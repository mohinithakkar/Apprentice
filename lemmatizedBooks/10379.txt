produce by ted garvin and pg distribute proofreader at love 's cost by charle garvice at love 's cost chapter 1 until this moment i have never fully realize how great a ass a man can be when i think that this morning i scurry through what might have be a decent breakfast leave my comfortable digging and be coop up in a train for seven hour that i be now drive in a pelting rain through so far as i can see for the mist what appear to be a howling wilderness i ask myself if i be still in possession of my sens i ask myself why i should commit such lurid folly last night i be sit over the fire with a book -- for it be cold though not so cold as this the speaker shiver and drag the collar of he overcoat still higher -- at peace with all the world with omar purr placidly by my side and my soul wrap in that serenity which belong to a man who have long since rid himself of that inconvenient appendage -- a conscience and have hit upon the right brand of cigarette and now -- he pause to sigh to groan indeed and shift himself uneasily in the well-padded seat of the luxurious mail-phaeton when william bring I you note vilely write -- be you sober stafford -- blandly ask I to join you in this mad business i smile to myself as i pitch the note on the fire omar smile too the very cigarette smile i say to myself i would see you blow first that nothing would induce I to join you that i would read about the lake too much and too often to venture upon they in the early part of June in fact have no desire to see the lake at any time or under any condition i tell omar that i would see you in the lowest pit of tophet before i would go with you to -- whatever the name of this place be and yet here i be the speaker pause in he complaint to empty a pool water from he mackintosh and succeed -- in turn it over he own leg he groan again and continue and yet here i be my dear stafford i do not wish to upbraid you i be simply make to myself a confession of weakness which would be pitiable in a stray dog but which in a man of my year with my experience of the world and reputation for common sense be simply criminal i do not wish to reproach you i be quite aware that no reproach not even the spectacle of my present misery would touch you callous and permit I to frankly add you abominably selfish nature but i do want to ask quite calmly and without any display of temper : what the blaze you want to come this way round and why you want I with you the speaker a slightly build man just beyond the vague line of young glance up with he dark somewhat sombre and yet softly cynical eye at the face of he companion who be drive this companion be unmistakably young and there be not a trace of cynicism in he grey-blue eye which look out upon the rain and mist with pleasant cheerfulness he be neither particularly fair nor dark but there be a touch of brighter color than usual in he short crisp hair and no woman have yet find fault with the moustache or the lip beneath and yet though stafford orme 's face be rather too handsome than otherwise the sign of weakness which one see in so many good-looking face do not mar it indeed there be a hint of strength not to say sternness in the well-cut lip a glint of power and masterfulness in the gray eye and the brow above they which impress one at first sight though when one come to know he the impression be soon lose efface by the charm for which stafford be famous and which be perpetually recruit he army of friend no doubt it be easy to be charming when the god have make you good to look upon and have fill you pocket with gold into the bargain life be a pageant of pleasure to stafford orme : no wonder he sing and smile upon the way and have no lack of companion even this man beside he edmund howard whose name be a by-word for cynicism who have never until he have meet stafford orme go a inch out of he self-contained way to please or benefit a fellow-man be the slave of the young fellow 's imperious will and though he make burlesque complaint of he bondage do not in he heart rebel against it stafford laugh shortly as he look at the rain-swept hill round which the two good horse be take the well-appointed phaeton oh i know you would come he say it be just this way you know the governor write and ask I to come down to this new place of he at bryndermere -- pardon I stafford you forget that i have be down south -- where i wish to heaven i have remain -- and that i only return yesterday afternoon and that i know nothing of these sudden alarum and excursion of you esteemed parent ah no so you do not assent stafford think i would tell you : shall have to tell you now i 'll cut it as short as possible he pause for a moment and gently draw the lash of the whip over the wet back of the two horse who be listen intently to the voice of they beloved master well three day ago i get a letter from my father it be a long one i think it be the first long letter i ever receive from he he inform I that for some time past he have be build a little place on the east side of bryndermere lake that he think it would be ready by the ninth of this month and would i go down -- or be it up -- there and meet he as he be come to england and would go straight there from liverpool of course there be not time for I to reply and equally of course i prepare to obey i mean go straight down to bryndermere and i should have do so but two day ago i receive a telegram tell I that the place would not be ready and that he would not be there until the eleventh and ask I to fill up the interval by send down some horse and carriage it occur to I with one of those brilliant flash of genius which you have so often remark in I my dear howard that i would drive down at any rate part of the way so i send some of the trap direct and get this turn-out as far as preston with I with another of those remarkable flash of genius it also occur to I that i should be devilish lonely with only pottinger here he jerk he head towards the groom who sit in damp and stolid silence behind and so i write and ask you to come kind of I be not it most infernally kind say howard with a sigh of a ton weight have you any idea that you father be build this little place by the way i can not imagine sir stephen building anything that could be describe as ` little ' you be right assent stafford with a nod i hear come down that it be a perfect palace of a place a kind of palace of art and -- and that sort of thing you know the governor 's style he brow be slightly knit for just a second then he throw as it be the frown off with a smile no i know nothing about it i know as little about it as i do of the governor himself and he affair howard nod when you come to think of it howard be not it strange that father and son should know so little of each other i have not see the governor for i forget how many year he have be out of england for the last fourteen or fifteen with the exception of a few fly visit and on the occasion of those visit i be either at school on the continent or tramp about with a gun or a rod and so we never meet i have a kind of uneasy suspicion that my revered parent have no particular desire to renew he acquaintance with he dutiful offspring anyway if he have he would have arrange a meeting seem rather peculiar for in every other respect he conduct as a parent have be above reproach those be scarcely the term by which i should designate a liberality which can only be describe as criminally lavish and a indifference to you moral progress which might more properly belong to a unregenerate turk than to a english baronet consider the opportunity of evil afford you by the possession of a practically unlimited allowance and a brazen cheek which can only be describe as colossal the fact that you have not long since go headlong to the devil fill I with perpetual and ever-freshening wonder stafford yawn and shrug he shoulder with cheerful acquiescence should have go a mucker ever so many time old man if it have not be for you he say but you have always be at hand just at the critical moment to point out to I that i be play the giddy goat and go to smash that be why i like to have you with I as a kind of guide monitor and friend you know howard groan and attempt to get rid of another miniature pool of water and succeed -- as before i know he assent my virtue have be its own reward -- and punishment if i have allow you to go you way to the proverbial dog after whose society gilded youth like yourself appear to be always hanker i should not be sit here with cold water run down my back and surround by nature in she gloomiest and dampest aspect only once have i deviate from the life of consistent selfishness at which every sensible man should aim and see how i be punish i do not wish to be unduly inquisitive but i should like to know where the blaze we be go and why we do not make for a decent hotel -- if there be such a thing in these desolate wild stafford hand he the rein so that he himself might get out he cigar-case and with some little difficulty and assist by pottinger 's soaked hat the two gentleman get they cigar alight there be not a decent hotel for mile explain stafford there be only a small inn at a little place call carysford i look it out on the map i think we would drive there today put up for the night to give the horse a rest and go on to this place of my governor 's the next day it be on the opposite side of the lake he jerk he whip to the right which side what lake ask howard hopelessly i see nothing of the lake nothing but mist and sodden hill no wonder the word ` poet ' instinctively arouse one 's animosity when i think of the number of well-meaning and inspired idiot who have write ream of poetry about this place i feel at this present moment as if i could cheerfully rend even a wordsworth a southey or a coleridge and i look back with remorse upon the hour the throb of admiration i have expend upon what i once deem they inspired page if i remember rightly most of the lake poet go off they head when i gaze around I i must admit that i be not surprised stafford laugh absently he be quite accustomed to howard 's cynical vein they be all right enough he say that be i suppose they be for i never read any of 'em since i leave school oh yes they be right enough about the beauty of the place you should see it on a fine day have anyone see it on a fine day inquire howard with the innocent air of one simply seek information i ask a countryman in the train if it always rain here and he reply ` no it sometimes snow ' that be a chestnut remark stafford with a laugh but it be all nonsense about its always be wet here they tell I it be fine for week together that you can never tell any instant whether it be go to clear up or not that the weather will change like a woman -- good heaven look at that he nod to the east as he speak unnoticed by they the sky have be clear gradually the mist sweeping dissolve away a breath of wind now waft they like a veil throw aside from hill and valley and lake and a scene of unparalleled beauty lay reveal beneath they the great lake shone like a sapphire meadow of emerald wood of darker green hill of purple and gray silver and gold rise from the bosom and the edge of the great liquid jewel the hill tower tier on tier into the heaven of azure blue sweep by cloud like drift snow the two man gaze in silence even pottinger to whom he ` oss generally represent all that be beautiful in nature gape with wide-open mouth how 's that for lofty you unbeliever demand stafford ever see anything like that before howard have be considerably startle but of course he conceal he amaze admiration behind a mask of cynicism rather a crib from val prinsep be not it with a suggestion of a drury lane pantomime about it good heaven and there be the fairy palace all complete he add as the mist still rise be discover on the slope of the other side a long and extremely ornate build the pure whiteness of which be reflect in the marvellous blue and opal of the lake can that be sir stephen 's ` little place ' i be afraid it be say stafford it look like the governor he add with a touch of gravity well it be very big or rather long and it be very white but one 's bind to admit that it do not spoil the landscape say howard in fact standing there amidst the dark-green tree with its pinnacle and terrace it be rather a ornament than otherwise i suppose there be flower on those velvety lawn and the interior i 'll wager my life match the exterior fortunate youth to possess a croesus for a father : yes i suppose the governor must be tremendously oafish say stafford the man who can build such a palace as that and have the cool cheek to call it ' a little place ' must in common decency be a multi-millionaire stafford nod and smoke thoughtfully for a minute as pottinger leave the horse ' head and climb into he seat behind and the mail-phaeton move along the road which begin to dip down at this point i know so little about my father he say again and yet the world know so much remark howard throw open he waterproof and bask in the sun which shine as warmly and unreservedly as if it have never hear of such a thing as rain one can not take up the paper without see some mention of sir stephen orme 's great name one day he be in pari negotiate a state loan another you read he be annex appropriate or whatever you call it a vast tract in africa or asia on the third you be inform with all solemnity that he have become director of a new bank insurance company or one of those vast concern in which only rothschild and baring can disport themselves now and again you be inform that sir stephen orme have be request to stand for a important constituency but that he be compel to decline because of the pressure of he numerous affair there may be a more famous and important individual in the world than you father my dear stafford but i can not call he to mind at this moment chaff away say stafford good-humouredly at any rate he have be a jolly liberal father to I do i tell you that just before he come home be place a largish sum at he bank for I i mean over and above my allowance you do not tell I but i be not at all surprised respond howard a truly wonderful father and a model to all other parent would that i possess such a one you do not remember you mother stafford the young fellow 's handsome face soften for a instant and he voice be low and grave as he reply : no -- and yet sometimes i fancy that i do though see that she die when i be quite a kid it must be only fancy i wish she have live he voice become still lower i wish i have a brother or a sister especially a sister -- by george that be a fine stream do you see that fish jump howard no i be too much occupy in jump myself i think by you exclamation that something have happen to the carriage or the horse and that we be on the verge of a smash-up let it jump if it amuse it so it may -- if i do not catch it say stafford pull up the horse near the bank of the stream do you mean to tell I that you be go to fish demand howard with a groan my dear stafford i know that be that abominable thing -- a sportsman -- you be consequently mad but you might have the decency to curb you insanity out of consideration for the wretched man who have the misfortune to be you companion and who plainly see that this period of sunshine be a gilded fraud and that presently it will rain again like cat and dog stafford laugh he have get down and drag out a rod and a fishing-basket sorry old chap he say but no fisherman could lose such a chance as this even to save he best friend from rheumatic fever i think we should come across a stream or two and i put on these tog accordingly he wear a norfolk suit of that wonderful harri tweed which strange to say keep out the rain the heat and the cold and fly be stick in he cap of the same material but look here there be no need for I to keep you pottinger will drive you to this place carysford where we stay the night -- i have engage room -- and you can have a warm bath and get into the dress-clothes after which you be hanker when i have catch a fish or two i 'll come on after you do not argue now my dear stafford i have not the least intention of do so i be simply die for a bath a change and a huge fire and when you arrive you 'll find I sit over the latter humbly thank god that i be not a sportsman stafford nod with he eye on the stream i should give the nag some gruel pottinger and put a extra coat on they : it 'll be cold to-night ta ta howard tell 'em to get a nice dinner i 'll be there in time for 'em to cook the fish but do not wait if i should be late -- say half past seven i promise you i will not retort howard fervently and i be one of those man who never break a promise -- unless it be inconvenient the phaeton drive on stafford go down to the stream put up he rod choose a fly as carefully as if the fate of a kingdom depend on it and begin to fish there be this great advantage in the art of fly-fishing : that while you be engage in it you can think of nothing else : it be as absorb as love or scarlet fever stafford work he fly steadily and systematically with a light and long cast which have make he famous with the brethren of the craft and presently he land a glittering trout which though only a pound in weight be value by stafford at many a pound in gold the fish begin to rise freely and he be so engross in the sport that he do not notice that howard 's prophecy have come true that the mist have sweep over the landscape again and that it be rain if not exactly cat and dog yet hard enough to make even the opposite bank a blur in he vision but stafford be utterly indifferent to rain and mist while the trout be rise and he basket be half full before he look around he it be wonderful when you be fish how great a distance you can walk without notice it he have follow the wind course of the stream until it have leave the road far behind and strike into a valley the wildness the remoteness of which be almost awe-inspiring and he stand still for a moment and look up at the sky into which the tall sharp peak of the hill lose themselves the stream break by huge boulder rumble with a soft roar which be the only sound that break the stillness it be the silence a profound stillness which make one feel as if one have wander into a unknown world newly make and as yet untouched by the foot of man unsullied by he presence stafford could not have quote a verse of poetry to save he life it be not in he line he could ride straight be a first-rate shot waltz like a angel and so far he dictionary do not contain the word fear but he know nothing of poetry or art and only like some kind of music amongst which it be to be fear soldier of the queen and the now much-abused chorus from faust rank high in he estimation he be just simply a healthy young englishman clean-limbed and clean-minded with a tremendous appetite for pleasure a magnificent frame and a heart as light and buoyant as a cork therefore though a artist or a poet would have be thrill to the marrow by the wild grandeur of the secluded valley and the grimly towering hill and would have long to put they on canvas or into verse stafford only feel suddenly grave and as if it be play it low down to throw a artificial fly even of the best make in such a spot but in a moment or two the sportsman 's instinct wake in he a fish stir in a pool under a boulder and pull himself together he throw a fly over the rise as he do so the brooding silence be break by the deep musical bark of a collie follow by the sharp yap yap of a fox-terrier the sudden sound almost startle stafford at any rate cause he to miss he fish he look up with a little frown of annoyance and see on the break of the opposite hill some of the mountain sheep which have stare at he with haughty curiosity run down towards the green bottom of the valley follow by the two dog a moment afterwards a horse and rider be silhouette on the extreme top of the high hill the horse be large whereby the rider look small and for a moment the pair be motionless remind stafford of a bronze statue the hill be fearfully steep even the dog run with a certain amount of caution and stafford wonder whether the rider -- he could not see if it be man or boy -- would venture down the almost precipitous slope while he be wonder the small figure on the horse send up a cry that ring like the note of a bell and echo in sweet shrillness down the hill and along the valley the collie stop as if shot and the fox-terrier look round prepare to go back to the rider it look for a moment as if the rider be go down the other side of the hill again then suddenly as if he detect something wrong in the valley below he turn the horse and come down the hill-side at a pace which make stafford hard and fearless rider as he be open he eye it seem to he impossible that the horse could avoid a false step or a slip and such a false step he know would send steed and rider hurtle down to something that could be very little short of instant death he forget all about the big trout in the pool and stand with he fly drift aimlessly in the water watch with something like breathless interest this the most daring piece of horsemanship he have ever witness and he have ridden side by side with the best steeplechaser of the day and have watch a crack hungarian cavalry corps at its maneuver which last be about the top notch of the horse-riding business but the big horse do not falter for a moment down it come at a hard gallop and stafford 's admiration be swallow up in amazement when he see that the rider be a young girl that she be ride with about half a ounce on the rein and that apparently she be as much at ease and unconscious of danger as if she be trot on a tame hack in rotten row as she come nearer admiration romp in ahead of amazement for the girl be a young one -- she look like the average school-girl -- and have one of the most beautiful face stafford have ever see she be dark but the cheek that be sweep by the long lash be colourless with that exquisite and healthy pallor which one see in the woman of northern spain she hair be black but soft and silky and the wind blow it in soft tendril now across she brow and now in dazzling strand about the soft feel hat which sit in graceful negligence upon the small and stately head she wear a habit stain by use and weather and so short that it be little better than a skirt and leave she almost as absolute a freedom as that enjoy by the opposite sex she hand be cover by well-worn gauntlet and she hold a stout and workman-like crop with a long huntsman 's thong a poet would instantly have think that it be a vision of the spirit of the mountain stafford only think it be the most lovely piece of girlhood he have ever look at she do not see he for a moment all she attention be engross by the sheep which be now wander up the valley then suddenly as if she feel he presence rather than see it she dark eye flash round upon he and she pull up the big horse on its haunch with a suddenness which ought to have send she from the saddle like a stone from a catapult but she sit back as firm as a rock and gaze at he steadily with a calmness which fascinate stafford and keep he stare back at she as if he be the veriest plough-boy and to put it frankly it be something like fascination she have come upon he so suddenly she feat of horsemanship have be so audacious she beauty be so marvellous that stafford perhaps for the first time in he life find himself unable to utter a word in the presence of one of the opposite sex it be only for a moment or two of course that he lose he presence of mind then he pull himself together and raise he cap she give he the very slightest of bow it be the faintest indication only of response to he salute she eye rest on he face with a strange ungirlish calm then wander to the last trout which lay on the bank stafford feel that something have to be say but for the life of he for the first time in he experience he could not hit upon the thing to say good-afternoon seem to he too banal commonplace and he could think of nothing else for a moment however it come at last will you be so good as to tell I if i be far from carysford he ask four mile and three-quarter by the road three mile over the hill she reply slowly as calmly as she have look at he and in a voice low and sweet and with a ring a tone in it which in some indefinable way harmonise with she appearance it be quite unlike the conventional girl 's voice there ring in it the freedom of the lonely valley the tower hill the freedom and unconventionality of the girl 's own figure and face and wind-tossed hair and in it be a note of dignity of independence and of a pride which be too proud for defiance in its way the voice be as remarkable as the beauty of the face the soft fire of the dark eye i have no idea it be so far say stafford i must have wander away from the place i start fishing on the road down below and have not notice the distance will you tell I the name of this place herondale she reply thank you say stafford it be a grand valley and a splendid stream she lean forward with she elbow on the saddle and she chin in the small gauntletted hand look up the valley absently and then back at he with a frank speculation in she eye which be too frank and calm to be flattering and be indeed somewhat embarrassing i suppose she take I for a tourist or a cheap tripper think stafford with a uncomfortable kind of amusement uncomfortable because he know that this girl who be act as shepherd in a old weather-stained habit and a battered hat be a lady she break the silence again have you catch many fish she ask up to now they have be separate by the stream stafford seize the opportunity wade across in a fairly shallow place and open the lid of he basket show she the contents yes you have do fairly well she say but the trout run larger higher up the valley by the way she brow come together slightly though the very faintest of smile for a instant curve the delicately cut lip do you know that you be poach this would have be a staggerer come from a mere keeper but from this exquisitely beautiful this calm statue of a girl it be simply devastate stafford stare at she do not this river belong to sir joseph avory he ask no she reply uncompromisingly sir joseph avory 's river be call the lesset water and run on the other side of that hill she raise she hunting-crop and pointed with a exquisite movement as graceful as that of a diana to the hill behind she i be very sorry say stafford i think this be he river i meet he in london and get permission from he do you know to whom this water belong to mr heron of herondale she reply i beg mr heron 's pardon say stafford of course i 'll put up my rod at once and i will take the first opportunity of apologise for my crime for poach be a crime be not it yes she assent laconically can you tell I where he live -- where he house be she raise she whip again and point to a opening on the left of the valley a opening line on either side by a wild growth of magnificent fir it be up there you can not see it from here she say as she speak she take she chin from she hand and sit upright gather up she rein and with another of the faint inclination of she head by way of adieu ride on up the valley stafford stand with he cap in he hand look after she for a moment in a brown study and still watch the back of the slight figure that sit the big horse with the grace of a indian maiden he begin to take down he rod and have pack it in he case and fasten he basket he follow she along the broken bank of the stream presently when she have go some little distance he hear the dog start bark again the crack of she whip ring like a pistol-shot and she bell-like voice echo amongst the hill join with the troubled baaing of the sheep stafford stop and watch she : there be evidently something wrong for the dog have become excite the sheep be run wildly but the girl 's exquisite voice be as clear and calm as ever and the big horse canter over the broken ground take a big boulder now and again with lilting jump as if he be go by he own volition and be well up in all the point of the game after a time the dog get the sheep into a heap and the young girl ride round they but something still seem to be wrong for she get down and leave the horse quite free make she way into the flock at that moment stafford see a sheep and a lamb break from the mob and make for the stream the sheep jump to a boulder with the agility of a goat the lamb attempt to follow but miss the boulder and fall into the stream the water be wild here and the pool deep and as the lamb be sweep down toward stafford he see that it be struggle in a ineffectual way and that it look like a case of drowning of course he go for it at once and wade in make a grab at it he get hold of it easily enough but the lamb -- a good size one -- struggle and in the effort to retain he hold stafford 's foot slip and he go headfirst into a deep pool he be submerge for a second only and when he come up he have the satisfaction of feeling that he have still get the lamb and grip the struggle thing tightly in he arm he make for the opposite bank and look up see the girl standing wait for he she face alive alight dance with delight and amusement the laughter shone in she eye like dazzling sunlight and quiver on the firm but delicate lip but it be only for a moment before stafford have fully take it in and have respond to it with one of he own short laugh she face be grave and calm again thank you she say with a gravity match she face and very much as one be thank for pass the salt it would have drown if you have not be there it be lame and could not swim i see from the top of the hill that it be lame and i be afraid something would happen to it as she speak she take the lamb which be bleat like mad lay it on the ground and hold it still firmly but gently with she knee examine it with all the confidence and coolness of a vet you 'll make yourself most frightfully wet say stafford she glance up at he with only faint surprise you be a londoner she say or you would know that here in these part we be so often more wet than dry that it make no matter yes i think so there be a thorn in its foot may i trouble you to hold he a minute stafford hold the lamb which be tolerably quiet now and she slowly take off she gauntlet produce a little leather wallet from the saddle -- the horse come at she call as if he be a dog -- take out a serviceable pair of tweezers and with professional neatness extract a extremely ugly thorn stafford stand and watch she the collie and the fox-terrier upright on they haunch watch she also the collie give a approve bark as with a pat she liberate the lamb which go bleat on its way to join its distract mother the fox-terrier leap round she with yap of excited admiration and there be admiration in stafford 's eye also the whole thing have be do with a calm almost savage grace and self-possession and she seem to be absolutely unconscious of he presence and only remember it when the lamb and its mother have join the flock thank you again she say it be very kind of you i be afraid you be wet as stafford have go completely under the water this be a fact he could not deny but he say with a laugh : though i be a londoner in a sense i do not mind a wetting -- in a good cause and i shall be dry or as good as dry before i get to the inn you must have eye like a hawk to have see from the top of the hill that that lamb be lame he add rather with the desire to keep she than to express he admiration for she sight i have good eye she say indifferently one have to have but i see that the lamb be lame from the way it keep beside its mother and the fuss she make over it : and i know too by donald 's bark that something be wrong i be sorry you be wet will you -- she glance towards the opening in the hill pause and for the first time seem slightly embarrassed stafford fancy that a faint touch of color come to the clear pallor of the lovely young face she do not finish the sentence but with another thank you and i should not have like to have lose the lamb go towards she horse stafford advance to put she in the saddle but with a little shake of the head and a do not trouble she spring into she place and ride off stafford look after she as he have do before then he say well i be d ----- d he feel for he pouch fill he pipe and light it and in do so he eye fall upon the little wallet from which she have take she tweezers he pick it up and quickly shout to she but the dog be bark with furious delight she be crack she whip and she have ride too far for she to hear he through the noise it would have be sheer folly to have run after she so with a shrug of he shoulder stafford put the little wallet in he pocket wade the stream and after a moment or two of consideration make for the inn by the nearest way to wit across the hill the girl ride along the strip of level moorland beside the river until she come to a narrow and not particularly well -- keep road which lead through the opening of the hill towards which she have motion she whip once or twice a smile cross she face and once she laugh as she think of the comical picture which the young man have make as he struggle to dry land with the wet lamb in he arm and the smile and she laugh make she face seem strangely girlish because it be usually so calm so gravely self-reliant some girl would have be quick to detect the romantic side of the incident and would have dwell with a certain sense of satisfaction upon the fact that the young man be tall and handsome and distinguished look but this girl have scarcely notice it at any rate it have not affect she in any way she have too much to do there be too much upon she well-formed and graceful shoulder to permit she to indulge in romance : diana herself be not more free from sentiment than this young girl who ride she horse just like a mexican who be vet enough to perform a surgical operation on a lamb and who know how many bushel of wheat should run to a acre and the best dress for permanent pasture it do occur to she that she might at any rate after he have rescue the lamb have give he permission to go on fishing but she be not very sorry for have fail to do so for after all he have be poach and as she have say poach be in she eye a crime she go down the road at a swift trot and presently it be block by a pair of wrought-iron gate so exquisite in they antique conscientiousness that many a mushroom peer would have give almost they weight in gold to place they at the beginning of he newly make park but no one come to open they they be close by a heavily padlocked chain and the lodge beside they be empty and dilapidated and the girl ride beside the lichen-covered wall in which they stand until she come to a opening lead to a old arch which face a broad and spacious court-yard as she ride beneath the arch a number of dog yelp a welcome from kennel or behind stable half-door and a bent old man dress like something between a stableman and a butler come forward touch he forehead to take she horse she slip from the saddle pat the horse and murmur a word or two of endearment but she bright eye flash round the court-yard with a glance of responsibility have you bring the colt in jason she ask jason touch he forehead again yes miss ida it take I three-quarter of a hour it will not come to I like it do to you it be in a loose stall saddle it to-morrow morning she say and i will come and try it the brindle cow have get into the corn and the fence want mend down by the pool you must get william to help you and do it at once he have take the steer to market i suppose i do not see they in the three acre oh and jason i find someone fishing in the dale you must get a notice board and put it up where the road run near the river the tourist ' time be come on and though they do not often come this side of the lake some of they may and we can not afford to have the river poached and jason look to ruppert 's off-hind shoe i think it be loose and -- she stop with a short laugh but that be enough for one time be not it oh jason if i be only a man how much better it would be yes miss assented jason simply with another touch of he forehead she sigh and laugh again and gather up she habit -- she have not to raise it much -- she go through a open door-way into a wild but pretty garden and so to the back of one of the most picturesque house in this land of the picturesque it be build of gray stone which age have color with a tender and a appreciative hand a rich growth of ivy and clemati clung lovingly over a greater portion of it so that the mullioned window be frame by the dark leaf and the purple flower the house be long and rambling and have once be flourish and important but it be now eloquent of decay and pathetic with the sign of better time that have vanish long ago a flight of worn step lead to a broad glass door and open the latter the girl pass under a curved wooden gallery into a broad hall it be dimly light by a oriel window of stain glass over which the ivy and clemati have be allow to fall there be that faint odour which emanate from old wood and leather and damask the furniture be antique and of the neutral tint which come from age the weapon and the ornament of brass the gilding of the great picture be all dim and lack-lustre for want of the cleaning and polishing which require many servant in the huge fire-place some big log be burn and donald and bess throw themselves down before it with a sigh of satisfaction the girl look round she just as she have look round the stable-yard then toss she soft hat and whip on the old oak table she go to one of the large heavy door and knock say in she clear voice : father be you there inside the room a old man sit at a table it be litter with book some of they open as if he have be consult they but before he lay a open deed and at he elbow be several other lie on a open deed-box he be thin and as faded-looking and as worn with age as the house and the room line with dusty volume and yellow surface-cracked map and picture he wear a long dressing-gown which be huddle round he as if he be cold though a fire of log almost as large as the one in the hall be burn in the open fire-place at the sound of the knock he raise he head a expression which be a mixture of fear and senile cunning come into he line and pallid face he dull eye peer from under they lid with a flash of sudden alertness and with one motion of he long hand he hurriedly fold the deed before he cram it with the other into the box lock it with a hurry and tremble hand and place it in a cupboard which he also lock then he draw one of the large book into the place be the deed have be and with a cautious glance round the room shuffle to the door and open it as the girl enter one would have notice the resemblance between she and the old man and have see that they be father and daughter for godfrey heron have be one of the handsomest man of he time and though she have get she dark eye and the firm delicate lip from she mother the clear oval of she face and its expression of aristocratic pride have come from the heron be you here still father she say it be nearly dinner-time and you be not dress you promise I that you would go out : how wicked of you not to have do so he shuffle back to the table and make a great business of close the book i have be busy -- reading ida he say i do not know it be so late you have be out i see i hope you have enjoy you ride have you meet anyone no she reply then she smile as she add : only a poacher the old man raise he head a faint flush come on he face and he eye flash with haughty resentment a poacher what be the keeper about ah i forget there be no keeper now any vagrant be free to trespass and poach on herondale i be sorry father she say lay she hand on he arm soothingly it be not a ordinary poacher only a gentleman who have mistake the heron water for the avory 's come now father you have barely time to dress yes yes i will come in a moment -- a moment he say but after she have leave the room he still linger and when at last he get to the door he close it and go back to the cupboard and try it to see if it be lock mutter suspiciously : do she hear I she might have hear the rustle of the parchment the turn of the lock sometimes i think she suspect -- but no no she be a child still and she would say something speak out no no it be all right yes yes i be come ida he say aloud as the girl call to he on she way up the stair chapter ii as stafford climb the hill steadily he wonder who the girl be it do not occur to he that she might be the daughter of the mr heron to whom the stream belong and from whose family name the whole dale have take its own for though she have look and speak like a lady the habit the gauntlet the soft feel hat be old and weather-stained : and she familiarity with the proper treatment of a sheep in difficulty indicate rather the farmer 's daughter than that of the squire she be not by any mean the first pretty girl stafford have see -- he have a very large acquaintance in london and one or two woman whose beauty have be blazon by the world be more than friendly with the popular stafford orme -- but he think as he go up the hill which seem to have no end that he have never see a more beautiful face than this girl 's certainly he have never see one which have impressed he more deeply perhaps it be the character of the loveliness which haunt he so persistently : it be so unlike the conventional drawing-room type with which he be so familiar as he think of she it seem to he that she be like a wild and graceful deer -- one of the deer which he have see come down to a mountain stream to drink on he father 's scotch moor hers be a wild almost savage loveliness -- and yet not savage for there have be the refinement the dignity of high race in the exquisite gray eye the curve of the finely cut lip she manner also prevent he from forget she he have never meet with anything like it she have be as calm and self-possessed as a woman of forty and yet she attitude as she lean forward in the saddle she directness of speech all she movement have the _ abandon _ of a unconscious child indeed the absence of self-consciousness she absolute freedom from anything like shyness combine with a dignity a touch of hauteur and pride strike he as extraordinary almost weird stafford be not one of you susceptible young man in fact there be a touch of coldness of indifference to the other sex which often trouble he women-friend and he be rather surprise at himself for the interest which the girl have arouse in he he wonder if he should meet she again and be conscious of a strong almost a very strong desire to do so which he admit to himself be strange : for he do not at that moment remember any girl whom at he first meeting with she he have hanker to see again he get to the top of the hill at last and begin to drop down there be nothing but a wander sheep-path here and there and the mountain be by no means as easy to descend as the classic avernus so that when he get to the bottom and come in sight of the little inn nestle in a crook of the valley he be both tire and hungry howard beautiful in evening-dress come saunter to the door with he long white hand in he pocket and a plaintive reproach on he vandyke face i be just about to send off the search party my dear stafford he say be it possible that you have just come down that hill good heaven what folly be commit in thy name o sport and of course there be no fish -- there never be the water be always too thin or too thick the sky too bright or too dull the wind too high or too low excuse be the badge of all the angling tribe stafford take he basket from he shoulder and make a pretence of sling it at howard 's head then toss it to the landlord who stand by smile obsequiously cook some of 'em as soon as you can he say then he follow the neat and also smile chamber-maid up to he room where for all he pretended indolence and cynicism howard have cause he friend 's thing to be lay out in readiness for he stafford dress slowly smoke a cigarette during the operation and still think of the strange farmer 's daughter and then he go down and join howard in the room he have order lake hotel may lack the splendor to which we be all grow accustomed and of which alas we be also grow rather wearied but they be most of they extremely comfortable and cosy and the woodman at carysford be no exception to the rule stafford look round the low-pitched room with its old-fashioned furniture its white dinner-cloth gleaming softly in the sunset and the fire-light and sigh with a nod of satisfaction this be something like eh old man he say and even howard deign to nod approvingly yes he say if anything could compensate one for the misery of travel especially that awful drive this should do so i confess i have look forward to a crowning discomfort in the shape of a cold and draughty and smelly room fry chop or a gory leg of mutton and a heel of the cheese make by noah in the ark i fancy that we be go to have a decent dinner and i trust i may not be disappoint for it be about the only thing that will save my life be you dry yet you look as if you have be walk through a river instead of beside it that be just what i have be do say stafford with a laugh i have have a adventure -- i know interrupted howard with a sigh you be go to tell I how you hook a trout six foot in length how it drag you a mile and a half up the river how you get it up to the bank and how just as you be land it it break away and be lose every man who have be fishing have that adventure stafford laugh with he usual appreciation of he friend 's amusing cynicism but he do not correct he for at that moment the neat maid-servant bring in the trout which prove to be pipe hot and of a golden-brown and the two man commence a dinner which as compare with the famous or infamous one of the london restaurant be olympian the landlord himself bring in a bottle of claret which actually be sound and another of port in a wicker cradle which even howard deign to approve of and the two man after they have linger over they dinner get into easy-chairs beside the fire and smoke they cigar with that sweet contentment which only tobacco can produce and only then when it follow a really good meal do you know how long you be go to stay in you father 's little place howard ask after a long and dreary silence stafford shrug he shoulder slightly ` pon my word i do not know he answer i be like the school-boy : ' i do not know nothink ' i suppose i shall stay as long as the governor do and come to that i suppose he do not know how long that will be i have get to regard he as a kind of stormy petrel here to-day and go to-morrow always on the wing and never rest anywhere for any time i be never surprise when i hear that though he last letter be date africa he have fly back to europe or have run over to australia y-e say howard musingly there be a atmosphere of mystery and romance about you esteemed parent sir stephen orme which smack of the arabian night my dear stafford man of the world as i be i must confess that i regard he with a kind of wonder awe and that i follow he erratic movement very much as one would follow the celestial progress of a particularly splendacious comet he never cease to be a object of wonderment to I and i love to read of he gigantic project he vast wealth he brilliant success and i tell you frankly that i be look forward to see he with a mixture of fear and curiosity do not be surprise if at my introduction i fall on my hand and knee in oriental abasement i have admire he so much and so long at a distance that he have assume in my eye a almost regal not to say imperial importance i hope you will like he say stafford with a touch of that simplicity which all he friend like if he resemble he son i be sure to do so say howard indeed in any case i be pretty sure to do so for how often have i read of he wonderful charm of manner he win smile and brilliant conversational power when do we get to this fairy palace i suppose if we get there before dinner it will be time enough reply stafford by the way i would better ask how far it be do not ring i want to go up for some more cigar he go up to he room and in get they from he bag see the little instrument case which he have throw into he bag when he be change back come the vision of the strange girl with the beautiful face he slip the wallet in he pocket and when he reach the hall he turn to the open door of the little room which serve as the landlord 's office or bar-room the landlord be enjoy a cigar and a glass of whiskey and water and he open the door still wider and give a respectful smile of welcome you have a very comfortable hotel here mr grove say stafford by way of open the conversation we have have a capital dinner and have enjoy it tremendously be that '72 port you give we yes sir reply mr grove much gratify for you go straight to a landlord 's heart when you guess a good vintage and appreciate it i be glad you like it sir there be more of it at you service will you take a seat sir and may i offer you a glass of whiskey it be as good as the port if i may say so stafford accept and present he cigar case he ask the distance to the new house on the other side of the lake and have be inform speak of the fishing you do very well to-day sir say mr grove you be fishing in the heron water i suppose this be what stafford want yes he say i be poach i mistook it for the lesset water i must go over and apologise to mr heron by the way i be tell i be poach by a young lady who ride down to the stream while i be fishing i have some little conversation with she but i do not learn she name she be a young lady with dark hair ride a big horse and have a couple of dog with she -- a collie and a fox-terrier the landlord have nod assentingly at each item of the description that must have be miss ida -- miss heron the squire 's daughter sir he say stafford 's brow go up no wonder she stare at I he say almost to himself but be you sure the young lady i saw be not dress well -- like a squire 's daughter and she be look after some sheep like -- like a farmer 's girl the landlord nod again that be miss ida right enough sir he say with a touch of respect and something like pride in he tone indeed it could not be anyone else no doubt miss ida have come down to look after the sheep in the valley and there be no farmer 's daughter in the vale that could do it better or half so well as she there be not a girl in the county or for that matter a man either who can ride like miss ida or know more about the point of a horse or a dog -- yes and you may say a cow -- than the squire 's daughter and as to she be poorly dress -- well there be a reason for that sir the family 's poor -- very poor yet the dale seem to be call after they stafford remark it be sir assent the landlord at one time they own more land than any other of the big family here mile and mile of it with some of the best farm but that be before my time though i have hear my father tell of it there be not very much left now beyond the dale and the home meadow he sigh as he speak and look sadly at the costly cigar which he be smoke the feudal spirit still exist in the heart of the man who be bear in these remote dale and tower hill and the landlord of the little inn be as proud of the antiquity of the heron family and as sorry for its broken fortune as any _ villein _ of the middle age could have be for the misfortune of he feudal baron heron hall use to be a fine place at one time sir i can remember my father describe what it be in he and he father 's day how there use to be score of servant and as many as fifty horse in the stable with the great place fill with guest summer and winter spring and autumn the squire heron of that time never ride behind less than four horse and once when he be high sheriff he ride to meet the judge with six it be open house to every poor man in the place and no wanderer be ever turn from the door the squire of my father 's time be the county member and the day he be elect there be two hogshead of port and two of brandy broach on the lawn in front of the terrace and for a week afterwards there be scarcely a sober man in the town for mile round he be master of the hound and the hunt breakfast and the hunt ball be more splendid than anything else of that kind in the kingdom in fact people use to come from all part of the kingdom to attend they yes the heron make herondale famous as you may say sir he pause and shake he head and stafford remain silent : he be too wise to break in upon the narrative the landlord sigh and look lovingly at he cigar then go on : they offer that squire -- miss ida 's grandfather -- a peerage the heron have often be offer a baronetcy but they would always refuse and the squire decline the peerage he say that no man could wish to be higher than heron of herondale that better man than he have be contented with it and he be quite satisfied with the rank which have satisfy he forefather when he die the follower at the funeral make a procession a mile and a quarter long how do the family lose its money drop its greatness stafford ask the landlord screw up he eye thoughtfully well it be hard to tell sir he reply of course there be always a tremendous drain go on for it be not only down here that the squire spend the money freely but it be just the same or worse when he be in london he have a big house there and entertain as splendidly perhaps more so than he do at the hall in those day too sir there be as much gaming and bet as there be now perhaps more -- though i be tell that great folk be more give nowadays to gamble on the stock exchange than at card or race-horse beg you pardon sir i be afraid you be right assent stafford with he short laugh i prefer the old way myself just so sir say the landlord with a approve nod well what with the money go here and there and everywhere they find when the present squire 's father die that there be very little left and worse than all that some of the land be sell and what remain be heavily mortgage it be what often happen to old family sir more 's the pity yes say stafford and be the present squire like he father no sir not a bit reply the landlord with a thoughtful and somewhat puzzle frown quite the reverse he father be free and easy with everybody and have a pleasant word and shake of the hand for everyone he meet but the present squire be always shy and quiet as a boy kind of reserved and stand-offish if you know what i mean sir when he come into the property he become more reserved than ever avoid all he father 's old friend and shut himself up at the hall and keep himself to himself he be a college gentleman and fond of book and he spend all he time alone in he library like a -- a hermit he go abroad for a time to italy they think and he come back with a wife but she do not make thing more lively for she die soon after miss ida be bear miss ida be the only child she be send away for some time to be take care of by one of the relative and she be only be back for a couple of year poor girl say stafford involuntarily well yes you may say that sir say the landlord but doubtfully though it do not seem as if miss ida be in need of much pity she be so bright and -- and high-spirited as you may say though it be a wonder she can be so see the life she lead alone in that great place with she father who never go beyond the garden and who shut himself up with he book all day yes it be a wonder when you come to think of it that she can smile and laugh and be as cheerful as she be i often hear she singing when she be ride through the dale or along the road here miss ida 's wonderfully like by all the people sir in fact you might say that they worship she i can understand it say stafford almost to himself it must have be great change to she continue the landlord come down here from london to such a wild out-of-the-way place many young lady would have lose heart and pine and fret but she be a true heron be miss ida and she face the thing fairly and buckle to as you may say she take the whole thing on she shoulder and though she could not coax the squire out of he shell she take care of he and run the whole place as if she be a man yes sir though she be only a girl as you see yourself she manage the house and the farm as if she be a woman of forty it be wonderful how she be pick it up i honestly believe there be not a man in the place as know more about horse as i say than she do but that be in the blood sir and she can ride -- well you see for yourself and have she no society no amusement do not she go out have friend i mean the landlord shake he head no sir she just live there with the squire and they see no one receive no visit and pay none you see sir the heron be proud they be get cause to be and i have hear it tell that the squire be too proud to let the old family friend see the poverty of the house and that he hate the new people who buy land and build house in the place -- i be sure i beg you pardon sir -- i be forget for the moment that you father sir stephen have just build that beautiful place the other side of the lake stafford smile that be all right mr grove he say i can quite understand mr heron think it confound cheek of a stranger to come here and stick up a great white place which no one can fail to see five mile off i suppose you think if i be to present myself at the hall i should get a very cold reception eh i be afraid you would not get any reception at all sir reply grove with respectful candor i be afraid neither mr heron nor miss ida would see you the old butler would just say : ` not at home ' as he say to the county people when they try and call there especially if they know who you be sir if i remember rightly the part of the land sir stephen buy belong to the heron i see say stafford it strike I it be rather a sad story mr grove it be a case of the child pay for the sin of they father that be it sir assent the landlord it take age to build up a house and a family like the heron but one man can knock it down so to speak it be hard line for miss ida who be as well-born as any of the title people in the county and far better than most they say that she be be wonderful well educate too though of course she have not see anything of the world have come straight from some small place in foreign part to be shut up in the dale and it be quite out of the world here sir especially in the winter when the snow lie so thick that we be almost imprison but wet or fine hot or cold miss ida can always be see ride or drive or walk she be a regular westmoreland lass for that no weather fright she at this juncture howard saunter out of the sitting-room and he and stafford go to the open door and look out on the exquisite view which be now bath in the soft light of a newly rise moon it still have a smack of drury lane have not it say howard strange that whenever we see anything beautiful in the way of a landscape we at once compare it with a stage ` set ' the fact of it be my dear stafford we have become absolutely artificial we pretend to admire nature but we be think of a theater all the time we throw up we eye ecstatically when we hear a nightingale but we much prefer a comic singer at the tivolus we talk sentiment at feast some of we but we have cease to feel it we do not really know what it mean i believe some of the minor poet still write about what they call love but in my private opinion the thing itself have become instinct who know anything about it take yourself for instance you have never be in love you have everything that you can desire you be clothe in purple and fine linen you fare sumptuously every day you flirt six day in the week and rest not on the seventh -- but love you do not know what it mean and if you do you be far too wise in you generation to go in for such a uncomfortable emotion stafford smile rather absently he be scarcely listen he be so accustomed to howard 's cynical diatribe that more often than not they make no more impression on he than water on a duck 's back besides he be think of ida heron the girl whose strange history he have just be listen to there be silence for a minute or two and while they stand lean against the door-way two man come out of another door in the inn and stand talk they be commercial traveller and they be enjoy they pipe -- of extremely strong tobacco -- after a hard day 's work presently one of they say : see that place of sir stephen orme 's on the hill splendacious be not it must have cost a small fortune i wonder what the old man 's game be the other man shake he head and laugh of course he be up to some game he would not lay out all that money for nothing millionaire as he be he be always get something up he sleeve perhaps he be go to entertain some big swell he want to get into he net or some of the foreign prince he be hand-in-glove with you never know what sir stephen orme 's up to perhaps he be go to stand for the county if so he be bind to get in he always succeed or if he do not you do not hear of he failure he be the sort of man disraelus use to write about in he novel one of the chap who have go through fire and water to get they end yes and blood too if it be necessary there be be some queer story tell about he they say he stick at nothing look at that last turkish concession the speaker and he companion saunter down the road stafford and howard have hear every word but stafford look straight before he and make no sign and howard yawn as if he have not hear a syllable do you raise any objection to my go to my little bed stafford he ask i suppose have do nothing more than clamber about a river get wet through and tramp a dozen mile over hill you do not feel tired no say stafford i do not feel like turn in just yet good-night old man when howard have go stafford exchange he dress-coat for a shooting-jacket and with the little wallet in he pocket and he pipe in he mouth he stride up the road as he say he do not feel tired -- it be difficult for stafford with he athletic frame and perfect muscular system to get tire under any circumstance -- the night be one of the loveliest he have ever see and it seem wicked to waste it by go to bed so he walk on all unconsciously go in the direction of heron hall the remark about he father which have fall from the bagman stick to he for a time like a burr : it be not pleasant to hear you father describe as a kind of charlatan and trickster and stafford would have like to have collar the man and knock a apology out of he but there be certain disadvantage attach to the position of gentleman and one of they be that you have to pretend to be deaf to speech that be not intend for you ear so stafford could not bash the bagman for have speak disrespectfully of the great sir stephen orme but presently almost suddenly stafford come in sight of the magnificent iron gate and he forget he father and the talkative commercial traveller and he interest in the girl of the dale flash back upon he with full force he see that the gate be chained and lock and with a natural curiosity he follow the road beside the wall it stop almost abruptly and give place to a low railing which divide the lawn in front of the house from the park beyond and the long irregular facade of the old building be suddenly reveal chapter iii stafford look at it with admiration mingle with pity in the light of the story the landlord have tell he he realize the full pathos of its antique grandeur it be not a ruin by any means : but it be grim with the air of neglect of desolation of solitude in two only of the many window be there any light there be no sound of life about the vast place and the moonlight show up with cruel distinctness the ravages make in stone-work and wood-work by the clawlike hand of time a capital of one of the pillar of the still handsome portico have crumble several of the pillar be break and askew the great door be blister and crack by the sun evidently no paint have touch the place for year the stone balustrade of the broad terrace have several gap in it and the coping and the pillar be lie where they have fall the step of the terrace have grass grow in the interstice of the stone one of the lion which have flank the step have disappear and the remain one be short of a front leg the grass on the lawn be long and unkempt the flower bed weedy and straggly and the flower themselves grow wild and untrained but for the smoke which ascend from two or three of the many chimney the place might well have seem desert and uninhabited and stafford with this feeling upon he stand and gaze at the place unrestrainedly it be difficult for he to realize that only a few hour ago he have leave london that only last night he have dine at he club and go to the big merrivale dance it be as if he be stand in some scene of the middle age he would not have be greatly surprise if the grass-grown terrace have suddenly become crowd by old-world form in patch and powder hoop and ruffle good lord what would some of the people i know give to belong to -- to own this place he say to himself to think of that girl living alone here with she father he be turn away when he hear a slight sound the great door open slowly and that girl come out on to the terrace she stand for a moment on the great marble door sill then she cross the terrace and lean on the balustrade look dreamily at the moonlit view which lay before she she could not see stafford 's tall figure which be conceal by the shadow of one of the tree and she think herself alone as usual she solitude do not sadden she she be accustom to it and presently as if move by the exquisite beauty of the night she lip part and she half sing half hum the jewel song from faust she have look beautiful enough in she old riding-habit and hat but she seem a vision of loveliness as she stand in the moonlight with the old house for a background there be something bewitchingly virginal in the rapt and dreamy face with its dark eye and long lash in the soft delicately cut lip the pure ivory pallor at the same time something equally bewitching in the modernness of she dress which be of soft cream cashmere make rather long and in accord with the present fashion she have place a rose in the bosom of she dress and it stand out redly richly from the soft cream she hair be no longer rough and touzle by the wind but brush in ripple smoothness and coil in dainty neatness in the nape of she graceful neck no wonder stafford catch he breath hold it as it be as he gaze at the exquisite picture which form so striking a contrast to she surroundings she lean she chin on she hand and look before she as she sing softly and at that moment she thought stray from the question of what she should do to keep the cow from the lawn to the young man who have rescue she lamb for she she do not think of he with anything like interest or curiosity but she be recall the ludicrous picture he make as he struggle to the bank with the lamb in he arm and a faint smile cross she face at this moment donald and bess stroll out to join she they would much have prefer to have remain roast themselves in front of the hall fire but ridiculous as it be for they mistress to leave the warm house for the comparatively cold terrace they feel themselves in duty bind to join she perhaps they might catch sight of a rabbit to repay they for they exertion donald walk with stately step toward he mistress and bess be follow with a shiver of reluctance and a backward glance towards the fire-light which shine through the open door when suddenly she sniff the presence of a stranger and with a sharp yap hurl herself down the broad step and towards the spot where stafford still stand donald with a loud bay follow with he long stride and ida startle from she reverie follow as far as the top of the step and wait i might have expect the faithful watch-dog say stafford to himself now what on earth be i to do i suppose they 'll spring on I -- the collie at any rate it be no use run i have get to stop and face it what a confound nuisance nuisance but it serve I right i have no business to be loaf about the place as the dog come up he put on that air of conciliation which we all know and murmur good dog all right old chap try to pacify donald and bess but they be not accustom to intruder especially at that time of night and they be legitimately furious dancing round he and display dazzling tooth threateningly they draw nearer and nearer and they would certainly have spring upon he but the girl come not run but quickly down the step and straight across the dewy grass towards they call to the dog as she come in she clear low voice which have not a trace of fear in it they loud bark change to sullen growl as she approach and motion they to be still she stop and gaze at stafford who step out into the moonlight she say not a word but as she recognize he a faint color come into the ivory pallor of she cheek and a expression of surprise in the dark fearless eye stafford raise he cap i be very sorry he say i be afraid you must think I a great nuisance this be the second time i have be guilty of trespass she be silent for a moment not with shyness but as if she be notice the change in he dress and wonder how he come to be in evening-clothes and where he have come from the expression be one of simple girlish curiosity which soften in a delicious way the general pride and hauteur of she face you be not trespassing she say and the voice sound very sweet and musical after the din of the dog there be public right of way along this road i be immensely relieve say stafford it look so unfrequented that i be afraid it be private and that i have make another blunder all the same i be very sorry that i should have disturb you and make the dog kick up such a row i would have go on or go back if i have know you be come out but the place look so quiet -- it do not matter she say they bark at the slightest noise and we be use to it the place be so quiet because only my father and i live here and there be only a few servant and the place be so big all this be say not repiningly but softly and a little dreamily by this time donald and bess have recover they temper and after a close inspection of the intruder have come to the conclusion that he be of the right sort and donald be sit close on he launch beside stafford and thrust he nose against stafford 's hand invitingly the girl 's beauty seem to stafford almost bewildering and yet softly and sweetly a part of the beauty of the night he be conscious of a fear that be actually a dread that she would bow call the dog and leave he so before she could do so he make haste to say : now i be here will you allow I to apologise for my trespass of this afternoon she incline she head slightly it do not matter she say you be very kind in help I with the lamb and i ought to have tell you that my father would be very glad if you would fish in the heron you will find some better trout higher up the valley thank you very much say stafford call the dog she turn away then fortunately stafford remember the case of instrument oh i beg you pardon he say i forget this wallet i find it by the stream after you have go oh my wallet she cry i be so glad you have find it i do not know what i should have do if you have not i should have have to send to preston or to london and besides it be a present from the old veterinary surgeon he leave it to I there be some beautiful instrument in it still smile she open it as if to show he stafford draw near so near as to become conscious of the perfume of the rose in she bosom of the still fainter but more exquisite perfume of she hair he bent over the case in silence and while they be look a cloud sail across the moon the sudden disappearance of the light rouse she as it be to a sense of he presence thank you for bring it to I she say it be very good of you oh i have not to bring it far say stafford i be stay at the woodman inn at carysford oh she say you be a tourist -- you be fish stafford could not bring himself to say that he be the son of the man who have build the great white house which no

be useless to deny the fact it be very old and i ma very fond -- she stop suddenly she lip apart she eye fix on the farther end of the terrace for while she have be speak a figure only just perceptible in the semi-darkness have move slowly across the end of the terrace pause for a moment at the head of the flight of step and then slowly descend stafford also see it and glance at she he see that she be startle if not frightened she scarcely seem to breathe and she turn she large dark eye upon he questioningly somewhat appealingly what be that she say in a whisper more to herself than to he someone -- a man have go down the step from the house he say do not you know who it be no she reply in as low a voice it be not jason -- there be no one else -- who can it be i will go and see

of the house near which the figure have disappear it strike stafford as strange that the dog do not bark in profound silence they go in the direction the figure have take and stafford presently see a ruin building which have evidently be a chapel as they approach it the figure come out of it and towards they as it pass they so close that they instinctively draw back stafford saw that it be a old man in a dressing-gown he head be bare he hair touch the collar of the gown he eye be wide open and gaze straight in front of he stafford be about to step forward and arrest he progress when suddenly the girl 's hand seize he and grip it hush she whisper with subdue terror it be my father he -- yes he be asleep oh see he be asleep he will fall -- hurt himself -- she in she turn be about to spring forward but stafford catch she arm no no you must not he say in a hurry whisper i think it would be dangerous i think he be all right if you let he alone he be walk in he sleep do not speak -- do not cry out no no she breathe but it be dreadful instinctively unconsciously she draw closer to stafford almost cling to he watch she father over she shoulder until the figure with its ghastly mechanical movement and vacant stare have pass into the house then with a long breath and with she hand clasp she throat as if she be stifle she break from stafford and spring quickly and noiselessly up the step and disappear also wonder whether he be awake or dream stafford wait for over a hour to see if she would appear again and he be turn away at last when she figure appear in the open door-way like that of a wraith she wave she hand to he then disappear and the door close still ask himself if he be not in a land of dream but tingle with the touch of she small hand with the haunting perfume of the soft black hair stafford gain the road and walk towards the inn chapter iv ida have follow she father across the terrace across the hall light weirdly by the glow of the sink fire and the pale moonlight up the broad stair along the corridor to the open door of he room he have walk slowly but steadily with he usual gait and he head bent slightly though he eye be wide open he seem to see nothing yet he do not stumble or even hesitate ida follow behind he with absolute noiselessness they be both ghostlike in they movement and the dog stand and watch they intently ear erect and with that gravity in they eye which dog wear when they be puzzle the old man close he door softly still without any hesitation and ida grasp the broad rail of the staircase wait breathlessly she hear he move about as leisurely and precisely as before then all be still she steal to the door and open it the light be streaming into the room and fall athwart the bed in which he be lie he eye close he face calm and peaceful she go on tiptoe to the bed and bent over he and find that he be in a deep profound sleep with a long breath of relief she leave he and sit on the stair and wait for it be just possible that he might rise again and resume the dreadful walk -- that motion of death in life she wait for a hour so absorb in she anxiety that she do not remember the man she have leave outside after another quarter of a hour she go to she father 's room and find that he be still sleep then she remember stafford remember he with a start of discomfort and embarrassment be he wait there still she go down-stair and from the open door-way she see dimly he figure under the tree there be something in the attitude of the erect figure that remind she of a soldier on guard a sentinel standing faithful at he post and when she have wave she hand in dismissal she do not quite close the door but watch he through the narrow opening as he pace slowly down the road look back at the house now and again as if to see if she want he then she close the door sign to the dog to be down before the fire and go up to she room after pause beside she father 's door and listen to he regular breathing she room be a large one -- nearly all the room in the place be large and as she undress herself slowly she look round it with a novel sense of loneliness the tall shadow of she graceful yet girlish figure be cast grotesquely on the wall by the candle beside she glass she have never feel lonely before though she life ever since she have arrive at the hall might be call one almost of solitude she have be so absorb in the duty which have so suddenly fall upon she young shoulder that there have be no time in which to feel the want of companionship there have always be something to think of something to do she father demand so much attention the house the land the farm -- she have to look after they all there have not be time to think even of herself and it have never occur to she that she be lead a life so different to that lead by most girl but to-night the silence of the great house large enough to hold fifty people but shelter only five person -- she father and herself and the three servant -- weigh upon she that sense of loneliness have come upon she suddenly as she have watch the young man 's retreat figure she could not help thinking of he even when she mind be oppress with anxiety on she father 's account in a vague way she remember how kind this stranger have be how quietly and with what a air of protection he have stand by she and restrain she from cry out and alarming she father as vaguely she remember that in the moment of she terror she have cling to he have forget under the great strain that he be a stranger -- and a man even now she do not know he name know nothing of he except that he be stay at the woodman inn kind and considerate as he have be she think of he with something like resentment it be as if he have step into she life have intrude upon its quiet uneventfulness he have no right to be there no right to have see she father in that terrible condition that death in life and she have behave like a frightened servant-maid have not only cling to he -- have she cling to he or be it only fancy -- but have leave he without a word of thanks have allow he to wait there and then have wave she hand to he just as she have see jessie the maid wave she hand to she young man after they have part and she be go into the house she bite she lip softly and a faint flush rise to the clear pallor of the lovely girlish face reflect in the glass yes she have behave just like a servant-maid she who in she heart of heart know that she pride herself upon she dignity and the good manners which should belong to a heron of herondale it be characteristic of she that while she think of he conduct and what she consider she bad behavior she give no thought to the fact that the stranger who have so intruded be singularly handsome and possess of that strange quality which at once impress woman most girl would have remember the fact but ida be different to the general run of she sex she have be bring up in a out-of-the-way place in which the modern novel the fashionable pastime of flirtation be not know and she secluded life in the lonely dale have deepen that sense of aloofness from the world that indifference to the sentiment which lurk in most girl ' bosom this tall handsome man who have step into she life and share the secret of she father 's strange affliction weakness be nothing more to she than one of the other tourist whom she sometimes chance to see on she lonely ride and walk when she have undress she go again to she father 's door and listen to he deep and regular breathing then at last she go to bed but the sense of loneliness be so intense that she lay awake for hour think of that bent figure walk in its sleep from the shadow of the ruin chapel for the future she would have to watch she father closely would perhaps have to lock the door of he room why have he go to the chapel so far as she know he be not in the habit of go there indeed she do not remember have see he go there in he wake moment she know nothing of somnambulism but she imagine that he have go in that direction by mere chance that if he have happen to find any impediment in he way he might as easily have go in another direction she fall asleep at last and sleep a hour beyond she usual time and so deeply that jessie have fill the cold bath without wake she beloved young mistress ida dress quickly all the incident of the precede night rush through she mind and hurry to she father 's room the door be open the room empty and with a sudden fear she run down the stair and find he in he usual seat in the library she draw a long breath and go and kiss he wish he good-morning as casually as she could you be up early this morning father she say try to keep she tone free from any anxiety he glance at the clock calmly no you be later he say he eye meet hers with they usual expression of absentminded serenity i -- i be a little tired and overslept myself she say be -- be you quite well this morning father yes quite well why not he reply with slight surprise she draw a breath of relief : it be quite evident that he know nothing of that weird walk and that it have not affect he injuriously nothing she say force a smile as she speak jason in he in-door livery which in some strange way look as if it have shrink with the figure which have worn it so long come to the door and in he husky voice say that breakfast be ready and ida take she father 's arm lead he into the dining-room in which all they meal be serve as she go to she place she glance through the window from which she could see the step at the corner of the terrace and a small part of the ruin chapel and she shudder when she have pour out she father 's coffee she take it round to he and let she hand rest on he shoulder lovingly but jason have bring in the post-bag and mr heron be unlock it and take out the few letter and papers and seem unconscious of the little anxious caress be there any for I father she ask linger beside he and she stretch out she hand to turn

letter bookseller ' catalogue sale catalogue -- nothing of importance she go back to she place and he wait until she have do so before he begin to open the letter he merely glance at some of they but presently he come to one which after a sharp quick look at she he read attentively then he return it to its envelope and with a secretive movement slip it into the pocket of he dressing-gown yes nothing but catalogue and bill you would better take they ida the bill at any rate and he throw they across to she when she have first come home to be mistress of the hall the bill have overwhelm she they have be so many and the money to meet they have be so inadequate but she have soon learn how to finance they and come to know which account must be pay at once and which might be allow to stand over she take they now and glance at they and the old man watch she covertly with a curious expression on he face i be sure i do not know how you will pay they he say as if she alone be responsible i can not pay all of they at once she reply cheerfully but i can some and the rest must wait i can send four -- perhaps five -- of the steer to the monthly market and then there be the sheep -- oh father i do not tell you about the gentleman i see fishing in the dale -- she stop for she see that he be not listen he have open a local paper and be read it intently and presently he look up with a eager flush on he face and a sudden lighten of the dull eye have you see this -- this house -- they call it a palace -- which that man have build on the lake side he ask he thin voice quaver with resentment do you mean the big white house by brae wood yes judge by the description of it here it must be a kind of gim-crack villa like those one see in italy build by man resemble this -- this _ parvenu _ it be a large place say ida but i do not think it be gim-crack father it look very solid though it be white and yes continental it be something between a tremendous villa and a palace why be you so angry i know you do not like to have new house build in bryndermere but this be some distance from we -- we can not see it from here or from any part of the grounds except the piece by the lake it be build on we land he say more quietly but with the flush still on he face the angry light in he eye it be buy by fraud obtain under false pretence i sell it to one of the farmer think he want it and would only use it for grazing i do not know until the deed be sign that he be only the jackal for this other man what other man father this stephen orme he be _ sir _ stephen orme now they knight he they knight every successful tradesman and schemer and this man be a prince of he tribe a low-born adventurer a _ parvenu _ of the worst type i think i have read something about he in the newspaper

receive yes and welcome by society society the word be a misnomer in my time a man of that class be keep at arm 's - length be relegate to he proper place -- the back hall but now -- he gaze angrily at the paper -- here be a whole column describe sir stephen orme 's new ` palatial villa ' and give a account of he achievement the success of he great undertaking and this man have choose to build he eyesore on heron land within sight of the house which -- which he would not have be permit to enter if i have know i would not have sell the land but you want the money father she say gently he look at she swiftly and a change come over he face a look of caution almost of cunning eh yes yes of course i want it but he know i should not have sell it for build on that be why he get bowden the farmer to buy it it be like he : only such a man can be capable of such a underhand act and now i suppose he will be welcome by he neighbor and the vayne and the bannerdale and make much of they 'll eat he dinner and they woman will go to he ball and concert -- they whose father would have refuse to sit at the same table with he but there be one house at which he will not be welcome one man who will not acknowledge he who will not cross the threshold of sir stephen orme 's brand-new palace or invite he to enter he own he shall not darken the door of heron hall he rise as he speak and leave the room with a quicker step than usual but half a hour later when ida go into the library she find he absorb in he book as usual and he only glance up at she with absent unseeing eye as she stand beside he put on she glove she habit skirt catch up under she elbow the old feel hat just a little askew on the soft silky hair do you want anything before i go out father she ask no no he reply abstractedly and bend over he book again as he answer ida cross the hall in the sunlight which light up she beauty and make it seem a more striking contrast than usual to the dull and grim surroundings of the dark oak the fade hanging and the lack-lustre armor and donald and bess bound bark before she down the terrace at which jason be hold thy big chestnut the horse prick up its ear and turn its head for she morning caress the touch of the small soft but firm hand which it have come to regard as its due and ida spring lightly from the last step into the saddle it be a informal way of mount which few girl could have accomplish gracefully but ida do it as naturally and as easily as a circus rider for the trick be a necessity to she who have so often to dismount and mount alone the lovely face be rather grave and thoughtful for some time after she have start for the remembrance of last night weigh upon she and she father 's unusual display of anger at breakfast trouble she vaguely but presently after she have clear a hedge and one of the broken rail she spirit rise : the sky be so blue the sun so bright it be hard to be depress on such a morning she ride to a distant part of the dale where in a rough meadow the steer be grazing she survey they critically choose those that should go to market then turn and leap a bank gain a ill-kept road a little farther on she come to a opening on the verge of the lake and she pull up arrest by the great white house on the other side which be literally glitter in the brilliant sunlight it certainly do not detract from the beauty of the view in fact it make the english lake look for the moment like a italian one she regard it thoughtfully for a moment then return to the road and as she do so she see a tall figure come towards she for a instant the color rise to she face but for a instant only and before stafford have reach she she be as pale as calm as usual she notice that he be dress in a serge suit notice vaguely how well it sit upon he that he gait have a peculiar ease and grace which the man of the dale lack that he handsome face flush lightly as he see she but she give no sign of these quick apprehension and sit cold and sphinx-like wait for he strafford 's heart leap at sight of she with a sudden pleasure which puzzle he for he would not have admit to himself that he have walk in this direction in the hope on the chance of meet she good-morning he say in he direct fashion raise he cap i be very fortunate to meet you i hope mr heron be no worse for -- be not ill no she say in she low clear voice my father be quite well he be just as he usually be this morning i be very glad say stafford he stand close beside the horse and look up at she and for the first time in he life he be try to keep the expression of admiration out of he eye the expression which he know most woman welcome but which somehow or other he feel this strange girl would resent i be afraid he would be upset i be afraid you be frighten last night -- it be enough to alarm to startle anyone what a splendid morning he go on quickly as if he do not want to remind she of the affair what a libel it be to say that it be always rain here i have never see so brilliant a sunshine or such color : do not wonder that the artist rave about the place and be never tire of painting it she wait until he have finish she eye downcast as if she know why he have turn from the subject then she raise they and look at he with she direct gaze i be glad i have meet you she say i want to thank you for you kindness last night -- oh but -- stafford try to break in but she go on slowly as if he have not speak -- i be -- frightened : it be sudden so unexpected my father have never do it before -- that i know of -- and he look -- she voice break for a moment -- so strange so ghost-like i think at first that it be the heron ghost which they say haunt the dale though i have never see it a faint smile curve she lip and shone in she eye and stafford be so fascinate by the sudden gleam of girlishness that he have to bend and pat bess who be plant dusty impression on he trousers in she frantic effort to gain he attention i do nothing in fact as i walk away i be fume because i could not help you -- could not do more you do help I she say gravely then she look across the lake to sir stephen 's little place i be admire that new house do not you think it be very beautiful rise so white and gracefully above the lake ye-e say stafford rather -- conspicuous though be not it she laugh suddenly and stafford ask with surprise : why do you laugh oh i be think of my father she say with a delicious frankness he be quite angry about it this morning it seem that it be build on we land -- or what be ours -- and he dislike the idea of anyone building at bryndermere so should i say stafford laconically and besides she go on she eye fix on the great white building so that she do not see he embarrassment my father do not like the man who build it he think that he get the land unfairly and he -- my father -- call he all sort of hard name stafford bit he lip and he face wear the expression which come into it when he be face a ugly jump he would have shirk this one if he could but it have to be face so he rush it i be sorry he say my father build it she do not start but she turn she head and look at he with a sudden coldness in the glorious eye you father -- sir stephen orme then you be -- i be he son yes my name be stafford orme she gather she rein up as if no comment no remark be necessary but stafford could not let she go could not part from she like that i be sorry to hear that mr heron have some cause of complaint some grievance against my father i can understand he not like the house to tell you the truth i do not care for it much myself yes i can understand mr heron 's annoyance i suppose he can see it from you house no she say simply this be the only part of we land from which it can be see and my father never come here : never leave the grounds the garden she pause a moment i do not know why you should mind -- except that i say that the land be get unfairly -- i wish i have not say that stafford color so do i he say but i hope it be not true there may be some mistake i do not know anything about my father 's affair -- i have not see he for year i be almost a stranger to he she listen with a grave face then she touch the big chestnut but stafford almost unconsciously lay he hand on the rein nearest he he mouth and chin express the determination which now and again surprise even he most intimate friend miss heron i be afraid -- he pause and she wait she eye downcast and fix on the horse 's ear i scarcely know how to put what i want to say he say i be rather bad at explain myself but i -- well i hope you will not feel angry with I because of the house because of anything that have pass between you father and mine -- of course i stand by he but -- well _ i _ do not build the confound place -- i beg you pardon but i think it be rather hard that you should cut I -- oh i can see by you face that you mean to do it -- that you should regard I as a kind of enemy because -- the usually fluent stafford stop helplessly as the beautiful eye turn slowly upon he with a slight look of wonder in they why should you mind she say with almost childish innocence you do not know I we only meet yesterday -- we be not friend -- oh i be not forget you kindness last night oh no -- but what can it matter to you in another woman stafford would have suspect the question of coquetry of a desire to fish for the inevitable response but look in those clear guileless eye he could not entertain any such suspicion i beg you pardon but it do matter very much he retort in the first place a man do not like be cut by a lady and in the next we shall be neighbor -- i be go to stay there -- he nod grimly at the beautiful little place neighbor she say half absently it be farther off than you think and besides we know no one we have no neighbor in that sense -- or friend my father do not like to see anyone we live quite alone -- so i have hear -- he stop and bite he lip but she do not seem to have notice he interruption -- so that even if my father do not object to the house or -- or -- my father say stafford with a smile a smile answer he candor it would be all the same and why should it matter to you you have a great many friend no doubt -- and we should not be likely to meet oh yes we should he say with the dogged kind of insistence which also sometimes surprise he friend i be go to avail myself of you permission and fish the stream -- but of course i can not do that now no -- i suppose not she assent but we should be sure to meet on the road -- i should be ride -- walk but not on this side often she argue a faint very faint color have steal into the clear pallor of she cheek she eye be downcast she be honestly surprised and yes a little pleased that he should protest against the close of they acquaintance pleased though why she could not have tell for it do not seem to matter oh yes i should he retort it be very pretty this side and -- see here miss heron he draw a little nearer and look up at she with something like a frown in he eagerness of course i shall speak to my father about -- well about the way the land be buy and i be hope i be sure that he will be able to explain it satisfactorily and i want to tell you that it be a mistake i do not know much of my father but i can not believe that he would do anything underhand he stop suddenly as the bagman 's remark flash across he memory if you father 's grievance against he be just why -- ah well you 'll have to cut I when we meet but i do not think it be and i do not think it would be fair to treat I as if _ i _ would do something wrong she brow come together and she look at he as if she be puzzle i do not know why it matter she say well i can not tell you he say helplessly i only know that i do not want to part from you this morning know that the next time we meet we should meet as stranger i want to come to the hall to enquire after mr heron she face flush do not she say in a low voice i will not of course he respond quickly it would only make matter worse you father would naturally dislike I refuse to see I but -- well it be very hard on I she look at he again gravely thoughtfully as if she be still puzzle by he persistence she eye wander to the dog bess be still stand up against he and donald have throw himself down beside he and be regard ida with a air that say quite plainly this new friend of yours be all right you have make friend with the dog she say with a slight smile stafford laugh oh yes there must be some good in dumb animal for most of 'em take to I at first sight she laugh at this not very brilliant display of wit i assure you they would not cut I next time we meet you can not be less charitable than the dog miss heron she give a slight shrug to she straight square shoulder the gesture seem charming to stafford in its girlish frenchiness ah well she say with a pretty air of resignation as if she be tire of argue stafford 's face light up and he laugh -- the laugh of the man who win but it die away rather suddenly as she say gravely : but i do not think we shall meet often i do not often go to the other side of the lake : very seldom indeed and you will not you say fish the heron so that -- oh there be the colt loose she break off how can it have get out i mean to ride it to-day and jason thinking i have change my mind must have turn it out the colt come waltz joyously along the road and catch sight of the chestnut whinny delightedly and the chestnut respond with one short whinny of reproof ida ride forward and head the colt and stafford quietly slide along by the hedge and get behind it take care say ida it be very strong what be you go to do stafford do not reply but steal up to the truant step by step cautiously and gradually approach near enough to lay he hand on its shoulder from its shoulder he work to its neck and wind he arm round it ida laugh oh you can not hold it she say as the colt plunge but stafford hang on tightly and yet so to speak gently soothing the animal with the horse language with which every man who love they be acquaint ida sit for a instant look round with a puzzle frown then she slip down take the bridle off the chestnut and slip it on the colt the chestnut who evidently understand the business stand stock still now i 'll hold it -- it will be quieter with I -- if you will please change the saddle unthinkingly stafford obey and get the saddle on the jigging and dancing youngster as unthinkingly he put ida up and it be not until the colt rise on its hind leg that he remember to ask she if the horse be break scarcely she say with a laugh but it will be all right good-morning -- and thank you and call to the chestnut she turn the colt and tear off the chestnut and the dog scamper after she stafford 's face grow hot for a moment with fear for she then it grow hotter with admiration as he watch she skimming across the moor in the direction of the hall once just before she vanish from he sight she turn and wave she hand to he as if to assure he that she be safe the gesture remind he of the white figure standing in the doorway last night and something stir in he heart and send a warm thrill through he in all he life he have never see anyone like she chapter v you look rather serious oh my prince say howard as some few hour later he leisurely climb into the phaeton beside stafford i have notice with inward satisfaction that as we approach the moment of meeting with you puissant parent the sultan a air of gravity and soberness have cloud that confoundedly careless devil-may-care countenance of yours i say with inward satisfaction because with my usual candor i do not mind admit that i be shiver in my shoe the shadow of the August presence be already fall on I and as the hour draw near i feel my littleness my utter insignificance with a acuteness which almost compel I to ask you to let I get down and make my way back to london as best i can do not be a ass retort stafford rather absently you ask a impossibility of I my dear fellow but i will try and conceal my asininity as best i can may i ask to change the subject where you be wander all the morning stafford color slightly and bestow minute attention to the off horse oh just prowl round he reply leisurely you tempt I to finish the quotation do you find anyone to devour apropo have he majesty the sultan ever mention matrimony to you staff stafford look round at he for a instant no he say curtly what the devil make you ask merely my incessant speculation as to you future my dear fellow reply howard blandly most father be ambitious for they son and i should imagine that sir stephen would be extremely so when a man be simply a plain ` mr ' he long for the ` sir ' when he get the ` sir ' he want the ` my lord ' for himself or for he son and heir that be the worst of ambition : you can not satisfy it i have no doubt in my mind that at this very moment sir stephen be make for a peerage for himself -- or you he can possibly gain he but you have no brain to speak of -- the fact that good-looking man be always deficient in that respect be a continual and bless consolation to we plain one staff -- will have to make what the world call a ` good marriage ' doubtless you father already have the future bride in he eye the daughter of a peer -- high in the government perhaps in the cabinet -- probably probably that be why he have ask you to meet he here i hope for you sake that she be good-looking i fancy -- musingly -- that you would be rather particular if rumor do you no injustice you always have be stafford laugh shortly i have never think about marry he say rather absently no one do my dear fellow it come like measles and other unpleasant thing without thought and when it come it be generally as unpleasant be not we go at a tremendous rate stafford do not think i be nervous i have ride beside you too often for that you destroy what nerve i possess long ago we be late and it be farther round than i think say stafford the horse be fresh i daresay very probably pottinger have give they a double feed he would naturally like they to dash up in fine style but if it be all the same to you -- as the horse break into a gallop -- i should prefer to arrive at you father 's ` little place ' in a more dignified fashion than on a stretcher stafford smile and check the high-spirited pair you talk of woman as if they be a -- a kind of plague you be never in love howard he ask never thank heaven respond howard devoutly when i think of it i acknowledge that i have much to be thankful for i be once : she be a girl with dark eye -- but i will spare you a minute description i meet she in a country rectory -- _ be _ that horse i think you call it the near one -- go to jump over the bank and one remarkably fine evening -- it be moonlight i remember -- i be on the point of declare my love and then the god save I the thought flash upon I that if she say ` yes ' i should have to sit opposite she at dinner for the rest of one of we life it save I i say that i think it be chilly and go in and up to bed grateful for my escape why do not you laugh stafford only smile in a perfunctory fashion he be think of the girl he have watch ride off on the unbroken colt of what it would seem like if she be seat opposite he with the candle-light fall on she soft white dress with diamond gleam in it diamond outshine by the splendor of those dark violet-grey eye of what it would seem like if he could rise from he seat and go to she and take she in he arm and look into those dark gray eye and say you be mine mine with no one to say he nay it be a lucky escape for she he say dreamily it be assented howard solemnly not one man in a thousand can love one woman all he life and i have the strongest conviction that i be not that one in less than six month i should have grow tired of she -- in less than a year i should have fly from the joy of matrimony -- or kill the partner of those joy have pottinger a wife and family my dear stafford if so be it wise to risk he life in this fashion i do not care for myself -- though still young i be not afraid to die and i would as soon meet it hurl from a phaeton as not -- but may i beg of you to think of pottinger stafford laugh the horse be all right he say they be only fresh and want to go he could not have drive slowly for he mind dwelling on the girl in the well-worn habit be electric i have spare you hitherto any laudation of the scenery my dear staff say howard pleasantly but permit I to remark that it really be very beautiful trust the great and powerful sir stephen to choose the best nature and art can produce what be this this prove to be a newly build lodge which appear on the left of the road stafford slow up and a lodgekeeper come and fling open the new and elaborately work iron gate this the way to -- to sir stephen 's house ask stafford the man touch he hat reverentially yes sir he reply sir stephen 's arrive come a hour ago stafford nod and drive on the road be certainly a new one but it be line with rhododendron and costly shrub and it wind and wind serpentine fashion through shrubbery and miniature plantation which indicate not only remarkably good taste but vast expenditure at interval the tree have be fell to permit a view of the lake lie below like a sapphire glowing in the sunlight presently they come in sight of the house it be larger than it have look in the distance a veritable palace a architect have receive _ carte-blanche _ and disport himself right royally

howard follow the butler between the two footman draw up beside the door and they enter the dining-room it be of choice american walnut and light by rose-shaded electric light in which the plate and the glass the flower and the napery glow softly : a ideal room which must have fill the famous decorator who have design it with just pride and elation the table have be reduce to a small oval and the servant proceed to serve a dinner which tell howard that sir stephen have become possess of a _ chef _ who be a _ cordon bleu _ the wine be as choice as the _ menu _ but sir stephen water he chateau claret and eat but little excuse himself in the middle of a sentence with : i be set you a bad example but there be always a skeleton at my feast -- a rather common one nowadays they call he gout and so you drive down that must have be pleasant it be a pretty country -- so i be tell i do not see much of it from the train but the lake -- ah well it be indescribable be not it after all one see one

anything please I but you -- ah well you two have the right to be particular and i 'll ask you to ask for just what you want -- and be sure you get it stafford glance round the room with its costly appointment and sir stephen catch the glance and smile you be think -- ah well no matter mr howard try those strawberry i do not think they be force they tell I that they get they on the slope even earlier than this this port -- now see how nice the people in these part be this port come from the landlord of the -- the -- yes the woodman inn he send it with he respectful compliment say you do he the honor to praise it last night you stay there i suppose surprisingly kind : quite a spanish bit of courtesy i write mr -- yes mr grove a note thank he on you behalf and i send he some dry sherry which stenson here -- he smile at the butler -- tell I be rather good eh stenson the solemn gravity of stenson 's face do not relax in the slightest as he murmur : count de meza 's '84 sir right so long as it be the best we have you approve stafford eh stafford nod with something more than approval thank you sir he say simply we admire mr grove 's port he be a good fellow i hope he 'll enjoy the sherry i shall take the first opportunity of call and express my sense of he kindness -- no more shall we have the coffee with the cigar in the billiard room the footman escort they through the

butler unlock and from which he take cigar and cigarette sir stephen wave they to seat and sink into a low chair with a sigh of satisfaction and enjoyment the footman place the exquisite coffee-service of limoge enamel on one of the table and as they leave the room howard as if he could not help himself say : this be a veritable aladdin 's palace sir stephen though i can imagine that fabulous erection can not have be as comfortable as this i be glad you like it he say but do you like it he put in with a shrewd gleam in he eye which could be keen as well as brilliant and genial i fancy you think it _ too _ fine -- eh stafford he lay he hand on stafford 's knee with a somewhat appealing gesture and glance i have see a doubt on you face once or twice -- and by george you have not see half the place yet yes mr howard i 'll admit that it be rather luxurious that be the result of give these new man _ carte-blanche _ they take you at you word sir i 'll own up i be a little surprised to-day for i tell they to build I a villa -- but then i want thirty or forty bedroom so i suppose they have to make it rather large it seem to I that as it overlook the lake it ought to be after the style of those place one see in italy and i hint that for the interior a oriental style might be suitable but i leave they a free hand and if they have overdo it they ought to have know better i employ the man who be recommend to I there be a pause for a moment stafford try to find some phrase which would conceal he lack of appreciation and he father as if he see what be pass through stafford 's mind go on quickly but smoothly : yes i see it _ be _ too fine and ornamental but i do not think you 'll find that the people who be come here tomorrow will agree with you i may not know much about art and taste but i know my world stafford -- mr howard -- i 'll make a clean breast of it i build this place with a object my dear sir you will not think I guilty of stick it up to please stafford here i know he taste too well something like mine i expect -- a cosy room with a clean cloth and a well-cooked chop and potato i have cook 'em myself before now -- the former on a shovel the latter in a empty meat-tin of course i know that stafford and you mr howard have live very different life to mine of course you have be accustom to every refinement and a great deal of luxury over since you leave the cradle quite right i be delighted that it should be so nothing be too good for stafford here -- and he chum -- nothing stafford 's handsome face flush you have be very generous to I sir he say in he brief way but with a glance at he father which express more than the word sir stephen throw he head back and laugh that be all right staff he say it be be a pleasure to I i just want to see you happy -- ` see you ' be rather inappropriate though be not it consider how very little i have see you but there be reason -- we will not go into that where be i you be tell we you

would tell you that i never give any reason but what i be say be this : that i have learn that the world like tinsel and glitter -- just as the sioux indian be catch by glass bead and length of turkey red calico and i give the world what it want see he laugh a laugh which be as cynical as howard 's the world be not so much a oyster which you have get to open with a sword as the old proverb have it but a wild beast yes a wild beast : and you have get to fight he at first fight he tooth and claw when you have beat he ah then you have get to feed he you have beat you wild beast sir stephen remark howard well -- yes more or less anyhow he seem ready to come to my hand for the tit-bits i can give he the world like to be _ fted _ like good dinner and high-class ball but above all it like to be amuse i be go to give it what it want stafford look up this declaration come from he father jar upon stafford whose heart he have win why should you trouble sir he say quietly i should have think you would have be satisfy because i want something more from it something in return say sir stephen with a smile satisfied no man be satisfied i have a ambition yet ungratified and i mean to gratify it you think i be vaunt mr howard no i think you be simply state a fact respond howard gravely i thank you sir say sir stephen as gravely i speak so confidently because i see my way clearly before I i generally do when i do not i back out and lie low stafford find this too painful he rise to get a light and saunter into the billiard-room and try the table sir stephen look after he musingly and seem to forget howard 's presence then suddenly he face flush and he eye shine with a curious mixture of pride and tenderness and the indomitable resolution which have help he to fight he wild beast he lean forward and touch howard 's knee do not you understand he say earnestly and in a low voice which the click of the billiard ball prevent stafford from hear it be for he for my boy mr howard it be for he that i have be work be still work for myself -- i be satisfied -- as he say but not for he i want to see he still higher up the ladder than i have climb i have do fairly well -- heaven and earth if anyone have tell I twenty year ago that i should be where and what i be to-day -- well i would have sell my chance for a bottle of ale you smile mr howard it be anything but beer and skittle for I then i want to leave my boy a -- title smile again mr howard i do not mind i have not a smile about I sir say howard ah you understand you see my mind i do not know why i have tell you except that it be because you be staff 's friend but i have tell you now and be i not right be not it a laudable ambition can you say that he will not wear it well however high the title may be where be there such another young fellow proud -- pride be too poor a word for what i feel for he he pause and sink back but lean forward again though i have keep apart from he mr howard i have watch he -- but in no unworthy sense no i have not spy upon he there be no need sir say howard very quietly i know it stafford be as straight as a dart as true as steel oh i have hear of he i know there be not a more popular man in england -- forgive I if i say i do not think there be a handsomer howard nod prompt assent i read of he in society at hurlingham everywhere he go he hold he own and i know why do you believe in birth mr howard he ask abruptly of course reply howard so do i though i can not lay claim to any but there be a good strain in stafford and it show itself there be something in he face a certain look in he eye in he voice and the way he move that quiet yet frank manner -- oh i can not explain he break off impatiently i think you have do it very well say howard i do not like the word -- it be so often misapply -- but i can not think of any better : distinguish be the word that describe stafford sir stephen nod eagerly you be right some man be make bear to wear the purple my boy be one of they -- and he shall he shall take he place amongst the noblest and the best in the land he shall marry with the highest nature have cast he in a noble mould and he shall step into he proper place he draw a long breath and he brilliant eye flash as if he be look into the future look into the hour of triumph yes i agree with you say howard but i be afraid stafford will scarcely share you ambition he be sorry he have speak as he see the change which he word have cause in sir stephen what he say almost fiercely why do you say that why should he not be ambitious he stop and lay he hand on howard 's shoulder grip it tightly and he voice sink to a stern whisper you do not know of anything -- there be no woman -- no entanglement no no say howard make you mind easy on that point there be no one stafford be singularly free in that respect in fact -- well he be rather cold there be no one i be sure i should have know it if there have be sir stephen 's grip relax and the stern almost savage expression be smooth out by a smile right he say still in a whisper then there be no obstacle in my way i shall win what i be fight for though it will not be a easy fight no sir but easy or difficult i mean win he rise and stand erect -- a striking figure look over howard 's head with a abstracted gaze then suddenly he eyelid quiver he face grow deathly pale and he hand go to he heart howard spring to he foot with a exclamation of alarm but sir stephen hold up he hand warningly move slowly to one of the table pour out a glass of _ liqueur _ and drink it then he turn to howard who stand watch he uncertain what to do or say and say with a air of command : not a word it be nothing then he link he arm in howard 's and lead he into the billiard-room table all right stafford first-rate sir reply stafford you and mr howard play a hundred no no say sir stephen you and howard i should enjoy look on we 'll have a pool say stafford take the ball from the cabinet howard watch

i have see a better you play a good game sir sir stephen 's face flush at he son 's praise as a girl 's might have do but he laugh it off only so so staff i do not play half as good a game as you and mr howard how should i -- mr howard there be the spirit-stand you 'll help yourself servant be a nuisance in a billiard-room not once for the rest of the evening do he show any sign of the weakness which have so startled howard and as they go up the stair he tell they a story with admirable verve and with evident enjoyment sorry we evening have come to a end he say as they stand outside he door it be the last we shall have to ourselves pity but it can not be help unconsciously he open the door as he speak and stafford say : be this you room sir yes walk in my boy reply sir stephen stafford walk in and stand stock-still with amazement the room be as plainly furnish as a servant 's -- more plainly probably than the servant who be house under he roof save for a square of carpet by the bed and dressing-table the floor be bare the bed be a common one of iron narrow and without drapery the furniture be of paint deal the only picture be a portrait of stafford enlarged from a photograph and it hang over the mantel-piece so that sir stephen could see it from the bed of course neither stafford nor howard make any remark remember that portrait stafford ask sir stephen with a smile i carry

thrill vitality which be new to he he put it down to the glorious morning to the discovery of the affection of he father to the good horse that step as lightly as a arab and carry he as if he be a feather and yet all the while he know that these do not altogether account for the electric eagerness the joy of living which possess he he pull up for a moment at the woodman inn to thank mr grove

the sun be still shine -- and he sigh impatiently and put adoni through the stream canter over the moor at the foot of the hill suddenly he hear the bark of a dog and look eagerly in the direction of the sound he see ida heron walk quickly round the hill with donald and bess scampering in front of she the gloom vanish from stafford 's face and he check adoni into a walk the dog be the first to see he and they tear towards he bark a welcome ida look up -- she have be walk with she eye bent on the ground -- the color rise to she face and she stop for a instant then she come on slowly and by the time they have meet there be no trace of the transitory blush stafford raise he hat and dismount and try to speak in a casual tone but it be difficult to conceal the subtle delight which spring up within he at the sight of she and he look at the beautiful face and the slim graceful figure in its tailor-made gown -- which well worn as it be seem to he to sit upon she as no other dress have ever sit upon any other woman -- he have hard work to keep the admiration from he eye i begin to count myself a very lucky man miss heron he say why she ask she grave eye rest on he calmly because i have

from the horse and wait with the quietude the self-possession and dignity which seem so strange in one so young and which by its strangeness fascinate he i -- speak to my father about the land : he be innocent in the matter it be buy through he agent and my father know nothing of anything -- underhand i can not tell you how glad i be that this be so so glad that -- i 'll make a clean breast of it -- i ride over this morning in the hope of meeting you and tell you she make a little gesture of acceptance i be glad too though it do not matter ah but it do he break in i should have be wretched if you have be right and my father have be guilty of anything of the kind but as a matter of fact he be not capable of it -- as you would say if you know he now there be no reason why we should not be friend be there he add with a suppress eagerness oh no she respond she glance up at the sky unnoticed by he a cloud have drift over the langdale pike as the range of high mountain be call it be go to rain and heavily and you have no umbrella waterproof exclaimed stafford she laugh with girlish amusement umbrella i do not think i have such a thing and this cloth be nearly waterproof besides i never notice the rain -- here it come it come with a vengeance it be as if the heaven have open and let down the bottom of a reservoir stafford mechanically take off he coat put this on he say that jacket be quite light you 'll get wet through she face crimsoned and she laugh a little constrainedly please put you coat on she say gravely and earnestly _ you _ will be wet through and you be not use to it there be a shed round the corner ride there as quickly as you can stafford stare at she then burst into a laugh which echo hers and leave you here be it likely well let we both go she say as if amuse by he obstinacy be it far he ask see if you can manage to balance on the saddle -- i would run beside you it be all very well to talk of not mind the rain but this be a deluge she glance at the horse i could not get up -- i could if he be bareback or if it be a lady 's saddle -- it do not matter look donald and bess be laugh at you for make a fuss about a shower will you try -- let I help you he plead i could lift you quite easily -- oh forgive I but i be not use to stand by and see a girl get soak you be walk -- not stand she remind he solemnly perhaps she smile give he courage : he take she just below the shoulder and lift she on to the saddle say as he do so and in as matter-of-fact a voice as he could : if you 'll just put you hand on my shoulder you 'll find that you can ride quite safely -- though i expect you could do it without that -- i have see you ride you know he keep he eye from she so that he do not see the hot blush which mantle in the clear ivory of she face or the sudden tightening of the lip as if she be struggle against some feeling and fight for she usual self-possession she succeed in a moment or two and when he look up the blush have go and something like amusement be share the sweet girlish confusion in she gray eye this be absurd she say it be to be hope jason or none of the man will see I they would think i have go mad and i should never hear the last of it the shed be by that tree i see it -- just across the road please keep a tight hold of my shoulder i should never forgive myself if you slip i be not in the least likely to slip she say then suddenly just as they be on the edge of the road she utter a exclamation of surprise rather than embarrassment for a carriage and pair come round the corner and almost upon they stafford stop adoni to let the carriage pass but the coachman pull up in response to a signal from someone inside and a man thrust he head out of the window and regard they at first with surprise and then with keen scrutiny he be a elderly man with a face which would have be coarse but for its expression of acuteness and a certain strength which reveal itself in the heavy feature can you tell I the way to sir stephen orme 's place he ask in a rough harsh voice ida be about to slip down but she reflect that the mischief if there be any be do now and to stafford 's admiration she sit quite still under the gaze of the man 's keen sarcastic eye yes keep straight on and round by the woodman : you will see the house by that time say stafford thanks drive on coachman say the man and he draw in he head with a grim smile and something like a sneer on he thick lip that make stafford 's eye flash chapter viii stafford and ida remain unconscious of the rain look after the carriage for a moment or two the sneer on the man 's heavy yet acutely sharp face still incensed stafford he have the usual desire of the strong man -- to dash after the rapidly disappear vehicle lug the fellow out and ask he what he be sneer at ida be the first to speak what a strange-looking man she say stafford start slightly awake to the fact that it be still pour i -- i beg you pardon i be keep you out in the rain he put adoni not at all unwillingly to a trot and they gain the rough cattle-shed and he would have lift the girl down but she be too quick for he and slip gracefully and easily from the saddle stafford lead the horse follow she into the shed bess sit on the extreme end of she haunch shiver and blinking and all too plainly cursing the british climate but donald throw himself down outside as if he regard the deluge as a cheap shower-bath stafford look at ida anxiously you be fearfully wet he say i think i could wipe off the worst of it if you 'll let I he take out he pocket handkerchief as he speak and wipe the rain from she straight beautifully mould shoulder she draw back a little and open she lip to protest at first but with a slight shrug she resign herself she eye downcast a faint color in she face i must be quite dry now she say at last i be afraid not say stafford i wish i have something bigger -- a towel she laugh the sweet girlish laugh which seem to he the most musical sound he have ever hear a towel fancy carry a towel to wipe oneself with when it rain it be evident you do not know we country there be week sometimes in which it never cease to rain and you must be wet through yourself she add glance at he he be on he knee at the moment carefully wipe the old habit skirt with he saturated handkerchief as if the former be something precious and she woman 's eye note he short crisp hair the shapely head and the straight broad back i be afraid that be all i can do he say regretfully as he rise and look at she gravely do you mean to say that you habitually ride out in such weather as this why yes she reply lightly why not i be too substantial to melt and i never catch cold besides i have to go out in all weather to see to the cattle and the sheep he lean against one of the post which support the shed and gaze at she with more intense interest than any other woman have ever arouse in he be not there a foreman a bailiff whatever you call he in these part she shake she head no we can not afford one so i do he work and very pleasant work it be especially in fine weather and you be happy he ask almost unconsciously she frank eye meet he with a smile of amusement yes quite happy she answer why do it seem so unlikely so unreasonable well it do he reply as if she frankness be contagious of course i could understand it if you do it occasionally if you do it because you like ride but to be oblige to have to go out in all weather it be not right she look at he thoughtfully yes i suppose it seem strange to you i suppose most of the lady you know be rich and only ride to amuse themselves and never go out when they do not want to do so sir stephen orme -- you -- be very rich be you not we my father and i be poor very poor and if i do not look after thing if i be not my own bailiff -- oh well i do not know what would happen stafford gnaw at he moustache as he gaze at she the exquisitely colourless face in which the violet eye glow like two twin flower the delicately cut lip soft and red the dark hair clustering at the ivory temple in wet ring set he heart beat with a heavy pulsation that be a agony of admiration and longing -- a longing that be vague and indistinct yes i suppose it must seem strange to you she say as if she be follow out the line of she own thought you must be accustom to girl who be so different yes they be different he admit most of the woman i know would be frighten to death if they be catch in such a rain as this would be more than frighten to death if they have to ride down that hill most of 'em think they have do wonder if they get in at the end of a run over a fairly easy country and none of 'em could doctor a sick sheep to save they life yes she say dreamily i have see they but only at a distance but i do not know anything about farm until i come home and do you never go away from here go to london for a change and get a dance and -- and all that he ask she shake she head indifferently no i never leave the dale i can not my father could not spare I have it leave off rain yet she go to the front of the shed and look out no it be still pelt please come back it be pour off the roof you hair be quite wet again she laugh but she obey i suppose that gentleman the man in the carriage be a friend of sir stephen 's as he ask the way to you house i do not know reply stafford i do not know any of my father 's friend i know very little of he until last night she look at he with frank girlish interest do you find the new house very beautiful she ask stafford nod yes he say absently it be a kind of -- of palace it be beautiful enough -- perhaps a little too -- too rich he admit she smile but then you be rich and be it true that a number of visitor be come down i hear it from jessie who be jessie he ask for he be more interested in the smallest detail of this strange bewilderingly lovely girl 's life than he father 's affair jessie be my maid i call she mine because she be very much attach to I but she be really we house-maid parlour-maid we have very few servant : i suppose you have a great many up at the new house he nod oh yes he say half apologetically too many by far i wish you could see it he add she laugh softly thank you but that be not likely i think it be not rain so hard now and that i can go it be simply pour still he say earnestly and emphatically you would get drench if you venture out but i can not stay here all day she remark with a laugh i have a great deal to do : i have to see that the sheep have not stray and that the cow be in the meadow the fence be bad in place and the stupid creature be always stray it be wonderful how quickly a cow find a weak place in a fence stafford 's face grow red a brick-dust red it be not fit work for you he say you -- you be only a girl you can not be strong enough to face such weather to do such work the beautiful eye grow wide and gaze at he with girlish amusement and something of indignation i be older than you think i be not a girl she retort and i be as strong as a horse she draw herself up and throw she head back i be never tire -- or scarcely ever one day i ride to keswick and back and when i get home jason meet I at the gate and tell I that the steer have ` break ' and have get on the bryndermere road i start after they but miss they for a time and only come up with they at landal water -- ah you do not know where that be well it be a great many mile of course i have a rest come back as i could only drive they slowly something in he eye -- the pity the indignation the wonder that this exquisitely refine specimen of maidenhood should be bent to such base use -- shone in they and stop she the color rise to she face and she eye grow faintly troubled then a proud light flash in they ah i see you be think that it be -- be not ladylike that none of you lady-friend would do it if even if they be strong enough stafford would have scorn himself if he have be tempt to evade those beautiful eye that sweet and now rather haughty voice besides he be not give to evasion with man or woman i be not think quite that he say but i 'll tell you what i be think if you 'll promise not to be offend she consider for a moment then she say : i do not think you will offend I what be it well i be think that -- see here now miss heron i have get you promise -- it be not worthy of you -- such work i mean because i be a girl she say she lip curve with a smile no he say gravely because you be a lady because you be so -- so refine so graceful so -- he dare not say beautiful and consequently he flounder and break down if you be a farmer 's daughter clumsy and rough and awkward it would not seem to inappropriate for you to be herd cattle and count sheep but -- now you promise -- when i come to think that ever since i meet you whenever i think of you i think of -- of -- a beautiful flower -- that now i have see you in evening-dress i realize how wrong it be that you should do such work oh dash it i know it be like my cheek to talk to you like this he wind up abruptly and desperately while he have be speak the effect of he word have express itself in she eye and in the alternate color and pallor of she face it be the first time in she life any man have tell she that she be refine and graceful and flower-like that she be so to speak waste she sweetness on the desert air and the speech be both pleasant and painful to she the long dark lash sweep she cheek she lip set tightly to repress the quiver which threaten they but when he have completely break down she raise she eye to he with a look so grave so sweet so girlish that stafford 's heart leap not for the first time that morning and there flash through he the unexpected thought : what would not a man give to have those eye turn upon he with love shine in they depths i be not offend she say i know what you mean none of you lady-friend would do it because they be lady i be sorry but they be not place as i be do you think i could sit with my hand before I or do fancy-work while thing go to ruin my father be old and feeble -- you see he the other night -- i have no brother -- no one to help I and -- so you see how it be the eye rest on he with a proud smile as if she be challenge he then she go on : and it do not matter i live quite alone i see no one no other lady there be no one to be ashamed of I stafford redden that be rather a hard hit for I he say ashamed by heaven if you know how i admire -- how amaze i be at you pluck and goodness -- she eye drop before he glowing one and there be no need to pity I : i be quite happy quite happier than i should be if i be play the piano or pay visit all day it have quite leave off now half unconsciously he put he hand on she arm pleadingly and with the firm masterful touch of the man will you wait one more moment he say in he deep musical voice she pause and look at he enquiringly you say just now that you have no brother no one to help you will you let I help you will you let I stand in the place of a friend of a brother she look at he with frank surprise and most man would have be embarrassed and confuse by the steady astonished regard of the violet eye but stafford be too eager to get she consent to care for the amusement that be mix with the expression of surprise why -- how could you help I she say at last even if -- -- you would let I he finish for she well i be not particularly clever but i have get sense enough to count sheep and drive cow and i can break in colt train dog and if i be obliged i daresay i could drive a plough she eye wander thoughtfully abstractedly down the dale but she be listen and think of course i should have a lot to learn but i be rather quick at pick up thing and -- be you joke mr orme she break in joking i be never more serious in my life he say eagerly and yet with a attempt to conceal he earnestness i be ask it as a favor i be indeed i shall be here for week month perhaps and i should be bore to death -- with you father 's house full of visitor she put in softly and with a smile break through she gravity oh they 'll amuse themselves he say at any rate i sha 'n' t be with they all day and i would ever so much rather help you than dance attendance on they she push the short silky curl from she temple and shake she head of course it be ridiculous she say with a girlish laugh and it be impossible too oh be it he retort i have never yet find anything i want to do impossible you always have you own way she ask by hook or by crook he reply but why do you want to -- help I she ask do you think you would find it amusing you would not the laughter shone in she eye again you would soon grow tired of it it be not like hunting or fishing or golfing it be work that try the temper -- i never know what a fiendish temper i have get about I until the first time i have to drive a cow and calf my temper could not be worse he remark calmly howard say that sometimes i could give point to the man possess with seven devil who be mr howard she ask my own particular chum he say he come down with I and be up at the house now but never mind howard be you go to let I help you as if i be a old friend or a -- brother or be you go to be unkind enough to refuse she begin to feel driven and she brow knit as she say : i think you be very -- obstinate mr orme that describe I exactly he say cheerfully i be a perfect mule when i like and i be like it all i know at this moment it be absurd -- it be ridiculous as i say she murmur half angrily half laughingly and i can not think why you offer why you want to -- to help I never mind say stafford he heart beat with anticipatory triumph for he know that the woman who hesitate be gain perhaps i want to get some lesson in farm on the cheap or -- -- perhaps you really want to help the poor girl who though she be a lady have to do the work of a farmer 's daughter she say in a low voice oh it be very kind of you but -- then i 'll come over to-morrow a hour earlier than this and you shall show I how to count the sheep or whatever you do with they he put in quickly but i be go to refuse -- very gratefully of course -- but to refuse you could not you could not be so unkind i 'll ride a hunter i have get he be rather stiffer than adoni and better up to rough work i will come to the stream where we first meet and wait for you -- shall i he say all this as if the matter be settle and with the sensation of be drive still more strongly upon she she raise she eye to he with a yielding expression in they with that touch of imploration which lurk in a woman 's eye and about the corner of she lip when for the first time she surrender she will to a man i do not know what to say it be absurd -- it be -- wrong i do not understand why -- ah well she sigh with a air of relief you will tire of it very quickly -- after a few hour -- all right we 'll leave it at that he say with a exasperating air of cheerful confidence it be a bargain miss heron shall we shake hand on it he hold out he hand with the smile which few man and still fewer woman could resist and she try to smile in response but as he strong hand close over she small one a faint look of doubt almost of trouble be palpable in she violet eye and on she lip she draw she hand away -- and it have to be draw for he release it only slowly and reluctantly -- and without a word she leave the shed stafford watch she as she go lightly and quickly up the road towards the hall bess and donald leap round she then with a sharp feeling of elation a feeling that be as novel as it be confuse he spring on he horse and put he to a gallop ride for home with one thought standing clearly out : that before many hour -- the next morning -- he should see she again once he shift he whip to he left hand and stretch out he right hand look at it curiously : it seem to be still thrill with the contact of she small warm palm as he come up to the woodman inn he remember what he have forget in the morning that he have leave he cigar-case on the dining-room mantel-shelf he pull up and give adoni to the hostler who rush forward promptly he go into the inn there be no one in the hall and know that he should be late for luncheon he open the dining-room door and walk in and straight up to the fireplace the cigar-case be where he have leave it and he turn to go out then he see that he be not the only occupant of the room for a lady be sit in the broad bay-window he snatch off he cap and murmur a apology i beg you pardon i do not know anyone be in the room he say the lady be young and handsome with a beauty which owe a great deal to color she hair be a rich auburn she complexion of the delicate purity which sometimes go with that color hair -- milk and rose it use to be call she eye be of china blue and she lip rather full but of the richest carmine she be exquisitely dress she travel costume evidently of redfern 's build and one hand from which she have remove the glove be load with costly ring diamond and emerald as large as nut and of the first water but it be not she undeniable beauty or she dress and costly jewellery which impressed stafford so much as the proud scornfully listless air with which she regard he as she lean back indolently -- and a little insolently -- tap the edge of the table with she glove pray do not apologise she say languidly this be a public room i suppose yes i think so say stafford in he pleasant frank way but one do not rush into a public room with one 's hat on if he have reason to suppose that a lady be present i think there be no one here -- the curtain conceal you : i be sorry she shrug she shoulder and give he the faintest and most condescending of bow then as he reach the door she say : do you think it will be moonlight to-night stafford naturally look rather surprise at this point-blank meteorological question i should not be surprise if it be he say you see this be a very changeable climate and as it be rain now it will probably clear up before the evening thanks she say i be much oblige -- oh my opinion be not worth much he put in parenthetically but she go on as if he have not speak -- i should be still further oblige if you would be so kind as to tell my father -- he be outside with the carriage somewhere -- that i be tired and that i would rather not go on until the cool of the evening certainly say stafford he wait a moment to see if she have any other request or rather order and then go out and find the gentleman with the strongly marked countenance in the stable-yard beside the carriage to which the hostler and the help be put fresh horse stafford raise he hat slightly i be the bearer of a message from the young lady in the dining-room sir he say she wish I to tell you that she would prefer to remain here until the evening the man swing round upon he with a alert and curious manner half startle half resentful what the devil -- i beg you pardon prefer to remain here well he mutter something that sound extremely like a oath then with a shrug of he shoulder tell the hostler to take the horse out thank you he say to stafford grudgingly i suppose my daughter be tire : very kind of you not at all respond stafford politely and he get on to adoni which mr grove himself have lead out and ride away the gentleman look after he with knit brow what be the name of that young fellow he ask of grove that be mr stafford orme sir stephen 's son sir reply grove the gentleman be walk towards the house but he pull up short he eye narrow themselves to slit and he thick lip close tightly a fine young fellow sir say grove with respectful enthusiasm a splendid specimen of a english gentleman the gentleman grunt and go on to the dining-room what whim be this maude he ask irritably she yawn behind she beringed hand i be tired i can not face that stuffy carriage again just yet let we dine here and go on afterwards in the cool oh just as you like he say it make no difference to I i know she assent then in a indolently casual way she ask : who be that gentleman who ride by just now she father glance at she suspiciously as he take off he overcoat now how on earth should i know my dear maude he reply with a short harsh laugh some young farmer or cattle dealer i imagine i say _ gentleman _ she retort with something approach insolence you will permit _ I _ to know the difference she father color angrily as if she have sting he you would better go upstairs and take off you thing while i order dinner he say chapter ix as stafford ride homewards he wonder whom the strange pair could be it be evident they be not go to stay at the villa or they would have drive straight there but it be also evident that the gentleman have hear of sir stephen 's little place or he would not have ask where it be but as stafford reflect rather ruefully it would be difficult for any traveller pass through the neighborhood not to see the new great white house or to hear something perhaps a very great deal of the man who have build it howard saunter down the hall to meet he good heaven how wet you look and needless to add how happy if there be anything in the doctrine of the transmigration of soul my dear stafford you future embodiment will be that of a newfoundland dog such a extremely strong passion for cold water be almost -- er -- indecent i have have a lovely morning in the library and you father be still at work with he correspondence i ask he what he think of lord palmerston 's aphorism : that if you leave you letter unanswered long enough they answer themselves and he admit it be true and that he have sometimes adopt the plan successfully there be a secretary with he -- a dark and silent man name murray who appear to have a automatic double-action brain anyway he can write a letter and answer question at the same time and he watch you father 's lip as if he -- the secretary not sir stephen -- be a dog wait for a stone to be throw it be interesting to watch -- for a time then it get on one 's nerve may i ask where you have be oh just for a ride be try the new horse : he be a clinker the governor could not have get hold of a better if he would search all arabium and hungary to boot i 'll just change and get some lunch i hope you have not wait you hope be not in vain young man reply howard suavely but i will come and sit beside you while you stoke with measom 's aid stafford be soon into dry clothes and seat at lunch and as he have promise howard draw a chair to the table and contemplate he with vicarious enjoyment what a appetite you have he drawl admiringly i imagine it would stand by you even if you be in love as a specimen of the perfectly healthy animal you stand preeminent my dear stafford by the way shall i spoil you lunch if i read you out a list of the guest whom we be expect this afternoon sir stephen be good enough to furnish I with it with the amiable wish that i might find some friend on it what do you say to lord and lady fitzharford the countess of clansford the baron wirsch the right honorable henry efford sir william and lady plaistow -- stafford look up and smile any more oh yes there be the two belton and george levinson to say

fashion be represent by the fitzharford and old lady clansford politics by efford and the belton and finance by plaistow and wirsch that griffinberg be come be a proof that sir stephen have get ' a little railway ' in he mind there be several other who seem to have be throw in not to increase weight but to lighten it it will be rather amusing -- a kind of menagerie which under less skilful guidance than sir stephen 's might be sure to disagree and fight stafford sigh oh you 'll be all right he say but i do not quite see where i shall come in howard laugh my dear stafford there be some extremely pretty girl with whom you can flirt and i have no doubt some of the man will join you in you eccentric attempt to drown yourself or break you neck _ be _ that the sun come out and be it go to clear i hope so say stafford laugh for i prophesy a fine evening and a lady be weak enough to take my word for it let we go and rake my father out of the library and get he into the garden with a cigar you may venture upon such a audacity but not i say howard with simulated fear i 'll wait for you on the terrace sir stephen look up with a frown as stafford enter and the dark-faced secretary stare aghast at the intrusion but sir stephen 's face clear as he see who it be back stafford he say what come into the garden -- cigar certainly you can finish up can not you murray thanks he look at he watch as they go through the hall i suppose some of the people will be here before long do mr howard show you the list do you know any of they stafford yes i have meet lady clansford and the fitzharford of course but most of they be too great and lofty i mean that they be celebrated personage out of my small track one do not often meet sir william plaistow and mr griffinberg at at home and afternoon tea sir stephen laugh oh well you must not let they bear you you know my boy you must consider yourself quite free to cut off and amuse yourself some other way whenever you get tire of they and leave it all to you sir say stafford with a smile but as he speak he draw a breath of relief he should be free to help the beautiful lovely girl of herondale a few hour later the visitor arrive and before dinner the superb drawing-room be if not crowd sufficiently well fill with the brilliant company nearly all the guest be extremely wealthy most of they be powerful either in the region of politics or finance and the fashionable world be represent by some beautiful woman with dress and diamond above reproach and some young man whose name stand high at hurlingham and prins stafford stand beside he father as sir stephen go from group to group greet one and another in he frank and genial yet polished manner which grow warm and marked by scarcely repress pride as he

griffinberg i want my son to know you you and i be such old friend that you will not mind I show that i be proud of he eh and he lay he hand on stafford 's shoulder with a air of pride and affection what a lovely place sir stephen have make of this mr orme say lady clansford we be quite startle as we drive up and simply bewilder when we get inside this room be really -- oh well i be beggar for adjective stafford go about listen to the encomium on he father or the house and make appropriate response but he be rather relieve when the butler announce dinner the dining-room receive its meed of praise from the guest and the elaborate _ menu _ cause some of the man to beam with inward satisfaction it be a superb dinner serve with a stateliness which could not have be exceed if royalty have be amongst the guest the plate be magnificent the flower arrange by a artist 's hand in rich and yet chaste abundance stafford as he look from the bottom of the table to sir stephen at the head feel with a thrill of pride that he father be the most distinguished-looking man of they all and he notice that in the tone of both the man and the woman who address he there be that subtle note which indicate respect and the consideration which man and woman of the world pay to one who have achieve greatness and yet he notice also that not one of they be more perfectly at he ease than sir stephen who laugh and talk as if he only aim be that of enjoyment and as if he have never plan a plan or scheme a scheme every now and then stafford catch he father 's eye and each time he do so sir stephen smile at he with that air of pride and affection which he make no attempt to conceal or check once or twice howard too catch he eye and smile significantly as if he be say how be this for a successful party the dinner go swimmingly and when the lady have retire sir stephen beg the man to close up and pass the wine freely the talk be of everything but politics or business -- stafford remark that not a word be say of either topic and sir stephen tell one or two story admirably and set the laughter go what sort of a night be it stafford he ask presently stafford draw the curtain from the open french window and the moonlight stream in to fight with the electric lamp shall we go out on to the terrace say sir stephen quite warm enough be not it they go out servant bring coffee and cigar and some of the

rain very thoughtfully : but not sadly for though it be still pelt in the uncompromising lake fashion she be half conscious of a strange lightness of the heart a strange brightness in herself and even in the rain-swept view which vaguely surprise and puzzle she the feeling be not vivid enough to be happiness but it be the nearest thing to it and without realize it she think all the way home of stafford orme she life have be so secluded so solitary and friendless that he have come into it as a sudden and unexpected flash of sunlight in a drear November day it seem to she extraordinary that she should have meet he so often still more extraordinary the offer he have make that morning she ask herself as she go with quick light step along the hill why he have do it why he who be rich and have so many friend -- no doubt the villa would be full of they -- should find any pleasure in learn to herd cattle and count sheep to ride about the dale with only a young girl for company if anyone have whisper it be because he prefer that young girl 's society to any other 's it be because he want to be with you not from any desire to learn farm she would have be more than surprise would have receive this offer of a solution of the mystery with a smile of incredulity for there have be no candid friend to tell she that she possess the fatal gift of beauty that she be one of those upon whom the eye of man can not look without a stir of the heart and a quicken of the pulse vanity be a strong plant and it flourish in every soil but it have find no root in ida 's nature she be too absorb in the round of she daily task in the care of she father and she effort to keep the great place from go to rack and ruin to think of herself and if she glass have ever whisper that she be one of the

of it after a few day perhaps hour of course she be wrong to humor the whim but it have be hard to refuse he hard to seem churlish and obstinate after he have be so kind on the night she father have frighten she by he sleep-walking and it have be still harder because she have be conscious of a certain pleasure in the thought that she should see he again for the first time as she go into the great

of the new hand that mr stafford be a very great gentleman amongst the fashionable people in london and that very likely he would marry one of the great lady that be come down mr davi say that a duchess would not be too fine for he he stand so high and yet susie say he be just as pleasant and easy as sir stephen and that he say ` thank you ' quite like a common person but there how foolish of I i be stand here chatter while you be wet through do ye run up and change while i put the lunch on miss ida dear when ida come down she father be already at the table with he book open at he elbow and he scarcely look up as she go to she place now as a rule she give he a account of she ride and walk and tell he about the cattle and the progress of the farm generally of how she have see a kingfisher or notice that the trout be rise or that she have startle a covey of partridge in the young wheat to all of which he seem scarcely ever to listen nod he head now and again and return often to he book before she have finish speak but to-day she could not tell he of she morning walk and she meeting with stafford orme she would have like to have assure he that he have do sir stephen a injustice in think he guilty of buy the brae wood land in a underhand way but she know it would be of no use to do so for once a idea have get into mr heron 's head it be difficult to destroy it for the first time in she life too she be conceal something from he once or twice she try to say : father the gentleman who be fishing on the river be sir stephen orme 's son i have meet he two or three time since and he have ask I to meet he to-morrow but she could not she know he would fly into one of the half-childish passion in which he could not be persuade to listen to reason and that he would insist upon the break off of she acquaintance with mr orme and there be so much pain in the mere thought of it that she courage fail she if she be not to meet he or if she meet he and tell he that she could not remain with he must not speak to he again it would be tantamount to tell he that she do not believe he father be innocent and she do believe it though she know so little of mr orme she feel that she could trust he so she sit almost silent thinking of what jessie have tell she and wonder why stafford orme should leave the gay party at the villa to ride with she once only in the course of the meal do she father speak he look up suddenly with a quick almost cunning glance and say : can you let I have some money ida i want to order some book there be a copy of the percy ` relique ' in the catalogue i should like to buy how much be it father she ask oh five pound will do he say vaguely there be one or two other book she make a hasty calculation : five pound be a large sum to she but she smile as she say : you be very extravagant dear there be already a copy of the ` relique ' in the library he look confuse for a moment then he say : but not with these note -- not with these note they be valuable and the book be cheap very well dear she respond and she go to the antique bureau and unlock it take a five-pound note from a cedar box he watch she covertly with a painful eagerness i suppose you have a large nest egg there eh ida he remark with a quaver laugh no : a very little one she respond ` not nearly enough to pay the quarterly bill but never mind dear there it be you must show I the book when they come i never see the last you order you know he take the note with a assumption of indifference but with a gleam of satisfaction in he sunken eye do not you he say i must have forget you be always so busy but i 'll show you these if you 'll remind I you must be careful of the money ida you must keep down the expense we be poor very poor you know and the cost of living and servant be very great -- very great he wander off to the library mutter to himself with he book under he arm and the five-pound note grip tightly in the hand which he have thrust into the pocket of he dressing-gown and ida as she put on she habit and go into the stable-yard to have the colt saddle sigh as she think that it would be nice to have just for once enough money to meet all the bill and buy all the book she father covet but she melancholy be not of long duration the colt be in high spirit and the task of impress he with the fact that he have now reach a responsible age and must behave like a horse with something else before he in life than kick up he heel in the paddock soon drive the thought of they poverty from she mind and send the blood leap warmly and wildly in she vein she spend the afternoon in break in the colt and succeed in keep stafford orme out of she thought but he slide into they again as she sit by the drawing-room fire after dinner -- the night be often cool in the dale all through early summer -- and recall the earnestness in he handsome face when he plead to be allow to help she she sit up for some little time after she father have go to bed and as usual she pause outside he door and listen all be quiet then but as she be brushing she hair she think she hear he door open she lay down the brush and stand battle with the sudden fear which possess she then she steal out on to the corridor the old man be stand at the head of the stair as if about to descend and though she could not see he face she know that he be asleep she glide to he noiselessly and put she hand upon he arm softly he turn he sightless eye upon she evidently without see she and fight against the desire to cry out she lead he gently back to he room he wake as they cross the threshold wake and look at she in a stupefied fashion be you ill father be there anything you want she ask as calmly as she could no he reply i be quite well i do not want anything i be go to bed -- why have you call I she remain with he for a few minute then leave the room turn the key in the door when she have go he stand listen with he head on one side then he open he hand and look with a cunning smile at the five-pound note which have be tightly grasp in it she do not see it no she do not see it he mutter and he go stealthily to the bed and thrust it under the pillow chapter xiii the morning break with that exquisite clearness which distinguish the lake when a fine day follow a wet one and despite she anxiety on she father 's account ida as she go down-stair be conscious of that sense of happiness which come from anticipation she make she morning tour of inspection of the stable and the dairy and order the big chestnut to be saddle directly after breakfast when she father come down she be relieve to find that he seem to be in he usual health and in answer to she question whether he have sleep well he reply in the affirmative and be mildly surprise that she should enquire directly he have go off to the library she run upstairs to put on she habit for the first time she be strike by its shabbiness she have never give a think to it before she evening-dress though plain and inexpensive be always dainty and fresh but she wear she habit as long as it would hold together and care nothing for the fact that she hat be stain by the rain : they be she working clothes and strictly consider as such but this morning she survey the skirt ruefully and thought of the trim and apparently always new habit which the bannerdale girl wear and she brush it with a care which it have never yet receive as a rule she wear a black scarf or none at all but as she look at herself in the glass she be not satisfied and she find a scarlet tie which she have buy in a fit of extravagance and put it on the touch of color heighten the beauty of she clear ivory face and brighten up the old habit but she look at herself in the glass with something like shamefacedness : why be she so anxious about she appearance this morning of all the morning for a instant she be tempt to snatch off the tie but in the end she let it remain and she brush the soft tendril of she hair at she forehead with unusual care before she fasten on she hat she father be walk up and down the terrace slowly as she come out and he raise he head and look at she absently i shall probably ride into bryndermere father she say shall i post you letter i know you will be anxious for that one to the book-seller to go she add with a smile he eye drop and he seem disconcerted for a minute then he say : no no i 'll send it by jason i have not write it yet and he turn away from she and resume he pacing to and fro ida go to the stable-yard and get on to rupert by the aid of the stone mount block from which charle the second have climb laughingly to the white horse which figure in so many picture of the merry monarch and ride out of the court-yard watch with pride by jason before she have go far he run after she if you be ride by west hill miss ida perhaps you would look at the cattle-shed there william say that the roof 's fall in very well she call back in she clear voice oh and miss ida there be a big stone wash out of the weir i be think it ought to be put back or we 'll have the meadow above flood this winter she laugh and nod and put rupert to a trot for she know that while she be within hear jason would bombard she with similar tale of woe not a slate slide from the old roof of the hall or a sheep fall lame but the matter be refer to she she ride down the road in the sunlight the big chestnut move under she as if he be on spring and she be a feather and half unconsciously she begin to hum a air -- not one of those modern one one hear in many drawing-room but a old-fashioned melody which she have find in a ancient music-book in the antique cabinet beside the grand piano she leave the road where it touch the wild moorland of the valley and rupert break into a canter donald and bess settling into the stride with which they manage to keep up with the big horse she have resolve that she would not ride straight to the stream and she keep up the hill-side but she eye wander to the road expectantly now and again but there be no sign of a horseman and after half a hour have pass a sense of disappointment rise within she it be quite possible that he have forget the engagement perhaps on reflection he have see that she be quite right in she objection to he strange proposal and he would not come a faint flush rise to she face and she turn rupert and ride up and over the hill where she could not see the road but she have no sooner get on top than she remember that no time have be mention or if it have that she have forget it she turn and ride up the hill again and look down saw stafford ride along the valley in desperate haste and yet look about he uncertainly she heart beat with a quicken pulse send the delicate color into she face and she pull up and lean forward with she chin in she hand watch he dreamily he ride a heavier horse than adonis and he have make a change in he dress in place of the riding-suit which have smack of london and hyde park he wear a rough but light coat thick cord breeches and brown leather gaiter she smile as she know that he have try to make himself look as much like a farmer as possible but no farmer in the dale have that peculiar air of birth and breeding which distinguish stafford orme the air which he father have be so quick to detect and to be proud of she notice how well he sit the great horse with what ease and hand he ride over the rough and treacherous ground suddenly he turn he head and see she and with a wave of he hand come gallop up to she with a smile of relief and gladness on he handsome face as he speak to the dog who clamour round he i be so afraid i have miss you he say i be late be i not some people keep I after breakfast you be not late i do not think any time be mention she respond quickly though she heart be beat with a strange and novel sensation of pleasure in he presence i scarcely expect you he look at she reproachfully not expect I but why i think you might change you mind she say he check a quick response and say instead : and now where do we go first you see i have get a bit heavier horse he be a present also from my father what do you think of he she eye he gravely and critically he be nice-looking she say but i do not like he so well as the one you ride yesterday do not i see he slip just now come up the hill do he say stafford i do not notice to tell you the truth i be so delighted at see you that i do not think i should have notice if he have tumble on he nose oh it be not much of a slip she say quickly to cover she slight confusion at he candid confession shall we go down to the sheep first anywhere you like he assent brightly remember i be you pupil she glance at he and smile a very big pupil but a very humble one he say i be afraid you 'll add ' a very stupid one ' before long as they ride down hill stafford steal a look at she unobserved ever since he have leave she yesterday she face have haunt he even while maude falconer in all she war paint and sparkling with jewel have be sing even in the silent watch of the night when -- strange thing for he -- he have awaken from a dream of she he have recall the exquisitely lovely face with its grave yet girlish eye and he feel now with a thrill that she be even more lovely than she have be in he thought and he dream that the nameless charm which have haunt he be stronger more subtle than even he fancy have paint it he notice the touch of color just below she white slender column of a neck and wonder why no other woman have ever think of wear a crimson tie with she habit what a grand morning he say i do not think i ever see a morning like this so clear and bright those hill there look as though they be quite near it be the rain she explain it seem to wash the atmosphere my father say there be only one other place which have this particular clearness and brightness after rain : and that be ireland there be the sheep now she smile do you know how to count they he stare at she you begin at number one i suppose he say she smile but where be number one she speak to donald in a low voice then the collie begin to work the sheep up into a heap bess assist with she sharp yap now they be ready say ida you must be quick stafford begin to count but the sheep move and the one he have count get mix up with the other and he begin again and yet again until he turn with a puzzle and furrow brow i can not count they he say they will not keep still for a single moment she turn to he with a smile there be fifty-two she say do you mean to say that you have count they already he exclaim yes i could have count they twice over by this time now begin again and begin from the farthest row and remember when you come to a black one keep you eye on that one and start again front he it be quite easy when you know how he begin again i make it forty-eight she shake she head and laugh that would be four miss and we should have to hunt for they but they be all there try again he try -- and make it fifty-six do not i tell you that i be a idiot he say in despair oh you can not expect to learn the first time she say consolingly it be week before i could do it and i almost cry the first few time i try : they would move just as i be finish oh well then i can hope to get it in time he say do it ever strike you that though we think ourselves jolly clever that there be heap of thing which a workingman -- the man we look down upon -- can do which we could not accomplish if it be to save we life for instance i could not make a horseshoe if my existence depend upon it and yet it look as easy as -- -- count sheep she finish with a twinkle in she grey-blue eye just so he say with a laugh shall i have another try oh no you would be here all day and we have get to see if the other be all right but first i think we would better go and look at the weir jason say that a stone have get wash down and that mean that when the autumn rain come the meadow would be flood all right : i be ready he say with bright alacrity i be enjoy this i know now why you look so happy and contented you be of some use in the world and i -- the rest of we -- that be the weir he break off to enquire as they come in sight of a rude barrier of stone which partially check the stream that be it she say and jason be right some of the big stone have be wash down what a nuisance we shall have to get some man from bryndermere to put they up again stafford ride up to the weir and look at it critically thank heaven i have not get to count the stone he say if you 'll kindly hold my horse -- he be not so well train as yours and would bolt i be afraid he slip from the saddle as he speak and she catch the rein what be you go to do she ask i do not know yet stafford call back as he wade into the river she hold the horse and sit reposeful in the saddle and watch he with a smile upon she face but it grow suddenly grave as she see stafford stoop and put he arm round one of the fall stone and she cry to he : oh you can not lift they it be no use try stafford apparently do not hear she for exert all he strength he lift the big stone and gradually slide and hoist it into its place then he attack the other two and with a still greater effort raise they into a line with they fellow ida watch he as -- well as one watch some strong man go through he performance it be a well-nigh incredible feat and she hold she breath as one stone follow the other it seem to she incredible and impossible because stafford 's figure be slight and graceful and he perform the feat with the apparent ease which he have learn in the ` varsity athletic sport the color rise to she face and she heart beat quickly there be one thing leave for woman to worship and they worship it readily -- and that be strength stafford could not count sheep -- any woman could do that -- but he could do what no woman could do : lift those great stone into they place so that as he wade out of the river she smile _ on _ he instead of _ at _ he -- which be a very different thing -- as she say : how strong you must be i should have think it would have require two or three man to lift those stone oh it be easy enough as easy as -- count sheep when you know how she laugh but you must be very wet she say glancing at the water as it drip from he clothes oh it be all in the day 's work he say cheerfully more than cheerfully happily now for the steer they be in the dale she say and she look at he as she speak with a new interest with the interest a woman feel in the presence of she master of the man who can move mountain he shake the water from he and ride at she side more cheerfully than he have do hitherto for he have so to speak prove he helpfulness he might be a idiot but he could lift weir stone into they place there they be she say and oh dear one of they have get loose there ought to be fourteen and there be only thirteen good heaven you must have eye like a hawk 's she laugh oh no i be use to it that be all now where can it be i think all the fence be mend i must find it stop he say at any rate i can find a cow -- bullock -- steer let I go you wait here he ride off as he speak and she pull up the big chestnut and look after he once more the question rise to perplex she : why have he come why be he ride about the dale with she counting sheep wade in the stream lifting weir stone and herd cattle it seem to be so strange so inexplicable and as she follow he with she eye he grace and strength be impressed upon she and she dwell upon they dreamily be there many such man in the world of which she know so little or be he one alone and unique and how good how pleasant it be to have he with she to talk to she to help she she have often long for a brother and have picture one like this strong and handsome with frank eye and smile lip -- someone upon whom she could lean to whom she could go when she be in trouble a shout awake she from she reverie and look up she see the miss steer force its way through a hedge on top of a bank stafford be ride after it at a easy canter and come straight for the bank the steer plunge through the hedge and flounder through the wide ditch and ida head it and drive it towards the rest of the herd then she turn in she saddle to warn stafford of the ditch but as she turn he be close upon the bank and she see the big hunter rise for the leap a doubt as to how he would land rise in she mind and she swing rupert round and as she do so she see the hunter crash through the hedge stumble at the ditch and fall lurch forward on its edge no man alive could have keep he seat and stafford come off like a stone throw from a catapult and lay face downward in the long wet grass something like a hot iron shoot through ida 's heart and send she face white and she ride up to he and fling herself from rupert and knelt beside the prostrate form he lay quite still and she know quite well what have happen : that he have fall on he head and stunned himself she remember at that moment that she herself have once so fall but the remembrance do nothing to soften she present anxiety she kneel beside he and lift he head on she knee and he white face smite she accusingly he be still motionless so long that she begin to fear -- be he dead she ask herself the question with a heavy pulsation of the heart with a sense of irrevocable loss if he be dead then -- then -- what have she lose tremble in every limb she lay she hand upon he heart it beat but slowly reluctantly she look round she with a sense of helplessness she have never be place in such a position before not far from she be a mountain rill and she run to it with unsteady step and soak she handkerchief in it and bath the white smooth forehead even at that moment she notice half unconsciously the clear-cut patrician feature the delicate line of the handsome face he have come to this mishap in he attempt to help she he be die perhaps in she service a thrill run through she a thrill that move she as by a uncontrollable impulse to bend still lower over he so that she lip almost touch he unconscious one they nearness the intent gaze of she eye now dark as violet seem to make themselves feel by he seem by some mysterious power to call he back from the shadow-land of unconsciousness he move and open he eye she start and the color flood she face as if she lip have quite touch he and she eye grow heavy as breathing painfully she wait for he to entirely recover he intelligence and to speak the steer he say at last feebly she moisten she lip and look away from he as if she be afraid lest he should see what be in she eye the steer be all right but -- but you he force a laugh oh i be all right too he say he look around hazily i must have come a smasher over that bank then he see that he be lie with he head upon she knee and with a hot flush the man 's shame for he weakness in the presence of a woman he struggle into a sit posture and look at she look at she with the force cheerfulness of a man who have come a unforeseen unexpected cropper of the first magnitude it be my fault you -- you be right about the horse : he ought not to have slip -- where 's my hat oh here it be the horse be not lame i hope no she say set she tooth in she great effort to appear calm and unmoved he be stand beside rupert -- she have get thus far when she voice break and she turn she face away quickly but not so quickly that he do not see she exceed pallor the heavy droop of the lid the sweep of the dark lash on she white cheek why -- what be the matter miss heron he ask anxiously and with all a man 's obtuseness _ you _ do not happen to come to grief in any way i do not fall on you -- or anything i -- she try to laugh try to laugh scornfully for indeed she be fill with scorn for this sudden inexplicable weakness a weakness which have never assail she before in all she life a weakness which fill she breast with rage but from under the closed lid two tear creep and roll down she cheek and against she will she make confession of this same foolish weakness it be nothing : i be very foolish -- but i -- i think you be badly hurt -- for the moment that you might even be -- kill he stagger to he foot and catch she hand and hold it look at she with that look in a man 's eye which be stronger and fiercer than fire and yet softer than water the look which go straight to a woman 's heart and you care -- care so much he say in a voice so low that she could scarcely hear it hush by the awe and wonder of passion she try to withdraw she hand bite she lip set they tightly in she battle for calmness and she old _ hauteur _ and indifference but he hold the small hand firmly feel it quiver and tremble see the violet eye raise to he with a troubled wonder in they and she name spring to he lip : ida he breathe chapter xiv ida the name have spring from he lip from he heart almost unconsciously it do not seem strange to he for he know as he speak it that he have call she so in he thought that it have hover on he lip ever since he have hear it but to she -- who shall describe the subtle emotion which thrill through a girl 's heart when she hear for the first time from a strange man 's lip the name whose use hitherto have be reserve for she kith and kin she stand erect but with she head bent she eye fix on the ground the name he voice ringing in she ear she heart be beat almost painfully as if with weight of a novel kind of fear that yet be not altogether fear stafford look at she with the man 's the lover 's eagerness but she face tell he nothing she be so ignorant of the very a b c of love that there be no start of surprise no word or movement which might guide he but he instant thought be that she be offend angry forgive I he say you be angry because i call you -- ida it be wrong and presumptuous but i have learn to think of you by you name -- and it slip out be you very angry ah you know why i call you so do not you know that -- i love you she raise she eye for a moment but do not look at he they be fix dreamily on the great hill in the distance then droop again and she brow come together she lip straighten with a still more marked expression of trouble doubt and wonder i love you he say with the deep note of a man 's passion in he voice i do not mean to tell you to speak -- i do not know until just now how it be with I : you see i be tell you everything the whole truth you will listen to I for she have make a movement of turn away a slow heavy gesture as if she be encumber by chain as if she be under some spell from which she could not wake i will tell you everything at the risk of make you angry at the risk of you -- send I away he pause for a moment as if he be choose he word with a care that spring from he fear lest he should indeed rouse she anger and -- lose she the first day i see you -- you remember as if she could forget she know as he ask the question that no trifling detail of that first meeting be forget that every word be engraven on she memory when i see you ride down the hill i think i have never see any girl so beautiful so lovely -- the color rise slowly to she face but die away again : the least vain of woman be move when a man tell she she be beautiful -- in he eye at any rate and when you speak to I i think i have never hear so sweet a voice and if i have that there have never be one that i so long to hear again you be not with I long only a few minute but when i leave you and trump over the hill to the inn i could not get you out of my mind i wonder who you be and whether i should see you again the horse move and instinctively she look over she shoulder towards they they will not go : they be quite quiet he say wait -- ah wait for a few minute i have a feeling that if i let you go i shall not see you again and that would -- that would be more than i could bear that night at the inn the landlord tell I about you of course he have nothing but praise and admiration for you -- who would have any other but he tell I of the lonely life you lead of the care you take of you father of you devotion and goodness and the picture of you live at the great silent house without friend or companion -- well it haunt I i could see it all so plainly -- i who be not usually quick at see thing as a rule i be not impress by woman -- howard say i be cold and bored -- perhaps he be right but i could not get you out of my mind i feel that i want to see you again he pause again as if the state of mind he be describe be a puzzle to himself -- pause and frown i leave the inn and start up the road -- i suppose i want to get a glimpse of the house in which you live yes that must have be it and then all at once i see you i remember the frock you wear that night -- you look like a angel a spirit standing there in the moonlight the most beautiful woman i have ever see be you angry with I for say so do not be for i have get to tell you everything and -- and -- it be difficult he be silent a moment she head be still down-bent she small white hand hang at she side she be quite motionless but for the slow rhythmic rise and fall of she bosom when you come to I when you speak to I my heart leap as if -- well as if something good have happen to I -- something that have never happen before when i go away the picture of you stand at the door wave you hand go with I and -- stay with I i could not get you out of my mind -- could think of nothing else even in the meeting with my father whom i have not see for so long the thought of you keep with I i try to get rid of it -- to forget you but it be of no use : sleep and wake you -- _ you be with I _ he voice grow almost harsh in its intensity and the hand that have hang so stilly beside she close on the skirt of she dress in she effort to keep the hot blush from she face when i ride out the next day it be only with the hope of see you it seem to I there be only one thing i want : to see you again to look into you eye to hear you speak all that i have hear about you -- well i dwelt upon it and i feel that i must help you it seem as if fate -- chance -- oh i do not know what to call it -- have _ send _ I to help you and when i see you -- ah well i can not expect you to understand what i feel he stop again as if he himself be try to understand it the feeling that fate have something to do with it -- you see it be quite by chance i start fishing that afternoon that i see you at the house -- give I courage to ask you to let I help you it sound ridiculous to you -- of course it do -- but if you only know how much it mean to I it mean that i should see you again perhaps every day for -- for a long time : ah well it mean just life and death to I and now -- he breath come fast he eye dwell upon she with passionate eagerness but he force himself to speak calmly than he might not frighten she from he side might not lose she -- now the truth have come upon I quite suddenly it be just now when i see that

that should explain this great mystery this wonderful thing that have happen to she at last with a singular gesture so girlish so graceful that it make he long still more intensely to take she in he arm she say in a low voice : i do not know -- no i do not want you to touch I please he hand fall to he side i can not answer you it be so -- so sudden no one have ever speak to I as you have do -- he laugh from mere excess of joy for she pure innocence she unlikeness in she ignorance of love and all pertain to it to the woman he know make the charm of she well-nigh maddening to think that he should be the first man to speak of love to she i be not angry -- ought i to be yes i suppose so we be almost stranger -- have see so little of each other they say that love all true love come at

dawn she smile at he with languid approval as if he be some pay jester and go into the breakfast-room there be other there beside lady clansford -- most of they the young people -- it be alas only the young who can sleep through the bright hour of a summer 's morn -- and a discussion on the program of the day be be carry on with a babel of voice and much laughter you shall decide for we miss falconer exclaim one of the young man whose only name appear to be bertie for he be always address as and speak of by it it be a toss-up between a drive and a turn on the lake in the electric launch _ i _ propose a sail but there seem to be a confirm and general scepticism as to my yachting capacity and lady plaistow say she do not want to be drown before the end of the season what would you like to do sit somewhere in the shade with a book she reply promptly but slowly there be a shout of laughter that be just what mr howard reply say bertie complainingly oh mr howard everyone know that he be

it would be all ready she shake she head as she help herself to a couple of strawberry no thanks she say with she musical drawl i know what that mean you drift into the middle of the lake or the river the wind drop and you sit in a scorching sun and get a headache please leave I out i shall stick to my original proposal perhaps if you do not drown anyone this time i may venture with you another day she lean back and smile at they under she lid as the discussion flow and ebb round she with a air of placid contempt and wonder at they excitement and presently murmur something to lady clansford who as chaperone and deputy hostess be try to coax they into some decision she rise and go out to the terrace there lie back in a deck-chair in a corner screen from any possible draught by the glass verandah be mr howard with one of sir stephen 's priceless havana between he lip a french novel in he hand and a morning paper across he knee he rise as she approach and check a sigh of resignation

to my cigar say so if you do and -- you 'll go off to some other nook she put in no i like it he eye shone with keen appreciation : this girl be not only a beauty -- which be almost common nowadays -- but witty which be rare thanks would you like the paper do not hesitate if you would i be not read it i never do i keep it there so that i can put it over my face if i feel like sleep -- which i generally do she decline the paper with a gesture of she white hand no i would rather talk which mean that you be to talk and i be to listen : will it exhaust you too much to tell I where the rest of the people be i leave a party in the breakfast-room squabbling over the problem how to kill time but where be the other my father for instance he be in the library with baron wirsch mr griffenberg and the other financier they be doubtless engage in some mystic rite connect with the worship of the golden calf rite in which the word ` share ' ` stock ' ` diamond ' ` concession ' appear at frequent interval i suppose you father have join they be a member of the all-powerful sect of money-worshipper she shrug she shoulder i suppose so and mr orme -- be he one of they she ask with elaborate indifference howard smile cynically stafford no all that he know about money be the art of spend it and what he do not know about that be not worth know it slip through he finger like water through a sieve and one of those mystery which burden my existence be how he always manage to have some for a friend up a tree be he so generous then she ask with a delicate yawn behind she hand howard nod and be silent for a moment then he say musingly : you have get on my favorite subject -- stafford -- miss falconer and i warn you that if i go on i shall bear you well i can get up and go away she say languidly he be a friend of yours i suppose by the way do you know that he stop those ridiculous horse last night and probably save my life for goodness sake do not let he hear you say that or even guess that you think it he say with a affectation of alarm stafford would be inexpressibly annoyed he hate a fuss even more than most englishman and would take it very unkindly if you do not let a little thing like that pass unnoticed oh yes i be he greatest friend i do not think -- slowly and contemplatively -- that there be anything he would not do for I or anything i would not do for he -- except get up early -- go out in the rain -- oh it be not true i be only brag he break off with a groan i have do both and shall do they whenever he want I to i be a poor creature miss falconer a martyr on the altar of friendship she say mr orme must be very irresistible he be he assent with a air of profound melancholy stafford have the extremely unpleasant knack of get everybody to do what he want it be very disgusting but it be true that be why he be so general a favorite why if you walk into any drawing-room and ask who be the most popular man in london the immediate and unanimous reply would be ` stafford orme ' she settle the cushion a little more comfortably you mean amongst man she say howard smile and eye she questioningly well -- i do not he reply drily she laugh a little scornfully oh i know the sort of man he be she say i have read and hear about they the sort of man who fall in love with every woman he meet ' a servant of dame ' howard lean back and laugh with cynical enjoyment you never be further out he say he flirt -- oh my aunt how he flirt -- but as to fall in love -- do you ever see a iceberg miss falconer she shake she head well it be one of the biggest the most beautiful fraud in the world when you meet one sailing along in the atlantic you think it one of the nicest sweetest thing you ever see : it be so dazzlingly bright with its thousand and one color glitter in the sunlight you quite fall in love with it and it look so harmless so entice that you be tempt to get quite close to it which no doubt be amusing to the iceberg but be slightly embarrassing for you for the iceberg be on you before you know it and -- and there be not enough left of you for a decent funeral that be stafford all the way he be so pleasant so frank so lovable that you think he quite harmless but while you be admire he confound ingratiating way while you be grow enthusiastic about he engaging trick -- he be the best rider the best dancer the best shot -- oh but you must have hear of he -- he be bear down upon you you heart go under and he -- ah well he just sail over you smile quite unconscious of have bring you to everlasting smash you be indeed a friend she say with languid irony oh you think i be give he away he say my dear miss falconer everybody know he every ball-room every tennis-court be strew with he wreck and all the time he do not know it but go he way crown with a modesty which be the marvel and the wonder of this most marvellous of age it sound like a hero out of one of ` ouida 's ' novel she remark as listlessly as before but behind she lowered lid she eye be shine with a singular brightness howard turn to she delightedly my dear miss falconer if you be a man i should ask to shake hand with you it so exactly describe he that be just what he be as handsome as the dew -- i beg you pardon -- as frank as a boy as gentle as a woman as staunch as a bull-dog as brave -- he would have stop a drayman 's team just as readily as yours last night -- and as invulnerable as that marble statue he point to a statue of adoni which stand whitely on the edge of the lawn and she raise she eye and look at it dreamily i could break that thing if i have a big hammer she say i daresay he say but can not break stafford honestly -- he look at she -- i wish you could why she ask turn she eye on he for the first time howard be silent for a moment then he look at she with a curious gravity because it would be good for he : because i be afraid for he afraid she echo yes he say with a nod some day he will run against something that will bring he to smash some woman -- but i beg you pardon do you know miss falconer that you have a dangerous way of lead one to speak the truth -- which one should never -- or very rarely -- do why on earth be i tell you all this about stafford orme she shrug she shoulder you be say ` some woman ' she say he give a sigh of resignation you be irresistible some woman who will be quite unworthy of he it be always the case the block of ice you can not smash with you biggest hammer be break into smithereens by a needle that be the peril before stafford -- but let we hope he will prove the exception to the rule and escape he be safe at present at any rate she though of the scene she have witness the girl sit sideways on stafford orme 's horse and she face flush for a instant be you sure she say quite he respond confidently i know all stafford 's flirtation great and small : if there be anything serious he would tell I and as he have not -- there be not she laugh the slow soft laugh which make howard think suddenly strangely of a sleepy tigress he have once watch in a rajah 's zoo as she lay bask in the sun : a thing of softness and beauty and -- death we have have a most amusing conversation mr howard she say i do not know when i have be so interested -- or so tempt tempt he look at she with a slow expectant smile oh yes she murmur turn she eye upon he with a half-mocking light in they you have forget that you have be talk to a woman i do not deny it he say it be the finest compliment i could pay you but -- after and that to a woman you account of you hero-friend be -- a challenge he nod and pause with he cigar half-way to he lip i be greatly tempt to accept it do you know she say he laugh do not : you 'll be vanquish be that too candid too -- brutal he say so brutal that i _ will _ accept it she say be that ring of yours a favorite i have have it ever since i can remember it be my mother 's he say rather gravely she hold out she hand upon which the costly gem glitter in the sunlight choose one to set against it she say quite quietly howard rouse for once from he sleepy cynicism meet she gaze with something like astonishment you mean -- he say in a low voice i mean that i be go to try to meet you iceberg you will play fair mr howard you will stand and look on and -- be silent he smile and lean back as if he have consider she strange audacious proposal and feel confident on my honor he say with a laugh you shall have fair play she laugh softly you have not choose my stake she say meaningly ah no pardon let I see he take she hand and examine the ring this -- i think it be the most valuable it do not matter she say you will not win it may i look at yours he extend he hand with a amuse laugh but without a smile she say : yes it be a quaint ring i like quaint thing i shall wear it on my little finger she drop he hand quickly for at that moment stafford ride round the bend of the drive he face be grave and almost stern in its preoccupation but he catch sight of they and raise he hat then turn he horse and ride up to the terrace good-morning stafford exclaim howard where have you be hallo anything happen you be coat all over with mud : have a fall he nod carelessly as he turn to the beautiful girl lie back now and look up at he handsome face with a air of languid indifference what a lovely day miss falconer where be all the other be you not go for a drive on the lake somewhere i have just be ask mr howard to take I for a row she say but he have refuse stafford laugh and glance at he watch i can quite believe it : he be the laziest wretch in existence if you 'll transfer the offer to I we 'll go after lunch by george there be the bell thanks she murmur and she rise with she slow grace i would better get into a appropriate costume mr howard what will you bet I that it do not rain before we start but you never bet you tell I not unless i be sure of win miss falconer he say significantly she look after stafford as he ride away to the stable nor i she retort with a smile as you will see chapter xvi when stafford and maude falconer go down to the lake after luncheon they find a party from the villa just embark on board one of the launch the air be fill with laughter and chatter and the little quay be bright with the white flannel of the man and the gay frock of the woman the party greet the two with a exuberant welcome and bertie call out to ask they if they be come on board perhaps you would rather go on the launch miss falconer say stafford but she shake she head no thanks she say languidly i hate crowd of that kind i would rather stick to we original proposition it will bear I less but perhaps you would rather join they be it likely say stafford with a smile as he sign to the man to bring up a skiff now let I make you as comfortable as i can we ought to have have a gondola he add as he hand she to the seat in the stern she lean back with she sunshade over she shoulder and stafford as he slip off he blazer and row out towards the center of the lake look at she with unconscious admiration she be simply perfectly dress in a yachting costume of white and pale-blue which set off to the fullest advantage she exquisite complexion and she red-gold hair but it be admiration of the coldest kind for even at that moment he be think of the girl in the well-worn habit the girl he love with a passion that make he slightest thought of she a psalm of worship and maude though she appear half asleep like a beautiful wild animal basking in the warmth of the sun glance at he now and again and note the strength and grace of he figure the almost grecian contour of the handsome face she have make she wager with howard on the spur of the moment prompt by the vanity of a woman pique by the story of stafford 's indifference to she sex but as she look at he she wonder how a woman would feel if she fall in love with he but she have no fear for herself there be a coldness in she nature which have hitherto guard she from the fever which man call love and she think herself quite secure there would be amusement triumph in make he love she in win she wager with that cynical mr howard who boast of he friend 's invulnerability and when she have conquer and gratify she vanity -- ah well it would be easy to step aside and bring the curtain down upon she triumph and stafford 's discomfiture she would wear that mr howard 's ring and every time she look at it it should remind she of she conquest stafford row on in silence for some minute he beautiful companion do not seem to want he to talk and certainly show no desire to talk herself so he give himself up to thinking of ida -- and wish that it be she who be sit opposite he there instead of this girl with the face of a grecian goddess with the lustrous hair of a houri at last feeling that he ought to say something he remark as he gaze at the marvellous view : very beautiful be not it she raise she eye and let they wander from the glittering water to the glorious hill yes i suppose it be i be afraid i do not appreciate scenery as much as other people do perhaps it be because one be always expect to fall into rapture over it do that shock you i be afraid i shock most people the fact be i have be bring up in a circle which have teach I to loathe sentiment they be always gush about they feeling but the only thing they care for be money that ought to have make you loathe money say stafford with a smile and a certain kind of interest indeed it be difficult not to feel interested in this beautiful girl with the face and the form of a goddess and apparently as small a capacity of emotion oh no she say languidly on the contrary it show I the value of money i see that if i have not be rich the daughter of a rich man i should have be of no account in they eye they be always profess to love I but i be quite aware that it be because i be rich enough to be able to buy pleasure for they unpleasant kind of people remark stafford no just the average she say coolly nearly all man and woman be alike -- worldly selfish self-seeking look at my father she go on as coolly as before he think of nothing but money he have spend he life fight scramble struggle for it and look at yours -- oh hold on say stafford laughing but redden a little you be very much mistaken if you think my father be that kind of man she smile why everybody have some story of he -- what shall i call it -- acuteness sharpness and of the wonderful way in which he have always get what he want i do not want to be offensive mr orme but i be afraid both we father be in the same category and that both would sacrifice anything or anyone to gain they end stafford laugh again you be altogether wrong miss falconer he say i happen to know that my governor be one of the most generous and tender-hearted of man and that whatever he have gain it be by fair means and by no sacrifice of other she shrug she shoulder i envy you faith in he but then you be a very enviable man i be tell as how asked stafford pretty here be not it here be one of those beastly steamer come : they spoil the lake but they be very convenient i suppose she glance at the big steamer puff towards they obtrusively and send a trail of smoke across the green and violet of the hill oh i be tell you be the most popular man in london that you have the world at you foot that you be only wait to see which duchess you prefer to throw you handkerchief to -- stafford color what rot -- i beg you pardon miss falconer of course i know you be only chaff I be not it true -- about the duchess i mean she ask so coolly so indifferently that stafford be compel to take she seriously nary a word he say brightly then with a sudden gravity : if you happen to hear such nonsense again miss falconer you can if you care to contradict it flatly i be not in the least likely to marry a duchess indeed i would not marry the highest and greatest of they if she would have I which be highly improbable do you mean to say that you have no ambition that you would marry for -- love she ask stafford stop rowing for a moment and look at she grimly what on earth else should i marry for he ask would not you before she could answer the steamer come abreast of they and so close that the swell from its screw set the slight narrow skiff dancing and plunge on the wave maude utter a faint cry and lean forward and stafford fear she be go to rise stretch out he hand and touch she knee force she into she seat again and keep she there until the swell have subside the color flood she face at the pressure of he strong hand which be like a steel weight and she catch she breath then as he take he hand away and resume rowing he say : i beg you pardon i be afraid you be go to get up -- a girl i once have in a boat do so and we upset the boat be very small she say in a low voice almost one of apology oh it be all right so long as you sit still and keep you head he say it could ride over twice as big a swell as this she look at he from under she lowered lid with a new expression in she face a faint tremor on she lip and as if she could not meet he eye she glance back with a affectation of interest at the steamer as she do so something drop from it into the lake what be that she say something fall overboard eh a man do you mean he ask stop oh no something small a parcel somebody 's lunch perhaps he say and he row on she lean back she eye downcast she still seem to feel that strong irresistible pressure of he hand under which she have be unable to move there ought to be a echo somewhere here he say as they come opposite one of the hill and he give the australian coo-ee in a clear ringing voice which the echo send back in a musical imitation how true it be she say and she open she lip and sing a bar or two of the elsie song stafford listen to the echo which be almost as soft and sweet as the girl 's note what a wonderful voice you have he say almost unconsciously i never hear a sweeter what be that you sing that thing of wagner 's she reply and quite naturally she begin the air and sing it through stafford let the boat drift and lean upon the oar he eye fix on she face a rapt and very eloquent admiration in he own ah -- beautiful he say in a low voice what a delight it must be to you to be able to sing like that i can understand a whole theater cry over that song sing as you sing it she glance at he with a affectation of languid amusement but she be watch he intently that be not the best in the opera she say i like this better and she sing the swan song sing it so low that he lean forward to catch the note which flow like silver from she soft red lip and when she finish it he draw a long breath and still lean forward look at she thank you thank you he say with so much of admiration and gratitude in he voice that as if to apologise for it he say : i be fond of music but i be forget you tea shall we pull back to the ferry hotel and get some i be in you hand she reply languidly he turned-the boat and pull back along the center of the lake in silence suddenly she bent forward there be something in the water she say something alive it be a -- yes it be a dog he say that be what you see drop over the steamer by george the poor little chap look in distress : seem as if he be nearly do can you steer he ask sharply oh yes she reply languidly why because i be go for he and it will help I if you can steer straight for he he look nearly play out why should you trouble -- it be a long way off it will be drown before you can get to it she say i 'll have to go for it anyway he say cheerfully and he begin to row hard distance be deceptive on a lake and the dog be farther off than they think but stafford put he back into it as hard as he have do in he racing day and maude falconer lean back and watch he with interest and something even stronger than interest in she mask eye he have turn up the sleeve of he flannel shirt and the muscle on he arm be stand out under the strain he lip be set tightly and there be the man 's frown of determination on he brow it have go down : it be no use she say you may as well stop and rest he look over he shoulder no he have come up again he exclaim : it be noticeable that he call the dog he while she speak of it as it we shall get he in time keep the boat straight the word be utter in a tone of command and they move she as the touch of he hand have do and she set she mind upon the task as she have never before set it upon anything reach well forward pull with the long steady stroke of the practice oarsman stafford send the boat along like a arrow and presently he drive it up to the spot where the dog strive in its death straggle it be a tiny black-and-tan terrier and stafford as he look over he shoulder see the great eye turn to he with a piteous entreaty that make he heart ache turn the boat -- quick he cry and as the skiff slide alongside the dog he

girl who watch he covertly before pay any attention to he own tea i wonder whether you could stand my little man he say and he put the terrier on the ground it stand upright and shiver for a moment

up the stair she look over the rail and see stafford 's tall figure stride down the hall he be softly pull the terrier 's ear and talk to it in the language dog understand and love and when she sink into a chair in she room he face with its manly tenderness be still before she he deep musical voice with its note of protection and succor still ring in she ear she sit quite motionless for a minute or two then she rise and go to the glass and look at herself a long intent look yes i be beautiful she murmur not with the self-satisfaction of vanity but with a calculate note in she voice be i -- be i beautiful enough then she swing away from the glass with the motion which remind howard of a tigress and set she tooth hard laugh with self-scorn but with something also of fear in the laugh i be a fool she mutter it can not be true so soon so suddenly oh i can not be such a fool chapter xvii if everybody be not enjoy himself at the villa it certainly be not the fault of the host sir stephen orme howard as he draw he chair up beside stafford when the lady have leave the room after dinner and the gentleman have begin to glance longingly at the rare chateau claret and the windermere port make a remark to this effect : upon my word staff it be the most brilliant house-party which i have ever join and as to you father in he character of host -- well word fail to express my admiration stafford glance at he father at the head of the table and nod sir stephen have be the life and soul and spring of the dinner talk fashionable gossip to lady fitzharford on one side of he and a giddy girl of twenty on the other exchange badinage with bertie and tell deeply interesting story to the man and he be now drag reluctant laughter from the grim baron wirsch and the almost grimmer griffenberg as he see with one eye that the wine be circulate and with the other that no one be be overlook or allow to drop into dullness a most marvellous man nearly all the morning he be closet with the financier in the afternoon he go for a ride with lady clansford he be in attendance at the solemn function of afternoon tea he play croquet -- and play it well -- at half-past five at six i see he walk round the grounds with the efford and the fitzharford and now he be laugh and talk with the _ abandon _ of a boy of five-and-twenty while the boy of five-and-twenty sit here as grave and silent as if he have be work like a horse -- or a sir stephen orme -- instead of fool about the lake with the most beautiful woman in the party and he friend have spend the day in a deck-chair on the terrace retort stafford at any rate i have be out of mischief say howard then he remember he wager with maude falconer and add rather remorsefully : at least i hope so by the way do not you echo my expression of opinion that miss falconer be the most beautiful woman here -- or elsewhere stafford wake from the reverie into which he nearly always drop when howard be talk and nod indifferently oh yes she be lovely of course how good of you how kind and gracious retorted howard ironically so my prince deign to approve of she and you also condescend to admit that she be -- er -- rather clever i daresay say stafford i have see so little of she she seem to I rather _ blas _ and cold howard nod yes but the worst of it be you can not count upon that kind of girl : they be apt to warm up sometimes and quite unexpectedly : and when they do they -- well they boil like a geyser or a volcano and then -- well then it be wise to get out of reach i once know a woman who be consider to be as cold as charity -- or a rich relation -- but who catch fire one day and burn up the man who ignite she of course this be my delicate way of say : ` beware oh my prince ' stafford smile miss falconer 's nature be a matter of profound indifference to he there be only one woman on whom he could bestow a thought and he be think of she now wonder when he should see she whether he might dare to tell she of he love again to ask she for she answer once or twice he father look across at he and nod and smile as if he love to see he and want to speak to he and stafford smile and nod back as if he understand when the man rise to go to the drawing-room sir stephen catch he up at the door and lay a hand upon he arm happy dear boy he ask in a low voice full of affection i have see scarcely anything of you no no i be not complain it be understand that you be to have a free hand -- but -- but i have miss you never mind this crowd will have go presently and then -- ah then we 'll have a jolly time to ourselves thing be go well he add with a significant smile as he glance at wirsch and griffenberg who well-fed and comfortable be in front of they i be glad sir say stafford sir stephen smile but check a sigh and a shrug of the shoulder yes my little scheme be flourish but -- he look at the financier again -- they be rather a hard team to drive as stafford enter the drawing-room he hear lady clansford enquire for miss falconer we want she to sing mr orme and i can not find she i think she be on the terrace say bertie who always seem to know where everybody be stafford go out by one of the window and see maude falconer pacing up and down at the end of the terrace she be superbly dress and as he look at she he involuntarily admire the grace of she movement mr falconer be walk with bent head and hand behind he back but now and again he look at she sideways with he sharp eye stafford do not like to interrupt they and withdraw to the other end of the terrace with a cigarette to wait till they join he young orme have come out to look for you say mr falconer without turn he head i know she say though she also have not turn they want I to sing i will go in directly you have not answer my question father be sir stephen very rich or be all this only sham i have hear you say so often that display very often only cover poverty falconer eye she curiously why do you want to

money to help he win it and be you join he in the game she ask he look at she with surprise there be a note in she voice which he have never hear before a note which convey to he the fact that she be no longer a girl but a woman upon my soul i do not know why you ask well well -- she have repeat the impatient gesture i have not make up my mind yet he want I to join he i could be of service to he on the other hand i could -- yes get in he way for i know some of the point of the game he be play yes i could help he -- or spoil he and which be you go to do she ask in a low voice she eye veil she lip draw straight falconer laugh grimly i do not know it all depend which would you do he ask half sarcastically she be silent for a moment then she say : you know sir stephen some time ago -- year ago father falconer nod i do he say shortly and you be friend and you quarrel he look at she with a air of surprise i see you both when you stand opposite each other after the carriage accident she say coolly i be not blind and i be not particularly stupid it do not strike I at the time that there have be anything wrong between you but i have since see you look at sir stephen and -- you have a expressive face sometimes oh my father he grin grimly you appear to keep you eye open maude yes there be a row between we and there be a grudge -- -- which you mean to pay off she say as impassively as if they be speak of the merest triviality which i could pay off -- gratify if i like he admit how she ask he do not reply but glance at she sideways and bit at the cigar which he have stop to light shall i tell you if i be a man and i want revenge upon such a man as sir stephen orme what i should do father she ask in a low voice and look straight before she as if she be meditate you can if you like what would you do he reply with a touch of sarcastic amusement she look round she and over she shoulder the window near they be close stafford with he cigarette be too far off to overhear they if i be a man rich and powerful as you be and i owe another a grudge i would not rest night or day until i have get he into my power whether i mean to exact my revenge or not i would wait and work and scheme and plot until i have he at my mercy so that i could say ` see now you get the better of I once you play I false once but it be my turn now ' he should sue for mercy and i would grant it -- or refuse it -- as it please I but he should feel that he be in my power that my hand be finer than he my strength greater he shoot a glance at she and he great rugged face grow line and stern where do

with which he be completely familiar what the devil do you mean he mutter if i be a man in you place i would have the great sir stephen at my foot to make or to break as i pleased i would never rest until i could be able to say : ` you be a great man in the world 's eye but i be you master you be my puppet and you have to dance to my music whether the tune be a dead march or a jig ' that be what i should do if i be a man but i be only a girl and it seem to I nowadays that man have more of the woman in they than we have he stop and stare at she in the moonlight a dark frown on he face he eye heavy with doubt and suspicion look here my girl he say you be show up in a new light to-night you be talk as you mother use to talk and you be not do it without a purpose what be it what grudge can you a mere girl who have only known he for a couple of day have against sir stephen she smile let we say that i be only concerned for my father 's wounded pride and honor she say or let we say that i _ have _ a game of my own to play and that i be ask you to help I while you gratify you own desire for revenge will you help I tell I -- tell I what you game be good lord -- with a scowl fancy you have a game : it be -- it be ridiculous almost as ridiculous as call I a girl and expect to see I play with a doll or a hoop she return calmly but you need not reply i can see you mean to do it like a

with cushion three or four time but he would persist on get on again so he 'll have to stay i suppose be you always so good-natured she ask in a low voice or do you reserve all you tenderness of heart for dog and horse -- as mr howard declare mr howard be too often a ass remark stafford with a smile you shall choose you song as a reward for you exertion this afternoon she say as he lead she to the piano most of the man in the crowd wait eagerly for the exquisite voice would have be move to the heart 's core by she tone and the expression in she usually cold eye but stafford be clothe in the armor of he great love and only inclined he head thanks : anything you like he say with the proper amount of gratitude she shoot a glance at he and sink into the music-seat languidly but a moment afterwards as if she could not help herself she be sing a tuscan love-song with a subdue passion which thrill even the _ blas _ audience cluster round she it thrill stafford but only with the desire to be near ida a desire that become irresistible and when she have finish he leave the room catch up he hat and overcoat and go out of the house as he do so mr falconer walk past he into the smoking-room mr griffenberg be alone there seat in a big arm-chair with a cigar as black as a hat and as long as a penholder falconer wheel a chair up to he and in he blunt fashion say : you be in

of do business at the moment stafford leave the villa ida be stand by the window in the drawing-room of heron hall on the table beside she lay a book which she have throw down with a gesture of impatience she be too restless to read or to work and the intense quietude of the great house weigh upon she with the weight of a tomb all day since she have leave stafford he word of passionate love have haunt she they sing in she ear even as she speak to she father or jessie or the dog who follow she about with wistful eye as if they be ask she what ail she and as if they would help she he love she she have say it to herself a thousand time all through the long afternoon the drag evening he love she it be so strange so incredible they have only meet three or four time they have say so little

they that be he want she to be he wife to _ give herself _ to he to be with he always never to leave he the strangeness the suddenness of the thing overwhelm she so that she could not think of it calmly he have ask she to think of it to decide to give he a answer why could she not she have always hitherto know she own mind if anyone have ask she a question about the estate about the farm she have know what to answer important as the question might have be but now she seem as if she mind be paralyze as if she could not decide be it because she have never think of love because she have never dream that anyone would love she so much as to want to have she by he side for all he life as she look through the window at the moonlight on the lawn she think of he call up the vision of he tall graceful figure and handsome face -- yes he be handsome she know but she have scarcely give a think to he face and only feel that it be good to have he near she to hear he talk in he deep voice break sometimes by the short laugh which sound almost boyish it have be good to have he near she -- but then she have be so lonely have see so few man -- scarcely any at all -- suppose when she meet he next she say no tell he that she could not love he and he go away leave she forever would she be sorry she turn away from the window suddenly nearly stumble over donald who be lie at she foot he

the library there be no sound in the house to drown the voice the passionately plead voice which ring in she ear i must go out she say i shall be able to think in the air shall be able to decide she catch up a shawl and fling it carelessly over she head quite unconscious that the fleecy rose-coloured wool make a exquisite frame for the girlish loveliness of she face and open the door go slowly down the broken lichen-covered step the two dog follow at she heel she draw in the keen but balmy air with a long breath and look up at the moon now a yellow crescent in the starry sky and something in the beauty of the night something subtly novel thrill she with a strange sense of throb pulse joy and happiness underneath which lurk as subtle a fear and dread the fear and dread of those who stand upon the threshold of the unknown who in pass that threshold enter a world of strange thing which they never more may leave love : what be it do she feel it oh if she could only tell what should she say to he when she meet he and when should she meet he perhaps he have come to regret he avowal to she have be wearied and disappointed by she coldness and would not come again at the think she heart contract as if at the touch of a icy hand but the next moment it leap with a suffocating sense of mystery of half-fearful joy for she see he come across the lawn to she and hear she name speak as it have never yet be speak except by he and she stand still as a statue as he hold out he hand and look into she eye murmur she name again ida chapter xviii ida it be the lover 's cry of appeal the

think of it she go on with innocent candor but it would be the same if you be of the highest rank he do not want I to leave he and if he be less anxious to keep you he would not give you to I who be

little closer and she small hand close a little more tightly on he arm and you would not give I up refuse to see I even if you father withhold he consent would you ida he ask she look straight before

girl singularly bless amongst woman jessie and jason even the bovine william who be repute the stupidest man in the dale notice the change in she notice the touch of color that be so quick to mount to

be like a mole burrow amongst he book and gloat secretly over the box which he conceal at the approach of footstep the opening of a door and the sound of a voice in a distant part of the house but though the servant remark the change in they beloved mistress they do not guess at its cause for by chance rather than design none of they have see ida and stafford together and yet they meet daily sometimes stafford would ride over from brae wood and meet she by the river there be a hollow there so deep that it hide not only themselves but the horse and here they would sit hand in hand or more often with he arm round she and she small shapely head with its soft but roughen hair upon he breast sometimes he would row across the lake and they would walk side by side along the bank and screen by the tree in which the linnet and the thrush sing the song which make a lover 's litany at other -- and these be the sweetest meeting of all for they come in the soft and stilly night when all nature be hush as if under the spell of the one great passion -- he would ride or walk over after dinner and they would sit in the ruin archway of the old chapel and talk of they blank past the magic present and the future which be to hold nothing but happiness love grow fast under such condition and the love of these two mortal grow to gigantic proportion absorb the life of both of they to

head as if he have put the question in word yes she say i shall die you remember my mother i shall follow she -- he utter a low hoarse cry and catch she hand and hold they then he fling they from he and stand with he back to she say thickly as if every word be force from he : you shall have you way you always have have like you mother before you -- you always will but mark my word : you 'll live to curse the hour you force I to do this she draw a long breath -- it be almost a sigh -- of relief and she lay she hand on he arm and kiss he on the forehead i 'll risk that she say with a tremulous laugh there be a silence for a moment then she say calmly : you will play you part carefully father you will let sir stephen think that stafford desire it : you will be careful he turn upon she with a oath you would best leave it to I he say savagely i 'll try and save you from shame all i can for god 's sake go and leave I alone chapter xxi while stafford be dress for dinner that night and wonder whether even if he should get a opportunity of speak to he father it would be wise to tell he of ida howard knock at the door stafford tell he to come in and send measom away and howard who be already dress sink into a easy-chair and survey he friend with bland approval a white tie to-night staff anything on yes there be a dance reply stafford rather absently what would he father say and do would he go over to heron hall the next morning yes that be what he would do a dance be that all from the undercurrent of suppress excitement animate most of the guest i should think it be something more important have you notice the air of suspense of fluctuate hope and doubt triumph and despair which have characterize we noble band of financier during the last few day stafford shake he head no i have not notice 'em particularly in fact i scarcely see they or do more than exchange the usual greeting they seem to I to move and look and speak just about as usual howard smile to be young and happy and free from care be to be blind : puppy for instance be blind stafford grin that be complimentary anyhow what do you think be up i think sir stephen be go to pull off he great event to make he grand _ coup _ say howard so you find a black-and-tan terrier improve a dress-coat by lie on it tiny have coil himself up on that garment which measom have lay ready on the chair and be lie apparently asleep but with he large eye fix on he beloved master oh he be a peculiar little beast and be always get where he should not be hi young man get off my coat he pick the terrier up and throw he softly on the bed but tiny get down at once and curl himself up on the fur mat by stafford 's foot seem to be fond of you : strange dog say howard yes i think sir stephen 's ` little scheme ' -- as if any scheme of he could be ` little ' -- have work out successfully and i should not be surprise if the financier have a meeting to-night and the float of the company be announce oh say stafford as he get into he coat yes i daresay it be all right the governor seem always to pull it off howard smile you talk as if a affair of thousand of thousand perhaps million be quite a bagatelle he say my dear boy do not you understand realize the importance of this business it be nothing less than a railway from -- stafford nod oh yes you tell I about it it be a very big thing i daresay but what puzzle I be why the governor should care to worry about it he have money enough -- no man have money enough say howard solemnly but no matter it be a waste of time to discuss philosophy with a man who have no mind above fox-hunting fishing pheasant-shooting and dancing by the way how many time do you intend to dance with the grecian goddess meaning -- say stafford miss falconer of course grecian goddess be not so common my dear stafford as to permit of more than one in a house-party i be sure i do not know reply stafford eye he with faint surprise what the devil make you ask I that howard eye the handsome face with cynical amusement pardon if i be impertinent but i assure you the question be be ask amongst themselves by all the woman in the house -- stafford stare at he and begin to frown with perplexity rather than anger my dear stafford i know that you be not possess of a particularly brilliant intellect but you surely possess sufficient intelligence to see that you attention to miss falconer be somewhat obvious what say stafford my attention to miss falconer -- be you chaff howard not in the least : it be usually too great a waste of time with you my dear boy : you do not listen and when you do half the time you do not understand no i be quite serious but perhaps i ought to have say she attention to you it would have be more correct stafford color look here old man he say if you think -- oh dash it all what nonsense it be miss falconer and i be very good friend and of course i like to talk to she -- she be so sharp almost as smart and clever as you be when she like to take the trouble and of course i like to hear she sing -- why my dear howard it be like listen to one of the big operatic swell but -- but to suggest that there be anything -- that -- there be any reason to warn I -- oh dash it come off it old man you be chaff not in the least but i do not intend any warning : in fact i be in honor bind to refrain from anything of the kind -- in honor bind say stafford howard almost blush oh it be nothing only a silly wager he say i can not tell you so do not enquire but all the same -- well there i will not say more if you be sure there be nothing between

twice with a girl or sit and talk to she for half a hour right say howard rise there be the bell as howard have say there be a air of suppress excitement about the people and it be not confine to the financier who cluster together in the hall and discuss and talk in undertone every now and then glance up the stair down which sir stephen would presently descend most of the other guest though they

's railway they be in a pleasant condition of excitement over the come dance stafford as he stand in the hall talk about the night 's program to bertie -- who have be elect by common and tacit consent master of the ceremony -- see maude falconer descend the stair she be even more exquisitely dress than usual and stafford hear some of the woman and man murmur admiringly and enviously as she sweep across the hall in she magnificent ball-dress she diamond for which she be famous glittering in she hair on she white throat and on she slender wrist the dress be a mixture of gray and black which would have look _ bizarre _ on anyone else less beautiful but its strange tint harmonise with she superb and classic class of beauty and she look like a vision of loveliness which might well dazzle the eye of the beholder she pause in she progress -- it might almost be call a triumphant one for the other woman 's look be eloquent of dismay -- and look at stafford with the slow half-dreamy smile which have come into she face of late when she speak to he have you see my father have he come down mr orme she ask no say stafford he look at she as a man do when he admire a woman 's dress and forget howard 's word of warning say : what a splendacious frock miss falconer do you like it i be glad she say i have my doubt but now -- she eye rest on he for a moment then she pass on i should not

be not without reason for to-night the artistically design and shaded electric lamp the beautiful room with they chaste yet effective decoration on which money have be lavish like water be see to they greatest advantage and the vayne the bannerdale and the local gentry generally exchange glance and murmured exclamation of surprise and admiration and wonder whether there could be any end to the wealth of a man who could raise such a palace in so short a time from the gallery of white-and-gold the famous band every man of which be a musician presently begin to send forth the sweet strain of a waldteufel waltz and stafford find lady clansford for the first dance though he have pay little attention to howard 's remark about maude falconer he remember they and he do not ask she for a dance

unsatisfactory : for what concern have stafford with the papers as they go through the hall they see the financier cluster together with a expectant air as if they be wait for the result of the arrival of the man by the special train and they stare at falconer and exchange glance as he and stafford pass they and go to the library door sir stephen 's voice come cheerily in response to stafford 's knock and stafford enter falconer follow he with bent head and the same heavy look sir stephen be sit at the table before a despatch box and he hold out he hand and utter a little cry of

if _ the scheme be successful you father will be a peer of the realm mr stafford he say drily with a emphasis on the if _ if _ echo sir stephen laughing and nod stafford could see by the brilliance of he eye the flush on he face that he be excite and be struggle with excitement if falconer nod at the despatch-case and with another banter laugh sir stephen open it and take out a large envelope he hold this for a moment poise between finger and thumb then he tear it open and take out a sheet of paper and turn he flash eye from the two man to the document he rise for a moment with the smile still on he face then they see it fade see the flush slowly disappear and in its place a dull gray steal over the face stafford startle go round to he and lay a hand on he shoulder what be the matter

of construct a railway in the most promising part of south africa -- sir stephen lean forward he head on he hand he eye fix on the heavy stolid face of the speaker the face which the keen hawk-like eye flash under the lowered lid with a gleam of power and triumph -- you father have reason to hope that he would acquire those land and rights he do not know that i have be wait for some year past to

and cover he face with he hand for a moment then he look up at stafford he be right it be he turn he have take it -- and with it every penny i possess it mean ruin -- complete ruin worse even than the loss of every penny for -- for -- i -- god help I -- can not afford to go into court and have the past rake up -- and he know it -- he know it stafford the sight of the old man 's anguish almost drive stafford mad have you no mercy sir he say to falconer grant that my father have injure you -- be not this rather too awful a revenge to exact i -- i -- i -- do not understand all that i have hear but

you that before i enter this house this afternoon i have resolve to have it but i hear something that induce I to change my mind sir stephen lean forward he eye fix eagerly on the speaker and stafford in he anxiety hold he breath and press he father 's shoulder encouragingly you hear something sir stafford ask as calmly as he could mr falconer be silent for a moment then he say : yes i hear that you be desirous of marry my daughter maude mr orme and i need not say that a man do not ruin he son-in-law there be a intense silence stafford stand as if he be turn to stone as if he be try to persuade himself that he have misunderstand the meaning of falconer 's word marry maude falconer -- he be he dream or be this man who stand regard he with cold glitter eye mad chapter xxii we do not nowadays strike attitude or ejaculate and swear when we be startle or shock stafford stand perfectly still still as a piece of stonehenge and gaze with a expressionless countenance at mr falconer that the man be indeed and in truth mad occur to he for a moment then he think there must be some mistake that mr falconer have make a blunder in the name and that it be a case of mistake he man but as the moment flee and the two elder man gaze at he as if expect he to speak he remember howard 's warn the color rush to he face and he eye drop merciful heaven be the man speak the truth when he say that he stafford be in love with maude falconer he face be hot and scarlet for a moment then it grow pale under the shame of the thought that he should have to correct the impression decline so to speak the imply honor sir stephen be the first to speak he have sink back in he chair but be now lean forward again he hand grip the table stafford he say still thickly but with the beginning of a note of relief in he voice i do not know this -- you do not tell I stafford turn to he helplessly what could he say -- before falconer the girl 's father you do not tell I but i do not complain my boy say sir stephen you be right to choose you own time -- young people like to keep they secret to themselves as long as possible falconer look from one to the other with a impassive countenance i feel that i be rather _ de trop _ he say that i have speak rather prematurely but my hand be force orme i want to set you mind at rest to show you that even if i hanker after revenge it be impossible under the circumstance he glance at stafford it be not the first time in history that the young people have play the part of peace-maker this be a kind of romeo and juliet business be not it i 'll leave you and mr stafford to talk it over he move to the door but with he hand upon it pause and look round at they again i ought to aid that like most modern father i be entirely in the hand of my daughter i can not go so far as to say orme that if i have be permit to choose i should have choose a son of yours for my son-in-law but you see maude do not give I the option the young people have take the bit between they tooth and bolt and it seem to I that the only thing we have to do be to sit tight and look as cheerful as possible oh one word more he add in a business-like tone of course i make over this concession to you orme just take the share i should have receive if you have win the game and i have only stand in as propose that be to say you will be in exactly the same position as if you have win all along the line -- as you think you have and with a nod which include father and son he go out stafford unconsciously draw back a little so that he be almost behind sir stephen who have cover he eye with he hand and sit perfectly motionless like a half-stunned man look back at some terrible danger from which he have only escape by the skin of he tooth then he drop he hand from he face and draw a long breath the kind of breath a man draw who have be battle with the wave and find himself on the shore exhaust but still alive stafford lay a hand on he shoulder and sir stephen start and look up at he as if he have forget he presence a flush as if of shame come upon the great financier 's face and he frown at the papers lie before he where they have drop from he hand what a escape stafford he say he voice still rather thick and with a tremor of excitement and even exhaustion in its usually clear and steady tone i be ashamed my boy that you should have be a witness to my defeat : it humiliate mortify I do not let that worry you father say stafford scarcely know what he say for the tumult in he brain the dread at he heart it be not the first defeat i have suffer in my life like other successful man i have know what it be to fall and i have laugh and get up and shake the dust off myself so to speak and go at the fight again all the harder and more determine because of the reverse but this -- this would have crush I utterly and forever do you mean that it would have ruin you completely father say stafford completely reply sir stephen in a low voice he head droop i have stake everything on this venture have stake even more than i possess i can not explain all the detail the ramification of the scheme which i have be work you could not understand they if i be to talk to you for a week suffice it that if i have fail to get this concession i should have be a utterly ruin man should have have to go through the bankruptcy court should have be leave without a penny and not only that : i should have drag a great many of the man of the friend who have trust to my ability who have believe in I into the same pit not only such man as griffenberg and wirsch and the belton but the plaistow the clansdale and the fitzharford they would have suffer with I would have consider themselves betray stafford draw a long breath there seem to he still a chance of save himself the girl he love above all -- he honor but even if it be so father he say other man have fail other man have be defeat ruin and leave penniless and yet have rise and shake the dust from they and fight they way again to the height you be not a old man you be strong and clever and you be not alone he say in a lower voice i be not much use i know but i 'll try and help you all i can i have often feel ashamed of myself for live such a idle useless life often feel that i ought to do something to justify my existence there be a chance now at any rate there be a occasion a necessity for my wake up and step into the ring to do a little fighting on my own account we may be beat by mr falconer but do not say we be utterly crush that do not sound like you sir and i do not understand why you should chuck up the sponge so quickly sir stephen raise he head and look at stafford with a curious expression of mingled surprise and apprehension what be it you be say stafford he ask what be it you mean i do not understand we be not beat ralph falconer have offer to make the concession over to I and no one need know that i have fail that he have steal the march on I you hear what he say : that you be in love with he daughter maude and that of course he could not injure he future son-in-law stafford he spring to he foot and begin to pace up and down the room i know that this have touch you pride -- i can give a pretty good guess as to how proud you be -- but for god 's sake do not let you pride stand in the way of this arrangement but -- stafford begin for he feel that he could not longer keep back the truth that he father must be tell not only that there be nothing between maude and himself but that he love ida heron but before he could utter another word sir stephen stop before he and with hand throw out appealingly and with a look of terror and agony in he face cry in broken accent : if you go to raise any obstacle stafford prompt by you pride for god 's sake do not say the word you do not know you do not understand you speak of ruin as if it mean only the loss of money the loss of every penny he laugh almost hysterically and he lip twitch do you think i should care for that except for you sake no a thousand time no i be young still i could begin the world again yes and conquer it as i have do before but -- he voice sink and he look round the room with a stealthy glance which shock and startle stafford -- the ruin ralph falconer threaten I with mean more than the loss of money it mean the loss of everything of friend of good name -- of hope stafford start and he face grow a trifle hard and sir stephen see it and make a despairing appealing gesture with he hand for god 's sake do not turn away from I my boy do not judge I harshly you can not judge I fairly from you standpoint you life have be a totally different one from mine have be live under different circumstance you have never know the temptation to which i have be subject you life have be a easy one surround by honor while mine have be spend half the time grub in the dust and the mire for gold and the rest fighting -- sometimes with one hand tie behind I -- against the man who would have rob I of it i have have to fight they with they own weapon -- sometimes they have not be clean -- sometimes it have be necessary to do -- to do thing -- god stafford do not turn away from I i would have keep this from you if i could but i be oblige to tell you now ralph falconer know all the detail of my past he know of thing which -- which if they be know to the world would stain the name i have raise to honor would make it necessary for I to hide my head in a suicide 's grave a low cry burst from stafford 's lip and he sink into a chair and bow he head upon he hand sir stephen stand a little way off and look at he for a minute then he advance slowly half timidly and ashamedly and lay a tremble hand on stafford 's shoulder forgive I stafford he say in a low broken voice i be oblige to tell you i would have keep it from you -- you would never have know -- but falconer have force my hand i be bind to show you how necessary it be that we should have he as friend instead of foe you be not -- ashamed of I my boy you will not go back on I in the stress and strain of he emotion the old digger 's slang come readily to he lip stafford take one hand from he face and hold it out and he father grasp it cling to it as a drown man cling to a rock god bless you my boy he say i might have know you would not turn you back upon I i might have know that you would remember that i be not fight for myself only but for the son i be so proud of i know i know sir say stafford almost inaudibly sir stephen hang he hand release it and pace up and down the room again fight for composure and face the situation after the manner of he kind like all successful adventurer he be always ready to look on the bright side he come back to stafford and pat he gently on the shoulder try and forget what i say about -- about the past stafford he say let we look at the future -- you future after all we be not beat it be a compromise it be a alliance he voice grow more cheerful he eye begin to

falconer 's daughter and that i would loftier idea for you but let that pass maude be a young lady who can hold she own against the best and the highest falconer must be rich or he would not have be able to have manage this thing would not have be able to beat I with you money and hers you can go as far as you please he take a turn up and down the room again a flush on the face that have be pallid only a minute or two ago he finely shaped head throw back yes stafford i should like you to have marry into the nobility in my eye there be no one too high in rank for you but no matter the title will come they can not do less than offer I a peerage this railway will be of too much service to the government for they to pass I over the peerage must come there be no chance of my lose it why yes the future be as bright as the sunlight on a June morning you will have the girl you love i shall have the peerage to leave to you i shall have not live and struggle and fight in vain i shall

unable to move dumb-stricken and incapable even of protest sir stephen have speak of fate : fate hold stafford under its iron heel and the mockery of fate 's laughter mingle with the strain of the

thrust deep in he pocket and he chin upon he chest try to clear he brain to free he mind from all side issue and to face the fact that he have tacitly agree that by he silence he have consent to marry maude falconer but oh how hard it be to think clearly with the vision of that girlish face float before he the exquisitely beautiful face with its violet eye now arch and merry now soft and plead now tender with the tenderness of a girl 's first true divinely trust love he be look at the book-case before he but a mist rise between it and he eye and he see the mountain-side and the darling of he heart ride down it the sunlight on she face the soft tendril of hair blow rough by the wind the red lip apart with a smile -- the little grave smile which he have kiss away into deeper still sweeter seriousness and he have lose she oh god how he love she and he have lose she forever there be no hope for he he must save he father -- not he father 's money that count for nothing -- but he father 's honor -- he father 's good name and even if he be not bind to make this sacrifice to marry maude falconer how could he go to heron hall and ask godfrey heron the man of ancient lineage of unsullied name to give he daughter to the son of a man whose past be so black that he character be at the mercy of ralph falconer stafford rise and stretch out he arm as if to thrust from he a weight too grievous to be bear a cup too bite to be drain then he arm fall to he side and with a hardening of the face a tightening of the lip which make he look strangely like he father he leave the library and cross the hall make he way to the ball-room chapter xxiii the ball be at its height even the coldest and most _ blas _ of the guest have warm up and catch fire at the blaze of excitement and enjoyment the ball-room be dazzling in the beauty of its decoration and the soft effulgence of the shaded electric light in which the magnificent jewel of the title and wealthy woman seem to glow with a subdue and chasten fire a dance be in progress and stafford as he stand by the doorway and look mechanically and dully at the whirling crowd the kaleidoscope of color form by the rich dress the fluttering fan and the dash of black represent by the man 's clothes think vaguely that he have never see anything more magnificent more elegant of wealth and success but through it all weird and ghost-like shone ida 's girlish face with its love-lit eye and sweetly curving lip he look round and presently he see maude falconer in she strange and striking dress she be dance with lord fitzharford there be not a touch of color in she face she lip be pensive she lid lower she look like a exquisite statue exquisitely clothed move with the exquisite poetry of motion but quite devoid of feel suddenly as if she feel he presence she raise she eye and look at he a light shot into they glow for a moment she lip curve with the faintest of smile and a warm tint steal to she face it be a eloquent look one that could not be mistake by the least vain of man and it go straight through stafford 's heart for it force he to realize that which he have not even yet quite realize -- that he have tacitly pledge himself to she under other circumstance the thought might have set he heart beating and send the blood course hotly through he vein but with he heart ache with love for ida and despair at the loss of she maude falconer 's love-glance only chill he and make he shudder with apprehension of the future with the thought of the cost of the sacrifice which he have take upon himself the music sound like a funeral march in he ear the glitter the heat the movement seem unendurable and he thread he way round the room to a ante-room which have be fit up as a buffet give I some wine please he say to the butler try to speak in he ordinary tone but he know that he voice be harsh and strained know that the butler notice it though the well-trained servant do not move a eyelid but open a bottle of champagne with solemn alacrity and pour out a glass stafford sign to he to place the bottle near and drink a couple of glass it pull he together a bit and he be go back to the ball-room when several man enter they be griffenberg baron wirsch the belton and the other financier they be all talk together and laugh and they face be flush with triumph close behind they but grave and taciturn as usual come mr falconer at sight of stafford mr griffenberg turn from the man to whom he be talk and exclaim gleefully : here be mr orme you have herd the good news i suppose mr orme splendid be not it wonderful man you father truly wonderful he can give we all point can not he baron the baron nod and smile shir stephen ish a goot man of pishness you have a very glever fader mr orme he say

stephen have ever do you 'll join we oh come we can not take a refusal dash it all you be in the swim orme if you have not take any active part in it stafford glance at mr falconer and notice a grim smile pass over he face if these exultant and flush money-spinner only guess how active a part he have take how amaze they would be a wave of bitterness sweep over he at such a moment man especially young man become reckless the strain be too great and they fly to the nearest thing for relief he turn back to the buffet and the butler and the couple of footman open several bottle of champagne -- none of the man know or care how many several other of the financial group join the party the wine go round rapidly they be all talk and laugh except stafford who remain silent and grave and moody for some little time then he too begin to talk and laugh with the other and he face grow flush and he manner excited falconer who stand a little apart apparently drink with the other but really with care and moderation watch he under half-lowered lid and presently he move round to where stafford lean against the table with he champagne-glass in he hand and touch he on the arm say : i hear they enquire for you in the ball-room stafford it be the first time he have call stafford by he christian name and it strike home as falconer have intend it should stafford set he glass down and look round as a man do when the wine be creep up to he head and he be startle by a unexpected voice all right -- thanks he say he make he way through the group who be too engross and excite to notice he desertion and go into the ball-room as he do so he father enter by a opposite door and see he come round to he and take stafford 's hand that hang at he side press it significantly i have tell they he say they be almost off they head with delight -- you see it be such a big thing even for they staff you have save we all my boy but it be only i and falconer who know it only i who can show my gratitude he voice be low and tremulous he face flush like those of the man whom stafford have just leave and he dark eye flash and restless where be they all he ask and stafford nod over he shoulder towards the buffet sir stephen look round the room with a smile of triumph and he glance rest on maude falconer standing by a marble column she eye downcast she fan move to and fro in front of she white bosom she be beautiful staff he whisper the loveliest woman in the room i be not surprise that you should have fall in love with she stafford laugh under he breath a strangely wild and bitter laugh which sir stephen could not have fail to notice if the music have not commence a new waltz at that moment stafford go straight across the room to maude falconer she do not raise she eye at he approach but the color flicker in she cheek this be we dance i think he say she look up with a little air of surprise and consult she program no i think this be mine miss falconer say the man at she side no she say calmly the next be yours lord bannerdale this be mr orme 's though he know she be wrong of course lord bannerdale acquiesce with a bow and a smile and stafford lead maude away wine have a trick of get into some man 's foot and promptly give they away but stafford though he be usually one of the most moderate of man could drink a fairly large quantity and remain as steady as a rock no one watch he dance would have know that he have drunk far too many glass of champagne and that he head be burn he heart thump furiously but though he step be as faultless as usual and he steer she dexterously through this crowd maude know by he silence by he flushed face and restless eye that something have happen and that he be under the influence of some deep emotion he be dance quite perfectly but mechanically like a man in a dream and though he must have hear the music he do not hear she when she speak to he but look straight before he as if he be entirely absorb in some think when they come in the course of the dance to one of the door she stop suddenly do you mind it be so hot she murmur n -- o he say as if awake suddenly let we go outside he catch up a fur cloak that be lie on a bench and disregard she laughing remonstrance that the thing do not belong to she he put it round she and lead she on to the terrace she look up at he just as they be pass out of the stream of light see how set and hard he face be how straight the lip and sombre the eye and she hand as it rest lightly on he arm quiver like a leaf in autumn when they have get into the open air he throw back he head and draw a long breath yes it be hot in there he say they walk slowly up and down for a minute passing and repassing similar couple then suddenly as if the presence of other the sound of they voice and laughter jar upon he stafford say : shall we go into the garden it be quiet there -- and i want to speak to you if you like she say in a low voice which she try to make as languid as usual but she heart begin to beat fiercely and she lip tremble and he might have hear she breath come quickly have he not be absorb in he own reflection they go down the step and into the semi-darkness of the beautiful garden the silence be break by the hum of the distant voice and the splashing of a fountain which reflect the electric light as the spray rise and fall with rhythmic regularity stafford stop at this and look at the reflection of the star in the shallow water something in its simplicitude and the quiet come after the glitter and the noise of the ball-room call up the remembrance of herondale and the quiet love-laden hour he have spend there with ida the thought go through he with a sharp pain and he thrust it away from he as one thrust away a threatening weakness what be it you want to say to I ask maude not coldly or indifferently as she would have ask the question of another man but softly dreamily he walk on with she a few pace look straight before he as if he be try to find word suitable for the answer then he turn he face to she and look at she steadily though he head be burn and the plash of the fountain sound like the roar of the sea in he ear i wonder whether you could guess he say as he think of she father 's word he assertion that stafford be to be he son-in-law i suppose you must she gaze be as steady as he but she lip quiver slightly i would rather you should tell I than that i should i guess she say in a low voice i might be wrong he be not in a condition to notice the significance of she last word and he go on with a kind of desperation i bring you here into the garden miss falconer to ask you if you would be my wife they have stop just within the radius of a electric light hold aloft by a grin satyr and stafford see she face grow paler and paler in the seconds that follow the momentous question he could see she bosom heave under the half-open fur cloak feel she hand close for a instant on he arm do you wish I to say ` yes ' she ask in a low voice the red flood stafford 's face for a moment and he eye fall under she fixed regard what answer do one generally hope for when one put such a question he say try to smile i want you to be my wife and i hope with all my heart that you will say ` yes ' ` with all you heart ' she echo slowly almost inaudibly ` with all you heart ' with all mine i answer ` yes ' as she murmur the word -- and like that of most cold woman when they be intensely move she voice could be exquisitely sweet with its thrill of passion all the sweeter for its rarity -- she insensibly draw nearer to he and she hand steal to he shoulder she eye be lift to he and they shine with the love that be course through she vein almost stop the beating of she heart love radiate from she as the light radiate from the lamp the mock satyr hold above they stafford be at he best and worst a man and not a block of stone and wood and touch almost fire by the passion so close to he he put he arm round she waist and bent he head until he lip nearly touch hers she eye close and she be surrender herself to the kiss when suddenly she draw she head back and keep he from she look up at he be it with all you heart she whisper you have never speak to I of -- love before be it with all you heart he brow contract in a frown he set he tooth hard if he be to lie ` twere better that he lie thoroughly and well better that he sacrifice should be complete and effectual scarcely know what he say what he do with the fume of the champagne confuse he brain the misery of he lose love rack he heart he say hoarsely : i do not know -- till to-night you can trust I i ask you to be my wife -- i will be true to you -- it be with all my heart if jove laugh at lover ' perjury the angel must weep at such false oath as this even as he speak the word stafford remember the i love you he have cry to ida as he kneel at she foot and he shudder as maude draw he head down and he lip meet hers \* \* \* \* \* half a hour later they go slowly up the step again stafford 's head be still burn he still feel confuse like a man move in a dream since he have kiss she he have say very little and the silence have be break more often by maude than by he she have tell he in a low voice tremulous with love and hesitate now and again how she have fall in love with he the day he have row she on the lake how she have struggle and strive against the feeling and how it have conquer she how miserable she have be though she have try to hide she misery lest he should never come to care for she and she should have to suffer that most merciless of all misery -- unrequited love she seem as if she scarcely want he to speak as if she take it for grant that he have speak the truth and that he love she and as if it be a joy to she to bare she heart that he might see how devotedly it throb for he and for he alone every now and then stafford speak a few word in response he scarcely know what he say he could not have tell what they be ten minute after they be say he sit with he arm round she like a man play a part mechanically in the same condition he move beside she now as arm and arm they enter the house he look straight before he with a set face a forced smile she with now raise now droop eye glowing with triumph a flush on she usually pale face she lip apart and tremulous the ball be break up some of the woman have already go to the drawing-room or they own apartment a stream of man be make they way to the billiard-room from which come the pop of champagne-cork and the hissing of syphon as they enter the hall howard come lounge out in he leisurely way from the drawing-room and at sight of he stafford seem to awake to realize what he have do and how he stand he look from howard to maude then he say : howard i want you to congratulate I miss falconer -- maude -- have promise to be my wife howard do not start but he stare in silence for a instant then he eyelid flicker and force the astonishment from he face he take stafford 's left hand and shake it and bow to maude i do congratulate you with all my heart my dear stafford and i hope you 'll both be as happy as the happiest pair in a fairy story she draw she arm from stafford 's i will go up now she say good-night stafford stand until she have get as far as the bend of the stair then howard who have discreetly go on turn to go back to he but as he come up with a word of wonder and repeat congratulation he see stafford put he hand to he forehead and as it seem to howard almost stagger there be moment when the part of even one 's best friend be silence blindness howard turn aside and stafford go on slowly with a kind of enforced steadiness to the billiard-room while howard with dismay and apprehension be look after he he hear mr howard call softly mockingly from the stair and look up saw maude falconer lean over with she arm extend she hand open he understand in a moment and remove he ring as he run up the stair put it in the soft pink palm she give a little triumphant mocking laugh she hand close over the ring and then she glide away from he the smoking-room be crowd as stafford make he way in through the cloud of smoke he see he father standing at one end surround by the money-spinning crew falconer seat in a chair near he with a black cigar between he lip the group be laugh and talk loudly and all have glass in they hand some of the younger man who have just come from the hall-room be add they laughter and chatter to the noise daze and confuse half mad with rage and despair with a sense that fate be join she mocking laughter with that of the man round he stafford take a glass of wine from the butler who advance with it and drink it off hold it out to be refill the man refill it twice and stafford he eye aflame almost push he way through the various group to where he father stand i have come for you congratulation sir he say in a voice which though not loud be so clear as to break through the row miss falconer have promise to be my wife a silence so sudden as to be startling fall upon the hot and crowded room then as sir stephen grasp he son 's hand a din of voice arise a excited buzz of congratulation and good wish stafford face they all he face pale and set he lip curve with a forced smile he eye flash but light with a sombre fire there be a smile on he lip a false amiability in he eye but there be so much of madness in he heart that he be afraid lest at any moment he should dash the glass to the ground and break out into cursing a hour later he find himself in he room and wave measom away from he he go to the window and fling it wide open and stand there with he hand against he throbbing brow and though no word come from he parched lip he heart cry : ida ida with all the agony of despair chapter xxiv the hour drag along as stafford face the tragedy of he life as he pace the room or flung himself into a chair with he head bow in he hand the effect of the wine he have take the suppress excitement under which he have labor pass away and in the reaction he brain clear and he begin to realize the terrible import of the step he have take the extent of the sacrifice he have make he own life be wreck and ruin irreparably not only he own but that of the girl he love the step he have take be not only irreparable but irrevocable he could not go back he have ask maude falconer to be he wife he have speak word which must have sound to she as word of love he have kiss she lip in a word he be pledge to she and the pledge could not be break and ida what should he do in regard to she he have promise that if he feeling undergo any change towards she he would not go and tell she and at that moment he feel that the promise have not be a vain one for he know that he could not go to she that at sight of she he resolution would melt like snow in the sun that he love for she would sweep he away on a torrent of passion and that he would be as false to maude falconer as he have be to ida and yet he could not leave she desert she -- yes that be the word -- without make some sign without speak one word not of excuse but of farewell what could he say to she he could not tell she the truth for he father 's sake that must never be divulge he could give she no explanation must permit she to think he base and faithless and dishonorable there be only one thing he could do and that be to write to she but what could he say he go to he writing-table and take up a pen he hand be cold as ice and shake and he hold it before he until it grow steadier at the best of time stafford be not much of a letter-writer one do not learn the epistolatory art either at public school or the ` varsity and hitherto stafford 's letter-writing have be confine to the send or accept of invitation a short note about some meet or horse deal how be he to address she she be he dearest still the only woman in the world he have love or ever would love but he dare not call she so dare not tell she so he write she name but the sweet word seem to look up at he reproachfully accusingly and though he have write only that name he tear up several sheet of paper and at last in desperation scarcely know what he be write he write quickly hurriedly and without pause the follow line : i be write this because you make I promise that if anything happen let it be what it might to separate we i would not come and tell you something have happen i have discover that i be not only unworthy of call you mine as any man in the world even the best would be but that i be unworthy in the sense that would justify you in the eye of you father of everybody belong to you in send I adrift if i could tell you what it be you would understand and see how great a gulf yawn between we you would not marry I i can never be anything to you but a painful memory though you know how much i love you you will never guess what it cost I to relinquish all claim to you to tear myself away from you but i must do so -- and forever there be no hope none whatever for I i do not ask you to forgive I -- if i have know what i know now i would rather have die than have tell you that i love you but i do ask you to forget I or if you remember I to think of I as the most wretched and ill-fated of man as one who be bind hand and foot and compel drive along a path against he will i dare not say any more dare not tell you what this sacrifice cost I whether you forget or remember I i shall never forget you for a single instant shall never cease to look back upon my lose happiness as a man look back upon a lose heaven stafford he read it over a dozen -- twenty time and every time it seem weaker meaner less inexplicable but he know that if he destroy it he could write nothing better nothing that could satisfy he though it seem to he that he heart would have express itself more fully it he have write only good-bye forget I at last and reluctantly he put it in a envelope and address it and turn it face downward on he table so that he might not see the name which have such power to torture he heart by the time he have succeed in write the letter the dawn be creep over the hill and cast a pearly light upon the lake he draw the curtain and in the weird light catch sight of he face in the mirror : a white and haggard face which might well have belong to a man ten year he senior such a face as would not fail to attract attention and provoke comment by its appearance at the breakfast-table he fling himself on the bed not to sleep for he know that that would be impossible but to get some rest but rest be as impossible as sleep when he close he eye ida 's face be near he she voice be in he ear inextricably mix with the slow and languorous tone of maude falconer he undress and get into he flannel before measom come and go down to the lake for a bath he be as a rule so moderate in drinking that the wine he have take supplement by he misery make he feel physically ill he shudder with cold as he dive into the water and as he swim out he feel for the first time in he life a slight twinge of cramp at another time he would have be somewhat alarm for the strongest swimmer be absolutely helpless under a attack of cramp but this morning he be indifferent and the thought strike he that it would be well for he if he fling up he arm and go down to the bottom of the lake on the shore of which he have experience such exquisite joy such unutterable misery he meet no one on he way back to the house and go straight to he room the swim have remove some of the trace of last night 's work but he still look haggard and worn and there be that expression in he eye which a man 's wear when he have be battle with a great grief or struggle against a overwhelming fate as measom be dress he he ask himself how he should get the letter to ida -- the only letter he have ever write she the only letter he would probably ever write to she he decide that he would send it over by pottinger whom he know he could trust not only to deliver the letter but to refrain from tell anyone that he have be send with it he put it in the pocket of he shooting-coat and go downstairs intend to go straight to the stable to find pottinger but as he go through the hall murray the secretary come out of the library and sir stephen catch sight of stafford through the open door and call to he stafford go in and he father rise from the table on which be already pile a heap of letter and papers and take stafford 's hand lay a hand on he shoulder you be early my boy he say i do not expect to see you for hour yet could not you sleep you look rather tired stafford you be late last night and -- ah well there be some excuse for a little excitement and exaltation he smile whimsically as a

suggestion as a excuse for he ill-looks i drink and smoke last night more than i usually do you look as fresh as usual sir he add with unconscious irony sir stephen throw up he head with a short laugh

other end of the hall and make he way to the stable just as he be cross the lawn the temptation to ride over to heron hall and leave the note himself assail he strongly he take the letter from he pocket and look at it wistfully but he know that he dare not run the risk of meeting ida and with a sigh he go on towards the stable carry the note in he hand and as he turn away maude falconer let fall the curtain which she have raise at she window so that she might watch he she stand for a moment with she costly dressing-gown hold together with one white hand she lid half close he have write

pretty and poetical jessie say ida what would he care for a dress like a cloud or the diamond that shine like star on it do she not know that he love the little rain-washed habit which a certain rustic country girl wear better than the choicest production of worth yes miss jessie go on and susie say that mr stafford the lord 's son -- the simple dale folk as often call sir stephen my lord as sir -- dance ever so many time with she and the servant be say that he be make love to she and that they should not be surprise to hear that mr stafford be go to marry miss falconer ida could not prevent the color rise to she face but she laugh unforcedly and with no misgiving for she have look into stafford 's eye and read he soul through they he be hers let all the woman in the world be beautiful and deck in silk and satin she run upstairs to put on she habit leave jessie rather disappoint at the effect of she news and she sing while she tie the little scarlet sailor 's knot and presently come down the stair with a step as light as she heart as she be mount and talk to jason about the last lot of steer mr wordley come out of the house to get he horse and hurry to she bare-headed in the good old way no i can not stay he say in answer to she invitation i have to be back at the office but i 'll ride a little way with you if i may it be not often i get the chance of ride with the prettiest girl in the county there now i have make you blush as i use to when you sit upon my knee and i tell you that little girl have no right to star for eye ida laugh but i be a big girl now she say and too old for compliment besides lawyer should always speak the truth for goodness sake do not spread that theory my dear or we shall all have to put we shutter up he retort with mock alarm he get on he old red-roan rather stiffly and they ride out of the court-yard and on to the road where be sure ida 's star-like eye sweep the hill and the valley lest perchance a young man should be ride there they ride in silence for a few minute during which the old lawyer seem very thoughtful and glance at she sideways as if he be try to make up he mind about something at last he say with a affectation of casualness : father be pretty well of late my dear ida hesitate for a moment she could not bring herself to tell even mr wordley of she father 's painful habit of walk in he sleep yes she say fairly well sometimes he be rather restless and irritable as if he be worry have he anything to worry he mr wordley -- i mean anything more than usual he do not answer and she look at he as if wait for he reply i be think of what you just say : that you be a big girl so you be though you always seem to I like the little child i use to nurse but the world roll on and you have grow into a woman and i ought to tell you the truth he say at last the truth she echo with a quick glance yes he say nod gravely do you father ever talk to you of business my dear i know that you manage the house and the farm ay and manage they well but i do not know whether he ever tell you anything about the business of the estate i ask because i be in rather a awkward position when you father dismiss he steward i think he would consult I on the matter which the steward use to manage but he have not do so and i be really more ignorant about he affair than anyone would credit see that i have be the heron ' family lawyer -- i and mine -- since well say since the flood no my father tell I nothing say ida be there anything the matter be there anything i should know he look at she gravely compassionately my dear i think there be he say if you have a brother or any relative near you i would not worry you would not tell you but you have none you be quite alone you see quite alone she echo and then she blush as she remember stafford and that she be no longer alone in the world and so i think you ought to be tell that you father 's affair be -- be not as satisfactory as they should be i know that we be very poor say ida in a low voice ah yes he say and so be a great many of the land gentry nowadays but they still struggle on and i have hope that by some stroke of good luck i might have help you father to struggle on and perhaps save something make some provision for you but my dear -- see now i be go to treat you as if you be indeed a woman and you will be brave i know for you be a heron and a heron -- it sound like a paradox -- have never show the white feather -- you father 's affair have be grow worse lately i be afraid you know that the estate be encumber that the entail be cut off so that you might inherit but advantage have be take of the cut off the entail to raise fresh loan since the steward be dismiss and i have be ignorant of you father 's business matter i come to-day to tell he that the interest of the heaviest mortgage be long overdue and that the mortgagee who say that he have apply several time be threaten foreclosure i feel quite sure that i should get the money from you father this morning but he have put I off and make some difficulty he make a rambling statement almost incoherent which i do not understand though to be sure i listen very intently and from a word or two he incautiously let drop i be afraid that -- he stop and frown and pucker he lip as if reluctant to continue ida look at he steadily with she deep gray eye go on she say do not be afraid to tell I the truth i can bear it i would rather know the worst know what i have to face for some time past i have fear my father be in trouble do you think i be afraid please tell I all in a word then my dear say the old lawyer with a sigh i be afraid you father have be speculate and like ninety-nine out of a hundred that do so have be lose it be like play against the bank at monte carlo one man may break it but the advantage be on the bank 's side and for the one who win thousand lose can you tell I if there be any grounds for my apprehension ida be silent for a moment as she recall she father 's manner of late he habit of shut himself up in the library of keep he letter from she of secrete papers and above all the furtive glance which she have now and again see he cast at she i be afraid that it be only too true she say my poor father what be to be do mr wordley can i do anything the old man shake he head he know too well that once a man have really take to gamble whether it be on the stock exchange or at a green table or on the turf there be very little hope of save he i fear you can do nothing he reply sadly a heron never yet brooked interference even by he nearest and dearest no you must say nothing about it even i must be careful how i approach he for this morning he be testy and irritable and resent the few question i venture to put to he do not make yourself unhappy about it i will try and arrange about the mortgage and i will come over again as soon as possible and try and persuade you father to confide in I as he use to do now come remember you be not to worry yourself my dear but to leave it entirely to I thing be rarely as bad as they seem and there be always a gleam of light in the darkest sky perhaps some day we shall see heron hall and the good old family in all its old glory and when that day come my little girl with the star eye will queen it in the dale like one of the heron lady of the past he pat she hand as he hold it pat and stroke it and look at she with a tender and encouraging smile which make ida 's eye grow moist she ride down the dale gravely and sadly for some minute : then the think flash through she mind warm she heart that she be not alone but there be one who love she and to whom she could by for consolation and encouragement yes it be only right that she should tell stafford all there should be no concealment from he she ride down the dale look for he but he be nowhere to be see when she come to the opening by the lake she see the large white villa gleam in the sunlight a launch be pat off from the landing-place with man and woman on board and the could almost fancy that she hear the sound of laughter the contrast of the prosperity typify by the great white place and the poverty of heron hall smite she sharply she be poorer even than she have think : what would the great the rich sir stephen say to such a daughter-in-law she watch the launch dreamily as it shoot across the lake and wonder whether stafford be on board laughing and talk perhaps with the beautiful miss falconer in this moment of she trouble the thought be not pleasant but there be no jealousy in it for in she assurance of he love he be free to talk and jest with whom he please she turn and after make she usual circuit ride home-wards as she reach the cross-road she hear the sound of a horse come from the hall and she pull up she heart beat fast then it sink with disappointment for the horseman come round the bend and she see that it be a groom he touch he hat as he pass and ride on at a sharp trot in the direction of bryndremere ida wonder why he have be to the hall but conclude that he have go there with some message about the farm produce when she ride into the stable-yard she see jessie and jason standing by the small hall door and talk eagerly and jessie come forward and take a letter from under she apron hold it out with a smile it be just come from the villa miss ida she say and oh miss what i tell you this morning -- it be quite true it be mr stafford 's own groom as bring the note and he say that he master be engage to miss falconer and that the whole place be in excitement over it he be as proud as punch miss ida for he say that he new mistress be terrible rich as well as beautiful and that there 'll be the grandest of grand doings up there the blood rush to ida 's face for a moment then fade and she slip the note into the pocket of she habit and laugh for it sound too ridiculous too incredible to cause she even a shadow of annoyance she give one or two order to jason then go into the hall take the note from she pocket and look at the address lovingly lingeringly : for instinctively she know whose hand have write it it be the first letter she have receive from he what would it say to she no doubt it be to tell she why he have not be able to meet she that morning to ask she to meet he later in the day with a blush of maidenly shame she lift the envelope to she lip and kiss each write word then she open it slowly as lingeringly as she have look at it spin out the pleasure the delight which lay before she in the perusal of she first love-letter with she foot upon the old-fashioned fender she head droop as if there be someone present to see she blush she read the letter and it be not too much to say that at first she fail utterly to grasp its meaning with knit brow and quake heart she read it again and again until its significance be so to speak force upon she then the letter drop from she hand she arm fall limply to she side and she look straight before she in a daze benumbed fashion every word burn itself upon she brain and sear she heart the blow have fall so suddenly so unexpectedly like a bolt from the blue smite the happiness of she young life as a sapling be smite by summer lightning that for the moment she feel no pain nothing but the benumbing of all she faculty so that she do not see the portrait of the dead and go heron upon which she eye rest do not hear she father 's voice call to she from the library be conscious of nothing but those terrible word which be din through she brain like the booming of a great bell presently she utter a low cry and clasp she head with she hand as if to shut out the sound of the word that tortured she it could not be true -- it could not be true stafford have not write it it be some cruel jest a very cruel jest perpetrate by someone who hate they both and who wantonly inflict pain yes that be it that could be the only explanation someone have write in he name it be a forgery she would meet stafford presently and they would laugh at it together he would be very angry would want to punish the person who have do it but he and she would laugh together and he would take she in he arm and kiss she in one of the many way in which he have make a kiss a ecstasy of delight and they would laugh together as he whisper that nothing should ever separate they she laugh now as she picture the scene that would be enact but suddenly the laugh die on she lip as there flash across she mind the word jessie have say stafford be engage to maude falconer the girl up at the villa whose beauty and grace and wealth all the dale be talk of oh god be there any truth in it be there any truth in it have stafford indeed write that cruel letter have he leave she forever forever forever should she never see he again never again hear he tell she that he love she would always love she the room spin round with she she suddenly feel sick and faint and reel catch at the carve mantel-shelf to prevent herself from fall then gradually the death-like faintness pass and she become conscious that she father 's voice be call to she and she clasp she head again and sweep the hair from she forehead and clench she hand in the effort to gain she presence of mind and self-command she pick up the letter and with a shudder thrust it in she bosom as cleopatra might have thrust the asp which be to destroy she then with leaden foot she cross the hall and open the library door and see she father standing by the table clutch some papers in one hand and gesticulate wildly with the other dizzily for there seem to be a mist before she eye she go to he and lay a hand upon he arm what be it father she say be you ill what be the matter he gaze at she vacantly and strike he hand on the table after the manner of a child in a senseless passion lose lose all lose he mumble jumble the word together almost incoherently what be lose father she ask

stony eye grow more vacant he jaw drop and he sink still lower in the chair jessie jason she call and they rush in for a space they stand aghast and unhelpful from fright then jason try to lift he master from the heap into which he have collapse the old man 's eye close he straggle for breath and when he have gain it he look from one to the other with a smile a senile smile which add to ida 's grief and terror it be all right he whisper huskily pantingly it be all right they do not know they do not guess then he manner change to one of intense alarm and dismay lose lose he gasp i be ruin rain herondale have go go -- all be go my poor child -- ida father break from ida 's white lip father i be here look at I speak to I i be here -- everything be not lose i be here and all be well he

as she cling she feel a shudder run through he and he fall a lifeless heap upon she shoulder the minute -- be they minute or year -- pass and be break into fragment by a cry from jessie miss ida miss ida he be -- the master 's dead ' ida raise she father 's head from she shoulder and look into he face and know that the girl have speak the truth he be dead she have lose both father and lover in one day chapter xxvi ida sit in the library on the morning of the funeral a pelting rain beat upon the window over which the blind have be draw the great silence which reign in the chamber above in which the dead master of heron lay brood over the whole house and seem in no part of it more intense than in this great book-lined room in which godfrey heron have spend so much of he life ida lay back in the great arm-chair in which he have sit she small brown hand lie limply in she lap she eye fix absently upon the open book which lay on the table as he have leave it the pallor of she face increase by she sorrow be accentuate by the black dress almost as plainly make as that which the red-eyed jessie wear in she kitchen though nearly a week have elapse since she father have die in she young arm and notwithstanding she capacity for self-reliance ida have not yet recover from the stupor of the shock she be scarcely think as she lay back in he chair and look at the table over which he have bent for so many monotonous year she scarcely realize that he have pass out of she life and that she be alone in the world and she be only vaguely conscious that she sorrow have so to speak a double edge that she have lose not only she father but the man to whom she have give she heart the man who should have be stand beside she now shield she with he strong arm comforting she with word of pity and love the double blow have fall so suddenly so unexpectedly that the pain of it have be dull and blunt the capacity of human nature for suffering be after all not unlimited god say to physical pain and mental anguish thus far and no farther and this limitation save ida from utter collapse then again she be not free to indulge in idle grief in the luxury of woe the great house have still to be run she have to bury she beloved dead the mourning which seem such a hopeless mockery when the heart be rack with misery have to be see to and she do it and go through it all with outward calm sustain by that heron spirit which may be describe as the religion of she class -- _ noblesse oblige _ jessie have weep loudly through the house ever since the death and could weep as loudly now but if ida shed any tear she weep in the silence and darkness of she own room and no one hear she utter a moan to suffer in silence and be strong be the badge of all she tribe and she wear it with quiet stoicism godfrey heron 's death have happen so suddenly that the news of it scarcely get beyond the radius of the estate before the follow morning and stafford have go to london in ignorance of this second blow with which fate have follow up the one he have deal ida : and when the neighbor -- the vayne the bannerdale and the avory -- come quickly and readily enough to offer they sympathy and help they could do nothing the girl solitary and lonely in she grief as she have be solitary and lonely through she life would see no one but the doctor and mr wordley and the people who have once be warm and intimate friend of the family leave reluctantly and sully to talk over the melancholy circumstance and to wonder what would become of the daughter of the eccentric man who have live the life of a recluse mr wordley would have like to have persuade she to see some of the woman who have hasten to comfort she but he know that any attempt at persuasion would have be in vain that he would not have be able to break down the barrier of reserve which the girl have instinctively and reservedly erect between she suffering soul and the world he heart ache for she and he do all that a man could do to lighten the burden of she trouble but there be very little that he could do beyond superintend the necessary arrangement for the funeral he first thought be of the relative but somewhat to he own dismay he find that the only one whom he could trace be a certain cousin a more than middle-aged man who though he bear the name of heron be quite unknown to ida and so far as mr wordley be aware have not cross the threshold of the hall for many year he be a certain john heron a retired barrister who have go in for religion not in the form of either of the established church but of that of one of the least known sect the member of which call themselves some kind of brother be suppose to be very strict observer of the scriptural law and be consider by those who do not belong to they both narrow-minded and uncharitable mr john heron be a prominent member of this little sect and be famous in its small circle for he extreme sanctity and he eloquence as a lay preacher mr wordley with much misgiving have invite this the only relative he could find to the funeral and ida be now await this gentleman 's arrival the stealthy footstep which belong to those who minister to the dead pass up and down the great house jason be set out the simple funeral baked meat which be consider appropriate to the occasion and mr wordley pace up and down the hall with he hand behind he back listen to the undertaker 's man upstairs and glance through the window in expectation of the carriage which have be send for mr john heron presently he see it round a bend of the drive and go into the library to prepare ida she raise she head but not she eye as he enter and look at he with that dull apathy which denote the benumbed heart the mind crush under its heavy weight of sorrow i come in to tell you my dear that mr john heron be come he say the carriage be just turn the bend of the drive i will come she say rise and support herself by the heavy carve arm of the great chair no no he say sit down and wait here he do not want she to hear the stealthy tread of the undertaker 's man to meet the coffin which they be go to bring downstairs and place in the hall i will bring he in here be there anything you would like I to say to he my dear he ask and speak with a certain hesitancy for as yet he have not speak of she future feeling that she grief be too recent too sacred to permit of the obtrusion of material and worldly matter to say to he she repeat in a low dull voice as if she do not understand yes he say i do not know whether you have form any plan whether -- he hesitate again you have think of go -- of pay a visit -- to these relation of yours he live in the north of london and have a wife and son and daughter as you know ida pass she hand across she brow try to remember ah yes she say at last i remember you tell I about they i never hear of they before -- until now why should i go to they do they want I have they ask I mr wordley cough discreetly they certainly have not ask she but he feel quite assure that a individual whose reputation for sanctity stand so high could not be so deficient in charity as to refuse a home to he orphan cousin they have not send you any definite invitation yet but they will be sure to want you to go and stay with they for a time at any rate and i think you ought to go i do not think i should like it say ida but indifferently as if the question be of no moment i would rather stay here mr wordley polish he glass very intently i be afraid you would find it very lonely at the hall my dear he say in fact i do not think you could remain here by yourself he add evade the direct gaze of the great sad eye i should feel lonely anywhere she say more lonely with people i do not know probably than i should feel here with jessie and jason -- and -- and the dog well well we can not discuss the question now and will endeavor to act for the best my dear say the old man still intent upon he glass i hear the carriage i will bring mr john in he return in a minute or two accompany by a tall and gaunt individual who in he black clothes and white necktie look a cross between a superior undertaker and a methodist preacher he feature be strongly marked and the expression of he countenance be both severe and melancholy and judge by he expression and he voice which be harsh and lachrymose he particular form of religion do not appear to afford he either amusement or consolation this be you cousin mr john heron say poor mr wordley who be evidently suffer from the effect of he few minute ' conversation with that gentleman mr john heron survey the slight figure and white face with its sad star-like eye -- survey it with a grim kind of severity which be probably intend for sympathy and extend a cold damp hand which resemble a extremely bony shoulder of mutton say in a rasp melancholy voice : how do you do ida i trust you be bear you burden as become a christian we be bear to sorrow the train be three-quarter of a hour late i be sorry say ida in she low voice leave he to judge whether she express regret for we birthright of misery or the lateness of the train will you have some lunch -- some wine she ask a dull vague wonder rise in she mind that this grim middle-class man should be of kith and kin with she dead father thank you no i have a abernethy biscuit at the station he draw back from and wave away the tray of wine which jason at this moment bring in i never touch wine i and all mine be total abstainer those who fly to the wine-cup in moment of tribulation and grief rely on a broken reed which shall pierce they hand i trust you do not drink cousin ida no -- yes sometimes not much she reply vaguely and regard he with a dull wonder for she have never see this kind of man before mr wordley pour out a glass of wine and in silent indignation hand it to she and unconscious of the heavy scowl with which mr john heron regard she she put she lip to it a glass of wine be not a bad thing at any time say the old lawyer especially when one be weaken and prostrate by trouble try and drink a little more my dear it be a matter of opinion of conviction of principle say mr john heron grimly as if he be in the pulpit we must be guide by the light of we conscience we must not yield to the seductive in fineness of creature comfort we be tell that strong drink be rage -- this be rather more than mr wordley could stand and very red in the face he invite mr john heron to go up to the room which have be prepare for he when that gentleman have stalk out the old lawyer look at ida with a mixture of dismay and commiseration not a -- er -- particularly cheerful and genial person my dear but no doubt mr john heron be extremely conscientious and -- er -- good-hearted i daresay assent ida apathetically it do not matter it be very kind of he to come so far to -- to the funeral she add he might have stay away for i do not think my father know he and i never hear of he be it not time yet she ask in a low voice as she speak jessie come in and take she upstairs to she room to put on the thick black cloak the bonnet with its long crape veil in which ida be to follow she father to the grave for in spite of mr wordley 's remonstrance she have remain firm in she resolve to go to the church-yard presently the procession start only a few carriage follow the hearse which bear godfrey heron to he last resting-place but when the vehicle cradle beyond the boundary of the grounds across which the dead man have not set foot for thirty year the cavalcade be swell by a number of tenant labourer and dalesman who have come to pay they last respects to heron of herondale and march in three which appear to be the regulation number for a funeral they make a long and wind tail to the crawl coach quite fill the little church and stand a black-garbed crowd in the pelting rain round the oblong hole which would suffice for the last bed of this one of the last of the lord of the dale but though all be present to show respect to the deceased squire the attention of every man and woman be fix upon the slight girlish figure standing by the side of the grave she head bent she great mournful eye fix upon the coffin she hand clench tightly as they hold together the thick mourn cloak she look so young so almost child-like in the desolation of she solitude that many of the woman cry silently and the rough man set they lip hard and look sternly and grimly at the ground the old clergyman who have christen she and every Sunday have cast glance of interest and affection at she as she sit in the great loose box of a pew find it very difficult to read the solemn service without break down and he old thin voice quaver as he speak the word of hope and consolation which the storm of wind and rain catch up and sweep across the narrow church-yard and down the dale of which the heron have be so long master mr john heron stand grim and gaunt opposite ida as if he be a figure carve out of wood and show no sign of animation until the end of the service when he look round with a sudden eagerness and open he large square lip as if he be go to improve the occasion by a address but mr wordley who suspect he of such intention nip it in the bud by say : will you give you arm to miss ida mr heron i want to get she back to the hall as soon as possible ida be lead to the carriage pass through a lane of sympathiser amongst whom be representative of all the great dale family and all bent they head with a respectful pity and sympathy as the young girl make she way down the narrow path about half a dozen person have be ask to go to the hall for the funeral lunch at which mr john heron as representative of the family preside it be a melancholy meal for most of those present be think of the orphan girl in she room above they speak in lowered voice of the dead man and of the great family from which he have spring and recall story of the wealth and lavishness of past heron and when the meal be over there suddenly fall a silence and all eye be turn upon mr wordley for the moment have arrive for the reading and expound of the will mr wordley rise cough and wipe he eye-glass and look round gravely as the legal adviser of my late client mr godfrey heron i have to inform you gentleman that there be no will my client die intestate the listener exchange glance and look grave and concerned no will say lord bannerdale anxiously then he kindly face clear but of course everything go to he daughter the estate be not entail mr wordley incline he head the estate be not entail as you observe lord bannerdale and my client miss ida heron inherit everything they draw a breath of relief and nod assentingly and presently they make a general movement of departure lord bannerdale linger behind the other i will not ask the poor child to see I mr wordley he say will you therefore be good enough to give she lady bannerdale 's love and to tell she that as lady bannerdale have write to she we shall be more than pleased if she will come to we at the court she be to consider it she home for just as long as she should please and we shall feel it a pleasure and a honor to have she amongst we as one of we own of course she can not remain alone here in this great place the old lawyer bow i will give she you kind message for which i thank you on she behalf lord bannerdale i do not know what she will do or where she will go at present she be not in a condition to discuss any plan for she future though to-day she express a desire to remain at the hall he pause for a moment before he add : i do not know whether she can do so my cousin be young and a mere child and she must follow the advice of she elder and she guardian the future of even the sparrow be in higher hand than ours and we know not what a day may bring forth say mr john heron grimly and with a uplifting of he heavy brow quite so say lord bannerdale who have take a great dislike for the sanctimonious speaker and who could scarcely repress a shudder as he shake mr john heron 's cold and clammy hand when they have all go mr wordley say : we have better go into the library and talk matter over i will send for miss ida it seem cruel to disturb she at such a moment but there be no help for it you speak as if you have bad tiding mr wordley to give we say john heron i be afraid i have respond the old lawyer shake he gray head sadly chapter xxvii when ida come down he lead she to a chair beside the fire which he have order to be light and lay he hand gently and tenderly on she shoulder by way of preparation and encouragement you cousin and i want to talk to you about the future ida he say you will have to be tell some time or other exactly how you father 's affair stand and i have come to the conclusion that it be better you should know at once than that you should be permit to remain in ignorance of the gravity of the situation i have go over you father 's papers and look into he affair very carefully and closely and i be sorry to say that they be in a very unsatisfactory condition as i tell you the other day the estate have be encumber and very seriously embarrassed for some time past and the encumbrance have be increase of late notwithstanding the admirable way in which you have manage the estate and the household affair ida raise she eye to he and try to regard he calmly and bravely but she lip quiver and she check a sigh mr wordley cough and frown as a man do when he be engage in a disagreeable and painful task the principal mortgagee have give I notice of foreclosure and the amount of the debt be so large that i be afraid -- it would be cruel and useless to conceal the truth from you -- i _ know _ that the property sell would not be sufficient to meet it of ready money there appear to be none -- mr john heron groan and raise he melancholy eye to the ceiling with a expression of reprobation ida appear unconscious of he presence and keep she sad eye steadily fix on the lawyer 's kind and mournful face -- in a word my dear child you poor father appear to have leave absolutely no effect behind he ida draw a long breath and be silent for a moment as she try to realize the significance of he word do you mean that i be quite penniless she say in a low voice mr wordley blow he nose and cough two or three time as if he find it difficult to reply at last he say in a voice almost as low as hers : put shortly i be afraid my dear that be what i must tell you i have no idea that the position be so grave i think that there would be something leave sufficient at any rate to render you independent but as i tell you i have be keep in ignorance of you father 's affair for some year past and i do not know how thing be go i be surprise as well as grieved deeply grieved and i must confess that i can only account for the deplorable confusion and loss by the theory that i suggest to you the other day i can not but think that you poor father must have engage in some disastrous speculation mr heron groan again and shake he head the prevailing vice of this most wicked of age he say the love of money the gambling on the race-course and the stock exchange be the root of all evil ida seem not to hear he and mr wordley ignore the comment it now remain for you my dear child to decide what to do i do not think you could possibly live on here you have not the means to do so though you should be as economical as you have be in the past the house must pass away from you in six month ' time or little more and there would be nothing gain by you linger hopelessly here for that period i must go then say ida as if there be a stab in every word mr wordley bent he head and lay he hand on she shoulder yes i fear you must go he assent but thank god you be not without friend many friend lord bannerdale charge I to tell you what he good wife have already write you -- that a home await you at the court where you will be receive gladly and lovingly and i be quite sure that the door of every house in the dale be wide open for you ida shrink in she chair clothe the offer as kindly as he might it spell charity not cold charity but charity still : and what heron have ever tamely accept charity from mere friend and stranger mr wordley see the shrink the little shudder and understand i understand my dear he say in a low voice but there be another offer another home which you can accept without humiliation or compunction you cousin mr john heron here will i be sure be only too glad too delighted to -- to -- he wait and glance at mr heron impatiently and at last that gentleman rise but not too eagerly to the occasion i need scarcely say he say slowly and solemnly that i should not approve of my cousin 's accept these offer of charity which though no doubt kindly mean appear to I somewhat -- er -- obtrusive i be not a wealthy man my simple home can not compare in size and grandeur with heron hall and the estate which my late unfortunate cousin appear to have squander but such as it be ida will be welcome in it i be not one to turn a deaf ear to the cry of the orphan and fatherless mr wordley frown and redden and cut in before mr john heron could finish he sentence even more offensively and so rouse ida 's spirit and render he offer impossible of acceptance quite so quite so my dear sir he say i be quite sure you will feel only too delighted and honor at the prospect of take this dear child into you family yes say mr heron unctuously we will take she in as a lamb gather into the fold as a brand be pluck from the burning ida look at he half stupefied and it be to be fear some doubt of he sanity arise in she mind quite so quite so interrupted mr wordley again then i think the sooner miss ida join you the

as if they be my own i will have a sale of the stock and other thing which we be free to sell and meanwhile miss ida must permit I to advance she some money on account of the proceeds he hand she a envelope in which he have already place some bank-note but ida look at he and slowly shake she head no no my dear he say i should not be guilty of such presumption though you be leave heron hall though it may be pass away from you forever you be still in my eye miss heron of herondale and i should not presume to offer you -- he voice break and he eye fill with tear the money be yours and you

trouble you will be but honor that privilege when you come to I for advice and assistance he voice be almost inaudible before he have finish and ida down whose cheek tear be run for the first time extend both hand in mute but eloquent gratitude they have both forget mr john heron 's presence but be remind of it by something between a cough and a sniff from he and at a glance from mr wordley ida turn to the gaunt figure and hold out she hand thank you she say in a low voice i will come with you and stay with you until -- until -- i can find something to do something at which i can earn my own living surely there must be something i can do she turn to mr wordley with a little anxious eager gesture i be strong -- very strong i have manage herondale -- i can ride and -- and understand a farm i be never tired surely there be something i can do she voice break she begin to tremble and the tear start to she eye again yes yes no doubt no doubt my child say mr wordley whose own eye be moist we will think about all that later on you must go now and rest you be tire he draw she arm within he and pat she hand tenderly and encouragingly lead she out of the room and stand in the hall watch she as she slowly go up the great stair such a girlish mournful figure in she plain black dress ida lay awake that night listen to the wind and the rain she be familiar enough with the dale storm but never have they wild music wail so mournful a accompaniment to she own thought compare with she other loss that of she home dearly as she love it weigh but little it be but a add pang to the anguish of she bereavement and behind that the principal cause of she grief loom the desertion of she lover she try not to think of stafford for every thought bestow on he seem to rob she dead father and to be disloyal to he memory but alas the human heart be despotic and as she lay awake and listen to the wail of the wind and the rain as it drive against the window stafford 's voice penetrate that of the storm and scarcely consciously she lip be form some of the passionate word of endearment which he have whisper to she by the stream and on the hill-side though she know every word by heart of the letter he have write she she do not yet understand or comprehend why he have break he solemn engagement to she she understand that something have rise between they something have happen which have separate they but she could form no idea as to what it be he have speak of unworthiness of something which he have discover that have render he unfit to be she husband but she could not guess what it be but confuse and bewilder as she be there be at present at any rate no resentment in she heart the lover have be take from she just as she father and she home have be there be no help for it there be no appeal from the decree of fate fate have decree that she should love stafford and lose he and she could only go on live she gray and dreary life make all the greyer and drearier by she short spell of joy and happiness sorrow 's crown of sorrow be still the remembrance of happier thing and she would have to wear that crown in place of the crown of he love wear it through all she day for young as she be she know that she have give she heart once and for all that though she might never see stafford again she would love he to the end a mist hang over the dale on this the day of she departure from the hall and all the hill over which she have so love to ride and walk be shroud as if in tear she stand and look at they from the hall window with vacant eye as if she do not yet realize that she be leave they perhaps forever but she have not long for gaze for mr heron and she be go by a early train and the moment for farewell come swiftly upon she with donald and bess close at she heel as if they be aware of they coming loss she go round to say good-bye she cross the lawn and go to the spot under the tree where she have meet stafford that never-to-be-forgotten night and from thence walk to the corner of the terrace where they have stand and watch she father come in he sleep from the ruin chapel then she go to the stable to say good-bye to rupert who whinny as he hear she approach footstep and thrust he soft velvety nose into she neck she have to fight hard against the tear at this point and she hide she face against that of the big horse with she arm throw round he neck as she murmur she last good-bye but the tear would not be keep back when it come to say farewell to the two faithful soul jessie and jason with whom she have grow up from a girl all leg and wing and whom she have learn to regard rather as devoted friend than servant jason break down completely and hurry away he old and feeble frame shake like a autumn leaf and jessie she arm throw round she young mistress and with sob and ejaculation implore she to take she faithful jessie with she perhaps the parting with the two dog be as bitter as any for as if they know quite well that she be go they cling closely to she and when she hug they and kiss they on the forehead they have to be drag off by jason and lock up in the stable lest they should follow the carriage which be to bear they beloved mistress away that carriage come all too soon though mr john heron have await its arrival impatiently and with watch in hand he seem grimmer and gaunter than ever that morning and as he look around the great hall he shake he head at its fade grandeur reprehensively as if he could if time permit deliver a sermon on the prodigality the wicked wastefulness which have bring ruin on the house and render it necessary for he to extend he charity to the penniless orphan mr wordley be there to say good-bye to ida and put she into the carriage but it prove a difficult good-bye to say and for once the usually fluent old lawyer be bereft of the power of speech as he hold ida 's small hand and look through tear-dimmed eye at the white and sorrowful face he have intend to say all sort of kind and encouraging thing but he could only manage the two word good-bye and they be almost inaudible she sink back into the carriage as it drive away from the hall and close she eye that she might not see the familiar tree in the avenue the cattle everyone of which she know by name grazing in the meadow the pale and woe-begone face of the servant who stand by the step to catch the last glimpse of they beloved and for some time she eye remain closed but they open as she come to the clearing by the lake from which one could see the long stretch faade of sir stephen orme 's white villa she open they then and look at the house wonder whether stafford be there wonder why he have not come to she despite the promise she have exact from he wonder whether he know that she father be dead and that she be leave penniless she be not capable of any more tear and a dull apathy crush down upon she so that she do not notice that at the station mr john heron improve the occasion as he would have put it by distribute tract to the station-master and porter the journey to london pass as if it be make in a dream and wearied in mind and body and soul she find herself late in the evening standing in the center of the heron 's dreary drawing-room await she reception by the heron family she have be tell by she cousin as they drive in a four-wheeled cab through the depressing street of a london suburb that the family consist of he wife and a son and a daughter that the son 's name be joseph and the daughter 's isabel that joseph be a clerk in the city and that isabel be about the same age as ida we be a very quiet family mr heron have say and you will no doubt miss the space and grandeur of heron hall but i trust we be contented and happy and that though we means be limit we sphere of usefulness be wider than that of some wealthier people my wife be unfortunately a invalid and require constant care and attention but i have no doubt she will find strength to bear any fresh burden which providence may see fit to put upon she though we circumstance be comfortable we be not surround by the luxury which so often prove a stumbling-block to weaker brethren i trust you may be happy in we humble home and that you may find some opportunity of usefulness in this new state of life to which you be call ida try to remember all this as she stand in the center of the drawing-room and look round upon the modern but heavy and ugly object with which it be furnish the room be seedy and shabby but with a different seediness and shabbiness from that of heron hall for there be a attempt to conceal its loss of freshness with antimacassar large in size and hideous of pattern a grim and ugly portrait of mr john heron occupy a great portion of one of the wall and be confront by a portrait of a similar size of he wife a middle-class woman of fade aspect and languish expression the other picture be of the type that one usually see in such house engraving print from wornout plate and third-class lithograph there be a large sofa cover with dirty cretonne and with a hollow in the middle show that the spring have go the centre-table be adorn by several well-known religious book arrange at regular interval a cage contain a canary hung between the curtain in the window and the bird a wretched-looking animal -- it be moult -- wake up at they entrance and shrill in the hateful manner peculiar to canary this depressing room be light by one gas-burner which only permit ida to take in all that have be describe but vaguely and dimly she look round aghast and with a sinking of the heart she have never be in any room like this before and its lack of comfort its vulgarity strike upon she strained nerve like a loud discordant note in music but its owner look round complacently and turn the gas a little higher as he say : i will go and fetch you cousin will not you sit down as he speak the door open and the original of the portrait on the wall enter follow by she daughter isabel ida rise from the bumpy sofa and see a thin harassed-looking woman more fade even than the portrait and a tall and rather a good-looking girl whose face and figure resemble in a vague indefinite way those of both she father and mother but though she be not bad-looking there be a touch of vulgarity in she widely open eye with a curious stare for the newcomer and in she rather coarse mouth which appal and repel poor ida and she stand look from one to the other try to keep she surprise and wonder and disapproval from reveal themselves through she eye she do not know that these two lady be the wife and daughter of a professional man consider themselves very much the superior of they friend and neighbor who be mostly retire trades-people or something in the city and that mr heron be extremely proud of she husband 's connection with the heron of herondale and be firmly convince that she and she family possess all the taste and refinement which belong to the aristocracy a simpler and a homelier woman would have put she arm round the girl 's neck and draw she towards she with a few loving word of greet and welcome but mrs heron only extend a hand hold at the latest fashionable angle and murmur in a languid and lackadaisical voice : so you have come at last my dear miss heron you train must have be very late john we have be expect you for the last hour and i be afraid the dinner be quite spoilt but anyway i be glad to see you thank you say poor ida it be isabel 's turn and she now come forward with a smile that extend she mouth from ear to ear and in a gush manner say in staccato sentence : yes we be so glad to see you how tired you must be one always feel so dirty and tumble after a long journey you 'll be glad of a wash miss heron but there i must not call you that it sound so cold and formal i must call you ida must not i ` ida ' it sound such a _ odd _ name but i suppose i shall get use to it in time i hope so say poor ida try to smile and speak cheerfully and amiably as miss isabel 's rather large hand enclose round hers but she look from one to the other with a appalling sensation of strangeness and aloofness and a lump rise in she throat which render the smile and any further speech on she part impossible and as she look from the simpering lackadaisical mother to the vulgar daughter with meaningless smile she ask herself whether she be really awake whether this room be indeed to be she future home and these strange people she daily companion or whether she be only asleep and dream and would wake to find the honest face of jessie bend over she and to see the familiar object of she own room at heron hall chapter xxviii when ida go upstairs for the wash the need for which miss isabel have so kindly inform she of she find that she room be clean and fairly comfortable though its appearance seem strange after the huge and old-fashioned one at the hall the furniture be cheap and unsubstantial the towel be small and thin in place of picture aggressively illuminate text scar the wall like freshly make wound and the place have a bare homeless look which make ida shudder the dining-room when she go down to it do not impress she any more favourably for here too the furniture be new and shiny with a sticky kind of shininess as if the treacly varnish have not yet dry there be not a comfortable chair in the room the picture be the most gruesome one of dor 's and there be a text over the mantel-piece as aggressive and as hideous in color as those in she room a lukewarm leg of mutton very underdone be on the table the cloth of which be by no means clean the dish which contain quite cold vegetable be crack and do not match the bread be of the commonest kind that which be call household the knife be badly clean and the plate be wear off the fork and spoon it be consider inelegant to have gas in the dining-room therefore a cheap paraffin-lamp be in the center of the table and be more liberal of scent than light the curtain to the window be of that annoying red which shriek down any other color near it they make ida 's tired eye ache while she be try to eat the slice of gory mutton mr heron and isabel watch she as if she be some aboriginal from a wild and distant country and they shoot glance at each other uneasy half-jealous half-envious glance as they note the beauty of the face and the grace of the figure in its black dress which plain as it be seem to make theirs still more dowdy and vulgar in the midst of this lugubrious account of the annoyance and worry of the journey mr heron break off to ask : where be joseph he be late to-night he be keep at the office reply he mother poor boy i hope he be not work too hard he have be keep nearly every night this week isabel smile at ida for what reason ida could not guess and while she be wonder there come a knock at the outer door and presently joseph enter he be a unprepossessing young man with small eye and thick lip over which it would have be wise of he to wear a big moustache but it be the fashion in the city to be clean-shaven and mr joseph consider himself the pink of fashion he clothes fit he too tightly he wear cheap necktie and ready-made boot of course of patent leather he dark hair be plaster on the low retreat forehead he face be flush instead of be as one would expect pale from overwork ida dislike he at the first glance and dislike he still more at the second as she catch he shifty eye fix on she with a curious and half-insolently admiring expression he come round and shake hand -- he be damp and cold like he father 's -- as mr heron introduce they and in a voice which unpleasantly match he face say that he be glad to see she tired joseph dear murmur he mother regard he with a mixture of pride and commiseration oh i be wear out that be what i be he say as he sink into a chair and regard the certainly untempting food with a eye of disfavor be hard at it all the evening -- he speak with a cockney city accent and be rather uncertain about he aspirate -- i work like a nigger labor be prayer remark he father as if he be enunciate something strikingly original nothing be accomplish without toil my dear joseph my dear joseph regard he father with very much the same expression he have bestow upon the mutton and how do you like london cousin ida he ask he hesitate before the cousin ida and get it out rather defiantly for there be something in the dignity of this pale refined face which awed he it be perhaps the first time in he life mr joseph have sit at the same table with a lady for mr john heron have marry beneath he and for money and in retire from the bar at which he have be a obvious failure have sink down to the society of he wife 's class i have see so little of it reply ida i have only pass through london twice on my way from france to herondale and from herondale here mr joseph be duly impress by the sound of herondale oh you must tell I all about you old home he say with a air of overconfidence to conceal he nervousness and we must show you about london a bit it be a tidy little place he grin with a air of knowingness and seem rather disconcert that ida do not return he smile shall i give you some water ida say mr heron i regret that i can not offer you any wine we have no intoxicant in the house we be all total abstainer on principle the other member of the family look down uncomfortably and to ida 's surprise as if they be ashamed thank you she say i do not care for wine i be afraid there be a great many thing you will miss here say mr heron we be a plain but i trust godfearing family and we be content with the interest which spring from the daily round the common task you will find no excitement at laburnum villa ida as she glance at the family could not help feeling that they be indeed plain but she make haste to say that she do not need any excitement and that she life have hitherto be devoid of they they seem to think that it be the proper thing to sit round the table while she be make she pretence of a meal but when it be finish mr joseph stretch himself out in what be erroneously call a easy-chair and proceed to monopolise the conversation regular busy time in the city he remark to he father never see such a hum it be all over this boom in south africa they be float that new company i be tell you about and the stock exchange be half wild about it they say the share will run to a hundred per cent premium before the week 's out and if you have get any money to spare guv ` nor i should recommend you to have a little flutter for it be a certainty mr heron seem to prick up he ear with a amount of worldly interest which scarcely harmonise with he saintly character what company be that he ask joseph the company start to work sir stephen orme 's reply joseph thrust he hand deep into he pocket and stretch out he leg still farther so that he could admire he large patent-leather clad foot it be about the biggest thing on record and be go to sweep the market all the big ` un be in it griffenberg and wirsch and the belton they say sir stephen have make half a million of money out of it already and that he will make a couple of million before he have do with it there be a rumor in the city to-day that he be to get a peerage for it be a kind of national affair you see ida be sit beyond the radius of the light from the evil-smelling lamp so that the other do not perceive the sudden pallor of she face it seem to she a cruel fate that she could not escape even here so many mile away from herondale from the reminder of the man she have love and lose the name strike on she heart like a stroke cause actual physical pain she sit perfectly still she hand clasp tightly in she lap as the wave of misery sweep over she here be a instance of toil reward say mr heron promptly improve the occasion the labourer be worthy of he hire and no doubt sir stephen orme by bring vast tract under the beneficent influence of civilisation merit the approval of he sovereign and a substantial reward at the hand of he fellow-subject let we trust that he will use he wealth and high position for the welfare of the heathen who rage in the land which he have -- er -- collar put in mr joseph in a undertone and with a grin -- add to the queen 's dominion say mr heron i will consider about the share i do not approve of speculation -- the pursuit of mammon -- but as i should use the money for charitable purpose i may on this occasion -- better make up you mind pretty soon remark joseph with a yawn there be a rush for they already now that the gentleman have get on to business my dear i think we have better retire to the drawing-room say mr heron with a attempt at the grand lady they return to that apartment -- mr joseph do not open the door for they -- and mr heron and isabel at once start on a series of question calculate to elicit all the detail of ida 's past life she father 's death and she present deplorable condition woman can be much more merciless than man in this kind of inquisition and ida weary in mind and body and spirit suffer acutely under the ordeal the two woman do not intend to be unkind -- they be really sorry for the homeless orphan they be prepare to like she they reluctantly and grudgingly admire she beauty and she grace and have a sneak kind of awe of she higher social position of which they be remind by every word she speak the high-bred accent and that indescribable air of delicacy and refinement which indicate good birth but they be devour by curiosity as to she mode of life and she friend a curiosity which they be too vulgar too inconsiderate to restrain so poor ida have to describe the hall and the servant and the way she manage the farm and the way in which she ride about herondale they be very much impressed specially so when she mention lord and lady bannerdale 's kind offer and they exchange glance as the title leave ida 's lip quite as naturally as if they be common name as mr heron afterwards remark to isabel i be afraid you 'll find it very dull here ida say mr heron with a sniff you will not find any society in woodgreen they be nearly all city people and there be not many large house -- this be as large as most -- and john be very strict she sigh and it be evident to ida that though she cousin john 's religion might be some amusement to he it be rather a bugbear and nuisance to he family but we must get joseph to take you about and perhaps you and isabel might go to a _ matine _ or two but john must not know anything about it ida make haste to assure they that she do not need any amusement that she prefer to be quiet and that she hope she cousin joseph would not take any trouble on she account at this point mr heron and he elegant son come in a bell be ring and the two servant come up for family prayer ida notice that both the maid look bored and discontented and that the parlor maid a mere bit of a girl appear to be tire out mr heron read a portion of scripture and offer up a long prayer in a harsh and rasping voice with the manner of a judge pronounce a sentence of seven year and as the servant be leave the room call they back and remark sternly : i notice in the housekeeping book that a larger quantity of candle than usual have be use during the past week and i fear that there have be grievous waste of this useful article do not let it occur again the servant go out suddenly and mrs heron suggest much to ida 's relief that ida would no doubt like to go to bed while ida be brushing she hair and fight against the natural fit of depression cause by she introduction to this cheerful household there come a knock at the door and she admit mr heron that lady be in a soil dressing-gown buy at a sale and quite two size too large for she and with a nervous flush she take from under this capacious garment a small decanter of wine i think you might like a little my dear she say as ida eye it with astonishment of course we be all total abstainer here but we keep a little in the house for medicinal purpose unknown to john and it be a great comfort sometimes when you be tired and in low spirit let I give you a glass ida would have like to have accept it and be sorry that she refusal seem to disappoint mr heron who retire as nervously as she have enter a few minute afterwards before ida have get over she astonishment at the incident there come another knock at the door and isabel enter in a dressing-gown which be own sister to mr heron 's i think there might be something you want she say she bold eye wander over ida curiously and then roam to the contents of ida 's dressing-bag which glitter and shine on the dressing-table what long hair you have do you brush it every night i do not mine not every night it be too much trouble be the top of all those thing real silver what a lot of money they must have cost what a pretty _ peignoir _ you have on : be it real lace yes i see it be you have nice thing with a envious sigh do not you ever have more color than you have get now or perhaps it be because you be tire you must be quite knock up when i come to think of it she drop she voice and glance round cautiously would you like to have a little brandy-and-water i have get same in my room -- of course the rest do not know anything about it father 's teetotal mad -- but i keep a little for when i be tired and down in the mouth and when i run out i get some from joseph 's room of course he be not a total abstainer i daresay you guess that directly you see he to-night and be not take in by he ` late at the office ' business ida look at she in amazement and isabel laugh knowingly joseph go to the theater and play billiards she say with sisterly candor he work it very cleverly he be artful joseph be and he take father and mother in nicely but sometimes i find a theater program in he pocket and mark of chalk on he coat oh i do not blame he the life we lead in this house would make a cat sick it be like be on a tread-mill nothing happen it be just one dreary round with mother always whine and father always preach you hear what he say to the servant to-night i wonder they stand it i should go out of my mind myself if i do not get a little amusement go up to the shop and sneak into a _ matine _ on the sly i be sure i do not know how you 'll stand it after the life you have lead what do you use for you hair it be so soft and silky i wish i have black hair like yours do you put anything on you hand they be rather brown but that be because you have live in the open air so much i suppose i 'll lend you some stuff i use if you like ida decline the brandy and the infallible preparation for whitening the hand and not at all discourage isabel go on : be there any young man at herondale you do not say anything about they down-stair but i think perhaps you would like to tell I when we be alone i suppose there be someone you be sorry to part from she add with a invite smile ida repress a shudder and ply she brush vigorously so that she hair hide the scarlet which suffuse she face i know so few of the people she say as i tell you down-stair my father and i lead the most secluded of life and see scarcely anyone isabel eyed ida sharply and suspiciously oh well of course if you do not like to tell I she say with a little toss of she head but perhaps it be too soon when we know each other better you 'll be more open i be sure i shall be glad of someone to tell thing to she sigh and look down with a sentimental air but ida do not rise to the occasion and with a sigh of disappointment and a last look round so that nothing should escape she isabel take she departure and ida be leave in peace tire as she be it be some time before she could get to sleep the change in she life have come so suddenly that she feel confused and bewildered it have not need joseph heron 's mention of sir stephen orme 's name to bring stafford to she mind for he be always present there and she lay with wide-open eye and ache heart repeat to herself the letter he have send she and wonder why he who she have think love she so passionately have leave she compare with this sorrow and that of she father 's death the smaller misery of she present condition count as naught chapter xxix as isabel have intimate life at laburnum villa be not altogether hilarious the environs of london be undeniably pretty prettier than those of any other capital in europe but there be no shirk the fact that the northern suburb of we great metropolis be somewhat grim and soul-depressing laburnum villa be in a long street which resemble the other street as one tree resemble another and you have to traverse a great many of these street before you get into the open country that be away from the red-bricked and stucco villa and still smaller and uglier house which have be run up by the enterprising jerry-builder but ida would have be glad enough to have go through this purgatory to the paradise of country lane which lay beyond if she could only have go alone but mrs heron and isabel never leave she alone they seem to consider it they duty to keep she company and they could not understand she desire for the open air much less she craving for solitude until ida 's arrival isabel have never take a walk for a walk 's sake and for the life of she she could not comprehend ida 's love of trapese about the dusty lane and over the common where there be always a wind isabel declare to blow she hair about if she go out she like to go up to london and saunter about the hot street gaze in at the shop window or stare enviously at the carriage people as they drive by ida do not care for london take very little interest in the shop and none whatever in the carriage folk she be always pine for the fresh air the breezy common the green tree and on the occasion when she could persuade isabel to a country ramble she walk with dreamy eye that see not the cut-and-dry rusticity of woodgreen and whetstone but the wild dale and the broad extant of the cumberland hill she be indeed live in the past and it be the present that seem a dream to she of course she miss the great house where she have rule as mistress she horse and she cow and dog but what she miss more than all else be she freedom of motion it be the routine the dull common routine of laburnum villa which irk so badly neither mrs heron nor isabel have any resource in themselves they have few friend and they be of the most commonplace not to say vulgar type and a tea at laburnum villa try ida almost beyond endurance for the visitor talk little else but scandal and talk it clumsily most of isabel 's time be spend in construct garment by the aid of paper-pattern which be give away by some periodical admirable pattern which in skilful hand no doubt produce the most useful result but isabel be too stupid to avail herself of they valuable aid and must always add something which render the garment _ outr _ and vulgar mr heron subscribe to a library and she and isabel read the latest six-shilling novel with avidity stuff they under the sofa cushion at the sound of mr heron 's approach footstep they always choose the worst book and forget one as soon as they take up another ida examine one and drop it with disgust for it happen to be a problem novel of the most virulent type a novel which be sell by score of thousand and one which isabel have recommend to ida as delicious of all the day ida find Sunday the worst for on that day they go twice to a little chapel at which mr heron minister it be a tin chapel which by its construction and position strike a chill to one 's very bone here mr heron rant and growl to he heart 's content and ida learn from he sanctimonious lip that only a small portion of mankind he own sect to wit be bind for heaven and that the rest of the world be doom to another place the horror of which he appear to revel in as she sit in the uncomfortable pew ida often wonder whether she cousin really believe what he preach or whether he be a hypocrite of the first water all this be very hard to bear but a burden still heavier be provide for she in the conduct of she cousin joseph on the evening of she arrival he have be gracious enough to bestow upon she a admiration of which she be then unconscious but he admiration grow and he begin to pay she what person of he class call attention he come in much earlier of a evening than he do before and he sit beside she and with he small eye fix on she pale and downcast face tell she anecdote of the office and he fellow-clerk he be under the impression that he possess a voice and with a certain amount of artfulness he get she to play he accompaniment bestow killing look at she as he sing the maid of athen or my pretty June -- with a false note in every third bar sometimes he come home to lunch explain to they that there be nothing do in the city and go with ida and isabel on one of they walk on these occasion he be get up in a norfolk jacket and knickerbockers and enjoy the flattering conviction that he look like a country gentleman he address he conversation exclusively to ida and endeavor as he would have say to make himself agreeable it be all lose upon ida whose head be in the cloud whose mind be dwelling on the past but he mother and sister notice it and mr heron begin to sniff by way of disapproval of he conduct with a mother 's sharp eye mr heron understand why joseph have launch out into new suit and brilliant necktie why he come home earlier than be he wont and why he hang about the pale-faced girl who seem unconscious of he presence mr heron begin to feel as she would have express it that she have take a viper into she bosom she be ambitious for she only son and want to see he marry to one of the daughter of a retired city man who have settle in woodgreen ida be all very well but she be absolutely penniless and not a good enough match for so brilliant and promise a young man as joseph mr heron begin to regard she with a certain amount of coldness and suspicion but ida be as unconscious of the change in mr heron 's manner as she be of the cause of mr joseph 's attention to she he be just a objectionable young man of quite a new and astonishing type to whom she be oblige to listen because he be the son of the man whose bread she eat he have often invite ida to accompany he and isabel to a _ matine _ but ida always decline not only be she father 's death too recent to permit of she go to the theater but she shrink from all public place of amusement when she have leave herondale it have be with the one desire to conceal herself and if possible to earn she own living mr joseph be very sulky over she refusal and isabel inform she that he have be so ill-tempered at the theater that she do not know what to make of he one day he come in soon after luncheon and when mr heron have leave the room inform ida and isabel that he have get ticket for a concert at the queen 's hall that evening it be a sacred concert he say so that you need have no scruple ida it be a regular swell affair and i tell you i have great difficulty in get hold of the ticket it be a charity concert get up by the big nob of the stock exchange and there 'll be no end of swell there i get the ticket because the guv ` nor 's go into the country to preach to-night and while the cat 's away we can slip out and enjoy ourselves not that he would object to a sacred concert i suppose especially if he be allow to hold forth during the interval he add with a sneer it be very kind of you to ask I say ida but i think i would rather stay at home i think you be fond of music joseph remark begin to look sullen we shall go quite quietly and no one need know anything about it for i get ticket for the upper circle and not the stall on purpose and they be in a back row i think you would enjoy this concert and if you do not go i shall tear up the ticket oh do let we go ida plead isabel a sacred concert be not as good as a theater but it will be a break in the monotony besides joseph must have have a lot of trouble to get the ticket for i read in the paper that there be a regular rush for they do not be selfish ida and spoil we enjoyment i wish you would go without I say ida with a sigh but ultimately she yield mr heron of course know that they be go but she be not tell in so many word that she might deny all knowledge of it if the outing come to mr heron 's ear and she watch they with a peevish and suspicious expression on she face as they start for the train they go up second-class and mr joseph who be in the best of humor and wear a new pair of patent-leather boot and a glossy hat to say nothing of a dazzling tie enliven the journey by whisper facetious remark on they fellow-passenger to ida who in vain lean away from he as far as possible in she corner of the carriage and endeavor to concentrate she attention on the program but though she eye be fix on it and she could not entirely shut out joseph 's ill-bred joke she thought be wander back to a certain afternoon when she have sit beside the heron stream and listen to stafford planning out they future he have be tell she something of the great world of which she know nothing but into which he be go to take she hand in hand as it be he be go to take she to the theater and the concert and the dance of which she have read and hear but of which she know nothing by experience now she be go to she first concert with mr joseph heron there be a larger crowd than usual outside queen 's hall that evening for the concert be really a important one for which some of the greatest singer have be engage in addition to pattus santley edward lloyd and other famous professional some distinguished amateur be to perform and royalty as represent by the ever-popular and amiable prince have promise to patronise the affair quite a swell show be not it say joseph as he push he way into the crowd and look over he shoulder at the long line of carriage set down they occupant i be glad you consent to come it would have be a pity if you would miss it i hope we shall be able to see the prince from we seat say isabel whose eye be more widely open than usual and she mouth half agape with excitement i be always stick in some corner where i can not see they when the royal family 's present they succeed in make they way into the hall and after joseph have hold a dispute with the man who have show they into they place and who have muddle the ticket and they number they settle down and ida look round though they seat be in the third row she could see nearly the whole of the large hall and she find the sight a novel and impressive one she interest increase as the admirable band play the first number with the precision and feeling for which the orchestra at the queen 's hall be famous in the interval between the selection and the song which be to follow joseph point out some of the celebrity who be present and whom he recognize by they portrait in the illustrated papers regular swell mob be not it he say exultingly there be not a seat in the house except those three in the stall and i suppose they 'll be fill up presently by some swell or other they always come late be not you glad you have come he add with a languish glance amidst a storm of welcome pattus come forward to sing and ida listen with rapture almost forget she sorrow as she pass under the spell of the magic voice which have sway so many thousand of heart during the cry of encore and unnoticed by ida three person a lady and two gentleman enter the stall and with a good deal of obsequiousness be show by the official into the three vacant seat one great singer follow rapidly after another and ida with slightly flush face and eye that be dim with unshed tear -- for the exquisite music thrill she to the core -- lean back with she hand tightly clasp in she lap she thought fly back to herondale and those summer evening which in some strange way every song recall she be unconscious of she surroundings even of the objectionable joseph who sit beside she as closely as he could and she start slightly as he whisper : those seat be fill up now i wonder who they be they look classy -- particularly so ida nod mechanically and pay no heed presently joseph who be one of those individual who can never sit still or be silent for long at a theater or concert nudge ida and say : look there be one of they stand up why i believe it be -- he borrow a opera-glass from the man sit in front of he and level it at the stall one of the new-comer one of the gentleman have rise from he seat and with he back to the platform be scan the house with a pleasant smile on he handsome face yes it be exclaim joseph excitedly it be sir stephen orme here take the glass and look at he that gentleman look round the house the one stand up with the white waistcoat the one that come in with the other two that be the great sir stephen himself i see he once in the city besides i have see he portrait everywhere that be the man who have create more excitement on the stock exchange than any man in we time ida take the glass which he have thrust into she hand and hold it to she eye but she hand shake and for a moment or two she could distinguish nothing then as the mist pass away and she hand grow steadier so that she could see sir stephen he bent down and say something to the lady sit beside he she look round and ida see distinctly and for the first time though fashionable london be tolerably familiar with it now the beautiful face of maude falconer with she heart beat painfully ida look at she note with a woman 's quickness every detail of the handsome face with its wealth of bronze-gold hair a presentiment flash into she mind and weigh upon she heart as she look a presentiment which be quickly verify for the man on the other side of the beautiful woman rise and look round the house and ida see that it be stafford she hand grip the opera-glass tightly for it be in danger of fall she feel as if she be stifle the great place with its sea of face and its ring of electric light swam before she eye and she feel sick and giddy it seem to she that stafford be look straight at she that he could not fail to see she and she shrink back as far as the seat would allow and a sigh that be a gasp for breath escape she lip which have grow almost as white as she face in take the glass from she joseph notice she pallor what be the matter he ask do you feel ill it be beastly hot would you like to come outside no no she pant with difficulty it be the heat -- i be all right now -- i beg of you not to move -- not to speak to I she fight against the horrible faintness against the shock which have overwhelm she she bite she lip to force the color back to they and try to keep she eye from the tall figure the handsome face against which she have so often press she own but she could not it be as if they be draw to it by a kind of fascination she see that he look pale and haggard and that the glance with which he sweep the house be a wearied one in strange contrast to the smile complacent and even triumphant one of he father be you all right now ask joseph i wish i would bring a bottle of smelling-salt will you come out and get something to drink -- water -- brandy no sure you be all right do you see sir stephen i wonder who the lady be beside he some swell or other i 'll be bind the other man must be sir stephen 's son for he be like he he be almost as great a personage as sir stephen himself you see he name amongst those of people of the highest rank in the fashionable column in the newspaper the lady 's get beautiful ` air have not she he go on after a pause not that i admire that color myself i be go on black ` air he glance insinuatingly at ida 's when the interval expire sir stephen and stafford resume they seat and with a sigh of relief ida try to listen to the music but she could hear stafford 's voice through it and be oblige to shut she eye that she might not see he instinctively and from jessie 's description she know that the beautiful girl with the complexion of a lily and the wealth of bronze-gold hair be maude falconer why be she with sir stephen and stafford be it indeed true that they be engage up to the present moment she have cherish a doubt but now it seem impossible to doubt any longer for how many minute hour year would she have to sit with those two before she she heart rack with the pang of jealousy with the memory of happier day with the ghastly fact that he have go from she life forever and that she be sit there a spectator of he faithlessness every song seem to mock she wretchedness and she have to battle with the mad desire to spring to she foot and cry aloud in a kind of dream she hear the strain of the national anthem and see stafford rise with the rest of the audience and watch he as he draw the costly cloak round maude falconer 's white shoulder in a dream allow joseph to draw she arm through he and lead she down the crowded staircase into the open air splendid concert he say triumphantly but you look tired ida we 'll have a cab to the station but let 's wait a minute and see the prince come out they stand in the crowd which have form to stare at he royal highness and as luck would have it stafford with maude falconer on he arm and follow by sir stephen pass in front of they and so close that ida shrink back in terror lest stafford should see she some of the crowd some stock exchange people probably recognize sir stephen and speak he name aloud and a cheer arise he bow and smile and shake he head in a deprecatory way and ida see stafford 's face darken with a frown as if he be ashamed of the publicity as he hurry maude falconer to the carriage a moment or two after the prince appear there be a excited and enthusiastic burst of cheer and at last joseph force he way out of the crowd and find a cab they have some little time to wait for the train and joseph after vainly press some refreshment on ida go into the refreshment-room and get a drink for himself and a cup of coffee for isabel while ida sink back into a corner of the carriage and wait for they joseph talk during the whole of the journey in a excited fashion dart glance every now and then from he small eye at the white face in the corner when they get out at the station he offer ida he arm and she take it half-unconsciously the path be too narrow to permit of three to walk abreast and joseph send isabel on in front and on some trivial excuse or another contrived to lag some little distance behind she every now and then he press ida 's arm more closely to he side look at she with sidelong and linger glance and at last he say in a kind of whisper so that isabel should not hear : i hope you have enjoy yourself ida and that you be glad you come i do not know when i have have such a jolly night and i hope we may have many more of they of course you know why i be so happy it be because i have get you with I life 's be a different thing for I since you come to live with we but i dessay you have see that have not you he laugh knowingly i have see -- what ask ida try to rouse herself and to pay attention to what he be say i say i suppose you have see how it be with I ida and why i be a halter be it be you who have do it it be because i be right down in love with you there i have say it now i have be go to say it for day past but somehow though i dessay you do not mean it you seem so cold and standoffish and quite different to other girl when a man pay they attention but i dessay you understand now and you 'll treat I differently i be awfully in love with you ida and i do not see why we should not be engage i be get on at the office and if i can squeeze some money out of the guv ` nor i shall set up for myself of course there 'll be a pretty how-d ` y-do over this at home for they be always want I to marry money and unfortunately you have lose yours not that i mind that mind you i believe in follow the dictate of you ` eart and i know what my ` eart say and now what do _ you _ say ida and he press she arm and look into she face with a confident smile ida draw she disengaged hand across she brow and frown as if she be try to grasp he meaning i -- i beg you pardon joseph she say i do not quite understand -- i be think of something else you be ask I -- he redden and push he thick lip out with a expression of resentment well i like that he say uneasily but with a attempt at a laugh i have just be propose to you -- ask you to be my wife and you be go to be not you ida draw she arm from he and regard he with stony amazement for the moment she really think that either he have be drink too much spirit at the refreshment-room at the station and that it be a elaborate joke on he part or that she have lose she sens and be imagine a hideously ridiculous speech too absurd and grotesque for even joseph to have utter then she see by he face that he be sober and that he have actually propose to she and in a kind of desperation she laugh he have be go to take she arm again but he hand fall to he side and he look at she with a mixture of astonishment and indignation with such a expression of wounded vanity and resentment that ida feel almost force to laugh again but she check the desire and say as gently and humbly as she could : i -- i beg you pardon joseph i think it be a -- a joke i be very sorry but though you do not mean it as a jest it be of course absurd i do not think you quite know what you be say i be quite sure you do not mean it -- oh yes but i do he break in eagerly and with a little air of relief i be in earnest ` pon my word i be i be awfully in love with you and if you 'll say yes i 'll stand up to the guv ` nor and make it all square for you but i say ` no ' say ida rather sternly she lip set tightly she eye flash in the darkness which fortunately for joseph hide they from he sight please do not speak to I in this way again but look here he stammer he face red he thick lip twist in a ugly fashion do you know what you be do -- say yes she say more sternly than before i think it be you who do not know what you be say you can not mean to insult I i beg you pardon joseph i do not mean to be angry to hurt you feeling i think you mean to pay I a great honor and i -- i thank you but i can not accept it and please take this as my final answer and never never speak to I again in this manner do you mean to say -- he begin angrily not another word please say ida and she hurry forward so that they come within hearing of isabel nothing more be say until they reach laburnum villa mr heron be wait up for they and be express a hope that they have enjoy themselves -- she have a woollen shawl round she shoulder and speak in a injured voice and with the expression of a long-suffering martyr -- when she catch sight of joseph 's angry and sullen face as he fling himself into a chair and thrust he hand in he pocket and she stop short and look from he to ida and sniff suspiciously and aggressively oh yes say joseph with a ugly sneer and a scowl at ida as she be leave the room we have have a very happy time -- some of we -- a particularly happy time i do not think chapter xxx it be hot at woodgreen but it be hotter still in mayfair where the season be draw to a close with all the sign of a long-spun-out and exhausting dissolution woman be wax pale under the prolonged strain of entertainment which for the last week or two have be matter of duty rather than pleasure and many a girl who have enter the list of society a blushing and hopeful _ dbutante _ with perhaps a ducal coronet in she mind 's eye be begin to think that she would have to be content with say the simpler one of a viscountess or even to wed with no coronet at all many of the man be down at cowe or golfing at st andrew and those unfortunate who be detain in attendance at the house which continue to sit like a broody hen as howard say longed and sigh for the come of the magic 12th of August before which date they assure themselves the house _ must _ rise and so bring about they long-delayed holiday but one man show no sign of weariness or a desire for rest sir stephen 's step be light and buoyant as ever on the hot pavement of pall mall and on the still hotter one of the city he face be as cheery he manner as gay and he voice as bright and free from care as those of a young man there be no elixir like success and sir stephen be drink deeply of the delicious draught he have be well know for year : he be famous now you could not open a newspaper without come upon he name in the city article and in the fashionable intelligence now it be a report of the meeting of some great company at which sir stephen have preside at another time it occur in a graphic account of a big party at the house he have rent at grosvenor square it be a huge mansion and the rent run into many figure but as howard remark it do not matter sir stephen be rich enough to rent every house in the square sir stephen have take over the army of servant and live in a state which be little short of princely : and live alone for stafford who be not fond of a big house and still less fond of a large retinue beg permission to remain at he own by no means over-luxurious but rather modest room it be not improbable that he would have like to have absented himself from the grand and lavish entertainment with which he father celebrate the success of he latest enterprise but it be not possible and stafford be present at the dinner and luncheon reception and concert which go on apparently without a break at clarendon house indeed it be necessary that he should be present and in attendance on he _ fiance _ who appear at every function maude be now almost as celebrate as sir stephen for she beauty she reputed wealth and the fact that she be engage to the son of sir stephen have raise she to a exalted position in the fashionable world and she name figure in the newspaper very nearly as often as that of the great financier she have step from obscurity into that notoriety for which we all of we have such a morbid craving almost in a single day and she queen it with a languid grace and self-possession which establish she position on a firm basis wherever she go she be the center and object of a small crowd of courtier the man admire she and the woman envy she for nowadays most woman would rather marry wealth than rank unless the latter be accompany by a long rent roll -- and in these hard time for landlord too many english nobleman have no rent roll at all short or long except he father 's stafford go to very few house and spend most of he time when not in attendance on maude in the solitude of he own chamber or in the smoking-room of one of the quietest of he club short as the time have be the matter of a few week only since have part from ida he have greatly change so change that not seldom the bright and buoyant and overbright sir stephen seem to be younger than he son he be too busy too absorb in the pursuit of he ambition the skilful steering of the enterprise he have so successfully launch to notice the change but it be notice by other and especially by howard often he watch stafford move moodily about he father 's crowded room with the impassive face which man wear when they have some secret trouble or anxiety which they conceal as the spartan boy conceal the fox which be gnawing at he vitals or howard come upon he in the corner of a half-darkened smoking-room with a expire cigar in he lip and he eye fix on a newspaper which be never turn by that unwritten code by which we be all govern nowadays howard could not obtrude by question he friend and stafford show no sign of make any voluntary statement or explanation he suffer in a silence with which he keep at arm 's - length even he closed friend and howard ponder and worry in a futile attempt to guess at the trouble which have change stafford from a light-hearted man with a immense capacity for pleasure to a moody individual to whom the pleasure of life seem absolutely distasteful one afternoon howard saunter into stafford 's room and find he sit in he easy-chair with a book turn face downward on he knee and he pipe in he mouth tiny the black-and-tan terrier who be lie coil up on a cushion at he master 's foot hear howard step on the stair and bark sharply for a moment then glance at stafford with a reassuring air coil himself up again and subside into spasmodic growl and whine of welcome for the mite be fond of howard asleep staff he ask as with a kind of groan at the heat he drop he hat on the table and sink on to the couch by jove you have the best of it in here -- it be out of the sun at any rate how that dog can lie on a stuffy cushion i think you be go down to lady brook 's at richmond this afternoon be it this afternoon say stafford i would forget i be sorry : but my father will be there and will look after maude howard glance at the weary-looking face as he help himself to a cigarette you be well out of it a lady who would give a garden-party on such a afternoon as this be indeed _ la belle dame sans mercie _ good heaven when i think of the suffer the votary of fashion undergo in one season i have no pity leave for the benighted hindoo woman who sacrifice themselves to juggernaut which remind I that there be a tremendously swagger function on at clarendon house tonight be not there stafford nod and refill and relit he pipe yes he say i have forget it but maude send I round a note to remind I of it and of course i must go i envy you howard : you can stay away that be what i can not do say howard with a whimsical smile i be draw into the vortex i be drag at the chariot wheel of that wonderful father of yours i be the victim of a peculiar kind of fascination which be as irresistible as the mesmeric influence or hypnotism i feel towards sir stephen as i should feel towards napoleon the great if he be alive i follow and gaze at he so to speak with my mouth agape and a fatuous smile over a countenance which i once flattered myself be intelligent i be dazed bewilder by he genius he audacity he marvellous courage and resource do you know stafford i think it would be a excellent idea to abolish the house of lord the house of common the monarchical government and place the whole business in the hand of a board to be preside over by sir stephen stafford draw at he pipe grimly and say nothing and howard go on in the gentle monotone characteristic of he : by the way the mysterious and proverbial little bird have whisper to I that sir stephen will not be sir stephen much longer in fact that they be go to make a peer of he very shortly and upon my word they could not find a better man for the place for unlike some noble lord you and i could mention staff he will wear he robe and coronet -- do they ever wear they now -- right nobly and for once the house of lord will get a man who know he own mind know what he want and the way to get it and if you will not take offence staff and throw thing at I i should like to remark that he son will prove a worthy successor can you fancy yourself in a peer 's robe with a velvet-lined coronet staff stafford grunt for reply and there be silence for a minute during which howard turn over the page of one of the illustrated weekly which lay on the table and suddenly he look up and exclaim : have you see this stafford shake he head i mean this portrait of miss falconer say howard in a low voice it be wonderfully good he go on as he contemplate the full-length picture wonderfully like she he hand the paper across and stafford look at it it be a admirable reproduction of a photograph of maude in evening-dress and make a truly splendid picture and look at it one feel instantly how well a coronet even a ducal one would fit those level brow beneath which the eye look out upon the world with a scarcely mask _ hauteur _ and disdain a man might well be proud of such a woman for he future wife but there be no pride in stafford 's face as he eye dwell moodily on the almost perfect face the tall _ svelt _ figure in its long-trained robe the splendor of she beauty oppress he with a sense of shame and with a involuntary exclamation which sound something like a groan he let the paper slip from he hand and droop still lower in he chair the sight of he be more than howard could bear in silence and he rise and lay a hand upon stafford 's shoulder what be wrong old man he enquire in a very low voice you be out of sort you have be off color for some time past of course i have notice it i have see the look you wear on you face now come over it at moment when you ought to have be at you best and brightest i have see a look in you eye when you lip have be smile that have make I -- uncomfortable in short staff you be get on my nerve and although i know it be like my cheek to mention the matter and that you 'll probably curse my impudence i really should be grateful if you would tell I what ail you still more grateful of you would let I help you to get rid of it i know i be a interfere idiot but i be fool enough to be fond of you -- it be about the only weakness i have get and i be ashamed of it -- but there it be he laugh with a touch of self-contempt with a attempt at he old cynicism but stafford understand the fictitious character of the laugh and as he lean he chin in he hand he give a short nod of acknowledgment howard do you remember that time when you and i be at palmero he say in a low voice and as if he be commune with himself rather than answer he friend do you remember that italian we meet there the man who seem so gay and careless the man who seem to have everything a fellow could desire and to be the embodiment of prosperity and success do you remember how once or twice you and i see a strange look on he face perhaps while he be at dinner or fool with the woman in the _ salon _ -- a look as if he have suddenly remembered something as if something have flash upon he mind in the midst of the laughter and music and bring he face to face with hell you point he out to I one night and we wonder what be the matter with he -- until he fall off he horse that day you and i be ride with he do you remember how when we have unbutton he riding-shirt we find the 'd ' that have be brand on he chest we know then what be the matter with he he have be a deserter the pain of hot iron have die out long ago but the scar remain he be no longer a common soldier but rich and prosperous a social success with perhaps he ambition gratified but the 'd ' be there all the time and every now and then even while he be enjoy himself he could feel the hot iron burning into he flesh and he know within the miserable little soul of he that he be a cur and a coward that drive by fate perhaps by some devilish accident of circumstance he have lose he honor and sell himself to the devil howard 's face go pale and grave i do not see where the application come in staff he say i do not see that anything in you case -- position resemble that poor wretch 's stafford rise he face grim and stern no and i can not show you howard he say do you think that poor devil would have bare he breast and show that would ' to even he dearest friend good god man why do you badger I be i to wear the cap and bell always do you expect I to be dance like a clown every moment of the day do i not play my part as well as i can who give you the right to peer and pry -- he recover suddenly from the fit of fury and grip howard 's arm as he almost shrink back from the burst of despairing rage forgive I old man i do not mean to turn and rend you like this i know you see there be something wrong there be but i can not tell you or any other man there be some thing that have to be bear in silence some mark of the branding-iron which one dare not show to even one 's dearest friend howard turn aside and begin to put on he glove with great care he hand shake and he voice also slightly as without raise he head he say : sure there be no help for it staff sure and certain respond stafford not even you wit and wisdom can be of any avail i will not ask you not to speak of this again it be not necessary but i will ask you never by look or sign to remind I of what i have just say to you it escape I unawares but i 'll keep a better watch on myself for the future and not even the knowledge of you sympathy shall lure another moan out of I he make a gesture with he hand and throw he head back as if he be sweeping something away and in something like he usual voice he say with perfect calmness : by the way maude ask I to tell you not to be late to-night to come before the crush arrive i think she be rely on you to help she in some way or other howard nod and speak with he usual drawl say : ` awake and call I early mother ' i will be there in good time miss falconer do I the great honor of permit I to flatter myself that i be sometimes of some slight service to she i imagine it be something about the cotillon concern which i be absolutely ignorant and be therefore capable of offer any amount of advice i be a whale at give advice and my only consolation be that no one be ever foolish enough to follow it so that i can humor my little foible without suffer the terror of responsibility _ au revoir _ my dear stafford until this evening good-bye tiny what a selfish little beast it be he will not even raise he head stafford laugh and pick up the dog by the scruff of its neck and it nestle against he lovingly and lick he cheek howard go down-stair still put on he glove and as he open the door he swear under he breath fervently chapter xxxi in obedience to miss falconer 's command howard present himself at clarendon house at a comparatively early hour that evening there be some guest stay in the house amongst they lady clansford who be still oblige enough to play the part of preside genius but they be all rest or dress for the ball and the drawing-room into which a couple of superbly liveried footman show howard be empty but presently he hear the _ frou-frou _ of satin and maude falconer sweep in she beauty the splendor of she dress the flash of the diamond in she hair and on she neck and arm she queenly presence almost make howard catch he breath she come in with a languid grace the air of _ hauteur _ which suit she so well but as she see that howard be alone the languor and the _ hauteur _ almost disappear and she come forward and give he she hand and he see a look on she face which remind he of that upon the ill-fated italian though it do not resemble it for the first time he notice a shade of anxiety on the level brow something like a pathetic curve in the perfectly moulded lip and he fancy that the gloved hand which he hold for a moment quiver be stafford not with you she ask i think he be come early he father expect he no i come alone reply howard but no doubt stafford will be here presently she stand calm and statuesque but with she eye downcast for a moment then she raise they and look at he about this cotillon she say then she break off : do you know what be go to happen to-night it be a secret but -- but i feel as if i must tell you though i be betray sir stephen 's confidence he tell I everything -- more than he tell even stafford strange as it may seem he -- he be fond of I that do not seem strange to I say howard with a little bow she make a slight gesture of impatience it seem strange to I she say with a touch of bitterness so few person be fond of I howard smile for once i must be guilty of contradict a lady he say when i reflect that to-night i shall form one of a band of devoted courtier who will throng round you in the hopeless pang of despair -- she repeat the gesture of impatience have you see stafford to-day she ask look down i see he a few hour ago he reply at he room at he room she repeat with a slight frown and a quick glance at he he promise to come to richmond why do he not do so be he -- ill ill say howard raise he brow and smile for he know the meaning of loyalty to a friend i never see he in better spirit in my life he be quite hilarious she eye flash upon he keenly but he meet they with he slow cynical smile he must have be very different to what he usually be she say i have not see he laugh since -- since we leave bryndermere she lip come tightly together and she look at he and then away from he mr howard you be he friend he closest friend i want you to tell I -- but no you would not speak if you be on the rack would you no one see no one speak it be only i who always watch he see that there be something wrong and i -- i be so helpless the outburst be so unlike she the drop of the mask of pride and self-possession be so sudden that howard be startle but no sign of he emotion reveal itself upon he placid face upon which he serene smile do not waver for a instant i think you be avail yourself of a lady 's privilege and indulge in a fancy miss falconer he say stafford be perfectly well and of course be perfectly happy -- how could he be otherwise he bent he head slightly perhaps he may be a little tired alas we be not all endowed with the splendid energy which the god have bestow on you and sir stephen and the heat be enough to take the backbone out of anyone less gifted she check a sigh as if she understand that it be useless to appeal to he and after a pause howard say : you have not tell I the great secret yet she seem to wake from a reverie and say listlessly : it will not be a secret for many hour sir stephen be expect the peerage to-night the official intimation should have reach he by midday but the prime minister do not return to london till this afternoon and the formality be not complete i think it will be announce to-night she eye shine and a spot of color start to she cheek you be glad howard say with a smile of sympathy that have something of mockery in it for you worldly cynic be always amuse by worldliness in other yes i be glad but not for my own sake you think i be pine for a coronet i do not care -- it be for stafford 's sake that i be glad nothing be too good for he no

stafford -- my boy he cry in accent of despair stafford spring to he father -- i be here he say for sir stephen 's gaze grow vacant as if he have be stricken blind the next moment he throw up he arm and with a gasp fall forward stafford catch he as a cry of terror rise from the crowd which fall back as if suddenly awed by some dreadful presence and force he way through it a famous doctor reach the father and son there be a moment of awful suspense then -- the music sound like a mockery in the silence -- all know though no word have be speak that the great sir stephen -- pardon the right honorable the earl of highcliffe -- be dead chapter xxxii by a stroke as of heaven 's lightning the house of joy be turn into the house of mourning they bear the dead man to he room plain and simple even in that mansion of luxury the guest depart some of they fly as from a pestilence some of they linger with white and dazed face and hushed whisper and stafford be leave alone with he dead for he have shut the door even upon howard who pace up and down outside not daring to force he sympathy upon he beloved friend the morning papers give a full account of the grand ball the announcement of sir stephen 's peerage and the sudden and tragic end to a life which have be live full in the public gaze a life of struggle and success which have be cut down at the very moment of extreme victory they recite the man 's marvellous career and hold it up to the admiration and emulation of he fellow englishman they call he a pioneer one who have add to the empire they hint at a public funeral -- and they all discreetly ascribe tell upon a weak heart sir stephen 's precarious condition have be know they say to he medical adviser who have for some time past try to persuade he to relinquish he arduous and nerve-racking occupation and to take repose not a word be say about the cablegram which have be deliver to he a few moment before he terribly sudden death for it be feel by all that nothing should be allow to blur the glory of such a successful career -- not for the present at any rate there be no need for a inquest the great physician who have be in attendance quite vainly be prepare to certify to the cause of death and stafford 's feeling be spare thus far someone high in authority suggest the idea of a public funeral through howard whom alone stafford saw but stafford decline the honor and the first earl of highcliffe be carry to he last rest as quietly as circumstance would permit the press and the man of the city with whom the dead man have work keep silence about the catastrophe that have happen until after the funeral then rumor arise at first in whisper and then more loudly and paragraph and leaderette appear in the papers hint at something wrong in connection with lord highcliffe 's last great scheme and call for a enquiry the morning after the funeral howard find stafford sit in a darkened room of the great house he head in he hand a morning paper lie open on the table before he he raise he white and haggard face as howard enter and take he friend 's hand in silence howard glance at the paper and bit he lip yes say stafford i have be read this you have see it howard nod you know what it mean i want you to tell I i have be put off the question day by day selfishly i could not face it until -- until he be bury but i can put it off no longer i must know now what be that cablegram which they bring he just before -- which you try to keep from he you have not read any of the newspaper ask howard gravely brace himself for the task from which he soul shrink stafford shake he head no i have not be able to i have not be able to do anything scarcely to think the blow come so suddenly that i have feel like a man in a dream -- dazed bewildered if i have be able to think at all it be of he love for I he goodness to I there never be such a father -- he voice break and he make a gesture with he hand even now i do not realize that he be go that i shall never see he again i be so fond of he so proud of he why do you hesitate if it be bad news and i suppose it be do you think i can not bear it howard there be nothing that you could tell I that could move I or hurt I fate have deal I its very worst blow in take he from I and nothing else can matter the cablegram this that the paper say what do it mean howard sit on the table so that he could lay he hand with a friend 's loving and console touch on stafford 's arm i have come to tell you staff he say i know that you ought to know -- but it be hard work -- that cablegram contain news that the zulus have rise _ en masse _ and that for a time perhaps for year the railway scheme be block if not utterly ruin it be the one weak link in the chain and you father be aware of it and have take what measure he could to guard against the danger but fate circumstance be too much for he a silly squabble so silly as to be almost childish between some squatter on the border and the discontented native upset all he carefully lay plan and turn a gigantic success at its very zenith into a tragic failure stafford lean he head upon he hand and look steadily at howard it be that that kill he he say it mean ruin i suppose ruin for he and other howard nodded yes he have stake all upon this last throw and the sudden reverse come at a moment when he nerve be strain to the utmost when he be excite with the honor and glory he have achieve the blow be too sudden the revulsion of feeling from exultation to despair too swift too great it be one of the most awful thing of which i have ever hear or read man be speak about it with bated breath there be nothing but pity for he nothing but regret at the stroke of misfortune which cut he down in the moment of he triumph and other repeat stafford it have bring ruin upon other what can i do be there anything i can do i be so ignorant i do not even know whether i sit here absolutely penniless or whether there be anything leave that i can give they mr falconer and murray and the lawyer be in the library say howard they have be go into affair they would have like to have have you with they but i begged you off i know you would be of no use to they stafford look he thanks no i could not have help they he say no one know less of my poor father 's affair than i no one be less capable of deal with they than i mr falconer will know what to do it be very good of he to come to my assistance i have scarcely see he i have not see anyone but you and maude say howard interrogatively no say stafford he brow draw together i have not see she she have be ill -- yes say howard in a low voice she be prostrate by the shock poor girl you will go to she as soon as she be able to leave she room yes of course say stafford very gravely and wearily there be a knock at the door and the footman in he mourning livery come in and say solemnly : mr falconer would like to know if you will see he my lord a frown cross stafford 's pale face at the my lord it sound strange and mockingly in he ear i will come at once he say come with I howard they go to the library and the three man who be sit there before a mass of papers rise to receive he falconer with a face as if it be carve out of wood murray with anxious brow the lawyer with a grave and solemn countenance and sharp alert eye stafford wave they to they seat and take a chair at the table and falconer with a straight underlip and eye half conceal by they thick lid speak for the other very sorry we can not leave you in peace for a little longer lord highcliffe he say but i be quite sure you would have blame we have we do so we have be go into you father 's affair and i very much regret that we can not give you a favourable report of they as you know the will which mr chaffinch he nod at the lawyer read this morning leave you everything and name mr chaffinch and mr murray here executor that be all very proper and satisfactory as it go but unfortunately we find that there be no estate murray the secretary pass he hand over he wrinkled forehead and sigh as if he himself have make away with the vast sum of money and the lawyer frowned and shuffle the papers before he stafford sit with he hand clasp on the table he eye fix on falconer 's impassive face you father 's immense fortune be wholly embark in this last business continue mr falconer he believe in it and stake everything on it a very large number of the share be hold by he they be down to nothing to-day it be very unlikely that they will recover it be possible that they never may and if they should it would be too late for the share you father hold will of course go to meet the claim -- and they be heavy -- on the estate i do not know whether i make myself understand : i be aware that you be not a business man stafford incline he head my father 's debt -- will they not be pay will there not be sufficient he ask in a dry voice mr falconer purse he lip and shake he head i be afraid not in fact i can say definitely that they will not he reply in a hard uncompromising way stafford look round the large superbly furnished room with its book-case of ebony and wedgewood its costly picture and bronze and recall the villa with its luxury and splendor and the vast sum which sir stephen have spend during the last few month it seem difficult to realize that the wealth be all go what be to be do he ask in a low voice mr falconer be silent for a moment as he regard the handsome face which seem to have lose its aspect of youth and take on the line and hollow of age i do not know it be not for I to say there will be a meeting of the director of the south african company and other to-morrow and some decision will be come to i have no doubt and i -- i can do nothing say stafford huskily i be penniless i suppose both murray and mr chaffinch raise they head with a air of surprise penniless echo mr chaffinch certainly not my lord surely you know stafford regard he gravely it seem as if he himself be too crush by he grief for surprise know he say what be in i should know i do not understand mr falconer cough we think you be aware of the existence of the deed that you father have inform you lord highcliffe what deed ask stafford dully i be sorry to appear so dense but i have not the least idea of you meaning as you say mr falconer i know nothing of business it be evident that you father do not tell you that he execute a deed of gift in you favor a gift of one hundred thousand pound say mr falconer which deed be make when he be quite solvent can not be upset the money be place in trust and be quite beyond the reach of the creditor say mr chaffinch we think you be aware of this my lord stafford shake he head he evince no sign of relief the color do not rise to he face and he eye be still fix on falconer it be a very wise provision say mr chaffinch approvingly and distinctly one i should have recommend but sir stephen -- lord highcliffe -- do it of he own accord he be a far-seeing man and he be aware that fortune might fail he that it be necessary he should place you my lord out of danger i can well believe that even at that time he see the peerage come and feel that you should be make secure that you should have a sufficient income to support the title it be not a tenth a twentieth of the sum you would have inherit but for this unfortunate accident of the native rise and the collapse of the south african company stafford scarcely hear he he be think of he father 's loving foresight and care for he son 's future a pang of bereavement shot through he very wise say mr falconer grimly whatever happen lord highcliffe be safe high and dry above water mark carefully invest the capital sum may be make to produce a income of four thousand or thereabout not too much for a earldom but -- ah well it might be so much worse the servant -- the small debt -- this house -- be there enough for they ask stafford after a pause mr chaffinch wave he hand no need to trouble about that my lord there will be sufficient at the bank to pay such small claim you lordship will keep the house on stafford look up with a sudden energy no he say not a moment longer than be necessary i shall return to my old room there be no occasion begin mr chaffinch i need scarcely say that the bank will honor you lordship 's cheque for any amount please get rid of this house as soon as possible say stafford he rise as he speak you will remain to lunch they murmur a negative and stafford beg to be excuse leave the room signing to howard to follow he he do not mean it but he manner in the abstraction of he grief be as lordly as if he have inherit a earldom of five century when they have get back to the little darkened room in which he have sit since he father 's death stafford turn to howard : at what time and place be this meeting to-morrow howard he ask at gloucester house broad street four stafford nod and be lose in thought for a moment or two then he say : howard will you send my horse to tattersall 's and the yacht to the agent for sale there be nothing else i think i use to have some diamond stud and ring but i have lose they i be always careless great heaven when i think of the money i have spend money that i would give my life for now but my dear old chap a hundred thousand pound four thousand a year -- it be not too much for a man in you position but there be no need to sell you horse stafford lay he hand on howard 's shoulder and look into he eye and laugh strangely then he hand drop and he turn away with a sigh leave I now howard he say i want to think -- to think he sink into a chair when howard have go and try to think of he future but it be only the past that rise to he mind and it be not altogether of he father that he think but of -- ida in he sacrifice of himself he have sacrifice she and fate have punish he for he forced treachery he sit with he head in he hand for hour recall those eye and yes kiss she sweet lip god what a bankrupt he be he father he sweetheart he wealth -- all have be take from he he do not think of maude chapter xxxiii at noon the follow day there be a large meeting at gloucester house there gather the belton baron wirsch griffenberg and the title and untitled folk who have be concern in sir stephen orme 's big scheme and they be all gloomy and in a bad temper for all of they have lose money and some of they be well-nigh ruin by the collapse of the company which be to have make they fortune they come before noon the appoint hour and talk sometimes in undertone but not seldom in loud and complain voice by one and all the dead man be blame for the ruin in which he have involve they they have leave the whole thing in he hand : he ought to have foresee ought to have take proper precaution they have be -- well if not dupe and deceive the victim of he criminal sanguineness and carelessness griffenberg be one of the heaviest loser be elect to the chair but beyond make a statement which tell they nothing he could do little when he inform they that lord highcliffe have die practically insolvent a murmur arise a deep guttural murmur which be something between a hiss and a groan and it be while this unpleasant sound be fill the room that stafford enter the groan if groan it can be call die away and they all turn and look at he pale and careworn face the tall figure in its deep mourning dress silence they for the moment griffenberg sign stafford to a seat beside he i be sure we can tell lord highcliffe that we be glad to see he that we be much oblige for he attendance some few say hear hear but the rest be silent and watchful as griffenberg speak the door open again and ralph falconer enter he glance at stafford and knit he brow but drop heavily into a chair and sit with stony face and half-lowered lid he have scarcely take he seat when howard enter in he quiet fashion and he go and stand just behind stafford i be just tell the meeting lord highcliffe that i be afraid we be in a bad way say griffenberg we all rely so completely on sir stephen -- i beg pardon lord highcliffe you father -- that we feel ourselves helpless now -- er -- leave in the lurch the company be in great peril there have already be heavy loss and we fear that we property will be swallow up -- ask he what sir stephen do with all he money cry a excited shareholder order say mr griffenberg lord highcliffe be not here to answer question then what be he here for retorted another man whose loss amount to a few hundred but who be more excited and venomous than those who have many thousand at stake he be all right he be a lord -- a pretty lord -- and i be tell the gentleman he be next to be he future father-in-law and be roll in money -- order order call griffenberg but the man decline to be silence oh it be all very well to call ` order ' but i have a question to ask i want to know whether it be true that sir stephen -- blow ` lord highcliffe ' sir stephen 's good enough for I -- make over a hundred thousand pound to he son the young gentleman sit there some of we be ruin by this company and we do not see why we should be shear while lord highcliffe get off with a cool hundred thousand i ask the question and i wait for a answer stafford rise he pale handsome face look almost white above he black frock-coat and black tie sit down do not

solvent -- i say so do not i yell the man who have put the question order order say griffenberg and i be inform that the gift be legal that it can not be touch -- of course it can not trust sir stephen to look after he own wail the man but i yield it give it up say stafford in the same level voice falconer start from he seat and lay a hand on stafford 's arm do not be a fool he whisper in he thick voice but stafford do not heed he i give it up relinquish it he say in the same low clear tone when my father -- he voice again shake for a moment but he master he emotion -- make the deed he think himself a rich man if he be alive to-day -- there be a pause and the meeting hang on he word -- he would entirely agree with what i be do i give up the deed of gift i relinquish it my lawyer have make I the proper document and i now give it to you chairman it be all i possess if i have more i would give it to you my father be a honorable man if he be here now -- he place the deed before griffenberg and sink into he seat there be a moment of intense silence then a cheer arise lead by the very man who have put the question griffenberg spring to he foot i hope you be satisfied gentleman he say with as much emotion as a city man can permit himself lord highcliffe have behave like a gentleman like a nobleman i can assure you that he sacrifice be a real one the deed of gift which he have surrender be a perfectly sound one and could not have be touch all honor to he for he surrender for he generosity another cheer arise -- again it be start by the very man who have attack poor stafford and before it have cease to ring through the crowded room stafford have make he way out mr falconer catch he by the arm as he be go down the stair do you know what you have do he demand in he dry harsh voice you have make yourself a pauper stafford stop and look at he with a dull vacant gaze a pauper repeat falconer huskily i daresay say stafford wearily and you a earl say falconer he face a brick-dust red do you think they will have any pity not they they 'll take you at you word they 'll have every penny how do you mean to live you the earl of highcliffe stafford pass he hand across he brow and a smile a grim smile curve he lip i do not know he say the money be theirs not mine stuff and rubbish say falconer you think only of yourself of you father 's good name i need scarcely tell you that maude stafford wait he pale face set like a statue 's -- that maude -- well you do not expect she to consider the engagement binding after -- after this the blood rush to stafford 's face i understand he say miss falconer be free i resign all claim to she at this moment howard come out he have almost fight he way from the crowded room stafford he cry it be not too late you can take it back they be friendly stafford smile i have nothing to take back he say howard link he arm in he friend 's good lord but it be splendid but all the same -- stafford have you consider it will leave you practically penniless i know say stafford i have consider let we go home they go home to stafford 's room howard be hot with the enthusiasm of admiration and with the effort to suppress it for nowadays man do not tolerate praise even from they dearest friend it seem to howard as if stafford 's act of renunciation have bring he a certain sense of relief as if some portion of the heavy weight have be lift from he heart of course now we have to go into a committee of way and mean my dear staff you will not mind my ask you what you be go to do i need not say that there be no need for any precipitate action i -- er -- the fact be staff i have a sum of money lie at the bank which absolutely annoy I by its uselessness the bank manager have be bother I about it for some time past and it be such a nuisance that i thought of toss he whether he should take or i it be not much -- a man do not amass a large fortune by write leader for the newspaper and article for review -- but of course you would not be so mean as to refuse to borrow what there be i be very much afraid that you 'll suffer by this absurdly quixotic action of yours which mind you though i admire it as i admire the siege of troy or the battle of waterloo be a piece of darned foolishness however let that go what do you mean to do i do not know yet say stafford he do not thank howard for the offer no thanks be necessary the thing be so sudden that i have not make any plan i suppose there be something i can do to earn my living i have no brain but i be pretty strong i might drive a hansom cab or a omnibus better man than i have do worse leave I alone old man to have a pipe and think of it howard linger for a hour or two for he feel that though stafford have dismiss he he have need of he and when he

envelope he look at it vacantly for a moment or two then he laugh a laugh that be not altogether one of derision or amusement chapter xxxiv ida have find she life at laburnum villa hard enough in all conscience before the night of the concert but it become still harder after mr joseph 's condescending avowal of love to she and she inevitably scornful refusal she avoid he as much as possible but she be force to meet he at the family breakfast a meal of a cold and dismal character generally partaken of by the amiable family in a morose and gloomy silence or to a accompaniment of irritable and nagging personal criticism mr heron who suffer from indigestion be always at he worst at breakfast time mr heron invariably appear meaner and more lachrymose isabel more irritable and dissatisfied and joseph whose bloodshot eye and swollen lip testify to the arduous character of he late work at the office go through the pretence of a meal with a sullen doggedness which evince itself by something like a snarl if any one address he hitherto he have of course be particularly not to say unpleasantly civil to ida but after he repulse he manner become mark by a covert insolence which be intend to remind she of she dependent position and the fact that she most direct means of escape from it be by accept he as she lover this manner of he offensive as it be intend to be ida could have bear with more or less equanimity for to she alas joseph heron seem of very little more account then one of the tradesman 's boy she see occasionally come up to the house but after treat she to it for a day or two in the hope of break she spirit as he would have express it he manner change to one of insinuate familiarity he address she in a low voice almost a whisper so that he sister and mother could not hear and he smile and nod at she in a would-be mysterious manner as if they be share some secret though ida do not know it it be mean to rouse mr heron 's suspicion and it succeed admirably she thin narrow face would flush angrily and she would look across at isabel significantly and isabel would snigger and toss she head as if she quite understand ida often go to here own room before mr joseph return at night but sometimes he come in before she have go and he make a practice of sit near she even venture on occasion to lean over the back of she chair he mother watch he out of the corner of she eye and with she thin lip draw down and although ida invariably get up and go to another part of the room she avoidance of joseph do not lull he mother 's suspicion ida 's contempt for the young man be too profound to permit of such a sentiment as hatred -- one can scarcely hate that which one scorn -- but whenever he come near she with he tobacco and spirit-laden breath she be conscious of a inward shudder which closely resemble that with which she pass through the reptile house at the zoological garden mr joseph the house the whole life begin to get on she nerve and in the solitude of she own room she spend many a anguished hour try to discover some way of escape she read all the advertisement of situation vacant in the newspaper but all the employer seem to require technical knowledge and accomplishment which she do not possess she know she could not teach even the youngest of child she be unacquainted with the mysterious science of short-hand and have never see a typewriter no one appear to want a young lady who could break horse tend cattle or run a farm and this be the only kind of work she could do so she be force to the bitter conclusion that she would have to go on live the life and eat the bread of the heron with as much patience as she could command in the hope that some day something would happen to release she from she bondage which be gradually rob she eye of they brightness and make she thin and listless it seem that nothing ever would happen that the week would drag into month and the month into year and one day as she toil slowly home from a country walk she almost feel inclined to turn to that last refuge of the destitute and answer one of the advertisement for a lady 's help : anything would be better than to go on live the life in death which be she lot at laburnum villa as she approach the house she see that the gas be light in the drawing-room and the sound of voice in which a strange one mingled penetrate through the thin door as she pass through the hall to she room while she be take off she hat there come a hurry knock and isabel enter in she best dress she be flush and in a flatter of suppress excitement oh ida can you lend I a clean collar she ask in a stage whisper and with a giggle which be intend to invite question but as ida have ask none isabel say with another giggle : you have hear I speak of george powler ida look doubtful : isabel have mention so many man generally by they christian name who be suppose to be smite by she that ida often listen absently enough to the foolish girl 's confidence not seldom get mix the one who go to south australia isabel go on with a affectation of coy shyness we use to see a great deal of he -- at least he use to call -- before he go away and though there really be nothing serious between we of course -- but one do not like to speak of these thing even to one 's bosom friend but he be down-stair just now i just have time to run up and he actually almost see I on the stair yes this one will do : you always have such good-shaped collar and yet you have always live in the country i must be quick and hurry down : man do so hate to be keep wait do not they you 'll come down presently will not you ida i be sure you 'll like he : he be so steady : and it be a very good business of course as i say nothing definite have pass between we but -- she giggle and simper significantly and ida try to force herself to take some interest fasten the collar for isabel and gently and with much tact persuade that inartistic young lady to discard a huge crimson bow which she have stick on she dress with disastrous result when some little time after ida go down to the drawing-room she find that the visitor be like most of those who come to laburnum villa very worthy people no doubt but uninteresting and commonplace this mr george powler be a heavy thick-set man approach middle age with the air of a prosperous merchant and with a somewhat shy and awkward manner it seem to ida that he look rather bore as he sit on one of the stiff uncomfortable chair with the mother and daughter engaging he in conversation as they would have call it he shyness and awkwardness be intensify by the entrance of the tall graceful girl in she black dress and he rise to receive the introduction with a startled kind of nervousness which be reasonable enough for the young woman with whom he associate be not dower with ida 's very palpable grace and refinement ida bow to he make some remark about the weather and go over with a book to the sofa with the broken spring -- and promptly forget he existence but she indifference be not reciprocate the man be painfully aware of she presence and after endeavor to carry on the conversation with isabel grow absent-minded and incoherent and presently as if he could not help himself get up and edge to the sofa nervously sit down and try to talk ida close she book and as in duty bind be civil to he though not perhaps so civil as she would have be to a man of she own age and class but mr george powler no doubt encourage by she gentleness serenity and perfect self-possession -- quality none too common in the class to which he belong -- grow less nervous and to he own amazement find himself talk presently quite fluently to this distinguished-looking young lady whose entrance of the drawing-room have strike he with awe with instinctive courteousness and kindness ida have ask he some question about south australia and he be lead to talk of he life there and to describe the country ida find she thought wander after a few minute and grow absent-minded but mr george powler be launch on he favorite subject be delighted with the condescension of the beautiful and stately listener and do not notice that she be scarcely listen do not notice also that mr heron be look discontented and sniff peevishly and that isabel 's face wear a expression of jealousy and resentment the fact be that the poor man have quite forget the other young woman -- and the other young woman know it suddenly they silence bear down upon ida 's absent-mindedness she feel rather than see that something be the matter and she get up in the middle of one of mr george powler 's fluent but badly construct sentence and go over to isabel ask she to play something isabel flush oh you have better sing she say mr powler would like that better _ i be _ sure oh yes please do plead the man and ida try to conceal she weariness and distaste go to the piano and sing the shortest song she know she acquiescence be unfortunate in its result for it complete in mr george powler 's bosom the havoc which she face and voice have work he press she to sing again beat time with he large hand and badly groomed head and be enthusiastic in he praise and seem so disappointed when she refuse that he second she appeal to isabel with a obviously force politeness isabel go to the piano but she be at no time a very brilliant performer and the poor girl be so upset by ida 's unconscious and unwilling superiority that she break down in the middle of one of those hideous drawing-room piece which seem specially arrange for the torture of those who be bless or curse with musical taste the conversation naturally lag and languish under these circumstance and mr george powler presently rise to take he leave he be not ask to remain to dinner though mr heron have intend invite he and have make secret and flurry preparation he shake hand with ida with marked _ empressement _ and nervousness and seem as if he could scarcely tear himself away when he have go the mother and daughter sit bolt upright in they chair and stare before they in a pregnant silence and ida wonder what be the matter be about to leave the room when mr heron say in a hard thin voice : one moment ida if you please ida pause at the door with she book in she hand startle from she dreaminess by the woman 's tone and manner you have better close the door ida i should not like the servant to overhear what it be my duty to say to you ida close the door and stand expectantly and mrs heron continue : i trust i be not one to find fault unnecessarily i know it be the duty of a christian to be patient and long-suffering but there be a limit to one 's endurance and i regret to say that you have pass that limit i should not be fulfil my duty to a young person who be under my charge if i refrain from point out to you that you conduct since you have be under we roof have be reprehensible and disgraceful ida be too amaze for a moment to realize the full significance of the spiteful speech and then as it gradually dawn upon she the blood rise to she face and a indignant protest rise to she lip but she check it and merely repeat the objectionable phrase yes disgraceful say mr heron i be sorry to be compel to use such a word to a young girl and to one in you position and i do not think you make matter better by pretend not to know what i mean it be no pretence mr heron say ida quite calmly i do not in the least know what you mean then i 'll tell you retort mr heron with suppress fury you be one of the most shameless flirt i ever know ida fall a almost irresistible desire to laugh she have be tire when she come in mr george powler 's attention have make she still more weary and the sight of the two woman seat bolt upright and evidently boil over with anger be full of a grotesque humor which affect she hysterically she manage to stifle the laugh and look at they patiently and calmly as she stand by the mantel-piece with one arm rest on the shelf the unconscious ease and grace of she attitude increase mr heron 's irritation she thin lip tremble and she eye grow red oh i be not blind she say i have be quite aware of you conduct for some time past but i have refrain from speak to you because as i say you be under my roof and i do not wish to hurt you feeling -- though i be sure you have have very little regard for ours i have be greatly deceive in you ida i think when you come that you be a quiet well-conducted young woman and i could scarcely believe my eye when i first saw that i be mistaken and that you quietness be only slyness i suppose you do not think i see that you be try to entrap my poor boy but a mother 's eye be sharp and a mother will protect she own at any cost oh you need not try to stare I out of countenance or to put on that surprised and innocent look you may have be able to deceive I once but you can not now i have be watch you and i have see with my own eye you carrying on mr heron -- begin ida very quietly but mrs heron tear on with breathless vehemence i suppose you only do it for you amusement i do not suppose you think there would be any good in it that he father or i would allow joseph to make such a _ fool _ of himself as to throw himself away upon a girl without any means but it be all the more shameful you succeed very well you have turn the poor boy 's head and make he miserable it be to be hope that it will stop there and that he will not be drive to drink or desperate course as some young man be of course you 'll say that you never mean anything of the kind i be quite prepare for that -- you can be plausible enough when you like with that quiet cat-like manner of yours ida have pass beyond the laughing stage by this time she face be pale she eye flash but she be able to say with a appearance of calm : you be quite right mr heron i have no hesitation in say that i do not wish you son to pay I any attention much less -- oh do you not see how ridiculous it be she break out indignantly and with a little desperate laugh mr heron 's face flame i do not know what you mean by ridiculous she snap i should say joseph be quite good enough a match for you and i have no doubt you think so though you pretend to sneer at he let I assure you mr heron that i have never think of you son as a possible husband say ida he attention to I be more than unwelcome -- and he know it oh then you admit that the poor boy be in love with you that he have tell you you see you can not deceive I i know it i wonder you be not ashamed of yourself at any rate have cause trouble in the house that shelter you that you have not shame enough to refrain from flirt before we very eye with the first man that appear ida stare at she in amazement too great for the moment to permit of resentment what be this you accuse I of she ask oh pray pray do not be so unreasonable so unjust mr heron wag she head as one who be not to be deceive by any affectation of innocence no thank you ida she exclaim that will not do for we we have see it with we own eye have not we isabel isabel take out she handkerchief and begin to whimper i should never have think it of you ida she sob and with george too and i would only just tell you that -- that there have be thing between we i do think you might have leave he alone ida be half distract but you really can not mean it she plead i have do nothing say nothing you surely do not complain of he speak to I of he be simply civil and polite heaven know i have no desire to exchange a word with he i would not have come down if isabel have not ask I and i have think you would have consider it rude of I to remain upstairs oh what can i say to convince you that you be mistake that i never give a think to this gentleman -- i forget he name -- that i do not care if i never see he again and that -- isabel surely you do not think I capable of the -- vulgarity the stupidity with which you mother charge I isabel 's sniff and sob only grow louder and she demonstrative misery work mr heron to a higher pitch of resentment and virtuous indignation that be right isabel do not answer she it be all pretence and deceit on she part she know very well that she be do she best to attract he attention smile and make eye at he and attempt to catch he just as she have catch poor joseph ida 's slight figure spring erect she face grow crimson and she eye flash with a just wrath which could no longer be suppress i think you must be mad she say in a low voice indeed you must be mad or you would not insult I in this way if i be guilty of the conduct of which you accuse I i should not be fit to live should not be fit to remain in any respectable house you be guilty retort mr heron and as to you be fit to remain under this roof -- and it be a respectable and happy one until you come -- you be the best judge i shall inform you cousin john of what have pass -- it be my duty to do so -- and he shall decide whether you be to remain a firebrand and a disturber of the peace of a christian household it be my duty to protect my poor boy at that moment the hall door be open and close and the poor boy after shuffling about in the hall for a moment or two open the drawing-room door he hat be on the back of he head one end of he collar be unfastened he face be flush and there be mud on he coat as if he have fall -- which he have he lurch into the room with a tipsy leer and nod to they with a affectation of extreme sobriety which be unfortunately always assume by the individual who be hopelessly intoxicated mr heron rise with outstretched hand oh joseph be you ill my poor boy ill he repeat with a hiccough no i be not ill yes i be though it be mental worry it be a ` arassed ` eart he look at ida and shake he head reproachfully _ she _ know but she do not care -- but whatsh the matter he break off stare at isabel who be still struggle with she sniff and sob whatsh up whatsh isabel cryin ' for ida be cryin ' too look ` ere i will not shtand that if they have bin ill-treating you ida my dear you shay so and i 'll know the reashon why you come to I my dear he lurch towards ida and as she draw back with a shudder of horror and loathing isabel and he mother catch the wretched young man by the arm and with cry of alarm and commiseration endeavor to soothe he do not speak to she do not think of she she be not worth it say mr heron she be not worth any sensible man 's thought least of all a man like you joseph you be ill you must come to bed stuff a ' ` umbug he

undershtand one another twin shoul we have kep ' we secret from you mother but the time have come -- the time have come to reveal the truth i love ida it ` sh no good you frowning at I like that i

with isabel 's assistance hustle and push he up the stair before he father be let in after a time mr heron come down again and ida hear she and she husband talk together -- you could not whisper in one room of laburnum villa without be hear in another one -- and presently the drawing-room door open and john heron enter ida have wait for she have expect he he be red and swollen with pomposity and resentment though he assume a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger air and throw a deeply grieved tone into he harsh raucous voice i be deeply grieved and shocked ida he begin to hear from you cousin so deplorable a account of you conduct i be not so unwise as to look for gratitude in this world but i do not think you would repay we kindness and consideration by attempt to wreck the happiness of a quiet and godly home of course i make all allowance for you bringing-up i be aware that in the state of life from which we rescue you the spiritual and the religious be entirely absent but i have hope that we precept and i may say example the influence of a deeply religious family -- by this time he voice have slide into the nasal whine and growl which it assume in the pulpit and ida notwithstanding she wretchedness again feel a almost irresistible desire to laugh please tell I cousin john what it be i have do what it be you complain of she break in anger by the interruption for there be nothing a man like john heron hate worse he snap out : you have be try to snare the affection of my son you have even cast lascivious eye at the stranger within we gate the blood rush to ida

for a instant i understand he say you treat we remonstrance with scorn you scoff at we rebuke yes i be afraid i can not help it cousin john say ida i be sorry that you should think I so wicked and so -- dangerous and i quite agree with isabel and she mother that if i be as bad as you say i be not fit to live in a respectable house and with -- decent people it would be useless for I to assure you

herself that the whole thing be too ridiculous be too much like a farce to make she wretched but she feel unutterably miserable and she know that she could no longer endure laburnum villa and the petty tyranny and vindictiveness of these relation poverty hardship she could have bear patiently and without complain but there be some thing more intolerable to a high-spirited girl such as ida than poverty or physical hardship -- there be some thing which hurt more than actual blow she feel stifle choke she know that happen what might she could not remain under she cousin 's roof eat the bread of he charity for another day she shudder as she picture herself meet they at the breakfast-table face mr heron 's spiteful face isabel 's tear-swollen eye and she cousin john 's sanctimonious sermon she would have to go she thrust a few thing into a bag and take out she purse and count the contents they amount to six pound and a few shilling but small though the sum be she think that it would maintain she until she could find some way of earn a livelihood though at the moment she have not the least idea what she could find to do without undress she throw herself on the bed and try to sleep but she heart ache too acutely and she brain be too active to permit of sleep and try as she would she mind would travel back to those brief day of happiness at herondale and she be haunt by the remembrance of stafford and the love which she have lose and at time that past be almost efface by the vision of stafford seat beside maude falconer at the concert as soon as she hear the servant move about the house she rise pale and weary and put on she outdoor thing steal down-stair with she bag in she hand the servant be busy in the kitchen and she unfasten the hall door and leave the house without attract any attention the fresh morning air while it rouse she to a sense of she position revive and encourage she after all she be young and strong and -- she look up at the house of bondage which she be leave -- she be free oh bless freedom how often she have read of it and hear it extol but she have never know until this moment how great how sweet a thing it be she wait at the mean little station until a workman 's train come up and hustle by the crowd of sleepy and weary toiler get into it when she leave the terminus she walk with a portion of the throng which turn up bishopsgate street though any other direction would have suit she as well -- or as little for she have no idea where to go or what to do beyond seek some inexpensive lodge she know well enough that she could not afford to go to a hotel that she would have to be content with a small room perhaps a attic and the plainest of food while she seek for work it be soon evident to she that she be not likely to find what she be look for in the broad thoroughfare of shop and office and begin to feel bewildered by the crowd which early as it be stream along the pavement she turn off into one of the narrower street the long arm of coincidence which thrust itself into all we affair lead she to the minory and to the very quay which stafford have reach in he aimless wanderings and mechanically she pause and look on dreamily at the bustle and confusion which reign there perhaps the presence of the sheep and cattle attract she : she feel draw to they by sympathy with they hustle and hurry condition which so nearly resemble she own with one hand rest on a rail and a bag in the other she watch the man as they drive the cattle up the gangway or lowered huge cask and bale into the hold a big fat man with a slouch hat on the back of he head and a pipe in the corner of he mouth -- which do not prevent he shout and bawl at the man and the animal -- lurch here and there like one of the cask and in the midst of he shout and bawl he every now and then glance at a watch of the frying-pan order it be evident even to the inexperienced ida that the vessel be about to start the sailor be rush about on deck in the haste and excitement of order disorder chain be clank and rope and pulley be shriek and a steam whistle shriek at interval and add to the multitudinous noise poor sheep poor bull murmur ida as the last of the beast be drive up the gangway and disappear perhaps you have come from another herondale do you remember do you look back as i do she draw back for the big man suddenly lurch in she direction and indeed almost against she beg pardon miss he say touch he slouch hat anything i can do for you anybody you be look for no oh no say ida blushing and turn away mr joffler for it be that genial australian nod and stretch he moon-like face in a smile think you would come to say ` good-bye ' to someone p ` rap wish it be I though if it be i have a idea that i should stay on -- air or no air -- and i be blest if there be not precious little about this morning hi there all ready bless it all we 'll be too late for the tide if he do not come he say to the captain who stand with one foot on the taffrail a expression of impatience on he weather-beaten face like enough he be not comin ' mr joffler he say they kind o ' gent be always slippery i dessay though i do not think as this one be one of that kind too much grit about he -- ah and i be not mistake here he be get ready there he turn and ida instinctively turn with he see a tall figure clothe in a serge suit make its way quickly through the crowd of busy dock-man and idly lounge spectator he come straight to the big fat man who greet he jovially and loudly and they pass side by side on to the vessel ida draw a long breath and pass she hand over she brow it be absurd of course it be a trick of the imagination of a wearied and overstrained brain -- but the tall figure in the blue serge -- ah how like it be to that of stafford it disappear with that of the big man into the vessel and with a sigh she be come away when she see the two man come along the deck and mount to the quarter the fat man be talk and laugh but the man in the blue serge be grave and silent as if he be lose in thought and not listen suddenly as she pause the younger slimmer figure turn in she direction and utter a cry a cry almost of terror be she dement have she longing she ache longing for a sight of he call up this vision of stafford unless she be out of she mind the victim of a strange hallucination it be he himself who stand there he face pale and haggard turn towards she stafford she cry unconsciously and she hand grip the iron rail in front of she as if he have hear she -- though it be impossible that she voice could reach he through the shout of the sailor the lowing and bleating of the cattle -- he raise he head and look in she direction they eye meet and be enchain for a moment which seem a eternity then the blood fly to he face leave it the next moment paler than before he swing round to the fat man by he side and clutch he arm wait stop the vessel i want to go ashore he say hoarsely mr joffler stare at he then laugh hold on sir he say not unsympathetically hold on take queer like lor ' bless you i know how the feelin ' be it catch at you right in the middle of the waistcoat it be the thought of the land go back from you -- we be move we be well away here take a sip of this you 'll get over it in a brace o ' shake he thrust a flask into stafford 's hand but stafford put it away from he let I go ashore i 'll join you later he say breathlessly mr joffler catch he arm as he be about to jump for the quay steady steady sir he admonish soothingly we can not stop -- and you would break you neck try to jump it and all for a fancy too i would stake my life hearten up man hearten up you be not the first to feel sick and sorry at leavin ' home and friend stafford bit he lip and try to pull himself together but he eye be still fix on the pale face the girlish black-clad figure and he voice be shaky as he say : you be right mr joffler it be too late now i -- i think i see someone on the quay there but it must have be fancy it be impossible quite impossible that be it say mr joffler with a sympathetic wink lor ' love you i have have they kind o ' fancy myself especially after a hot night on shore if you would only take a pull at this you would be all right directly it do not do to come aboard too sober ` specially when you be leavin ' old england for the first time do you see 'em now ida have move away and stafford draw a long breath and force a smile no he say huskily and almost to himself yes it must have be fancy she could not have be there it be impossible mr joffler whistle and wink to himself comprehendingly she ' he murmur ah that be it be it ah well i have be there myself do not you let the fancy upset you sir it ` ull pass afore we get into the open nothing like the sea for teachin ' you to forget gal you have leave behind you come down below and try and peck a bit there be cold beef -- _ and _ pickle that 'll send they kind o ' fancy to the right about ida turn and walk quickly away she head swim she look like one in a dream it be of course impossible that the man she have see could be stafford : stafford on board a cattle-ship but the hallucination have make she feel faint and ill she remember that she have eat nothing since yesterday at noon and she ascribe this freak of she imagination to the weakness cause by want of food she leave the quay slowly -- as if she heart and she strength and all she life 's hope have go with the dingy vessel -- and emerge on the narrow crowded street look for some shop at which she could buy a roll of bread presently she see a baker 's at the opposite side of the road to that on which she be walk and she be cross when a huge empty van come lumbering round the corner she draw back to let it pass and as she do so a lighter cart come swiftly upon she she be so daze so bewildered by the vision she have see and the noise of the street that she stand hesitate uncertain whether to go on or retreat to the pavement she have leave the woman -- or man -- who hesitate in the middle of a busy london street be lose : the cart be upon she before she have move the shaft strike she on the shoulder and down she go into the muddy road the driver jerk the horse aside and leap from he seat the usual crowd which seem to spring instantaneously from the very stone collect and surge round the usual policeman force he way through and ida be pick up and carry to the pavement there be a patch of blood on the side of she head -- the dear small head which have rest on stafford 's breast so often -- and she be unconscious ` orse strike ` er with ` be ` oof say the policeman sententiously ` ere boy call a keb i 'll have you name and address young man a cab be bring and ida still unconscious be carry to the london hospital and lay there in the white painfully clean carbolic-smelling ward attend by the most skillful doctor in england and by the grave and silent nurse who notwithstanding they life of stress and toil have not lose the capacity for pity and sympathy indeed no one with a heart in she bosom could stand up unmoved and hear the girl moan and cry in a whisper for stafford day and night the white lip frame the same name -- stafford stafford -- as if she soul be in the cry chapter xxxvi when ida come to she find the sister of the ward and a young nurse bend over she with placid and smile face why a hospital nurse should under any and every circumstance be invariably cheerful be one of those mystery worthy to rank with the problem contain in the fact that a undertaker be nearly always of a merry disposition of course ida ask the usual question : where be i and how long have i be here and the sister tell she that she be in the alexandrium ward of the london hospital and that she have be there unconscious for ten day the nurse smile as if it be the best joke in a mild way in the world and answer ida 's further question while she administer beef tea with a air of pride and satisfaction which make she plain and homely face seem angelic to ida you be knock down by a cart you know say nurse brown you be not badly injure that be no bone be break as be very often the case -- that girl there in the next bed but two have one arm one leg and two rib break : mail cart and that poor woman opposite get both arm and a collar-bone break -- but i must not harrow you with we bad case she say quickly as ida seem to wince of course you feel very strange -- i suppose this be the first time you have be in a hospital ward yes reply ida glance round timidly ah yes of course say nurse brown nodding and smile encouragingly and you feel shy and nervous but if you only know it you be better off here than you would be anywhere else you have the very best surgeon in the world -- we be awfully proud of they and though i ought not to say it the best of nursing you be watch night and day and you get the least wee little thing you want if it be good for you i daresay you will not care to stay here but will like to be take away as soon as you be well enough to be move for of course we all know that you be a lady oh it be not the first time we have have a lady in the ward a great many of they come down here ` slum ' and sometimes they get run over as you have be or they fall down some of the dark and rickety stair or hurt themselves in some other way -- it be wonderful what a choice of accident you can have in this busy and crowded part of london after a pause she go on : of course you will go away as soon as you can but it be a pity it really be you be ever so much better off here and you would soon get use to the other people in the ward though they be of a different class to yourself but though most of they be very poor and some of they be usually rough when they be at home it be wonderfully how patient they be -- you will scarcely ever hear a murmur only a sigh now and again -- and they be so grateful that sometimes they bring the tear to you eye and it be quite hard to part from they when they get well and be discharge but i really must not talk to you any more she murmur penitently and the soft placid voice cease ida look round the ward she heart beating as fast as she condition would allow as nurse brown have say she feel terribly strange and nervous in the long whitewashed ward which however be render cheerful enough by the dozen of picture from illustrated papers which have be fasten to the wall and by the vase and great bowl of flower which seem to occupy every suitable spot she close she eye and try to think but she fall asleep instead and dream that she have fall off rupert and be lie on the moss beside the river quite comfortable and most absurdly content when she wake the sister be stand beside she and nod with cheerful approval that be better miss heron she say it be quite pleasant to watch you asleep and not to hear you rambling ida 's face flush have i be rambling she ask what have i say you know my name the nurse smile you thing be marked she explain but there be no address nothing which could help we to communicate with you friend or we would have do so you will tell we where to send now will you not ida blush again and feel troubled why should she annoy and worry the heron she shudder slightly as she picture she cousin john standing beside the bed where the sweet and pleasant-faced sister now stand and preach at she they would want to take she back to loburnum villa and ida regard the prospect of return to that cheerful abode of the christian virtue as a prisoner might regard the prospect of return to he gaol the sister regard she keenly without appear to do so perhaps you would rather remain quietly for a few day miss heron she suggest sweetly ida 's eye -- they look preternaturally large violet orb in she white face -- beam gratefully oh yes yes if i may shall i be ill long -- how soon will it be before i can go it be about as difficult to get a definite answer from a nurse as from a doctor oh some day yet reply the sister cheerfully you must not go until you be quite strong in fact we should not let you now you lie quite still and try and sleep again if you can and you can think over whether you would like to communicate with you friend or not if you ask my advice i shall say like mr punch ` do not ' i will not say ida with she rare smile the sister nod and leave she and ida close she eye again : but not to sleep she recall she flight from laburnum villa she wander through the street the crowded and noisy quay and the strange hallucination the vision of stafford standing on the stern of the vessel of course it be only a vision a hallucination but how real it have seem so real that it be almost difficult to believe that it be not he himself she smile sadly at the thought of stafford the son of the great sir stephen orme sailing in a cattle-ship the hour pass in a kind of peaceful monotony break by the frequent visit of nurse brown and the house surgeon with he grave face and preoccupy air and for some time ida lay in a kind of semi-torpor feeling that everything that be go on around she be the unreal action in a dream but as she grow stronger she begin to take a interest in the life of the great ward and she fellow-patient and on the second day after she return to consciousness begin a conversation with she next-door neighbor a pleasant-looking woman who have eye she wistfully several time but who have be too shy to address the young lady she be a country woman from dorsetshire -- up to london on a visit to my daughter miss which be marry to a man as keep a dairy it be she first visit to london she have wander from she daughter 's lose she and in she confusion tumble down the cellar of a beer-shop she tell ida the history of some of the other case and ida find herself listen with a interest which astonish she nurse brown see the two talk nod approvingly that be right she say with a smile you keep each other company it pass the time away very soon ida find herself take a interest in everything that go on in the noiseless movement of the nurse in the arrival of a new case in the visit of the doctor and the chaplain and the friend of the other patient let the pessimist say what they may there be a lot of good in human nature and it come out quite startlingly in the ward of a hospital ida be amaze at the care and attention the patience and the devotion which be lavish on herself and she fellow-sufferer a devotion which no money can buy and which could not have be exceed if they have one and all be princess of the blood royal one instance of this whole-souled devotion and unstinting charity occur on the third day and bring the tear to she eye not only then but whenever she think of it in the after year a tiny mite of a baby only a few week old be bring into the ward and lay in a cot not very far from ida 's bed the nurse and the doctor crowd round it with eager attention it be watch day and night if it cry at the first note of the feeble wail a couple of nurse fly to the cot and if necessary a famous physician be telephone for : and come promptly and cheerfully the whole ward be wrap up in the tiny mite and ida lean on she elbow and crane forward to get a glimpse of it and feel towards it as she would have feel if it have be a little sick or wounded lamb in herondale what be the matter with it poor little thing she ask the sister the spine reply the sister bend tenderly over the cot and take the emaciated little paw in she comforting minister hand will it get well ask ida quite anxiously the sister shake she head lor ' bless I say ida 's neighbor pityingly it ` ud be almost better if the pore little thing die the sister look up with mild surprise oh yes it can not live longer than three week she say as sadly as if she have not see a score of similar case ida lay down she eye fill with tear she heart fill with awe and wonder perhaps for the first time in she life she understand what charity mean here be a waif of the slum doom to die in so many week and yet it be the object of the loving devotion of every nurse in the ward with every comfort and luxury which a age of civilisation could supply and the recipient of the enthusiastic attention of a great surgeon whose name be famous throughout the world the woman in the next bed be cry too it make you think of ` eaven do not it miss she say with a sniff if i be rich i would leave all my money to a ` orspital that i would the speech suddenly remind ida of she own poverty of which she have not think very much for the need of money be not very keenly feel in a hospital ward where everything be free grati for nothing the time come when she be permit to get up and nothing could exceed she amazement on finding herself so weak that she leg tremble under she and the wall and the floor seem to rock and heave but in a day or two she be able to walk a little and she at once beg permission to help nurse the baby it be against the rule but it be very difficult for anyone to resist ida when she turn those great violet eye upon they imploringly : and much to she delight she be permit to hover about the cot and assist in a unofficial way when the baby be asleep which be not particularly often ida be permit to read to some of the other patient and in fact make herself generally useful in a unobtrusive fashion this be all very well but the day arrive when she be strong enough to leave the hospital and once more face that world which have be describe as the best of all possible world and no doubt be for those who have plenty of money and friend but which be not far from be the worst of all possible world for those who have not she take five pound from she little store and go to the sister i be rather poor she say with a smile and i can not afford more than this i wish it be a hundred time as much indeed no money could repay you goodness and kindness to I the wonder of which i shall never cease to feel the sister look at she keenly but say very gently : you can put it in the box in the hall when you go out but you will not go to-day i will arrange for you to stop until to-morrow in fact the baby -- none of we -- could spare you i want you to have some ten with I in my room to-night and a little talk miss heron so ida turn away quickly that the sister might not see she tear and accept the reprieve chapter xxxvii the heron be not very much surprised at ida 's flight but though john and he wife and daughter be anything but sorry to get rid of she they be rather uncomfortable and joseph who be in the doldrums after he drinking-fit do not make they more comfortable by assure they that he be perfectly certain she have commit suicide he and he father set out to look for she but as ida have leave no clue behind they could find no trace of she though they procure the assistance of scotland yard and insert guard advertisement in the newspaper john heron comfort himself with the reflection that she could have come to no harm or they would have hear of it and at last it occur to he when nearly a fortnight have elapse that she might have return to herondale probably to the care of mr wordley and that he have be too indignant to acquaint the heron with the fact i think i have better run down to herondale marium and ascertain if the err and desperate girl have return there he say one morning after prayer see that she leave my roof in so unseemly a fashion with no word of regret or repentance i do not consider that she have any further claim upon I but i have a tender heart and on this occasion i will be generous before i be just i be sure she have no further claim upon we say mr heron with a sniff and i hope you will make it plain john that on no account can we take she back we have be put to considerable trouble and expense and i really think that she go without any fuss be quite providential at this moment there come a double knock at the door and the servant announce that mr wordley be in the drawing-room mr and mr heron exchange glance and both of they turn rather pale for john heron have a very vivid recollection of mr wordley 's frank and candid manner of express himself but he have to be face and the pair go down into the drawing-room with a long-suffering expression on they face mr wordley however appear to be quite cheerful he shake hand with both of they and enquire after they health and that of they family quite amiably and pleasantly most delightful weather be not it he remark quite pleasant travel you have a remarkably -- or -- convenient house mr heron : charming suburb : will no doubt be quite gay and fashionable when it be -- er -- more fully develop you be look well mr heron mr heron whatever he may have look be feel anything but well at that moment for he suspect than the lawyer be only mask he attack and that he mean to spring upon he presently i enjoy fairly good health mr wordley thank you he say in he sanctimonious way but i have my share of trial and anxiety in this miserable world oh do not call it miserable on a morning like this say mr wordley cheerfully my dear sir there be nothing the matter with the world it be -- er -- some of the people in it that try to make it miserable while he have be speak he have be glance at the door and listen as if he have be listen and expect to hear and see someone else the fact be he say i have come up rather suddenly on rather important business : come up without a moment 's delay _ where be _ miss ida i should like to see she at once please if i may the face of the pair grow sallow and the corner of john heron 's mouth drop lower even than usual ida he say in a hollow voice as if he be confuse where be she surely you know mr wordley i know how should i know i come up to see she : not a moment to spare be not she here why do you both stare at I like this she be not here say john heron ida leave we house more than a fortnight ago mr wordley look disappointed and grunt : oh go to stay with some friend i suppose i 'll trouble you to give I they address mr heron please he rise as he speak as if he mean start on the moment but he sink into the chair again as john heron say in a sepulchral voice : i should most willingly do so mr wordley but i regret to say i do not know where she be you -- do not -- know -- where -- she be say mr wordley anger and amazement struggle for the upper hand what the devil i beg you pardon mr heron you must excuse a old man with a short temper and a touch of the gout -- but i do not understand you why do not you know mr heron begin to sniff and she worthy husband draw himself up and try to look dignified and fail utterly in the attempt such language -- he begin confound my language sir snap the old lawyer he face grow red be good enough to answer my question ida leave we hospitable roof about a fortnight ago say mr heron she leave like a thief in the night -- that be to say morning i regret to say that she leave no message no word of farewell behind she i have occasion to rebuke she on the precede night and follow the dictate of a ungodly nature and a perverse pride she choose to leave the shelter of this roof -- mr wordley spring to he foot he passion render he speechless for a moment _ you _ rebuke miss ida be you out of you mind and pray what have she do she have be guilty of attempt to ensnare the affection of my son -- begin john heron at this moment the door open and joseph appear mr wordley look at he ensnare the affection of _ this _ he snort with a contempt which cause mr joseph 's immediate retreat oh you _ must _ be out of you mind she conduct be reprehensible in other way stammer john heron nonsense almost shout mr wordley i do not want to hear any more of such nonsense miss ida 's conduct reprehensible why she could not conduct herself in any way than that of a high-bred pure-minded gentle-hearted girl if she try you have be entertain a angel unaware mr heron -- there be a bit of scripture for _ you _ -- you have have a pearl in you house and it be be cast before -- bless my soul i be lose my temper but ` pon my word there be some excuse for it you have let that dear child leave you house you have lose sight of she for over a fortnight and -- and you stand there and snuffle to I about she ` conduct ' where be she oh of course

throat and stammer : i forgive you sir you will regret this exhibition of brutal violence and i shall put up a prayer -- do not you dare to put up any prayer for I cry mr wordley i should be afraid something would happen to I i need not ask why she leave you house it be quite evident enough i have nothing more to say to you one moment say john heron with a attempt at dignity perhaps you will be good enough to inform I of the nature of the communication that you have for my cousin ida mr wordley look as if he be go to choke no i will not sir he at last respond i will tell you nothing -- except that i hope and trust i may never see you sanctimonious face again good-morning good-morning madame he be outside laburnum villa with the velocity and force of a whirlwind and be half-way on he road to the station before he could get he breath or regain he self-possession be a lawyer he of course go straight to the police but he be shrewd enough not to go to scotland yard but to the police station near the terminus for it seem to he that it would be easier to trace ida from that spot fortunately for he he find a inspector in charge who be both intelligent and zealous he listen attentively to the detailed statement and description which the lawyer -- calm enough now -- furnish he and after consider for a minute or two during which mr wordley wait in a legal silence ask : young lady any friend in london sir mr wordley reply in the negative think she have go to a situation no reply mr wordley she leave suddenly and i do not know what situation she could find she be a

last he go and ida be leave alone to face the strange change in she fortune she sit before the fire dream for a few minute then she wander over the old house from room to room and every room have its memory and association for she in the library she could almost fancy that she father be sit in the high-backed chair which be still draw up in its place to the table and she go and sit in it and touch with reverent loving hand the book and papers over which he have be wont to bend she stand before he portrait and gaze at it with tear-dimmed eye and only the consciousness of the love she have bear he enable she to bear he absence as she pass through the hall the newly rise moon be pour in through the tall window and follow by donald and bess who have not leave she for a moment she open the great hall door and go on to the terrace and walk to the end stand and look towards the ruin chapel in which she father have bury he treasure up to this moment she have be buoy up by excitement and the joy and pleasure of she return to the old house but suddenly there fall a cloud-like depression upon she she be conscious of a ache void a lack of something which rob she heart of all its joy she have no need to ask herself what it be : she know too well she old home have come back to she she be the mistress of a large fortune she stand as it be bath in the sunshine of prosperity but she heart fall cold and dead and the sunshine bright as it be well-nigh dazzling indeed have no warmth in it she be a great heiress now would no doubt soon be surround by friend she have be poor and well-nigh friendless that day stafford have take she in he arm and kiss she for the first time but ah how happy she have be be it possible could fate be so cruel as to decree that she should never be happy again never lose the ache pain which rack she heart at every thought of he she put the fear from she with a feeling of shame and helplessness she _ would _ forget the man who leave she for another woman would not let thought of he cast a shadow over she life and dominate it no doubt by this time he have quite forget she or if he remember she recall the past with a feeling of annoyance with which a man regard a pass flirtation pleasant enough while it last but of which he do well to be a little ashamed she would not look in the direction of the tree under which he have stand on the night of the day she have first see he and she go in with a forced cheerfulness to tell jessie listen with wide-open eye of some of the strange thing which have happen to she all the time she be talk she be beset by a longing to ask jessie about brae wood and the orme but she crush down the idea and jessie be too intent upon hear the story of she mistress 's sojourn in london to have any breath or inclination to tell any of the dale news of course ida do not speak of the disagreement at laburnum villa but she give jessie a account of the accident and she experience of a hospital ward at all which jessie utter oh and ah with bated breath and gaping month it be late before ida get to bed and later still before she fall asleep for somehow now that she be back at herondale the memory of that happy past grow more vivid in fact the whole place be haunt by the spectre of she lose love : and of all spectre this be the most sad and heart-possessing she be out on rupert as early as possible the next morning and it be difficult to say which be the more pleased at the reunion he or he mistress and oh what a delight it be to ride across the moor and along the valley and by the stream to see the cattle grazing and to hear the sheep call to one another in the old plaintive way it be almost difficult to believe that she have ever leave herondale that laburnum villa be anything but a nightmare and the heron a dismal unreality now for some time she avoid that part of the road where the opening of the plantation give a view of the villa but she be draw towards it at last and she lean forward on she horse and look across the lake at the great white place shine in the autumn sunlight it seem very still and quiet and there be no sign of life about the place the lake itself be desert save by one of the steamer on which be only a few passenger well wrapped-up against the now keen air the appearance of the white long-stretching place strike she with a sense of desertion and desolation and with a sigh she turn and ride away that afternoon as she be come in from the stable jessie come run towards she oh miss ida there be lord and lady bannerdale and lady vayne and two of the young lady in the drawing-room very well say ida quietly and remove she right-hand gauntlet she go straight into the drawing-room in accordance with she father 's wish and she own perhaps mistaken pride she have avoid all these people hitherto but there be no need to avoid they any longer she be they equal in birth and she newly discover wealth effectually remove any cause for pride lady bannerdale a motherly and good-natured woman come forward to meet she and take she by both hand my dear we have come over at once to tell you how glad we be she say we hear the good news from mr wordley and neither i nor my husband could wait another day before we come to congratulate you lady vayne too hold ida 's hand and look at she with affectionate sympathy and we feel the same my dear she say so you must not think we intrusive ida shake hand with they all and ring for the tea she be very quiet and subdue but the little cold look of surprise with which she have at one time meet they advance be now absent and they could perceive that she be glad to see they we joy in the good news be not altogether unselfish and disinterested my dear miss ida say lord bannerdale that heron hall should be shut up and desert while there be so charming a mistress to represent the old family be little short of a general misfortune you can not tell how anxious and concerned we have be about you -- but we will say no more about that i trust a brighter star have rise above the old house and that it be enter upon brighter fortune at any rate let that be as it may we want you to believe how delighted we be to have you back again and under such happy auspices and we want to say too dear say lady bannerdale while lady vayne nod assentingly that we hope you have really come back to we that you will be one of we and let we see a great deal of you of course under the circumstance she glance at ida 's black dress we be debar from express we pleasure in festivity but we hope you will come to we quite quietly and very often and that you will let we treat you as one of we own dear girl ida murmur a suitable response but though she be by no means demonstrative they be satisfied and as they leave they express that satisfaction to each other oh yes she be glad to see we lady bannerdale say and i like she all the better for not meet we half-way and for refrain from any gush poor girl i be afraid she have be very ill and have feel she trouble very keenly she be much thinner and when she come into the room there be a expression in she face which touch I and make my eye dim we must look after she remark lady vayne there be something weird in the idea of she living there all alone though of course she maid jessie will take care of she lady bannerdale smile ida heron be one of those girl who be quite capable of take care of themselves she say how wonderfully calm and self-possessed she be most girl would have be rather upset or at any rate a little flurried meeting we all so unexpectedly but she come into the room with the perfect unself-consciousness which mark -- the high-bred lady finish lord bannerdale i wonder whether we realize how old a family the heron be we be all mushroom compare with that slim little girl who be now the mistress of herondale and a enormous fortune we shall have to find a husband for she remark lady vayne who be the match-maker of the locality lord bannerdale smile the trouble would be to get miss ida to accept he when you have find he he say shrewdly i have a idea she would be difficult to please there be a little curl to those pretty lip of hers which be tolerably significant poor girl there be time enough yet to think of such a thing say lady bannerdale reprovingly but while she sit it mother-like she think that she son edwin would be home from a long tour in the east in a week or two that he be particularly good-looking and in the opinion of more person than he mother a particularly amiable and good fellow the next day there be more visitor they all seem as genuinely glad at she return and they all make as genuine overture of friendship it be evident that ida need not be alone in the world any longer unless she wish to be on the morning of the third day as she be ride to bryndermere with some shopping as a excuse she meet mr wordley a gentleman be sit beside he who ida guess be the architect he prove to be no less a personage than the famous mr hartley they have pull up for the introduction close by the opening on the lake and while the architect be exchange greeting with ida he keen eye wander now and again to the villa and as ida turn to ride back with they he say : that be rather a fine place over there miss heron rather bizarre and conspicuous but striking and rather artistic new too : whose be it stephen orme 's place reply mr wordley in rather a low voice oh say mr hartley with a nod which strike ida as be peculiarly expressive and significant though she do not know what it imply the three go all over the old hall and after lunch the great architect explain with the aid of a sheet of paper and a pencil he idea of what should be do there need not be there should not be the least addition he say what you want to do miss heron be as mr wordley say restore : restore with all reverence it be a superb piece of architecture of its kind and it must be touch with a gentle hand if you be prepare to leave it all to I i trust i may be able to make the present building worthy of its past it will be a delightful task for I but i must tell you frankly that it will cost a very large sum of money how much i shall be able to inform you when i have get out my plan and go into the estimate but at any rate i can say emphatically that the place be worth the expenditure be i to have _ carte blanche _ yes say ida i will leave it entirely in you hand this at least she could do with the money which she father have so mysteriously make : restore it the house he have love so well well to its old dignity and grandeur the great architect very much impressed not only by the hall but its beautiful young mistress leave before mr wordley who want to talk over business with ida but he find she rather absent-minded and preoccupy and presently in a pause she say with forced calmness : be sir stephen orme still at the villa at brae wood mr wordley he have be make some memorandum in he pocket-book and he look up with a start and stare at she be sir stephen -- my dear child do not you know -- have not you hear hear what she ask she face begin to grow paler she lip set tightly god bless my soul i be surprised he exclaim i think everybody have hear the news sir stephen be not live at the villa for a very grave and all-sufficient reason : he be dead my dear ida lean back in she chair and raise a screen which she hold in she hand so that it shield she face from he gaze i do not know she say in a very low voice i have not hear i have not see any papers or if i have only the advertisement part dead yes say mr wordley poor man he die suddenly quite suddenly in the middle of a grand ball die of the shock shock she echo he look at she as if he find it hard to realize she ignorance yes the shock of the bad news dear I it seem so strange that you a neighbor so to speak should not have hear the story of which all london -- one might almost say all england -- be talk sir stephen be a great financier and have just bring out a great company to work a important concession in africa he be suppose to have make a enormous sum of money by it indeed must have do so but at the very moment of he success there come a stroke of bad luck and the news of it be bring to he on the night of the ball he be give in he splendid town house the sudden reverse mean absolute ruin and he fall dead with the cablegram in he hand shocking be it not ida 's lip move but she could not speak the whole scene seem to rise before she but naturally enough she thought be concentrate upon one figure in it that of stafford then -- then mr stafford orme be now the baronet sir stafford she say in a scarcely audible voice no he be now lord highcliffe he father be raise to the peerage on the day he die -- one night almost say the hour he die that make it the more unfortunate unfortunate i do not understand you say he be a peer yes but a penniless peer and i can not imagine a more unpleasant and miserable position than he he father die absolutely ruin indeed insolvent though i suppose by he son 's act of noble self-sacrifice a great many of the debt be pay tell I -- i do not know say ida as steadily as she could sir stephen settle a very large sum of money upon the young man but he refuse to take advantage of it and make over the whole sum every penny of it to the creditor and leave himself i be tell absolutely penniless not that it matter very much because he be engage to a miss falconer who father be i believe a millionaire the color rise to ida 's face the hand which hold the screen shake and they -- they be go to be marry soon ask she i do not know i suppose not reply mr wordley as he bent over he memorandum again lord highcliffe have disappear left england no one seem to quite know where he have go it be a terrible collapse and a tragic end the great sir stephen 's but man of he trade always have to run such risk by the way i suppose the villa will have to be sell sell echo ida i would like to buy it she speak on the impulse of the moment but mr wordley do not seem at all surprised and only smile as he respond : i know no reason why you should not my dear miss ida i be not sure that it would be a good investment but if you have a fancy for it i will enquire into the matter yes certainly you can buy if you want to do so long after he have go ida sit lean forward in she chair and gaze at the fire stafford be now lord highcliffe a peer but poor and a wanderer she start : be it really he whom she have see on the cattle steamer then they have be near each other have look into each other 's eye perhaps she would never seem he again -- but ah yes it be quite probable she would for be he not engage to the wealthy miss falconer and would he not come back to marry she the follow evening she receive a short note from mr wordley : it inform she that the villa be not for sale it have be purchase by mr falconer for he daughter chapter xxxix within a few day she receive invitation from the bannerdale and vayne and the other county family who be evidently possess by the kind determination that she should become one of they the dinner at bannerdale grange be quite _ en famille _ she be make a great deal of and if she have give they the least encouragement they would actually have pet she but though ida have lose something of she old pride and _ hauteur _ cause by she isolation she be still somewhat reserve and grateful as she be for they overture of affection she could not respond as fully as she would have like it be the same with the vayne and avory they be all more than kind to she and she long to receive they attention with open arm but she could not : the fact be she wounded heart be so tender that it shrink even from the gentlest touch the girl be all right remark lord bannerdale she have be in great trouble and it have hurt she very badly and though she seem rather cold and reserved she be more sensitive than most woman : you must give she time ida have resolve that though she could not altogether forget the great sorrow of she life she would not brood over it she know that for she complaint there be nothing worse than idleness and she seek employment for she mind and body with a eagerness that sometimes become almost feverish when she be not visit or receive visit from what might be call she new friend she be busy about the farm and the estate and take long ride on rupert accompany as of old by the dog very soon too mr hartley begin at the restoration and ida be deeply interested in the progress of the work then again the hunting season commence and to the delight of sir robert vayne the master she appear at the first meet : and be it necessary to say be in at the death she enjoy that first run more than she have enjoy anything since the fatal morning she have lose both sweetheart and father and she be very nearly happy as she ride home with a crushed hat and a habit splash with mud a week or two afterwards lord bannerdale give a hunt breakfast and make a point of she be present and she yield though she would have prefer to have join the meet at the covert as she ride up lord bannerdale come down the step to meet she and by he side be a tall good-looking young fellow whom ida rightly guess by he likeness to he father to be lord bannerdale 's son he have return from he travels on the precede night be in perfect health and spirit much tan by the sun and rain and seem to possess he full share of the amiability of he amiable family he stand bare-headed at rupert 's head and take ida 's hand to help she to dismount and not only walk with she to the house but contrived to sit beside she at the breakfast-table he people have be talk to he of ida he be quite prepared to be impressed and that he be so be evident before the meal have conclude he mother pay particular attention to ida and lord bannerdale regard the young pair approvingly lord edwin ride as straight as ida herself it be a magnificent run -- of course the best run of the season -- and lord edwin secure the brush fasten it to she saddle those who see the act -- they be not many for the pace have be fast and hard -- exchange significant glance lord edwin be over at the hall next day and display a keen interest in the restoration and bent for some time over the plan which he have humbly beg ida to show he he be a modest young fellow with more intelligence and good sense than generally go with he age and ida like he it be inevitable that they should meet almost every day it be almost as inevitable that he should fall in love with she for she be not only the most beautiful girl in the county but there be a element of romance in she loneliness and she fortune which naturally appeal to he he go to he father one day and confide in he but though lord and lady bannerdale be more than pleased they beg he not to be too sanguine sanguine he exclaim color i live in a state of mortal fear and dread for though i love she more every time i see she i never leave she without feel that my case be hopeless there be something about ida -- oh of course i can not explain -- but i feel as if i could no more speak to she of love than i could -- could jump over this house and yet she be so gentle and friendly say lady bannerdale to encourage he the young fellow wise in he generation shake he head that be just it mother he say gravely she treat I as if i be a brother quite a young brother and i know that if i be to speak to she to let she know how much i love she it would mean the end of everything i should never be able to see she again -- and i could not stand that for i be only happy when i be with she -- and then i be miserable with the thought of have to leave she you must be patient my dear fellow say lord bannerdale ida heron be a girl in a million and she be worth wait for oh i 'll wait say lord edwin but sometimes i feel that all the wait in the world will not win she he add with a sigh one day -- it be in the christmas week which ida have be prevail upon to spend with the bannerdale -- lord bannerdale come in at luncheon-time with some news i hear the villa be to be occupy at christmas he say mr falconer and he daughter be come down to-day be there to be a house-party say lady bannerdale but i suppose not no there could not be under the circumstance poor girl sir stephen 's death -- i never can remember that he be lord highcliffe -- must have be a great grief and shock to she she and she father will naturally wish to be quiet but i suppose we ought to call you have never see she i think ida no say ida in the impassive reticent way in which she always speak and look when on guard a extremely beautiful woman say lady bannerdale but she always strike I as be a remarkably cold one though of course it may have only be manner the present lord highcliffe sir stephen 's son have be away some time now i suppose he will come back soon and they will be marry they will make a very handsome couple you would like he edwin i take a great fancy to he on the few occasion i meet he and i feel deeply sorry for he misfortune but there will be no lack of money when he and miss falconer be marry for she father be immensely rich i believe it would be very nice for all of we if lord highcliffe settle at the villa and i have a idea that mr falconer have buy it for they ida 's heart sink and she seize the first opportunity of get to she own room what hope of forgetfulness could there be for she what chance of happiness if stafford come back to the villa to live if she should be in hourly dread of meet he the think haunt she though all the quiet christmas festivity at the grange and she be glad to get back to the hall and away from the eye which watch she though they watch she with a friendly and affectionate regard in she daily ride she avoid the opening on the lake side from which the villa be visible and she would sometimes make a long _ detour _ rather than go near the spot on one occasion when return from bryndermere instead of cross by the ferry she ride round by the other side of the lake keep well away from the villa lest she should meet anyone belong to it she have reach the top of the hill below which wind the road lead to the hall and after pause to look at the magnificent view be ride across a field one of the outlying field of she estate when she see a lady ride through a gate at the lower end the blood rush to she face and she heart seem to stand still for a moment for she see that it be maude falconer then she face grow pale and a wave of bitterness grow over she for she recognize the horse on which maude be ride : it be stafford 's adonis she first impulse be to turn aside and leave the field but she pride revolt and she keep she course look straight before she and try not to see the graceful figure below she at sight of she the blood have fly to maude 's face also and she try to check she horse but adoni at any time rather more than she could well manage be fresh and too eager to join the other horse and he carry she up the field against she will the two meet almost face to face the horse exchange friendly neigh for a moment while one could count twenty the two rival sit and look at each other half unconsciously ida notice the pallor and the worn look of the beautiful face the wistful peevishness of the delicately cut lip then suddenly maude 's face flush she eye grow hard and scornful and with something like a sneer she say in a metallic tone : i beg you pardon but be you aware that you be trespassing a saint would have turn on such provocation and ida be no saint feel that she face be as crimson as the other girl 's and grow as hot of heart as of face she set she lip tightly and try to remain silent : surely it would be better in every way better to ride on without a word but it be more than she could do : and she draw herself up and she eye flash back the challenge as she say in a low but distinct voice : pardon I but you be mistake the land on which i be ride belong to I maude grow pale again and she lip set closely until the line of red almost disappear be this not then part of the villa estate she ask no it be part of the herondale estate reply ida rather more gently : for be it not horrible that she should be engage in altercation with stafford 's future wife then i presume i have the honor of speak to miss heron say maude with a indefinable air combine contempt and defiance which bring the color to ida 's face again my name be ida heron yes she say then if you be make no mistake it be i who be trespassing say maude and it be i who must apologise pray consider that i do so most fully miss heron no apology be necessary say ida still more gently you be quite welcome to ride over this or any part of herondale maude give a little scornful laugh thanks it be very good of you she say haughtily and with that covert offensiveness of which alas a woman alone be capable i do not think i shall have any desire to avail myself of you kind permission the public road and the land belong to my father 's house will i think prove quite sufficient for I i be the daughter of mr falconer of the villa at brae wood ida incline she head slightly by way of acknowledgment and adieu and without another word ride on towards the gate at the bottom of the field which open on to the road adoni who have be delight to meet he old friend promptly follow and though maude falconer try she hardest to check he and turn he he inwardly laugh at she effort trot cheerfully beside rupert and continue they conversation maude be half mad with mortification and quite unable to leave ida 's hated side she raise she whip and strike adoni across the face the horse who have never receive such a blow before in he life stop dead short fall back almost on to he haunch then rear straight up and in a moment of temper try to throw she off indeed she must have fall but ida always cool at such moment sweep sideways catch adoni 's bridle and bring he on all fours maude be instantly jerk forward on to the horse 's neck in a humiliating fashion but recover she seat sit tremble with passion it be impossible not to pity she and ida in she gentlest and quietest of voice say : i will wait here will not go through the gate until you groom come up you horse will be quite quiet then if i might venture to say so i think it would be wise not to strike he across the head very few horse can stand it and this one be high-bred and exceptionally spirited -- she be stop by maude 's scornful laugh really i ought to feel very much oblige to you miss heron she say and my sense of obligation be almost as great as my amazement at you frankness -- and assurance may i ask you to be good enough to release my horse 's rein ida 's hand fall from the rein and she face grow crimson but before she could have retort even if she have intend do so maude strike the horse again it turn and dash across the field kick and plunge violently with maude sway perilously in the saddle ida wait until the groom -- it be pottinger -- have gain he mistress 's side and get hold of the horse then with no thought of bravado but simply with the desire to get away from the spot she put rupert at the gate and leap into the road chapter xl ida ride home all quiver with the pain of she meeting with maude falconer at first it seem to she that she must leave herondale -- for a time at any rate that it would be impossible for she to run the risk of meet the beautiful woman who have steal stafford from she but as she grow calmer she pride come to she aid and she see that to run away would be cowardly herondale be she home have be she home long before the villa have spring up and to desert it because of the proximity of maude falconer would be almost as bad as if a soldier should desert he color but for the next few day she do not leave she own grounds she grow pale and listless and lady bannerdale when she come to look she up notice the change in she but be too tactful to make any remark upon it we have miss you so much my dear she say affectionately indeed my husband have be quite fidgety and irritable -- so unlike he -- and edwin have be worse if it be possible man be a great trouble my dear ida though perhaps i ought not to say that of mine for i count myself lucky in both husband and son edwin have scarcely give I a day 's trouble since he be a child i really think if i be ask what be the best gift bestow by the fairy godmother i should say ' a good digestion and a temper to match ' and i be quite proud of edwin 's strength and amiability but even he have be somewhat of a trial for the last few day so my dear girl do come over and help I manage they ida smile rather absently and she ladyship glide smoothly from the subject since we last saw you we have call at the villa she say and we be fortunate enough to find miss falconer at home she be alone there in that huge palace of a place for she father have go back to london and though i be never very much take with she i could not help pity she why ask ida not absently now but in she quiet reserved manner she look so -- well actually so unhappy reply lady bannerdale she be in mourning and she face -- she be really a extremely beautiful girl -- be like marble and she reception of I be almost as cold i be afraid that she have have more trouble than we be aware of there be such a preoccupy and indifferent air about she it occur to I that she be fret for she absent _ fianc _ mr stafford -- oh dear I i shall never remember to call he lord highcliffe -- and i resolve to carefully refrain from mention he but you know how stupid one be in such a case how one always talk about lameness in the presence of a man with one leg and in the midst of a pause in the conversation which by the way be nearly all on my side i blurt out with : ` have you hear from mr stafford orme lately miss falconer ' ' i suppose you mean lord highcliffe lady bannerdale ' she say turn she cold blue eye on my scarlet face ` he be in australium and be well i do not hear very often from he he be lead a very busy life and have little time for letter-writing i imagine ' of course i get myself away as soon as i could after that and i be afraid i leave a very bad impression upon miss falconer ida say nothing but lean forward and stir the fire which may have cause the color which glow for a moment or two on she face i be sure i do not know why the young man should have rush off to the other end of the world : or why he do not rush back again and marry the lady of he heart who have enough money for both of they and would make a extremely handsome and stately countess by the way have you ever see the present lord highcliffe my dear yes i have see he ida reply in the tone which close a subject of conversation shall i give you some more tea no would you like to see how the workman be get on i think they be work very quickly they will want this part of the house presently and i have a idea of go away for a time perhaps abroad she add though she have put the idea away from she until this moment and it be only lady bannerdale 's talk of maude falconer which start it again in she mind lady bannerdale look alarmed oh do not do that my dear she say if you be oblige to turn out of the house why not come to we it would be so kind and sweet of you ida sigh a little wearily oh i do not suppose they will insist upon eject I she say i think i can persuade they to leave I two or three room lady bannerdale go home and drop she bomb-shell in the presence of lord bannerdale and edwin ida rather think of go abroad she say in a casual way at the dinner table lord edwin be raise he wine glass to he lip but arrest it half-way and set it down again and he handsome face grow long and grave oh we shall miss she remark lord bannerdale lamely and avoid look in he son 's direction not another word be say but the next day lord edwin come into lady bannerdale 's room with that affectation of ease and indifference which never yet deceive a mother i be go to call on miss heron mother he say any message lady bannerdale look at he she brow wrinkle with motherly anxiety there be nothing in the world she desire more than he happiness and she know that the marriage with ida would be in every way desirable : the girl be one in a thousand the bannerdale estate almost join herondale both she and she husband be fond of ida who they know would prove a worthy successor to the present mistress of the grange but just because it seem so desirable and lord edwin 's heart be so passionately set upon it the mother be anxious she see that he be dress with extreme care and that he face be unusually grave you will give ida my love edwin please and tell she

way my happiness or unhappiness rest with she when he arrive at the hall ida be just go out for a ride she turn back with he to the drawing-room think that he have bring a message from he mother

but very resolutely no she say in a low voice i -- i want to tell you lord edwin how proud i be at the honor you have pay I like yourself i be not good at express my feeling -- though indeed i think you have do yourself a injustice : you have speak tell I very well -- and i be very grateful i wish i could say ` yes ' ah say it he implore she eagerly she shake she head again and lift she eye and

a conceited bounder to think that you have fall in love with I already i only want you to let I try and win you love and -- i think i shall do so he say in a modest but manly way which would at once have win ida 's heart -- if it have not be win already if you will only give I some hope just tell I that i have a chance that you 'll let I try -- ida smile a sad little smile if i say as much as that -- but i can not lord edwin you -- you have tell I that you love I and it would not be fair -- ah please do not try to persuade I do not you see how terrible it would be if i be to let you think

when the man be sing round the camp fire singing and laugh the sense of my loss would come crush down upon I and i would spring to my foot and wander out into the starlit silence of the vast plain and spend the night thinking of all that have pass between we at other time a kind of madness would catch hold of I and i would join the wildest of the gang and laugh and sing and drink with the maddest of the lot she draw a long breath of comprehension and pity and hide she eye on he breast he bent and kiss she murmuring penitently : i be not fit to kiss you ida i do not mean to tell you but -- but

ease and that he shiver and shrink as he feel maude on he back what be the matter with he he say he seem fidgety do the saddle fit yes sir say pottinger with a half-nervous glance at maude follow by the impassive expression of the trained servant who can not speak out he be troublesome sometimes say maude but i can manage he quite easily oh yes assent stafford he be as quiet as a lamb but he be highly breed and as highly string as they be start pottinger murmur : do not curb he too tightly miss maude ignore the warning and she and stafford ride out the rain have cease the cloud have pass away and in the joy of he nearness she spirit rise a feeling of triumph swell in she bosom how little i think yesterday even this morning that we should be ride side by side stafford she say how little i think i should have you back again my own my very own do not all these month you have be away seem like a dream to you they do to I she draw a long breath let we ride across the dale you will find it wet there have you not better keep to the road no no she say adoni be die for a gallop see how he be fret stafford look at the horse curiously he be champ he bit and throw up he head in a nervous agitate manner which stafford have never see he display before i can not make the horse out he say more to himself than maude perhaps he 'll be all right after a gallop they cross the road at a trot which be a uneven one on adoni 's part and get on the moor maude still in high spirit still buoy up by she feeling of triumph talk continuously tell he some of the london news plan out they future they would have a house in london stafford should take he proper place in the world they would step back to the high position which be he by right as a peer of the realm stafford be scarcely listen a question be haunt he a question which he could not thrust from he : he be go to marry maude falconer go to take the hard and stony road of duty which ida in she noble way have point out to he ought he not to tell maude about ida and he broken engagement to she would it not be better for both of they for all of they if he be to do so he would have to tell she that he could not live at the villa she would want to know the reason would it not be better to tell she he raise he head to begin when suddenly he see go up the hill in front of they a horse and horsewoman she be walk up slowly and long before she figure stand out against the clear sky he see that it be ida it be scarcely a exaggeration to say that he heart stand still that she should have appear before he in he sight at such a moment while he be ride beside he future wife -- he future wife -- fill he with bitterness he face must have pale or maude must have see he start for she look at he and then turn she head and look in the direction in which he eye be fix she recognize ida instantly the color rush to she face she hand tighten on she rein spasmodically for a moment she feel inclined to turn aside to ride away escape from the girl she hate and loathe and then she be move by another impulse the demon of jealousy whisper : this be the moment of you triumph why not enjoy it to the full why not let she feel the bitterness of defeat there be you rival let she see with she own eye you triumph and you happiness the temptation be too great for she and she yield to it who be that ride up the hill she say control she voice admirably it be miss heron be it not yes it be he say as impassively as he could she lip curl scornfully at he assumption of indifference i have see she and meet she she say but i have not be introduce to she let we overtake she and you can introduce I i should like to know she he look straight before he he face grave and set be it worth while he say in a low voice some other time -- why not now she ask we can catch she quite easily the moment have come for he to tell she not now he say huskily i have something to tell you maude something you ought to know before -- before you make miss heron 's acquaintance she turn to he with a low laugh do you think i do not know she say between she tooth i have know all along i read the letter you write to she -- i get it -- steal it if you like -- from pottinger i have know all along -- do you not think i have be very patient very discreet even now i bear no malice i can forget the past forget and forgive why should i not see that i be assure of you love and good faith you will see how completely i forget how little importance i attach to you fancy for the girl a fancy which i be sure you have quite outgrow oh i can trust you we will join miss heron by all mean he face be dark and heavy do not maude until you have hear all he begin but with a scornful laugh that yet have something doubt and desperate in it she send adoni on he spring forward nervously and shiver under a stroke from she whip and swiftly lessen the distance between he and rupert who hear he approach before ida do and who neigh a welcome ida turn and see who be follow she saw stafford just behind and gather she rein together she ride rupert quickly to the top of the hill miss heron cry maude in a voice of covert insolence but almost open triumph miss heron stop please ida do stop for a moment then feel that it be impossible for she to meet they that day at any rate she let rupert go again by this time stafford have almost gain maude 's side he face be dark with anger he tooth clench tightly he know that maude intend to flaunt she possession of he before ida in a low but perfectly distinct voice he say : stop maude do not follow she she look over she shoulder at he she face flush she eye flash why not she demand scornfully be she afraid or be it you who be afraid both perhaps we shall see before he could catch she rein she have strike adonis twice with the sharp cut whip and with a shake of he head and a snort of rage and resentment he stand on he haunch for a moment then leap forward and begin to race down the hill stafford see that the horse have bolt either from fear or anger he know that it would only increase maude 's peril if he gallop in pursuit behind she he therefore check he horse and make in a slanting line for a point towards which he judge adoni would go maude be sway in she saddle in which she could only keep herself by clutch at the pommel it seem every moment as if she must fall as if the horse itself must fall and throw she like a stone down the steep hill ida the moment she have get over the top of the hill have ride quickly and of course quite fearlessly and safely and have get rupert so well in hand as usual that when she hear the clatter behind she and turn see the peril in which maude have put herself she be able to pull rupert up it be almost a repetition of what have occur the other day but this time maude falconer 's peril be infinitely greater for she horse be half mad and tear down the steep hill-side render doubly dangerous by the loose stone and be all too evidently indifferent whether he stand or fall and yet another risk lay just below for william have be digging in that spot for stone to mend the bank and even if the maddened horse see the hole it be more than probable that he would not be able to pull up in time such moment as these form the criterion of true courage there be only one way in which ida could save or attempt to save the white-faced woman who be draw towards she at breakneck speed what she would have to attempt to do would be to ride straight for the oncoming horse swerve almost as she reach it and keep side by side with it until she could succeed either in turn it away from that horrible hole or stop it by throw it she do not hesitate for a moment it may be say in all truth that at that moment she forget that the woman whose life she be go to save be maude falconer she do not realize the fact -- or if she do she be indifferent to it -- that she be risk she own life to save the woman who have rob she of stafford there be the life to be save and that be enough for ida she slip she foot almost out of the stirrup feel rupert 's mouth firmly but gently lean forward and whisper a word to he which it be very likely he understand -- perhaps he see all the game even before she do -- and with a encouraging touch of she hand she let he go he spring forward like a arrow from the bow as they draw near the fly horse ida shift she whip to she left hand so that she right should be free and lean as far in the saddle as she could with safety she make a snatch at adoni 's rein at the moment she come alongside he she would have catch the rein she might have stop the horse or turn it aside -- god alone know -- but as she finger almost grasp it maude steady in she seat by the nearness of she would-be rescuer raise she whip and strike ida across the bosom and across the outstretched hand the blow in its finish fall on adoni 's reek neck with a snort he tear away from the other horse and sweep onward with maude once again sway in she saddle ida gaze at she in speechless terror for a instant then as if she could look no longer she fling up she arm across she eye a moment afterwards a cry a shrill scream that ring in she ear for many a day afterwards rise above the clatter of adoni 's hoof and before the cry have die away horse and rider have fall with awful force into and across the hole then come a dead silence break only by the sound of the horse 's iron shoe as he kick wildly and paw in a vain attempt to rise ida ride up and fling herself to the ground try to approach the struggle animal but indeed it be horror and not fear that strike she motionless for a moment for horse and rider be mix in awful confusion and already maude falconer 's graceful form be stain with blood and batter by the madly kick animal now in its death-throe a instant after before she could recover from she paralysis of terror -- the whole affair be one of a moment and have pass as quickly as a flit cloud -- stafford be by she side and at work extricate woman from horse it be not a easy task for though adoni be now dead a part of maude 's body lay under he shoulder but with utmost herculean strength stafford succeed in get she clear and lift she out of the hole on to the grass kneel beside he ida calm now but tremble raise maude 's head on she knee and wipe the blood from the beautiful face its loveliness be not mar there be no bruise or cut upon it the blood have fly from a wound just behind the temple stafford run to the brook for some water and try to force a few drop through the clenched tooth while ida bath the white brow suddenly a tremor run through he and he put he hand over maude 's heart it be quite still he bent he cheek to she lip no breath meet they for a moment or two he could not speak then he stay ida 's minister hand and look up at she say : it be of no use she be dead chapter xliii the ball which lady clansford always give about the middle of the season be generally a very brilliant affair but this year it be more brilliant and alas more crowded than usual for lord clansford be connect as everybody know with the great trans-african company and as also everybody know that company have recover from the blow deal it by the rising of the native and be now flourish beyond the most sanguine expectation of its owner the clansford coffer not to mention those of many other person be overflow and lord clansford could afford a somewhat magnificent hospitality howard as he make he way up the crowded stair smile cynically to himself as he catch sight of a little knot of financier who stand just outside the great door of the _ salon _ they be all there -- griffenberg wirsch the belton efford and fitzharford and they be all smile and in the best of humor present by they appearance a striking contrast to that which they have wear when he have see they on the night when the ruin of the company have be convey in that fatal cablegram have succeed at last in force a entrance and bow over the hand of he noble hostess which must have sadly ache and return she mechanical word of welcome with a smile as galvanic as she own howard sidle he way along the wall -- a waltz be in progress -- and collide against the beautiful and bounteous bertie who be mop he brow and look round despairingly for he partner halloo howard he exclaim pretty old scrimmage be not it should have think you languid grace would have keep out of this sight i have give a dance to a girl but dash my best necktie if i can find she : might as well look for a needle in a bottle of hay -- as if any fellow would be such a fool as to put a needle in such a place i be jolly mad at lose she i can tell you for she be the prettiest girl in the room and i have to fight like a coal-heaver to get a dance from she and now i can not find she : just my luck what be the name of the prettiest girl in the room ask howard languidly oh it be the new beauty of course reply bertie with a superior little shrug at howard 's ignorance it be miss heron of herondale the great heiress howard prick up he ear but maintain he languid and half-indifferent manner miss heron of herondale he say in he slow voice do not think i have meet she no dessay not she do not go out much and lady clansford think it be rather a feather in she cap get she here to-night when you see she you will not say i have over-praised she she be more than pretty and she would be the bright and particular star of the season if she do not keep in she shell so much herondale say howard musingly that be the place near the villa be not it i do not remember anyone of she name as have be amongst the company there no say the omniscient bertie she be live in retirement with she father then but stafford must have know she -- make she acquaintance do not you remember that she be present when poor miss falconer meet with she fatal accident howard remember very well but he say ah yes as if the fact have just be recall to he she father die and leave she a hatful of money -- that be ever so many month ago -- and now she be come up to london and i tell you howard that it be with she as it be with the friend of we school-boy day : ' i come i be see i conquered ' everybody be mad about she she be stay with some country people call the vaynes people who would have pass like a third _ entre _ unnoticed but they be deluge with invitation and ` all on account of eliza ' do not be vulgar bertie say howard rebukingly well it be vulgar admit bertie especially apply to such a exquisite creature as miss heron -- oh there she be with young glarn they say that he be more than ready to lay he ducal coronet at she foot -- confound the young beggar -- but she do not give he the least encouragement to do so look she do not appear to be listen to he though he be talk for all he be worth and it be the same with all of we : we be all die with love for she and for all she care we may die howard look across the room and catch a glimpse of a tall slim figure a pale ivory-tinted face with soft and silky black hair dress in the simplest fashion and dark violet eye half hide by they long lash it be a lovely face and something more -- a impressive one : it be a face once see not easily forget perhaps it be not its beauty but a certain preoccupy expression a sadness in the eye and in the curve of the expressive lip which make it so haunt a one she be exquisitely dress with a suggestion of mourning in the absence of diamond and a touch of pale violet in the black lace frock she be very beautiful say howard and i can condole with you sincerely on the loss of you dance yes it be nearly over now say bertie with a sigh talking of stafford he say after a minute when do you hear from he last to-day reply howard i have he letter in my pocket still out in the backwoods ask bertie poor old chap awful piece of luck for he if he father have only go on living and wait until that bless company have come right side uppermost he would have be a millionaire look at griffenberg and the rest of 'em he nod towards the group of financier they be simply roll in money roll in it yes he be still in the backwoods as you call it respond howard and from what he say i should think he be have a pretty hard time of it though of course he do not complain : there be some man still leave who do not complain there be a pause during which he have be think deeply then he say : so stafford know miss heron do he bertie look mysterious and lower he voice yes look here old chap i should not say this to anyone but you but you be stafford 's great and only chum and i know i can speak safely to tell you the truth -- now you be go to tell I anything but the truth murmur howard with a sigh of resignation oh no i be not retort bertie what there be of it be the truth and nothing but the truth it be not much but i have a kind of idea that stafford know we new beauty better than we think do you remember how he use to leave we party and go off by himself not like stafford that be it and one of we fellow remark to I that one day come home from a ride he see stafford ride with a lady he could not swear to he but -- well stafford 's hard to mistake then again how be it he and miss heron be in at maude falconer 's death and why do he bolt off to australia again directly after the funeral and why be it that she keep we all at arm 's length even that confound glarn howard 's eye grow sharp but he smile languidly as he say : you ought to edit a riddle book bertie my son i think we should get across the room now i should be greatly oblige if you would introduce I to miss heron all right say bertie come along but i warn you you 'll only meet with a cold reception just a smile and a word and then she 'll look away as if she would forget you existence and have not the least desire to remember it oh i be use to that say howard lead on as they cross the room howard 's acute brain be hard at work there be something in stafford 's conduct a tone in he letter which howard could never understand but now in the light of bertie 's mysterious communication he think he discern a solution of the problem over which he have ponder for many a hour stafford have be unhappy during the whole of he engagement to poor maude he have exile himself again immediately after she death though as howard know he be well enough off now to return to england and to live at any rate in a quiet way if there be anything in bertie 's suggestion -- howard purse he lip with a air of determination if there be anything then he would find it out and act accordingly stafford 's happiness be very precious to howard and in the quiet resolute cynical way characteristic to he he resolve that if that happiness lay in the hand of this beautiful girl with the sad eye and lip he howard would do he best to persuade she to yield it up he reception be certainly not encouraging ida glance at he and return he bow with a slight inclination of she head and then look away as if she have do all that could be demand of she and it be with a faint surprise perceptible in she face that she hear howard say in he slow and rather drawling voice : there be a conservatory behind that glass door miss heron it be not very far from the madding crowd but it must be cooler than here will you let I take you to it she hesitate for a moment but something in the steady regard of howard 's calm and sleepy eye impress she very well she say but i think i be engage for this next dance and i must not go far away i have already break two or three engagement in that case you can come without hesitation he say it be the first crime that cost a pang have pass that the downward course be easy and painless he lead she to a seat and with the cool determination which stafford always admire in he begin at once for he do not wish to give she time to slip on she woman 's armor he intend to strike quickly unexpectedly so that she should not be able to conceal the effect of the blow almost as hot as in australium he say languidly but watch she out of the tail of he eye i suppose you be never there miss heron nor have i be but i have get a letter in my pocket from a very great friend of mine who be rough it on a cattle-run and he have so often describe the country to I that i almost feel as if i know it by the way i think you know he he be my dearest and closest friend -- stafford orme as i always call he and think of he of course i be speaking of lord highcliffe the problem be solve : he see she face suddenly flush and then as suddenly grow pale so sharp have be the blow its effect so overwhelming that she fan fall from she hand howard as he restore it to she seize the opportunity of look she full in the face and assurance be make doubly sure this girl _ do _ hold he friend stafford 's happiness in she hand ida be silent for a moment because she know she could not control she voice could not keep it steady then with a quicken breath she say : yes i know mr orme -- lord highcliffe then i hope you like he he say mercilessly for there be no time for mercy some idiot of a dancing-man would come and take she from he the next minute i express the hope because i myself like and admire he very much indeed he be a splendid fellow and one of those instance of a good man struggle with adversity be you fond of poetry miss heron ida 's bosom be heave she be fight for calm she know now who it be with whom she be speak it be the friend the cynical mr howard of whom stafford have tell she she have not catch he name at the introduction she regard he with intense interest and inclined she head by way of assent i never think of my friend lord highcliffe without recall those significant line of william watson 's he look at she and be it say that he eye be fine and impressive one when he show they plainly these be the line : ' i do not ask to have my fill of wine of love or fame i do not for a little ill against the god exclaim ` one boon of fortune i implore with one petition kneel : _ at least caress I not before thou break I on thy wheel _ ' she lip quiver and she long lash conceal she eye they be fine line she say they fit my friend lord highcliffe 's case to a t he be for a time the spoil darling of fortune she caress he as she caress few man -- and now she be break he on she wheel and the caress of course make the break all the harder to bear he write most interesting letter -- i do not know whether you care about farm and cattle-raising and that kind of thing for my own part i be sublimely ignorant of such matter i can lay my hand upon my heart and say i know a cow from a horse but nothing shall induce I to go further if you be interested i would venture to offer to show you one of he letter there be nothing in they of a private character she heart beat still more quickly he see the eager light flash in she eye and he hand go to he breast coat-pocket then he say blandly : i will bring one next time we meet be you go -- where be you go to-morrow miss heron i too shall be go there probably she put she hand to she lip with a little nervous gesture : she be disappointed she think he be go to show she a letter then and there i be go to lady fitzharford 's to-morrow afternoon to try over some music with she she say hesitatingly ah yes lady fitzharford be a good friend of mine he say shall you be there at say four yes say ida in a low voice do you say that mr orme -- lord highcliffe be well oh yes he be all right now reply howard he have be ill -- a fever of some kind or other i believe -- but he have recover he be a monster of strength as you may have hear but i be afraid he be very unhappy : something on what he call he mind -- he be not very intellectual you know -- ida shoot a indignant glance at he which make howard chuckle inwardly -- but the best the noblest of good fellow i assure you miss heron i would give anything to see he happy ah here come a gentleman with hurry gait and distract countenance he be look for he partner alas it be you we meet then at lady fitzharford 's to-morrow i will bring my friend 's letter but i do sincerely hope it will not bear you he bow he adieu and leave she and leave the house for the ball have no further interest for he all the way home he ponder over the case that she love stafford he have not the very least doubt she eye she sudden blush and color she voice have betray she he have love she all the time and i be a purblind ass not to have see it he say to himself with cynical self-contempt as he climb up to he room they be modest but comfortable room in picadilly -- and he strike a match before he open the door but it be not necessary for he to have get a light for there be one in the room already and by it he see a long-limbed figure which have be sit in he easy-chair but which rise and exclaim : howard howard hold he breath for a moment then say with exaggerated calm i be glad you find the cigar and the whiskey stafford have you be wait long : sorry to keep you howard laugh as he wring he friend 's hand i think i should surprise you old man but i flatter myself say stafford nothing surprise I but i 'll admit to be rather pleased at see you drawl howard push he gently buck in the chair have you -- er -- walk from australium or fly stafford stare oh i see you mean i come so quickly on my letter i start directly after i post it but lose the mail at southampton i -- i get a restless fit and be oblige to come get it now drawl howard or perhaps the journey have cool you down have you eat i can get something -- yes yes say stafford rather impatiently get dinner at the hotel i come on here at once : hear you would go to a dance and think i would wait i want you to do something for I howard -- i 'll tell you all my news some other time -- not that there be much to tell : i be well and nourishing as you see i want you to go down to bryndermere i dare not go myself -- not yet i want you to get all the information you can about -- about a lady : miss heron of herondale -- how very strange say howard innocently do you know i have just have the pleasure of meet a miss heron of herondale -- stafford spring to he foot where he demand hotly at lady clansford 's ball which i have just leave may i ask why you be so interested in miss heron as to send I on such a mission i love she say stafford briefly i can not live without she -- i have try and i have fail i have love she since -- oh i can not tell you i want to know what she be do i want to know if she have forget I if there be any hope for I howard look at he compassionately and whistle softly my dear old man he say with a air of reluctance you fly rather high the lady you speak of be the belle of the present season she be the admire of all admirer belt earl to say nothing of noble duke be at she foot she be the star of the ball which i have just leave if i may say so i think you be very unwise to leave such a peerless
