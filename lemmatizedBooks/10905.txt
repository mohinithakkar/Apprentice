delightfully with a touch-and-go vivacity which be the highest form of dinner-table talk not dwelling with a heavy hand upon any one subject but glance from theme to theme with airy lightness but not one word do she say about the governor of madras and at this juncture of affair it would have be the worst possible taste to inquire too closely after he lordship 's welfare so the dinner wear on to

year of age at the beginning of he service but he be a man of extraordinary gravity much in advance of he year a man of shrewd common-sense and clear sharp intellect not a reading man or a man in any way superior to he station and belongings but a man who could think quickly and understand quickly and who always seem to think rightly prompt in action yet steady as a rock and to all appearance recognize no earthly interest no human tie beyond or above the interest of he master as a nurse steadman show himself invaluable lord peverill leave he a hundred pound in acknowledgment of he service which be something for lord peverill who have very little ready cash wherewith to endow he only daughter after he death the title and the estate go to a distant cousin lady diana angersthorpe be take

among all she possession she most value but it have hitherto be reserve for summer occupation or for perhaps two or three week at easter when the spring be exceptionally fine the sudden determination to spend the come winter in the house near grasmere be consider a curious freak of lady maulevrier 's and she be constrain to explain she motive to she friend ` he lordship be out of health ' she say ` and want perfect rest and retirement now fellside be the only place we have in which he be likely to get perfect rest anywhere else we should have to entertain fellside be out of the world there be

would rather winter in the south ' those terrible rumor which have first come upon the world of london last June have be grow darker and more define ever since but still lady maulevrier make believe to ignore they and she act she part of unconsciousness with such consummate skill that nobody in she circle could be sure where the act begin and where the ignorance leave off the astute lord denyer

position and fortune and now by he folly by he extravagance and by that greed of gold which be inevitable in the spendthrift and profligate he have go near to cheat she out of both name and fortune yet she so command herself as to receive he with a friendly air when he arrive at the dolphin on a dull gray autumn afternoon after she have wait for he nearly a fortnight jame steadman usher in he lordship a frail attenuate look figure of middle height wrap in a furred cloak yet shiver a pale sickly face light auburn whisker light blue eye full and large but with no intellectual power in they lady maulevrier be sit by the fire in a melancholy attitude with the blenheim spaniel on she lap she son be at hasting with he nurse she have nothing nearer and dearer than the spaniel she rise and go over to she husband and let he kiss she it would have be too much to say that she kiss he but she submit she lip unresistingly to he and then they sit down on opposite side of the hearth ' a wretched afternoon ' say he lordship shiver and draw he chair closer to the fire steadman have take away he fur-lined cloak ' i have really underrate the disagreeableness of the english climate it be abominable ' ` to-day be not a fair sample ' answer she ladyship try to be cheerful ` we have have some pleasant autumn day ' ' i detest autumn ' exclaim lord maulevrier ' a season of dead leaf damp and dreariness i should like to get away to montpellier or nice as soon as we can ' she ladyship give he a scathing look half-scornful half-incredulous ` you surely would not dream of leave the country ' she say ` under present circumstance so long as you be here to answer all charge no one will interfere with you liberty but if you be to cross the channel -- ' ` my slanderer might insinuate that i be run away ' interrupted maulevrier ` although the very fact of my return ought to prove to every one that i be able to meet and face this cabal ' ` be it a cabal ' ask she ladyship look at he with a gaze that search he soul ` can you meet they charge can you live down this hideous accusation and hold up you head as a man of honor ' the sensualist 's blue eye nervously shun that look of earnest interrogation he lip answer the wife 's speak question with a lie a lie make manifest by the expression of he countenance ' i be not afraid ' he say he wife answer not a word she be assure that the charge be true and that the battered rake who shiver over the fire have neither courage nor ability to face he accuser she see the whole fabric of she life in ruin she son the penniless successor to a tarnished name there be silence for some minute lady maulevrier sit with lowered eyelid look at the fire deep in painful think two perpendicular wrinkle upon she broad white forehead -- so calm so unclouded in society -- tell of gnawing care then she steal a look at she husband as he recline in he arm-chair he head lie back against the cushion in listless repose he eye look vacantly

premature decay the result of a evil life be distinctly mark in he fade face the dull yellow tint of the complexion the tarnished dimness of the large blue eye the discontented droop of the lip the languor of the attitude the pallid transparency of the waste hand all tell of a life worn threadbare energy exhaust chance throw away a mind abandon to despair ` you look very ill ' say he wife after that long blank interval which mark so unnatural a apathy between husband and wife meeting after so long a severance ' i be very ill i have be worry to death -- surround by rogue and liar -- the victim of a most infernal conspiracy ' he speak hurriedly grow whiter and more tremulous as he go on ` do not talk about it you agitate yourself to no purpose ' say lady maulevrier with a tranquillity which seem heartless yet which might be the result of suppress feeling ` if you be to face this scandal firmly and boldly next January you must try to recover physical strength in the meanwhile mental energy may come with better health ' ' i shall never be any better ' say lord maulevrier testily ` that infernal climate have shatter my constitution ' ` two or three month of perfect rest and good nursing will make a new man of you i have arrange that we shall go straight from here to fellside no one can plague you there with that disguised impertinence call sympathy you can give all you

charming retreat in summer but we have never winter there what put it into you head to go there at such a season as this why i daresay the snow be on the top of the hill already ' ` it be the only place i know where you will not be watch and talk about ' reply lady maulevrier ` you will be out of the eye of the world i should think that consideration would weigh more with you than two or three degree of the thermometer ' ' i detest cold ' say the earl ` and in my weak health -- ' ` we will take care of you ' answer she ladyship and in the discussion which follow she bear herself so firmly that she husband be fain to give way how could a disgraced and ruin man break in health and spirit contest the mere detail of life with a high-spirited woman ten year he junior the earl want to go to london and remain there at least a week but this she ladyship strenuously oppose he must see he lawyer he urge there be step to be take which could be take only under legal advice -- counsel to be retain if this lie invention of satan be really destine to take the form of a public trial he must be prepare to fight he foe on they own ground ` you can make all you preparation at fellside ' answer he wife resolutely ' i have see messr rigby and rider and you own particular ally rigby will go to you at fellside whenever you want he ' ` that be not like my be on the spot ' say he lordship nervously evidently much disconcert by she ladyship 's firmness but too feeble in mind and body for a prolonged contest ' i ought to be on the spot i be not without influence i have friend man in power ' ` surely you be not go to appeal to friendship in order to vindicate you honor these charge be true or false if they be false you own manhood you own rectitude can face they and trample upon they unaided by back-stairs influence if they be true no one can help you ' ' i think you at least ought to know that they be as false as hell ' retort the earl with a attempt to maintain he dignity ' i have act as if i so believe ' reply he wife ' i have live as if there be no such slander in the air i have steadily ignore every report every insinuation -- have hold my head as high as if i know you be immaculate ' ' i expect as much from you ' answer the earl coolly ` if i have not know you be a woman of sense i should not have marry you ' this be he utmost expression of gratitude he next remark have reference solely to he own comfort where be he room at what hour be they to dine and hereupon he ring for he valet a german swiss and a servant out of a thousand chapter iii on the wrong

whither they travel across country by wallingford and oxford the second day take they to lichfield lord maulevrier be out of health and feeble and grumble a good deal about the fatigue of the journey the badness of the weather which be dull and cold east wind all day and a light frost morning and night as they progress northward the sky look grayer the air become more bite he lordship insist upon the stage be shorten he lay in bed at he hotel till noon and be seldom ready to start till two o'clock he could see no reason for haste the winter would be long enough in all conscience at fellside he complain of mysterious ache and pain describe himself in the presence of hotel-keeper and headwaiter as a mass of malady he be nervous irritable intensely disagreeable lady maulevrier bear he humor with unwavering patience and win golden opinion from all sort of people by she devotion to a husband whose blighted name be the common talk of england everybody even in distant provincial town have hear of the scandal against the governor of madras and everybody look at the sallow fade anglo-indian with morbid curiosity he lordship sensitive on all point touch he own ease and comfort be keenly conscious of this unflattering inquisitiveness the journey protracted by lord maulevrier 's languor and ill-health drag its slow length along for nearly a fortnight until it seem to lady maulevrier as if they have be travel upon those dismal flat unpicturesque road for month each day be so horribly like yesterday the same hedgerow and flat field and pass glimpse of river or canal the same absence of all beauty in the landscape -- the same formal hotel room and smirking landlady -- and so on till they come to lancaster after which the country become more interesting -- hill arise in the background even the smoky manufacturing town through which they pass without stop be less abominable than the level monotony of the midland county but now as they draw nearer the hill the weather grow colder snow be speak of and when they get into westmoreland the mountain-peak gleam whitely against a lead-coloured sky ` you ought not to have bring I here in such weather ' complain the earl shiver in he sable as he sit in he corner of the travel chariot look discontentedly at the gloomy landscape ` what be to become of we if we be catch in a snowstorm ' ` we shall have no snow worth talk about

luncheon at windermere and to be at home by nightfall but by the time they get to windermere the sky have change to a dark gray and the people at the hotel prophesy a heavy fall before night and urge the earl and countess to go no further that day the latter part of the road to fellside be rough and hilly if there should be a snowstorm the horse would never be able to drag the carriage up the steepest bit of the way here however lord maulevrier 's obstinacy come into play he would not endure another night at a hotel so near he own house he be sick to death of travel and want to be at rest among comfortable surroundings ` it be murder to bring I here ' he say to he wife ` if i have go to hasting i should have be a new man by this time as it be i be a great deal worse than when i land '

travel cap cover head and ear he eye contemplate the whitening world with a weary anger he wife watch the landscape as long as she could but the snow soon begin to darken all the air and she could see nothing save that blank blinding fall half-way to fellside there be a point where two road meet one lead towards grasmere the other towards the village of great langdale a cluster of humble habitation in the heart of the hill when the horse have struggle as far as this point the snow be six inch deep on the road and make a thick curtain around they as it fall by this time the earl have doze off to sleep he wake a hour after let down the window which let in a snow-laden gust and try to pierce the gloom without ` as black as erebus ' he exclaim ` but we ought to be close at home by this time yes

postilion explain that when they come to the critical point of they journey where the road branch off to the langdale the snow be fall so thickly the whole country be so hide in all-pervading whiteness that even he who know the way so well could give no help to the driver he could only trust to the instinct of local postilion and local horse and instinct have prove wrong the traveller alight and be usher into a not uncomfortable-looking parlor very low as to the ceiling very old-fashioned as to the furniture but spotlessly clean and enliven by a good fire to which he lordship draw near shiver and mutter discontentedly to himself ` we might be worse off ' say she ladyship look round the bright little room which please she better than many a state apartment in the large hotel at which they have stop ` hardly unless we be out on the moor ' grumble she husband ' i be sick to death of this ill-advised unreasonable journey i be at a loss to imagine you motive in bring I here you

grog in front of the kitchen fire he have teach himself to dispense with the consolation of tobacco lest he should at any time make himself obnoxious to she ladyship steadman be closet with lady maulevrier for the next half-hour during which he lordship 's condition be gravely discuss when he leave the sitting-room he tell the landlord to be sure and feed the post-horse well and make they comfortable for the night so that they might be ready for the drive to fellside early next morning ` do you think he lordship will be well enough to travel ' ask the landlord ` he have make up he mind to get home -- ill or well ' answer steadman ` he have waste about a week by he dawdle way on the road and now he be in a fever to get to fellside ' chapter iv the last stage the post-horse -- which have be well feed but accommodate somewhat poorly in stable and barn -- be quite ready to go on next morning but lord maulevrier be not able to leave he room where she ladyship remain in close attendance upon he the hill and valley be white with snow but there be none fall and mr evan the elderly surgeon from ambleside ride over to great langdale on he elderly cob to look at robert haswell and be call in to see lord maulevrier she ladyship have speak lightly of he skill on the previous evening but any doctor be better than none so this feeble little personage be allow to feel he lordship 's pulse and look at he lordship 's tongue he opinion never too decidedly give be a little more hazy than usual on this occasion perhaps because of a certain awfulness to unaccustomed eye in lady maulevrier 's proud bearing he say that he lordship be low very low and that the pulse be more irregular than he like but he commit himself no further than this and go away promising to send such pill and potion as be appropriate to the patient 's condition a boy ride the same pony over to langdale later in the afternoon with the promise medicine throughout the short winter day which seem terribly long in the stillness and solitude of great langdale lady maulevrier keep watch in the sick-room steadman go in and out in constant attendance upon he master -- save for one half-hour only which she ladyship pass in the parlor below in conversation with the landlady a very serious conversation as indicate by mr smithson 's grave and somewhat troubled look when she leave she ladyship but a good deal of she trouble may have be cause by she anxiety about she brother who be pronounce by the doctor to be ` much the same ' at eleven o'clock that night a mount messenger be send off to ambleside in hot haste to fetch mr evan who come to the inn to find lady maulevrier kneel beside she husband 's bed while steadman stand with a troubled countenance at a respectful distance the room be dimly light by a pair of candle burn on a table near the window and at some distance from the old four-post bedstead shaded by dark moreen curtain the surgeon look round the room and then fumble in he pocket for he spectacles without the aid of which the outside world present itself to he under a blur and uncertain aspect he put on he spectacles and move towards the bed but the first glance in that direction show he what have happen the outline of the rigid figure under the coverlet look like a sculptured effigy upon a tomb a sheet be draw over the face of death ` you be too late to be of any use mr evan ' murmured steadman lay he hand upon the doctor 's sleeve and draw he away towards the door they go softly on to the landing off which open the door of that other sick-room where the landlady 's brother be lie ` when do this happen ' ' a quarter of a hour after the messenger ride off to fetch you ' answer steadman ` he lordship lay all the afternoon in a heavy sleep and we think he be go on well but after dark there be a difficulty in he breathing which alarm she ladyship and she insist upon you be send for the messenger have hardly be go a quarter of a hour when he lordship wake suddenly mutture to himself in a curious way give just one long draw sigh and -- and all be over it be a terrible shock for she ladyship ' ` indeed it must have be ' murmur the village doctor ` it be a great surprise to I i know lord maulevrier be low very low the pulse feeble and intermittent but i have no fear of anything of this kind it be very sudden ' ` yes it be awfully sudden ' say steadman and then he murmur in the doctor 's ear ` you will give the necessary certificate i hope with as little trouble to she ladyship as possible this be a dreadful blow and she -- ' ` she shall not be trouble the body will be remove to-morrow i suppose ' ` yes he must be bury from he own house i send a second messenger to ambleside for the undertaker he will be here very soon no doubt and if the shell be ready by noon to-morrow the body can be remove then i have arrange to get she ladyship away to-night ' ` so late after midnight ' ` why not she can not stay in this small house -- so near the dead there be a moon and there be no snow fall and we be within seven mile of fellside ' the doctor have nothing further to say against the arrangement although such a drive seem to he a somewhat wild and reckless proceeding mr steadman 's grave self-possessed manner answer all doubt mr evan fill in the certificate for the undertaker drink a glass of hot brandy and water and remount he nag in nowise relish he midnight ride but console himself with the reflection that he would be handsomely pay for he trouble a hour later lady maulevrier 's travel carriage stand ready in the stable yard in the deep shadow of wall and gable it be at steadman 's order that the carriage wait for she ladyship at a obscure side door rather than in front of the inn a east wind be blow keenly along the mountain road and the careful steadman be anxious he mistress should not be expose to that chilly blast there be some delay and the four horse jingle they bit impatiently and then the door of the inn open a feeble light gleam in the narrow passage within steadman stand ready to assist she ladyship there be a bustle a confusion of dark figure on the threshold a huddle mass of cloak and fur wrap be lift into the carriage the door be clap to the horse go clatter out of the yard turn sharply into the snowy road and start at a swing pace towards the dark sullen bulk of loughrigg fall the moon be shine upon elterwater in the valley yonder -- the mountain ridge the deep gorge below those sullen height look back where the shadow of night enfold they but all along the snow-white road the silver light shone full and clear and the mountain way look like a path through fairyland chapter v forty year after ` what a horrid day ' say lady mary throw down she book with a yawn and look out of the deep bay window into a world of mountain and lake which be cloud over by a dense veil of rain and dull gray mist such rain as one see only in a lake district a curtain of gloom which shut off sky and distance and narrow the world to one solitary dwelling suspend amidst cloud and water like another ark in a new deluge rain -- such rain as make out-of-door exercise impossible -- be always a affliction to lady mary haselden she delight be in open air and sunshine -- fishing in the lake and river -- sit in some sheltered hollow of the hill more fitting for a eagle 's nest than for the occupation of a young lady try to paint those ever-varying unpaintable mountain peak which change they hue with every change of the sky -- swim ride rove far and wide over hill and heather -- pleasure all more or less masculine in they nature and which be a subject of regret with lady maulevrier lady lesbium be of a different temper she love ease and elegance the gracious luxury of life she love art and music but not to labor hard at either she play and sing a little -- excellently within that narrow compass which she have allot to herself -- play mendelssohn 's ` lied ' with finish touch and faultless phrasing sing heine 's ballad with consummate expression she paint not at all why should anyone draw or paint indifferently she ask when providence have furnish the world with so many great painter in the past and present she could not understand mary 's ardent desire to do the thing herself -- to be able with she own pencil and she own brush to reproduce the lake and valley the wild brown hill she love so passionately lesbium do not care two straw for the lovely lake district amidst which she have be rear -- every pike and force every beck and gill whereof be distinctly dear to she younger sister she think it a very hard thing to have spend so much of she life at fellside a trial that would have hardly be endurable if it be not for grandmother grandmother and lesbium adore each other lesbium be the one person for whom lady maulevrier 's stateliness be subjugate by perfect love to all the rest of the world the countess be marble but to lesbia she be wax lesbium could mould she as she please but happily lesbium be not the kind of young person to take advantage of this privilege she be thoroughly ductile or docile and have no desire at present which run counter to she grandmother lesbium be a beauty in she nineteenth year she be a curious reproduction in face and figure expression and carriage of that lady diana angersthorpe who five and forty year ago flutter the dove-cot of st jame 's and mayfair by she brilliant beauty and she keen intelligence there in the panelled drawing-room at fellside hang harlow 's portrait of lady diana in she zenith in a short-waisted white satin frock with large puffed gauze sleeve through which the perfect arm show dimly stand under that picture lady lesbium look as if she have step out of the canvas she be to be paint by millais next year lady maulevrier say when she have be introduce and society be begin to talk about she : for lady maulevrier make up she mind five or six year ago that lesbium should be the reign beauty of she season to this end she have educate and train she furnish she with all those grace best calculate to please and astonish society she be too clever a woman not to discover lesbium 's shallowness and lack of all great gift save that one peerless dower of perfect beauty she know exactly what lesbium could be train to do and to this end lesbium have be educate and to this end lady maulevrier bring down to fellside the most accomplished of hanoverian governess who have learn french in pari and have toil in the educational mill with profit to herself and she pupil for a quarter of a century to this lady the countess entrust the education of she granddaughter ' mind while for they physical training she provide another teacher in the person of a clever little parisian dancing mistress who have set up at the west-end of london as a teacher of dancing and calisthenics and have utterly fail to find pupil enough to pay she rent and keep she modest _ pot-au-feu _ go mademoiselle thiebart be very glad to exchange the uncertainty of a first floor in north audley street for the comfort and security of fellside manor with a salary of one hundred and fifty pound a year both fräulein and mademoiselle have be quick to discover that lady lesbium be the apple of she grandmother 's eye while lady mary be comparatively a outsider so it come about that mary 's education be in somewise a mere picking-up of the crumb which fall from lesbium 's table and that she be allow in a general way to run wild she be much quicker at any intellectual exercise than lesbium she learn the lesson that be give she at railroad speed and rattle off she exercise with a slap-dash penmanship which horrify the neat and niggling fräulein and then rush off to the lake or mountain and by this mean grow browner and browner and more indelibly freckled day by day thus widen the gulf between herself and she beauty sister but it be not to be suppose that because lesbium be beautiful mary be plain this be very far from the truth mary have splendid hazel eye with a dancing light in they when she smile ruddy auburn hair white tooth a deeply-dimpled chin and a vivacity and archness of expression which serve only in she present state of tutelage for the subjugation of old woman and shepherd boy mary have be teach to believe that she chance of future promotion be of the smallest that nobody would ever talk of she or think of she by-and-by when she in she turn would make she appearance in london society and that it would be a very happy thing for she if she be so fortunate as to attract the attention of a fashionable physician a canon of westminster or st paul 's or a barrister in good practice mary turn up she pert little nose at this humdrum lot ' i would much rather spend all my life among these dear hill than marry a nobody in london ' she say fearless of that grand old lady at whose frown so many people shiver ` if you do not think people will like I and admire I -- a little -- you have better save yourself the trouble of take I to london i do not want to play second fiddle to my sister ' ` you be a very impertinent person and deserve to be take at you word ' reply my lady scowl at she ` but i have no doubt before you be twenty you will tell another story ' ` oh ' say mary now just turn seventeen ` then i be not to come out till i be twenty ' ` that will be soon enough ' answer the countess ` it will take you as long to get rid of those odious freckle and no doubt by that time lesbium will have make a brilliant marriage ' and now on this rainy July morning these two girl neither of whom have any serious employment for she life or any serious purpose in live waste the hour each in she own fashion lesbium recline upon a cushion seat in the deep embrasure of a tudor window she _ pose _ perfection -- it be one of many such attitude which mademoiselle have teach she and which by assiduous training have become a second nature poor mademoiselle have finish she mission and teach lesbium all she could teach have now depart to a new and far less luxurious situation in a finishing school at passy but fräulein müller be still retain as watch-dog and duenna lesbium 's pale blue morning gown harmonise exquisitely with a complexion of lily and rose violet eye and golden-brown hair she feature be distinguish by that perfect chiselling which give such a haughty grace to she grandmother 's countenance even at sixty-seven year of age -- a loveliness which like the sculptured marble it resemble be unalterable by time lesbium be read keat it be she habit to read the poet carefully and deliberately take up one at a time and duly lay a volume aside when she find herself mistress of its contents she have no passion for poetry but it be a elegant leisurely kind of reading which suit she languid temperament moreover she grandmother have tell she that a easy familiarity with the great poet be of all knowledge that which best qualify a woman to shine in conversation without offend the superior sex by any assumption of scholarship mary be a very different class of reader capricious omniverous tear out the heart of book roam from flower to flower in the field of literature loving old and new romance and reality novel travel play poetry and never dwelling long on any one theme perhaps if mary have live in the bosom of a particularly sympathetic family she might have be reckon almost a genius so much of poetry and originality be there in she free unconventional character but hitherto it have be mary 's mission in life to be snub whereby she have acquire a very poor opinion of she own talent ` oh ' she cry with a desperate yawn while lesbium smile she languid smile over endymion ` how i wish something would happen -- anything to stir we out of this statuesque sleeping-beauty state of be i verily believe the spider be all asleep in the ivy and the mouse behind the wainscot and the horse in the stable ' ` what could happen ' ask lesbium with a gentle elevation of pencilled brow ` be not these lovely line -- and coverlid gold-tinted like the peach or ripe October 's fade marigold fall sleek about he in a thousand fold fade marigold be not that intensely sweet ' ` very well for you sleepy keat but i do not suppose you would have notice the passage if marigold be not in fashion ' say mary with a touch of scorn ` what could happen why a hundred thing -- a earthquake flood or fire what could happen do you say lesbium why maulevrier might come home unexpectedly and charm we out of this death-in-life ' ` he would occasion a good deal of unpleasantness if he do ' answer lesbium coldly ` you know how angry he have make grandmother ' ` because he keep race-horse which have a unlucky knack of lose ' say mary dubiously ' i suppose if he horse win grandmother would rather approve ' ` not at all that would make hardly any difference except that he would not ruin himself quite so quickly grandmother say that a young man who go on the turf be sure to be ruin sooner or later and then maulevrier 's habit be altogether wild and foolish it be very hard upon grandmother who have such noble ambition for all of we ' ` not for I ' answer mary smile ` she view about I be very humble she consider that i shall be most fortunate if a doctor or a lawyer condescend to like I well enough to make I a offer he might make I the offer without like I for the sake of hear himself and he wife announce as mr and lady mary snook at dinner party that would be too horrid but i daresay such thing have happen ' ` do not talk nonsense mary ' say lesbia loftily ` there be no reason why you should not make a really good marriage if you follow grandmother 's advice and do not affect eccentricity ' ' i do not affect eccentricity but i be afraid i really be eccentric ' murmured mary meekly ` for i like so many thing i ought not to like and detest so many thing which i ought to admire ' ' i daresay you will have tame down a little before you be present ' say lesbium carelessly she could not even affect a profound interest in anyone but herself she have a narrowness of mental vision which prevent she look beyond the limited circle of she own pleasure she own desire she own dream and hope she be one of those strictly correct young woman who be not likely to do much harm in the world but who be just as unlikely to do any good mary sigh and go back to she book a bulky volume of travels and try to lose herself in the sandy waste of africa and to be deeply interested in the source of the congo not in she heart of heart care a straw whether that far-away river come from the mountain of the moon or from the moon itself to-day she could not pin she mind to page which might have interested she at another time she thought be with lord maulevrier that fondly-love only brother just seven year she senior who have take to race-horse and bad way and seem to be try he hardest to dissipate the splendid fortune which he grandmother the dowager countess have nurse so judiciously during he long minority maulevrier and mary have always be what the young man call ` no end of chum ' he call she he own brown-eyed molly much to the annoyance of lady maulevrier and lesbium and mary 's life be all gladness when maulevrier be at fellside she devote herself wholly to he amusement ride and drive with he follow on she pony when he go otter hunting and very often abandon the pony to the care of some stray mountain youth in order to join the hunter and go leap from stone to stone on the margin of the stream and occasionally in moment of wild excitement when the hound be in full cry splashing in and out of the water like a naiad in a neat little hunting-habit mary look after maulevrier 's stable when he be away and have supreme command of a kennel of fox-terrier which cost she brother more money than the countess would have care to know for in the wide area of lady maulevrier 's ambition there be no room for two hundred guinea fox-terrier be they never so perfect altogether mary 's life be a different life when she brother be at home and in he absence the best part of she day be spend in think about he and fulfil the duty of she position as he representative in stable and kennel and among certain rustic in the district chiefly of the sport type who be maulevrier 's choose ally or _ protégés _ never perhaps have two girl of patrician lineage live a more secluded life than lady maulevrier 's granddaughter they have know no pleasure beyond the narrow sphere of home and home friend they have never travel -- they have see hardly anything of the outside world they have never be to london or pari or to any city larger than york and they visit to that center of dissipation have be of the briefest a mere flash of mild gaiety a horticultural show or a oratorio and back by express train closely guard by governess and footman to fellside in the autumn when the leaf be fall in the wooded grounds of fellside the young lady be send still under guardianship of governess and footman to some quiet seaside resort between alnwick and edinburgh where mary live the wild free life she love roam about the beach boat shrimping seaweed-gathering make hard work for the governess and footman who have be send in charge of she lady maulevrier never accompany she granddaughter on these occasion she be a vigorous old woman straight as a dart slim as a girl active in she degree as any young athlete among those hill and she declare that she never feel the need of change of air the sodden shrubbery the fall leaf do she no harm never within the memory of this generation have she leave fellside she love of this mountain retreat be a kind of _ culte _ she have come here break spirited perhaps broken heart bring she dead husband from the little inn at great langdale forty year ago and she have hardly leave the spot since that day in those day fellside house be a very different kind of dwelling from the gracious modern tudor mansion which now crown and beautify the hill-side above grasmere lake it be then a old rambling stone house with queer little room and inconvenient passage low ceiling thatch gable and all manner of strange nook and corner lady maulevrier be of too strictly conservative a temper to think of pull down a old house which have be in she husband 's family for generation she leave the original cottage undisturbed and build she new house at right angle with it connect the two with a wide passage below and a handsome corridor above so that access should be perfect in the event of she require the accommodation of the old quaint low ceil room for she family or she guest during forty year no such necessity have ever arise but the old house know as the south wing be still leave intact the original furniture undisturbed although the only occupant of the building be she ladyship 's faithful old house-steward jame steadman and he elderly wife the house which lady maulevrier have build for herself and she grandchild have not be create all at once though the nucleus date forty year back be a handsome building she have add more room as necessity or fancy dictate now a library with bedroom over it now a music room for lady lesbium and she grand piano -- anon a billiard-room as a agreeable surprise for maulevrier when he come home after a tour in america thus the house have grow into a long low pile of tudor masonry -- steep gable heavily mullioned casement gray stone wall curtain with the rich growth of passion-flower magnolia clemati myrtle and rose -- and all those flower which thrive and flourish in that mild and sheltered spot the view from those mullioned casement be perfect switzerland could give hardly any more exquisite picture than that lake shut in by hill grand and bold in they varied outline so rich in they color that the eye dazzle with beauty forget to calculate the actual height of those craggy peak and headland the mind forget to despise they because they be not so lofty as mont blanc or the matterhorn the velvet sward of the hill slope steeply downward from lady maulevrier 's drawing-room window to the road beside the lake and this road be so hide by the wooded screen which bound she ladyship 's grounds that the lake seem to lie in the green heart of she garden a lovely placid lake on summer day reflect the emerald hue of the surround hill and look like a smooth green meadow which invite the foot passenger to cross it the house be approach by a wind carriage drive that lead up and up and up from the road beside the lake so screen and sheltered by shrubbery and pine wood that the stranger know not whither he be go till he come upon a opening in the wood and the stately italian garden in front of a massive stone porch through which he enter a spacious oak-panelled hall and anon descend a step or two he find himself in lady maulevrier 's drawing-room and face to face with that divine view of the everlasting hill the lake shine below he bath in sunlight or if it be the stranger 's evil fate to come in wet weather he see only a rain-blotted landscape -- the blur outline of gray mountain peak scowl at he from the other side of a gray pool but if the picture without be depress the picture within be always good to look upon for those oak-panelled or tapestried room communicate by richly-curtained doorway from draw room to library from library to billiard room be as perfect as wealth and taste could make they lady maulevrier argue that as there be but one house among all the possession of she race which she care to inhabit she have a right to make that house beautiful and she have spare nothing upon the beautification of fellside and yet she have spend much less than would have be squander by any pleasure-loving dowager restlessly rove from piccadilly to the engadine from pontresina to nice or monaco wind up with easter in pari and then back to piccadilly she ladyship 's friend wonder that she could care to bury herself alive in westmoreland and expatiate on the eccentricity of such a life nay those who have never see fellside argue that lady maulevrier have take in she old age to hoarding and that she pig at a cottage in the lake district in order to swell a fortune which young maulevrier would set about squander as soon as she be in she coffin but here they be wrong it be not in lady maulevrier 's nature to lead a sordid life in order to save money yet in these quiet year that be go -- start with that golden nucleus which she husband be suppose to have bring home from indium obtain no one know how the countess have amass one of the largest fortune possess by any dowager in the peerage she have it and she hold it with a grasp that nothing but death could loosen nay that all-foreseeing mind of hers might contrive to cheat grim death itself and to scheme a way for protect this wealth even when she who have gather and garner it should be moulder in she grave the entail estate belong to maulevrier be he never such a fool or spendthrift but this fortune of the dowager 's be she own to dispose of as she please and not a penny of it be likely to go to the young earl lady maulevrier 's pride and hope be concentrate upon she granddaughter lesbium she should be the inheritress of this noble fortune -- she should spread and widen the power of the maulevrier race lesbium 's son should link the family name with the name of he father and if by any hazard of fate the present earl should die young and childless the old countess 's interest should be strain to the uttermost to obtain the title for lesbium 's offspring why should she not be countess of maulevrier in she own right but in order to make this future possible the most important factor in the sum be yet to be find in the person of a husband for lady lesbium -- a husband worthy of peerless beauty and exceptional wealth a husband whose own fortune should be so important as to make he above suspicion that be lady maulevrier 's scheme -- to wed wealth to wealth -- to double or quadruple the fortune she have build up in the long slow year of she widowhood and thus to make she granddaughter one of the greatest lady in the land for it need hardly be say that the man who be to wed lady lesbium must be she equal in wealth and lineage if not she superior lady maulevrier be not a miser she be liberal and benevolent to all who come within the circle of she life wealth for its own sake she value not a jot but she live in a age in which wealth be power and ambition be she ruling passion as she have be ambitious for she husband in the day that be go she be now ambitious for she granddaughter time have intensify the keen eagerness of she mind she have be disappointed cruelly bitterly in the ambition of she youth she have be make to drink the cup of shame and humiliation but to this ambition of she old age she hold with even greater tenacity god help she if she should be disappoint here it be not to be suppose that so astute a schemer as lady maulevrier have not survey the marriage market in order to discover that fortunate youth who should be deem worthy to become the winner of lesbium 's hand year ago when lesbium be still in the nursery the dowager have make herself inform of the age weight and color of every likely runner in the matrimonial stake or in plainer word have keep herself by she correspondence with a few intimate friend and she close study of the fashionable newspaper thoroughly acquaint with the character and exploit the disposition and antecedent of those half-dozen elder son among whom she hope to find lesbium 's lord and master she know she peerage by heart and she know the family history of every house record therein the sin and weakness the folly and loss of bygone year the taint mental and physical the lateral branch and intermarriage the runaway wife and unfaithful husband idiot son or scrofulous daughter she know everything that be to be know about that aristocratic world into which she have be bear sixty-seven year ago and the sum-total of she knowledge be that there be one man whom she desire for she granddaughter 's husband -- one man and one only and into whose hand when earth and sky should fade from she glazing eye she could be content to resign the sceptre of power there be no doubt half-a-dozen or more in the list of elder son who be fairly eligible but this young man be the achille in the rank and file of chivalry and she soul yearn to have he and no other for she darling she soul yearn to he with a tenderness which be not all on lesbium 's account forty-nine year ago she have fondly love he father -- love he and have be fain to renounce he for ronald hollister afterwards earl of hartfield be then a younger son and the two family have agree that marriage between pauper be a impudent fly in the face of providence which must be put down with a iron hand lord hartfield send he son to turkey in the diplomatic service and the old dowager lady carrisbrook whisk she niece off to london and keep she there under watch and ward till lord maulevrier propose and be accept by she there should be no foolishness no clandestine correspondence the iron hand crush two young heart and secure a brilliant future for the body which survive fifteen year later ronald 's elder brother die unmarried ha abandon that career of vagrant diplomacy which have take he all over europe and as far as washington and re-appear in london the most elegant man of he era but thoroughly _ blasé _ there be rumor of a unhappy attachment in the faubourg saint germain of a tragedy at petersburg society protest that lord hartfield would die a bachelor as he brother die before he the hollister be not a marry family say society but six or seven year after he return to england lord hartfield marry lady florence ilmington a beauty in she first season and a very sweet but somewhat prudish young person the marriage result in the birth of a heir whose appearance upon this mortal stage be follow within a year by he father 's exit hence the hartfield property always a fine estate have be nurse and fatten during a long minority and the present lord hartfield be repute one of the richest young man of he time he be also speak of as a superior person inherit all he father 's intellectual gift and have the reputation of be singularly free from the vice of profligate youth he be neither prig nor pedant and he be very popular in the best society but he be not ashamed to let it be see that he ambition soar higher than the fashionable world of turf and stable card and pigeon match though not of the gay world nor in it lady maulevrier have contrived to keep herself thoroughly _ en rapport _ with society she few choose friend with whom she correspond on term of perfect confidence be among the best people in london -- not the circulator of club-house canard the pickers-up of second-hand gossip from the society papers but actor in the comedy of high life arbiter of fashion and taste bear and breed in the purple last season lord hartfield 's absence have cast a cloud over the matrimonial horizon he have be a traveller for more than a year -- patagonium peru the pyramid japan the north pole -- society care not where -- the fact that he be go be all-sufficient bachelor a shade less eligible come to the front in he absence and become first favorite lady maulevrier well inform in advance have defer lesbium 's presentation till next season when she be tell lord hartfield would certainly re-appear he plan have be make for return before christmas and it would seem that he scheme of life be lay down with as much precision as if he have be a prince of the blood royal thus it happen to lesbium 's intense disgust that she _ début _ be defer till the verge of she twentieth birthday it would never do lady maulevrier tell herself for the edge to be take off the effect which lesbia 's beauty be to make on society during lord hartfield 's absence he must be there on the spot to see this star rise gently and slowly above society 's horizon and to mark how everybody bow down and worship the new light ' i shall be a old woman before i appear in society ' say lesbia petulantly ` and i shall be like a wild woman of the wood for i have see nothing and know nothing of the civilised world ' ` you will be ever so much more attractive than the young woman i hear of who have see and know a great deal too much ' answer the dowager and as she granddaughter know that lady maulevrier 's word be a law that alter not there be no more idle repining she ladyship give no reason for the postponement of lesbium 's presentation she be far too diplomatic to breathe a word of she idea with regard to lord hartfield anything like a matrimonial scheme would have be revolt to lesbium who have grand but not sordid view about matrimony she think it she mission to appear and to conquer a crowd of suitor would sigh around she like the love and grace round that fair belinda whose story she have read so often and it would be she part to choose the most worthy the day be go when a girl would so much as look at such a fribble as sir plume she virgin fancy demand the tennysonian ideal the grave and knightly arthur but when lesbium thought of the most worthy it be always of the worthiest in she own particular sphere and he of course would be title and wealthy and altogether fit to be she husband he would take she by the hand and lead she to a higher seat on the dais and place upon she head or at least upon she letter-paper and the panel of she carriage a coronet in which the strawberry leave should stand out more prominently than in she brother 's emblazonment lesbium 's mind could not conceive a ignoble marriage or the possibility of the most worthy happen to be find in a lower circle than she own and now it be the end of July and the season which should have be glorify by lady lesbium 's _ début _ be over and do with she have read in the society papers of all the ball and birthday and race meeting and regatta and cricket match and gown and parasol and bonnet -- what this beauty wear on such a occasion and how that other beauty look on another occasion -- and she feel as she read like a spell-bound princess in a fairy tale mew up in a battlemented tower and deprive of she legitimate share in all the pleasure of earth she have no patience with mary -- that wild unkempt ungraceful creature who could be as happy as summer day be long racing about the hill with she bamboo alpenstock rioting with a pack of fox-terrier practise long loser rowing on the lake do all thing unbecome lady maulevrier 's granddaughter that long rainy day drag its slow length to a close and then come fine day in which molly and she fox-terrier go wander over the sunlit hill skip and dance across the mountain streamlet -- gill as they be call in this particular world -- almost as gaily as the shadow of fleecy cloudlet dance up yonder in the windy sky molly spend half she day among the hill steal off from governess and grandmother and the stately beauty sister and sometimes hardly be miss by they so ill do she young exuberance harmonise with they calmer life ` one can tell when mary be at home by a perpetual banging of door ' say lesbium which be a sisterly exaggeration found upon fact for molly be give to impetuous rush in and out of room when that eager spirit of hers impel the light lithe body upon some new expedition nor be the society of fox-terrier conducive to repose or stateliness of movement and maulevrier 's terrier although strictly forbid the house be for ever break bond and leap in upon molly 's retirement at all unreasonable hour she and they be enchant to get away from the beautiful luxurious room and to go roving by hill-side and force away to easedale tarn to bask for hour on the grassy margin of the deep still water or to row round and round the mountain lake in a rotten boat it be here or in some kindred spot that molly get through most of she reading -- here that she read shakespeare byron and shelley and wordsworth -- dwelling lingeringly and lovingly upon every line in which that good old man speak of she native land sometimes she climb to higher ground and feel herself ever so much nearer heaven upon the crest of silver howe or upon the rugged stony steep of dolly waggon pike half way up the dark brow of helvellyn sometimes she disappear for hour and climb to the summit of the hill and wander in perilous pathway on stride edge or by the dark still water of the red tarn this have be she life ever since she have be old enough to have a independent existence and the hill and the lake and the book of she own choosing have do a great deal more in ripen she mind than fräulein müller and that admirable series of educational work which have be provide for the tuition of modern youth grammar and geography primer and elementary work of all kind be mary 's detestation but she love book that touch she heart and fill she mind with thought wide and deep enough to reach into the infinite of time and space the mystery of mind and matter life and death nothing occur to break the placid monotony of life at fellside for three long day after that rainy morning and then come a event which although commonplace enough in itself mark the beginning of a new era in the existence of lady maulevrier 's granddaughter it be evening and the two girl be dawdle about on the sloping lawn before the drawing-room window where lady maulevrier read the newspaper in she own particular chair by one of those broad tudor window accord to she infallible custom remote as she life have be from the busy world she ladyship have never allow she knowledge of public life and the bent of modern thought to fall into arrear she take a keen interest in politics in progress of all kind she be a staunch conservative and look upon every liberal politician as she personal enemy but she take care to keep herself inform of everything that be be say or do in the enemy 's camp she have a intense respect for lord bacon 's maxim : knowledge be power it be a kind of power secondary to the power of wealth perhaps but wealth unprotected by wisdom would soon dwindle into poverty lady lesbium saunter about the lawn look very elegant in she cream-coloured indian silk gown very listless very tired of she lovely surroundings neither lake nor mountain possess any charm for she she have have too much of they mary roam about with a swifter footstep look at the rose pluck off a dead leaf or a cankered bud here and there presently she tear across the lawn to the shrubbery which screen the lawn and flower garden from the wind carriage drive sink many foot below and disappear in a thicket of arbutus and irish yew ` what terribly hoydenish manners ' murmured lesbium with a languid shrug of she shoulder as she stroll back to the drawing-room she care very little for the newspaper for politics not at all but anything be better than everlasting-contemplation of the blue still water and the rugged crest of helm crag ` what be the matter with mary that she rush off like a mad woman ' inquire lady maulevrier look up from the _ time _ ' i have not the least idea mary 's movement be quite beyond the limit of my comprehension perhaps she have go after a bird 's - nest ' mary be intent upon no bird 's - nest she quick ear have catch the sound of manly voice in the wind drive under the pine wood and surely yes surely one be a clear and familiar voice which herald the come of happiness in such a moment she seem to have wing she become unconscious that she touch the earth she go skim bird-like over the lawn and in and out with flutter muslin frock among arbutus and bay yew and laurel till she stand poise lightly on the top of the wooded bank which border the steep ascent to lady maulevrier 's gate look down at two figure which be saunter up the drive they be both young man both tall broad-shouldered manly walking with the easy swing movement of man accustom to active exercise one the handsomer of the two in mary 's eye since she think he simply perfection be fair-haired blue-eyed the typical saxon this be lord maulevrier the other be dark bronze by foreign travel perhaps with black hair cut very close to a intelligent-looking head bare to the evening breeze ` hulloa ' cry maulevrier ` there be molly how d'ye do old girl ' the two man look up and molly look down delight at she brother 's return so fill she heart and mind that there be no room leave for embarrassment at the appearance of a stranger ' o maulevrier i be so glad i have be pine for you why do not you write to say you be come it would have be something to look forward to ' ` could not never know from day to day what i be go to be up to besides i know i should find you at home ' ` of course we be always at home ' say mary ` go up to the house as fast as ever you can i 'll go and tell grandmother ' ` and tell they to get we some dinner ' say maulevrier mary 's flutter figure dip and be go vanish in the dark labyrinth of shrub the two young man saunter up to the house ` we need not hurry ' say maulevrier to he companion whom he have not take the trouble to introduce to he sister ` we shall have to wait for we dinner ' ` and we shall have to change we dusty clothes ' add the other ' i hope that man will bring we portmanteau in time ' ` oh we need not dress we can spend the evening in my den if you like ' mary fly across the lawn again and bound up the step of the verandah -- a picturesque swiss verandah which make a covered promenade in front of the house ` mary may i ask the meaning of this excitement ' inquire she ladyship as the breathless girl stand before she ` maulevrier have come home ' ` at last ' ` and he have bring a friend ' ` indeed he might have do I the honor to inquire if he friend 's visit would be agreeable what kind of person ' ' i have no idea i do not look at he maulevrier be look so well they will be here in a minute may i order dinner for they ' ` of course they must have dinner ' say she ladyship resignedly as if the whole thing be a infliction and mary run out and interview the butler beg that all thing might be make particularly comfortable for the traveller it be nine o'clock and the servant be enjoy they eventide repose have give she order mary go back to the drawing-room impatiently expectant of she brother 's arrival for which event lesbium and she grandmother wait with perfect tranquillity the dowager calmly continue the perusal of she _ time _ while lesbium sit at she piano in a shadowy corner and play one of mendelssohn 's softest lied to these dreamy strain maulevrier and he friend presently enter ` how d'ye do grandmother how do lesbium this be my very good friend and canadian travel companion jack hammond -- lady maulevrier lady lesbium ' ` very glad to see you mr hammond ' say the dowager in a tone so purely conventional that it might mean anything ` hammond i ought to remember you family -- the hammond of -- ' ` of nowhere ' answer the stranger in the easiest tone ' i spring from a race of nobody of whose existence you ladyship be not likely to have hear ' chapter vi maulevrier 's humble friend that faint interest which lady lesbium have feel in the advent of a stranger dwindle to nothing after mr hammond 's frank avowal of he insignificance at the very beginning of she career with the world wait to be conquer by she a high-born beauty could not be expect to feel any interest in nobody lesbium shake hand with she brother honor the stranger with a stately bend of she beautiful throat and then withdraw herself from they society altogether as it be and begin to explore she basket of crewel at a distant table by the soft light of a shaded lamp while maulevrier answer he grandmother 's question and mary stand watch he hang on he word as if unconscious of any other presence mr hammond go over to the window and look out at the view the moon be rise above the amphitheatre of hill and she ray be silver the placid bosom of the lake light be dot here and there about the valley tell of village life the prince of wale 's hotel yonder sparkle with its many light like a castle in a fairy tale the stranger have look upon many a grander scene but on none more lovely here be lake and mountain in little without the snow-peak and awful inaccessible region of solitude and peril homely hill that one might climb placid english vale in which english poet have live and die ` hammond and i mean to spend a month or six week with you if you can make we comfortable ' say maulevrier ' i be delighted to hear that you can contemplate stay a month anywhere ' reply she ladyship ` you usual habit be as restless as if you life be a disease it shall not be my fault if you and mr hammond be uncomfortable at fellside ' there be courtesy but no cordiality in the reply if mr hammond be a sensitive man touchily conscious of he own obscurity he must have feel that he be not want at fellside -- that he be a excrescence matter in the wrong place nobody have present the stranger to lady mary it never enter into maulevrier 's mind to be ceremonious about he sister molly she be so much a part of himself that it seem as if anyone who know he must need know she molly sit a little way from the window by which mr hammond be stand and look at he doubtfully wonderingly with not altogether a friendly eye as he stand with he profile turn to she and he eye upon the landscape she be incline to be jealous of she brother 's friend who would most likely deprive she of much of that beloved society hitherto she have be maulevrier 's choose companion at fellside -- indeed he sole companion after the dismissal of he tutor now this brown bearded stranger would usurp she privilege -- those two young man would go roaming over the hill fishing otter-hunting go to distant wrestling match and leave she at home it be a hard thing and she be prepare to detest the interloper even to-night she would be a loser by he presence under ordinary circumstance she would have go to the dining-room with maulevrier and sit by he and wait upon he as he eat but she dare not intrude herself upon a meal that be to be share with a stranger she look at john hammond critically eager to find fault with he appearence but unluckily for she present humor there be not much room for fault-finding he be tall broad-shouldered well-built he enemy would hardly deny that he be good-looking -- nay even handsome the massive regular feature be irreproachable he be more sunburnt than a gentleman ought to be mary thought she tell herself that he good look be of a vulgar quality like those of charle ford the champion wrestler whom she see at the sport the other day why do maulevrier pick up a companion who be evidently not of he own sphere hoydenish plain-spoken frank and affectionate as mary haselden be she know that she belong to a race apart that there be circle beneath circle below she own world circle which hers could never touch and she suppose mr hammond to be some waif from one of those nethermost world -- a village doctor 's son perhaps or even a tradesman 's -- send to the university by some benevolent busybody and place at a disadvantage ever afterwards a unfortunate anomaly suspend between two world like mahomet 's coffin the butler announce that he lordship 's dinner be serve ` come along molly ' say maulevrier ` come and tell I about the terrier while i eat my dinner ' mary hesitate glance doubtfully at she grandmother who make no sign and then slip out of the room hang fondly on she brother 's arm and almost forget that there be any such person as mr hammond in existence when these three be go lady lesbium express herself strongly upon maulevrier 's folly in bring such a person as mr hammond to fellside ` what be we to do with he grandmother ' she say pettishly ` be he to live with we and be one of we a person of whose belongings we know positively nothing who own that he people be common ' ` my dear he be you brother 's friend and we have the right to suppose he be a gentleman ' ` not on that account ' say lesbium more sharply than she wont ` do not he make a friend or almost a friend of jack howell the huntsman and of ford the wrestler i have no confidence in maulevrier 's idea of fitness ' ` we shall find out all about this mr hamleigh -- no hammond -- in a day or two ' reply she ladyship placidly ` and in the meantime we must tolerate he and be grateful to he if he reconcile maulevrier to remain at fellside for the next six week ' lesbium be silent she do not consider maulevrier 's presence at fellside a unmitigated advantage or indeed he presence anywhere those two be not sympathetic maulevrier make fun of he elder sister 's perfection chaff she intolerably about the great man she be go to captivate in she first season the great house in which she be go to reign lesbium despise he for that neglect of all he opportunity of culture which have leave he after the most orthodox and costly curriculum almost as ignorant as a ploughboy she despise a man whose only delight be in horse and hound gun and fishing-tackle molly would have care very little for the gun or the fishing-tackle perhaps in the abstract but she care for everything that interested maulevrier even to the bagful of rat which be let loose in the stable-yard sometimes for the education of a particularly game fox-terrier there be plenty of talk and laughter at the dinner-table while the countess and lady lesbium converse gravely and languidly in the dimly-lighted drawing-room the dinner be excellent and both traveller be ravenous they have eat nothing since breakfast and have drive from windermere on the top of the coach in the keen evening air when the sharp edge of the appetite be blunt maulevrier begin to talk of he adventure since he and molly have last meet he have not be dissipate in london all the time -- or indeed any great part of the time of he absence from fellside but molly have be leave in cimmerian darkness as to he proceedings he never write a letter if he could possibly avoid do so if it become a vital necessity to he to communicate with anyone he telegraph or in he own language ` wire ' to that person but to sit down at a desk and labor with pen and ink be not within he capacity or he view of he mission in life ` if a fellow be to write letter he might as well be a clerk in a office ' he say ` and sit on a high stool ' thus it happen that when maulevrier be away from fellside no fair _ châtelaine _ of the middle age could be more ignorant of the movement or whereabouts of she crusader knight than mary be of she brother 's going on she could but pray for he with fond and faithful prayer and wait and hope for he return and now he tell she that thing have go badly with he at epsom and worse at ascot that he have be as he express it ` up a tree ' and that he have go off to the black forest directly the ascot week be over and at rippoldsau he have meet he old friend and fellow traveller hammond and they have go for a walk tour together among the homely village the watchmaker the timber cutter the pretty peasant girl they have dance at fair -- and shoot at village sport -- and have altogether enjoy the thing hammond who be something of a artist have sketch a good deal maulevrier have do nothing but smoke he german pipe and enjoy himself ' i be glad to find myself in a world where a horse be a exception and not the rule ' he say ` oh how i should love to see the black forest ' cry mary who know the first part of faust by heart albeit she have never be give permission to read it ` the gnome and the witch -- der freischütz -- all that be lovely of course you go up the brocken ' ` of course ' answer mr hammond ` mephistophele be we _ valet de place _ and we go up among a company of witch ride on broomstick ' and then quote ` seh ' die bäume hinter bäumen wie sie schnell vorüberrücken und die klippen die sich bücken und die langen felsennasen wie sie schnarchen wie sie blasen ' this be the first time he have address himself directly to mary who sit close to she brother 's side and never take she eye from he face ready to pour out he wine or to change he plate for the serving-man have be dismiss at the beginning of this unceremonious meal mary look at the stranger almost as superciliously as lesbium might have do she be not incline to be friendly to she brother 's friend ` do you read german ' she inquire with a touch of surprise ` you have better ask he what language he do not read or speak ' say she brother ` hammond be a admirable crichton my dear -- by-the-by who be admirable crichton -- know everything can twist you little head the right way upon any subject ' ` oh ' think mary ` highly cultivate be he very proper in a man who be educate on charity to have work he hardest at the university ' she be not prepare to think very kindly of young man who have be successful in they college career since poor maulevrier have make such a dismal failure of he have be gate and send down and plough and have everything ignominious do to he that could be do which ignominy have involve a expenditure of money that lady maulevrier bemoan and lament until this day because she brother have not be virtuous mary grudged virtuous young man they triumph and they honor great raw-boned fellow who have take they degree at scotch university come to oxford and cambridge and sweep the board maulevrier have tell she when he own failure demand explanation perhaps this mr hammond have graduate north of the tweed and have come southward to rob the native mary be not any more inclined to be civil to he because he be a linguist he have a pleasant manner frank and easy a good voice a cheery laugh but she have not yet make up she mind that he be a gentleman ` if some benevolent old person be to take a fancy to charle ford the wrestler and send he to a scotch university i daresay he would turn out just as fine a fellow ' she think ford be somewhat of a favorite as a local hero the two young man go off to the billiard-room after they have dine it be half-past ten by this time and of course mary do not go with they she bid she brother good-night at the dining-room door ` good-night molly be sure you be up early to show I the dog ' say maulevrier after a affectionate kiss ` good-night lady mary ' say mr hammond hold out he hand albeit she have no idea of shake hand with he she allow she hand to rest for a instant in that strong friendly grasp she have not rise to give a couple of finger to a person whom she consider she inferior but she be incline to snub mr hammond as rather a presume young man ` well jack what do you think of my beauty sister ' ask he lordship as he choose he cue from the well-filled rack the lamp be light the table uncovered and ready carambole in he place albeit it be month since any player have enter the room everything which concerned maulevrier 's comfort or pleasure be do as if by magic at fellside and mary be the household fairy whose influence secure this happy state of thing ` what can any man think except that she be as lovely as the finest of reynold 's portrait as that lady diana beauclerk of colonel aldridge 's or the kitty fisher or any example you please to name of womanly loveliness ' ` glad to hear it ' answer maulevrier chalk he cue ` can not say i admire she myself -- not my style do not you know too much of my lady di -- too little of poor kitty but still of course it always please a fellow to know that he people be admire and i know that my grandmother have view grand view ' smile down at he cue ` shall i break ' and he begin with the usual miss in baulk ` thank you ' say mr hammond begin to play ` matrimonial view of course very natural that she ladyship should expect such a lovely creature to make a great match be there no one in view have there be no family conclave -- no secret treaty be the young lady fancy free ' ` perfectly she have be bury alive here except parson and a few decent people whom she be allow to meet now and then at the house about here she have see nothing of the world my grandmother have keep lesbium as close as a nun she be not so fond of molly and that young person have wild way of she own and give everybody the slip by-the-by how do you like my little moll ' the adjective be hardly accurate about a young lady who measure five foot six but maulevrier have not yet grow out of the idea belong to that period when mary be really he little sister a girl of twelve with long hair and short petticoat mr hammond be slow to reply mary have not make a very strong impression upon he dazzle by she sister 's pure and classical beauty he have no eye for mary 's homelier charm she seem to he a frank affectionate girl not too well-mannered and that be all he think of she ` i be afraid lady mary do not like I ' he say after he shot which give he time for reflection ` oh molly be rather _ farouche _ in she manners never would train fine do not you know she ladyship lecture till she be tired and now mary run wild and i suppose will be leave at grass till six month before she presentation and then they 'll put she on the pillar-rein a bit to give she a better mouth good shot by jove ' john hammond be use to he lordship 's style of conversation and understand he friend at all time maulevrier be not a intellectual companion and the distance be wide between the two man but he lordship 's gaiety good-nature and acuteness make amends for all shortcoming in culture and then mr hammond may have be one of those good conservative who do not expect very much intellectual power in a hereditary legislator chapter vii in the summer morning john hammond love the wild freshness of morning and be always eager to explore a new locality so he be up at five o'clock next morning and out of door before six he leave the sophisticated beauty of the fellside garden below he and climb higher and higher up the fell till he be able to command a bird 's - eye view of the lake and village and just under he foot as it be lady maulevrier 's favorite abode he be provide with a landscape glass which he always carry in he ramble and with the aid of this he could see every stone of the build the house add to at she

on the crest of a steepish slope the old building at right angle with the new make a quadrangle the third and fourth side of which be form by the dead wall of servant ' room and coach-house which have no window upon this inner enclosed side the old building be low and irregular one portion of the roof thatch another tile in the quadrangle there be a old-fashioned garden with geometrical flower-bed a yew tree hedge and a stone sun-dial in the center a peacock stalk about in the morning light and greet the newly rise sun with a discordant scream presently a man come out of a half glass door under a verandah which shaded one side of the quadrangle and stroll about the garden stop here and there to cut a dead rose or trim a geranium a stoutly-built broad shouldered man with gray hair and beard the image of well-fed respectability mr hammond wonder a little at the man 's leisurely movement as he saunter about whistle to the peacock it be not the manner of a servant who have duty to perform -- rather that of a gentleman living at ease and hardly know how to get rid of he time some superior functionary i suppose think hammond the house-steward perhaps he ramble a long way over the hill and come back to fellside by a path of he own discover which bring he to a wooden gate lead into the stable-yard just in time to meet maulevrier and lady mary emerge from the kennel where he lordship

about he ramble over the hill yonder up above that homely bench call ` rest and be thankful ' on the crest of loughrigg fall he be begin to learn the name of the hill already yonder darkling brow rugged gloomy look be nab scar yonder green slope of sunny pasture stretch wide its two arm as if to enfold the valley be fairfield and here close on the leave as he face the lake be silver howe and helm crag with that stony excrescence on the summit of the latter know as the ` lion and the lamb ' lady maulevrier 's house stand within a circle of mountain peak and long fell which wall in the deep placid fertile valley ` if you be not too tired to see the garden we might show they to you before breakfast ' say maulevrier ` we have three-quarter of a hour to the good ' ` half a hour for a stroll and a quarter to make myself presentable after my long walk ' say hammond who do not wish to face the dowager and lady lesbium in disorder apparel lady mary be such a obvious tomboy that he might be pardon for leave she out of the question they set out upon a exploration of the garden mary cling to she brother 's arm as if she want to make sure of he and still carry angelina the garden be as other garden but pass beautiful the sloping lawn and richly-timbered bank wind shrubbery broad terrace cut on the side of the hill give infinite variety all that wealth and taste and labor could do to make those grounds beautiful have be do -- the rarest conifer the loveliest flowering shrub grow and flourish there and the flower bloom as they bloom only in lakeland where every cottage garden can show a wealth of luxurious bloom unknown in more expose and arid district mary be very proud of those garden she have love they and work in they from she babyhood trot about on chubby leg after some choose old gardener carry a few weed or withered leaf in she pinafore and fancy herself useful ' i help ` oo do not i teeven ' she use to say to the gray-headed old gardener who first teach she to distinguish flower from weed ' i shall never learn as much out of these horrid book as poor old steven teach I ' she say afterwards when the gray head be at rest under the sod and governess botany manual and hard word from the greek be the order of the day nine o'clock be the breakfast hour at fellside there be no family prayer lady maulevrier do not pretend to be pious and she put no restraint of piety upon other people she go to church on Sunday morning for the sake of example but she read all the newest scientific book subscribe to the anthropological society and think as the newest scientific people think she rarely communicate she opinion among she own sex but now and then in strictly masculine and superior society she have be hear to express herself freely upon the nebular hypothesis and the doctrine of evolution ` after all what do it matter ' she say finally with she grand air ' i have only to marry my granddaughter creditably and prevent my grandson go to the dog and then my mission on this insignificant planet will be accomplish what new form that particular modification of molecule which you call lady maulevrier may take afterwards be hide in the great mystery of material life ' there be no family prayer therefore at fellside the sister have be properly educate in they religious duty have be teach the anglican faith carefully and well by they governess fräulein müller who have become a staunch anglican before enter the family of the english nobility and by the kind vicar of grasmere who take a warm interest in the orphan girl they grandmother have give they to understand that they might be as religious as they like she would be no let or hindrance to they piety but they must ask she no awkward question ' i have read a great deal and think a great deal and my idea be still in a state of transition ' she tell lesbium and lesbium who be somewhat automatic in she piety have no desire to know more lady maulevrier seldom appear in the forenoon she be a early riser be too vivid and highly string a creature even at sixty-seven year of age to give way to sloth she rise at seven summer and winter but she spend the early part of the day in she own room read write give order to she housekeeper and occasionally interview steadman who without any onerous duty be certainly the most influential person in the house people in the village talk of he and envy he so good a berth he have a gentleman 's house to live in and to all appearance live as a gentleman this tranquil retirement free from care or labor be a rich reward for the faithful service of he youth and it be know by the better inform among the grasmere people that mr steadman be save money and have share in the north-western railway these fact have ooze out of themselves as it be he be not a communicative man and rarely waste half a hour at the snug little inn near st oswald 's church amidst the cluster of habitation that be once call kirktown he be a unsociable man people say and think himself better than grasmere folk the lodging-house keeper and guide and wrestler and the honest friendly soul who be the outcome of that band of norwegian exile which find a home in these peaceful vale miss müller more commonly know as fräulein officiate at breakfast she never appear at the board when lady maulevrier be present but in she ladyship 's absence miss müller be guardian of the propriety she be a stout kindly creature and by no mean a formidable dragon when the gong sound john hammond go into the dining-room where he find miss müller seat alone in front of the urn he bow quick to read ` governess ' or ` companion ' in the lady 's appearance and she bow ' i hope you have have a nice walk ' she say ' i see you from my bedroom window ' ` do you then i suppose yours be one of the few window which look into that curious old quadrangle ' ` no there be no window look into the quadrangle those that be in the original plan of the house be wall up at she ladyship 's order to keep out the cold wind which sweep down from the hill in winter and early spring when the edge of loughrigg fall be white with snow my window look into the garden and i see you there with he lordship and lady mary ' lady lesbium come in at this moment and salute mr hammond with a haughty inclination of she beautiful head she look lovelier in she simple morning gown of pale blue cambric than in she more elaborate toilette of last evening such purity of complexion such lustrous eye the untarnished beauty of youth breathe the delicate freshness of a newly-opened flower she might be as scornful as she please yet john hammond could not withhold he admiration he be incline to admire a woman who keep he at a distance for the general bent of young woman now-a-day be otherwise maulevrier and mary come in and everyone sit down to breakfast lady lesbium unbend a little presently and smile upon the stranger there be a relief in a stranger 's presence he talk of new thing place and people she have never see she brighten and become quite friendly deign to invite the expression of mr hammond 's opinion upon music and art and after breakfast allow he to follow she into the drawing-room and to linger there fascinate for half a hour look over she newest book and she last batch of music but look most of all at she while maulevrier and mary be loaf on the lawn outside ` what be you go to do with yourself this morning ' ask maulevrier appear suddenly at the window ` anything you like ' answer hammond ` stay there be one pilgrimage i be eager to make i must see wordsworth 's grave and wordsworth 's house ' ` you shall see they both but they be in opposite direction -- one at you elbow the other a four mile walk which will you see first we 'll toss for it ' take a shilling from a pocketful of loose cash always ready for moment of hesitation ` head house tail grave tail it be come and have a smoke and see the poet 's grave the splendor of the monument the exquisite neatness with which it be keep will astound you consider that we live in a period of wordsworth worship ' hammond hesitate and look at lady lesbium ` be not you come ' call maulevrier from the lawn ` it be a fair offer i have get my cigarette case ' ` yes i be come ' answer the other with a disappointed air he have hope that lesbium would offer to show he the poet 's grave he could not abandon that hope without a struggle ` will you come with we lady lesbium we 'll suppress the cigarette ' ` thanks no ' she say become suddenly frigid ' i be go to practice ' ` do you never walk in the morning -- on such a lovely morning as this ' ` not very often ' she have re-enter those frozen region from which he attention have lure he for a little while she have remind herself of the inferior social position of this person in whose conversation she have allow herself to be interested ' _ filon _ ' cry maulevrier from below and they go mary would have very much like to go with they but she do not want to be intrusive so she go off to the kennel to see the terrier eat they morning and only meal of dog biscuit chapter viii there be always a skeleton the two young man stroll through the village maulevrier pause to exchange greeting with almost everyone he meet and so to the rustic churchyard above the beck the beck be swollen with late rain and be brawl merrily over its stony bed the churchyard grass be deep and cool and shadowy under the clustering branch the poet 's tomb be disappointing in its unlovely simplicity its stern slatey hue the plainest granite cross would have satisfy mr hammond or a cross in pure white marble with a sculptured lamb at the base surely the lamb emblem at once pastoral and sacred ought to enter into any monument to wordsworth but that gray headstone with its catalogue of date those stern iron railing -- be these fit memorial of one whose soul so love nature 's loveliness after mr hammond have see the little old old church and the medallion portrait inside have see all that maulevrier could show he in fact the two young man go back to the place of grave and sit on the low parapet above the beck smoking they cigarette and talk with that perfect unreserve which can only obtain between man who be old and try friend they talk as it be only natural they should talk of that household at fellside where all thing be new to john hammond ` you like my sister lesbium ' say maulevrier ` like she well yes the difficulty with most man must be not to worship she ' ` ah she be not my style and she be beastly proud ' ' a little _ hauteur _ give piquancy to she beauty i admire a grand woman ' ` so do i in a picture titian 's queen of cyprus or any party of that kind but for flesh and blood i like humility -- a woman who know she be human and not infallible and only just a little better than you or I when i choose a wife she will be no such example of cultivate perfection as my sister lesbium i want no goddess but a nice little womanly woman to jog along the rough and tumble road of life with I ' ` lady maulevrier 's influence no doubt have in a great measure determine the bent of you sister 's character : and from what you have tell I about she ladyship i should think a fixed idea of she own superiority would be inevitable in any girl train by she ' ` yes she be a proud woman -- a proud hard woman -- and she have steep lesbium 's mind in all she own pet idea and prejudice yet god know we have little reason to hold we head high ' say maulevrier with a gloomy look john hammond do not reply to this remark : perhaps there be some difficulty for a man situate as he be in find a fit reply he smoke in silence look down at the pure swift water of the rotha tumble over the crag and boulder below ` do not somebody say there be always a skeleton in the cupboard and the nobler and more ancient the race the bigger the skeleton ' say maulevrier with a philosophical air ` yes you family secret be a attribute of a fine old race the pelopida for instance -- in they case it be not a single skeleton but a whole charnel house i do not think you skeleton need trouble you maulevrier it belong to the remote past ' ` those thing never belong to the past ' say the young man ` if it be any other kind of taint -- profligacy -- madness even -- the story of a duel that go very near murder -- a runaway wife -- a rebellious son -- a cruel husband i have hear such story hint at in the record of family but we story mean disgrace i seldom see stranger put they head together at the club without fancy they be tell each other about my grandfather and point I out as the grandson and heir of a thief ' ` why use unduly hard word ' ` why should i stoop to sophistication with you my friend dishonesty be dishonesty all the world over and to plunder raja on a large scale be no less vile than to pick a pocket on ludgate hill ' ` nothing be ever prove against you grandfather ' ` no he die in the nick of time and the inquiry be squashed thanks to the angersthorpe interest and my grandmother 's cleverness but if he have live a few week longer england would have ring with the story of he profligacy and dishonor some people say he commit suicide in order to escape the inquiry but i have hear my mother emphatically deny this my father tell she that he have often talk with the people who keep the little inn where he father die and they be clear enough in they assertion that the death be a natural death -- the sudden collapse of a exhaust constitution ' ` be it on account of this scandal that you father spend the best part of he life away from england ' hammond ask feeling that it be a relief to maulevrier to talk about this secret burden of he the young earl be light-hearted and frivolous by nature yet even he have he graver moment and upon this subject of the old maulevrier scandal he be peculiarly sensitive perhaps all the more so because he grandmother have never allow he to speak to she about it have never satisfy he curiosity upon any detail of that painful story ' i have very little doubt it be so -- though i be not old enough when he die to hear as much from he own lip my father go straight from the university to vienna where he begin he career in the diplomatic service and where he soon afterwards marry a dowerless english girl of good family he go to rio as first secretary and die of fever within seven year of he marriage leave a widow and three baby the youngest in long clothes mother and baby all come over to england and be at once establish at fellside i can remember the voyage -- and i can remember my poor mother who never recover the blow of my father 's death and who die in yonder house after five year of broken health and broken spirit we have no one but the dowager to look to as child -- hardly another friend in the world she do what she like with we she keep the girl as close as nun so _ they _ have never hear a hint of the old history no breach of scandal have reach _ they _ ear but she could not shut I up in a country house for ever though she do succeed in keep I away from a public school the time come when i have to go to the university and there i hear all that have be say about lord maulevrier the man who tell I about the old scandal in a friendly way pretend not to believe it but one night when i have get into a row at a wine-party with a tailor 's son he tell I that if he father be a snip my grandfather be a thief and so he think himself the better breed of the two i smash he nose for he but as it be a decide pug before the row begin that hardly square the matter ' ` do you ever hear the exact story ' ' i have hear a dozen story and if only a quarter of they be true my grandfather be a scoundrel it seem that he be immensely popular for the first year or so of he government give more splendid entertainment than have be give at madras for half a century before he time lavish he wealth upon he favorite then arise a rumor that the governor be insolvent and harass by he creditor and then a new source of wealth seem to be at he command he be more reckless more princely than ever and then little by little there arise the suspicion that he be trafficking in english interest sell he influence to petty prince wink at those mysterious crime by which rightful heir be push aside to make room for usurper lastly it become notorious that he be the slave of a wicked woman false wife suspect murderess whose husband a native prince disappear from the scene just when he existence become perilous to the governor 's reputation accord to one version of the story the scandal of this rajah 's mysterious disappearance follow not long after by the ranee 's equally mysterious death be the immediate cause of my grandfather 's recall how much or how little of this story -- or other dark story of the same kind -- be true whether my grandfather be a consummate scoundrel or the victim of a baseless slander -- whether he leave indium a rich man or a poor man be know to no mortal except lady maulevrier and compare with she the theban sphinx be a communicative individual ' ` let the dead bury they dead ' say hammond ` neither you nor you sister can be the worse for this ancient slander no doubt every part of the story have be distort and exaggerate in the tell and a great deal of it may be pure invention evolve from the inner consciousness of the slanderer god forbid that any whisper of scandal should ever reach lady lesbium 's ear ' he ignore poor mary it be to he as if there be no such person she feeble light be extinguish by the radiance of she sister 's beauty she very individuality be annihilate ` as for you dear old fellow ' he say with warm affection ` no one will ever think the worse of you on account of you grandfather 's peccadillo ' ` yes they will hereditary genius be one of we modern craze when a man 's grandfather be a rogue there must be a taint in he blood people do not believe in spontaneous generation moral or physical now-a-days typhoid breed typhoid and typhus breed typhus just as dog breed dog and who will believe that a cheat and a liar can be the father of honest man ' ` in that case know what kind of man the grandson be i will never believe that the grandfather be a rogue ' say hammond heartily maulevrier put out he hand without a word and it be warmly grasp by he friend ` as for she ladyship i respect and honor she as a woman who have lead a life of self-sacrifice and have worn she pride as a armor ' continued hammond ` yes i believe the dowager 's character be rather fine ' say maulevrier ` but she and i have never hit we horse very well together she would have like such a fellow as you for a grandson jack -- a man who take high honor at oxford and could hold he own against all comer such a grandson would have gratify she pride and would have repay she for the trouble she have take in nurse the maulevrier estate for however poor a property it be when she husband go to india there be no doubt that it be a very fine estate now and that the dowager have be the making of it ' the two young man stroll up to easedale tarn before they go back to fellside where lady maulevrier receive they with a stately graciousness and where lady lesbium unbent considerably at luncheon and condescend to a animated conversation with she brother 's friend it be such a new thing to have a stranger at the family board a man whose information be well abreast with the march of progress who could talk eloquently upon every subject which people care to talk about in this new and animated society lesbium seem like a enchanted princess suddenly awaken from a spell-bound slumber molly look at she sister with absolute astonishment never have she see she so bright so beautiful -- no longer a picture or a statue but a woman warm with the glow of life ` no wonder mr hammond admire she ' think poor molly who be quite acute enough to see the stranger 's keen appreciation of she sister 's charm and positive indifference towards herself there be some thing which woman find out by instinct just as the needle turn towards the magnet shut a girl up in a tower till she be eighteen year old and on the day of she release introduce she to the first man she eye have ever look upon and she will know at a glance whether he admire she after luncheon the four young people start for rydal mount with fräulein as chaperon and watch-dog the girl be both good walker lady lesbium even though she look like a hot-house flower have be train to active habit could walk and ride and play tennis and climb a hill as become a mountain-bred damsel molly feeling that she conversational power be not appreciate by she brother 's friend take half a dozen dog for company and with three fox-terrier a little yorkshire dog a colley and a otter-hound be at no loss for society on the road more especially as maulevrier give she most of he company and entertain she with a account of he black forest adventure and all the fine thing he have say to the fair-haired blue-eyed baden girl who have sell he photograph or wild strawberry or have awaken the echo of the hill with the music of they rustic flute fräulein be perfectly aware that she mission upon this particular afternoon be not to let lady lesbium out of she sight for a instant to hear every word the young lady say and every word mr hammond address to she she have receive no specific instruction from lady maulevrier they be not necessary for the fräulein know she ladyship 's intention with regard to she elder granddaughter -- know they at least so far as that lesbium be intend to make a brilliant marriage and she know therefore that the presence of this handsome and altogether attractive young man be to the last degree obnoxious to the dowager she be oblige to be civil to he for she nephew 's sake and she be too wise to let lesbium imagine he dangerous : but the fact that he be dangerous be obvious and it be fräulein 's duty to protect she employer 's interest everybody know lord maulevrier so there be no difficulty about get admission to wordsworth 's garden and wordsworth 's house and after mr hammond and he companion have explore these they go back to the shore of the little lake and climb that rocky eminence upon which the poet use to sit above the placid water of silvery rydal it be a lovely spot and that narrow lake so poor a thing be magnitude the gauge of beauty have a soft and pensive loveliness in the clear afternoon light ` poor wordsworth ' sigh lesbium as she stand on the grassy crag look down on the shine water break in the foreground by fringe of rush and the rich luxuriance of water-lily ` be it not pitiable to think of the year he spend in this monotonous place without any society worth speaking of with only the shabbiest collection of book with hardly any interest in life except the sky and the hill and the peasantry ' ' i think wordsworth 's be a essentially happy life in spite of he narrow range ' answer hammond ` you with you ardent youth and vivid desire for a life of action can not imagine the calm bliss of reverie and constant communion with nature wordsworth have a thousand companion you and i would never dream of for he every flower that grow be a individual existence -- almost a soul ' ` it be a mild kind of lunacy a everlasting opium dream without the opium but i be grateful to he for live such a life since it have bequeath we some exquisite poetry ' say lesbium who have be too carefully culture to fleer or flout at wordsworth ' i do believe there be a otter just under that bank ' cry molly who have be watch the obvious excitement of she bandy-legged hound and she rush down to the brink of the water leap lightly from stone to stone and incite the hound to business ` let he alone can not you ' roar maulevrier ` leave he in peace till he be want if you disturb he now he 'll desert he holt and we may have a blank day the hound be to be out to-morrow ' ' i may go with you ' ask mary eagerly ` well yes i suppose you 'll want to be in it ' molly and she brother go on a explore ramble along the edge of the water towards ambleside leave john hammond in lesbium 's company but closely guard by miss müller these three go to look at nab cottage where poor hartley coleridge end he brief and cloud day and they have go some way upon they homeward walk before they be rejoin by maulevrier and mary the damsel 's kilted skirt considerably the worse for mud and mire ` what would grandmother say if she be to see you ' exclaim lesbium look contemptuously at the muddy petticoat ' i be not go to let she see I so she will say nothing ' cry mary and then she call to the dog ` ammon agag angelina ' and the three fox terrier fly along the road fall over themselves in the swiftness of they flight dart and leap and scramble over each other and offer the spectator the most intense example of joyous animal life the colley be far up on the hill-side and the otter-hound be still hunting the water but the terrier never go out of mary 's sight they look to she to take the initiative in all they sport they be back at fellside in time for a very late tea lady maulevrier be wait for they in the drawing-room ` oh grandmother why do you not take you tea ' exclaimed lesbium look really distressed ` it be six o'clock ' ' i be use to have you at home to hand I my cup ' reply the dowager with a touch of reproachfulness ' i be so sorry ' say lesbium sit down before the tea-table and begin she accustomed duty ` indeed dear grandmother i have no idea it be so late but it be such a lovely afternoon and mr hammond be so interested in everything connect with wordsworth -- ' she be look she loveliest at this moment all that be softest in she nature call forth by she desire to please she grandmother whom she really love she hang over lady maulevrier 's chair attend to she small want and seem scarcely to remember the existence of anyone else in this phase of she character she seem to mr hammond the perfection of womanly grace mary have rush off to she room to change she muddy gown and come in presently dress for dinner look the picture of innocence john hammond receive he tea-cup from lesbium 's hand and linger in the drawing-room talk to the dowager and she granddaughter till it be time to dress lady maulevrier find herself favourably impressed by he in spite of she prejudice it be very provoke of maulevrier to have bring such a man to fellside he very merit be objectionable she try with exquisite art to draw he into some revealment as to he family and antecedent : but he evade every attempt of that kind it be too evident that he be a self-made man whose intellect and good look be he only fortune it be criminal in maulevrier to have bring such a person to fellside she ladyship begin to think seriously of send the two girl to st bee or tynemouth for change of air in charge of fräulein but any sudden proceeding of that kind would inevitably awaken lesbium 's suspicion and there be nothing so fatal to a woman 's peace as this idea of danger no the peril must be face she could only hope that maulevrier would soon tire of fellside a week 's westmoreland weather -- gray sky and long rainy day would send these young man away chapter ix a cry in the darkness the peril have to be face for the weather do not favor lady maulevrier 's hope westmoreland sky forget to shed they accustomed shower westmoreland hill seem to have lose they power of draw down the rain that August be a lovely month and the young people at fellside revel in ideal weather maulevrier take he friend everywhere -- by hill and stream and force and gill -- to all those choose spot which make the glory of the lake country -- on windermere and thirlmere away through the bleak pass of kirkstone to ullswater -- on drive excursion and on boat excursion and pedestrian ramble which latter the homely-minded hammond seem to like best of all for he be a splendid walker and love the freedom of a mountain ramble the liberty to pause and loiter and waste a hour at will without be accountable to anybody 's coachman or responsible for the well-being of anybody 's horse on some occasion the two girl and miss müller be of the party and then it seem to john hammond as if nothing be need to complete the glory of earth and sky there be other day -- rougher journey -- when the man go alone and there be day when lady mary steal away from she book and music and all those study which she be suppose still to be pursue -- no longer closely supervise by she governess but on parole as it be -- and go with she brother and he friend across the hill and far away those be happy day for mary for it be always delight to she to be with maulevrier yet she have a profound conviction of john hammond 's indifference kind and courteous as he be in all he dealings with she and a sense of she own inferiority of she own humble charm and little power to please which be so acute as to be almost pain one day this keen sense of humiliation break from she unaware in she talk with she brother as they two sit on a broad heathy slope face to face with one of the langdale pike and with a deep valley at they foot while john hammond be climb from rock to rock in the gorge on they right explore the beauty of dungeon ghyll ' i wonder whether he think I very ugly ' say mary with she hand clasp upon she knee she eye fix on wetherlam upon whose steep brow a craggy mass of brown rock clothe with crimson heather stand out from the velvety green of the hill-side ` who think you ugly ' ` mr hammond i be sure he do i be so sunburnt and so horrid ' ` but you be not ugly why molly what be you dream about ' ` oh yes i be ugly i may not seem so to you perhaps because you be use to I but i know he must think I very plain compare with lesbium whom he admire so much ' ` yes he admire lesbium there be no doubt of that ' ` and i know he think I plain ' say molly contemplate wetherlam with sorrowful eye as if the sequence be inevitable ` my dearest girl what nonsense plain forsooth ugly quotha why there be not a finer pair of eye in westmoreland than my molly 's or a prettier smile or whiter tooth ' ` but all the rest be horrid ' say mary intensely in earnest ' i be sunburnt freckled and altogether odious -- like a haymaker or a market woman grandmother have say so often enough and i know it be the truth i can see it in mr hammond 's manner ' ` what freckle and sunburn and the haymaker and all that ' cry maulevrier laughing ` what a expressive manner jack 's must be if it can convey all that -- like lord burleigh 's nod by jove why what a goose you be mary jack think you a very nice girl and a very pretty girl i 'll be bind but be not you clever enough to understand that when a man be over head and ear in love with one woman he be apt to seem just a little indifferent to all the other woman in the world and there be no doubt jack be desperately in love with lesbium ' ` you ought not to let he be in love with she ' protest mary ` you know it can only lead to he unhappiness you must know what grandmother be and how she have make up she mind that lesbium be to marry some great person you ought not to have bring mr hammond here it be like let he into a trap ' ` do you think it be wrong ' ask she brother smile at she earnestness ' i should be very sorry if poor jack should come to grief but still if lesbium like he -- which i think she do -- we ought to be able to talk over the dowager ' ` never ' cry mary ` grandmother would never give way you have no idea how ambitious she be why once when lesbium be in a poetical mood and say she would marry the man she like best in the world if he be a pauper she ladyship fly into a terrible passion and tell she she would renounce she that she would curse she if she be to marry beneath she or marry without she grandmother 's consent ' ` hard line for hammond ' say maulevrier rather lightly ` then i suppose we must give up the idea of a match between he and lesbium ' ` you ought not to have bring he here ' retort mary ` you have better invent some plan for send he away if he stay it will be only to break he heart ' ` dear child man 's heart do not break so easily i have fancy that mine be break more than once in my life yet it be sound enough i assure you ' ` oh ' sigh mary ` but you be not like he wound do not go so deep with you ' the subject of they conversation come out of the rocky cleft in the hill as mary speak she see he hat appear out of the gorge and then the man himself emerge a tall well-built figure clothe in brown tweed come towards they with sketch-book and colour-box in he pocket he have be make what he call memorandum of the waterfall a stone or two here a cluster of fern there or a tree tear up by the root and yet green and live hang across the torrent a rude natural bridge this round by the langdale pike and dungeon ghyll be one of they best day or at least molly and she brother think so for to those two the presence of lesbium and she chaperon be always a restraint mary could walk twice as far as she elder sister and revel in hill-side path and all manner of rough place they order they luncheon at the inn below the waterfall and have it carry up on to the furzy slope in front of wetherlam where they could eat and drink and be merry to the music of the force as it come down from the hill behind they while the light and shadow come and go upon yonder rugged brow now gray in the shadow now ruddy in the sunshine mary be as gay as a bird during that rough and ready luncheon no one would have suspect she uneasiness about john hammond 's peril or she own plainness she might let she real self appear to she brother who have be she trust friend and father confessor from she babyhood but she be too thorough a woman to let mr hammond discover the depth of she sympathy the tenderness of she compassion for he woe later as they be walk home across the hill by great langdale and little langdale and fox howe and loughrigg fall she fall behind a few pace with maulevrier and say to he very earnestly -- ` you will not tell will you dear ' ` tell what ' he ask stare at she ` do not tell mr hammond what i say about he think I ugly he might want to apologise to I and that would be too humiliating i be very childish to say such a silly thing ' ` undoubtedly you be ' ` and you will not tell he ' ` tell he anything that would degrade my mary assail she dignity by so much as a breath sooner would i have this tongue tear out with red-hot pincers ' on the next day and the next sunshine and summer sky still prevail but mr hammond do not seem to care for rambling far afield he prefer loitering about in the village rowing on the lake reading in the garden and play lawn tennis he have only inclination for those amusement which keep he within a stone 's throw of fellside : and mary know that this disposition have arise in he mind since lesbium have withdraw herself from all share in they excursion lesbium have not be rude to she brother or she brother 's friend she have decline they invitation with smile and sweetness but there be always some reason -- a new song to be practice a new book to be read a letter to be write -- why she should not go for drive or walk or steamboat trip with maulevrier and he friend so mr hammond suddenly find out that he have see all that be worth see in the lake country and that there be nothing so enjoyable as the placid idleness of fellside and at fellside lady lesbium could not always avoid he without a too-marked intention so he taste the sweetness of she society to a much greater extent than be good for he peace if the case be indeed as hopeless as lady mary declare he stroll about the grounds with she he drink the sweet melody of she voice in heine 's tenderest ballad he read to she on the sunlit lawn in the lazy afternoon hour he play billiards with she he be she faithful attendant at afternoon tea he give himself up to the study of she character which to he charmed eye seem the perfection of pure and placid womanhood there might perhaps be some lack of passion and of force in this nature a marked absence of that impulsive feeling which be a charm in some woman : but this want be atone for by sweetness of character and mr hammond argue that in these calm nature there be often a unsuspected depth a latent force a grandeur of soul which only reveal itself in the great ordeal of life so john hammond hung about the luxurious drawing-room at fellside in a manner which he friend maulevrier ridicule as unmanly ' i have no idea you be such a tame cat ' he say : ` if when we be salmon fishing in canada anybody have tell I you could loll about a drawing-room all day listen to a girl squalling and reading novel i should not have believe a word of it ' ` we have plenty of rough on the shore of the st lawrence ' answer hammond ` summer idleness in a drawing-room be a agreeable variety ' it be not to be suppose that john hammond 's state of mind could long remain unperceived by the keen eye of the dowager she see the gradual dawn of he love she see the glow of its meridian she be please to behold this proof of lesbium 's power over the heart of man so would she conquer the man foredoom to be she husband when the come time should bring they together but agreeable as the fact of this first conquest might be as a evidence of lesbium 's supremacy among woman the situation be not without its peril and lady maulevrier feel that she could no longer defer the duty of warn she granddaughter she have wish if possible to treat the thing lightly to the very last so that lesbium should never know there have be danger she have tell she a few day ago that those drive and walk with the two young man be undignified even although guard by the fräulein 's substantial presence ` you be make yourself too much a companion to maulevrier and he friend ' say the dowager ` if you do not take care you will grow like mary ' ' i would do anything in the world to avoid _ that _ ' reply lesbia ` we walk and drive have be very pleasant mr hammond be extremely clever and can talk about everything ' she color heighten ever so little as she speak of he a indication duly observe by lady maulevrier ` no doubt the man be clever all adventurer be clever and you have sense enough to see that this man be a adventurer -- a mere sponge and toady of maulevrier 's ' ` there be nothing of the sponge or the toady in he manner ' protest lady lesbium with a still deeper blush the warm glow of angry feeling ` my dear child what do you know of such people -- or of the atmosphere in which they be generate the sponge and toady of to-day be not the clumsy fawn wretch you have read about in old-fashioned novel he can flatter adroitly and feed upon he friend and yet maintain a show of manhood and independence i 'll wager mr hammond 's trip to canada do not cost he sixpence and that he hardly open he purse all the time he be in germany ' ` if my brother want the company of a friend who be much poorer than himself he must pay for it ' argue lesbium ' i think maulevrier be lucky to have such a companion as mr hammond ' yet even while she so argue lady lesbium feel in some manner humiliate by the idea that this man who so palpably worship she be too poor to pay he own travel expense poet and philosopher may say what they will about the grandeur of plain living and high thinking but a young woman think better of the plain liver who be not compel to plainness by want of cash the idea of narrow means of dependence upon the capricious generosity of a wealthy friend be not without its humiliating influence lesbium be barely civil to mr hammond that evening when he praise she singing and she refuse to join in a four game propose by maulevrier albeit she and mr hammond have beat mary and maulevrier the evening before with much exultant hilarity hammond have be at fellside nearly a month and maulevrier be begin to talk about a move further northward there be a grouse moor in argyleshire which the two young man talk about as belong to some unnamed friend of the earl 's which they have think of shooting over before the grouse season be end ` lord hartfield have property in argyleshire ' say the dowager when they talk of these shooting ` do you know he estate mr hammond ' ` hammond know that there be such a place i daresay ' reply maulevrier reply for he friend ` but you do not know lord hartfield perhaps ' say she ladyship not arrogantly but still in a tone which imply she conviction that john hammond would not be hand-in-glove with earl in scotland or elsewhere ` oh yes i know he by sight every one in argyleshire know he by sight ' ` naturally a young man in he position must be widely know be he popular ' ` fairly so ' ` he father and i be friend many year ago ' say lady maulevrier with a faint sigh ` have you ever hear if he resemble he father ' ' i believe not i be tell he be like he mother 's family ' ` then he ought to be handsome lady florence ilmington be a famous beauty ' they be sit in the drawing-room after dinner the room dimly light by darkly-shaded lamp the window wide open to the summer sky and moonlit lake in that subdue light lady maulevrier look a woman in the prime of life the classical modelling of she feature and the delicacy of she complexion be unimpaired by time while those trace of thought and care which give age to she face in the broad light of day be invisible at night john hammond contemplate that refine and placid countenance with profound admiration he remember how she ladyship 's grandson have compare she with the sphinx and it seem to he to-night as be study she proud and tranquil beauty that there be indeed something of the mysterious the unreadable in that countenance and that beneath its heroic calm there might be the ash of tragic passion the trace of a life-long struggle with fate that such a woman so beautiful so gifted so well fitted to shine and govern in the great world should have be content to live a long life of absolute seclusion in this remote valley be in itself a social mystery which must need set a observant young man wonder it be all very well to say that lady maulevrier love a country life that she have make fellside she earthly paradise and have no desire beyond it the fact remain that it be not in lady maulevrier 's temperament to be satisfy with such a existence that falcon eye be never mean to gaze for ever upon one narrow range of mountain and lake that lip be make to speak among the great one of the world lady maulevrier be particularly gracious to she grandson 's friend this evening maulevrier speak so decisively about a speedy migration northward seem so inclined to regret the time waste since the twelfth of the month that she think the danger be past and she could afford to be civil she really like the young man have no doubt in she own mind that he be a gentleman in the highest and broadest sense of the word but not in the sense which make he a eligible husband for either of she granddaughter lesbium be in a pensive mood this evening she sit in the verandah look dreamily at the lake and at fairfield yonder a broad green slope silver with moonlight and seem to stretch far away into unfathomable distance if one could but take one 's lover by the hand and go wander over those mystic moonlit slope into some new unreal world where it would not matter whether a man be rich or poor high-born or low-born where there should be no such thing as rank and state to be win or lose lesbium feel to-night as if she would like to live out she life in dreamland reality be too hard too much set round by difficulty and sacrifice while lesbium be lose herself in that dream-world lady maulevrier unbent considerably to john hammond and talk to he with more appearance of interest in he actual self and in he own affair than she have manifest hitherto although she have be uniformly courteous she ask he he plan for the future -- have he choose a profession he tell she that he have not he mean to devote himself to literature and politics ` be not that rather vague ' inquire she ladyship ` everything be vague at first ' ` but literature now -- as a amusement no doubt it be delightful -- but as a profession -- do literature ever pay ' ` there have be such case ' ` yes i suppose so walter scott gibbon macaulay froude those make money no doubt but there be a suspicion of hopelessness in the idea of a young man start in life intend to earn he bread by literature one remember chatterton i should have think that in you case the law or the church would have be better in the latter maulevrier might have be useful to you he be patron of three or four living ' ` you be too good even to think of such a thing ' say hammond ` but i have set my heart upon a political career i must swim or sink in that sea ' lady maulevrier look at he with a compassionate smile poor young man no doubt he think himself a genius and that door which have remain shut to everybody else would turn on they hinge directly he knock at they she be sincerely sorry for he young clever enthusiastic and doom to bitterest disappointment ` you have parent perhaps who be ambitious for you -- a mother who think she son a heaven-born statesman ' say she ladyship kindly ` alas no that incentive to ambition be want in my case i have neither father nor mother living ' ` that be very sad no doubt that fact have be a bond of sympathy between you and maulevrier ' ' i believe it have ' ` well i hope providence will smile upon you path ' ` come what may i shall never forget the happy week i have spend at fellside ' say hammond ` or you ladyship 's gracious hospitality ' he take up the beautiful hand white to transparency show the delicate trace of blue vein and press he lip upon it in chivalrous worship of age and womanly dignity lady maulevrier smile upon he with she calm grave smile she would have like to say ` you shall be welcome again at fellside ' but she feel that the man be dangerous not while lesbium remain single could she court he company if maulevrier bring he she must tolerate he presence but she would do nothing to invite that danger there be no music that evening maulevrier and mary be play billiards fräulein müller be sit in she corner work at a high-art counterpane lesbium come in from the verandah presently and sit on a low stool by she grandmother 's arm-chair and talk to she in soft coo accent inaudible to john hammond who sit a little way off turn the leaf of the _ contemporary review _ : and this go on till eleven o'clock the regular hour for retire when mary come in from the billiard-room and tell mr hammond that maulevrier be wait for a smoke and a talk then candle be light and the lady all depart leave john hammond and he friend with the house to themselves they play a fifty game and smoked and talk till the stroke of midnight by which time it seem as if there be not another creature awake in the house maulevrier put out the lamp in the billiard-room and then they go softly up the shadowy staircase and part in the gallery the earl go one way and he friend the other the house be large and roomy spread over a good deal of ground lady maulevrier have insist upon there be only two story the servant ' room be all in a side wing correspond with those older building which have be give over to steadman and he wife and among the villager of grasmere enjoy the reputation of be haunt a wide panelled corridor extend from one end of the house to the other it be light from the roof and serve as a gallery for the display of a small and choice collection of modern art which she ladyship have acquire during she long residence at fellside here too in sheraton cabinet be those treasure of old english china which lady maulevrier have inherit from past generation she ladyship 's room be situate at the southern end of this corridor she bed-chamber be at the extreme end of the house with window command two magnificent view one across the lake and the village of grasmere to the green slope of fairfield the other along the valley towards rydal water this and the adjoining boudoir be the prettiest room in the house and no one wonder that she ladyship should spend so much of she life in the luxurious seclusion of she own apartment john hammond go to he room which be on the same side of the house as she ladyship 's but he be in no disposition for sleep he open the casement and stand look out upon the moonlit lake and the quiet village where one solitary light shone like a faint star in a cottage window amidst that little cluster of house by the old church once know as kirktown beyond the village rise gentle slope crown with foliage and above those wooded crest appear the grand outline of the hill surround and guard easedale 's lovely valley as the hill surround jerusalem of old he look at that delicious landscape with eye that hardly see its beauty the image of a lovely face come between he and all the glory of earth and sky ' i think she like I ' he be say to himself ` there be a look in she eye to-night that tell I the time be come when -- ' the thought die unfinished in he brain through the silent house across the placid lake there ring a wild shrill cry that freeze the blood in he vein or seem so to freeze it -- a shriek of agony and in a woman 's voice it ring out from a open window near he own the sound seem close to he ear chapter x ' o bitterness of thing too sweet ' only for a instant do john hammond stand motionless after hear that unearthly shriek in the next moment he rush into the corridor expect to hear the sound repeat to find himself face to face with some midnight robber whose presence have cause that wild cry of alarm but in the corridor all be silent as the grave no open door suggest the entrance of a intruder the dimly-burning lamp show only the long empty gallery he stand still for a few moment listen for voice footstep the rustle of garment : but there be nothing nothing yes a groan a long-drawn moan sound as of infinite pain this time there be no doubt as to the direction from which the sound come it come from lady maulevrier 's room the door be ajar and he could see the faint light of the night-lamp within that fearful cry have come from she ladyship 's room she be in peril or pain of some kind convince of this one fact mr hammond have not a instant 's hesitation he push open the door without compunction and enter the room prepare to behold some terrible scene but all be quiet as death itself no midnight burglar have violate the sanctity of lady maulevrier 's apartment the soft steady light of the night-lamp shone on the face of the sleeper yes all be quiet in the room but not in that sleeper 's soul the broad white brow be painfully contract the lip draw down and distort the delicate hand half hide by the deep valencienne ruffle clutch the coverlet with convulsive force sigh after sigh burst from the agitate breast john hammond gaze upon the sleeper in a agony of apprehension uncertain what to do be this dream only or be it some kind of seizure which call for medical aid at she ladyship 's age the idea of paralysis be not too improbable for belief if this be a dream then indeed the vision of lady maulevrier 's head upon she bed be more terrible than the dream of common mortal in any case mr hammond feel that it be he duty to send some attendant to lady maulevrier some member of the household who be familiar with she ladyship 's habit she own maid if that person could be unearth easily he know that the servant sleep in a separate wing but he think it more than likely that she ladyship 's personal attendant occupy a room near she mistress he go back to the corridor and look round he in doubt for a moment or two close against she ladyship 's door there be a swing door cover with red cloth which seem to communicate with the old part of the house john hammond push this door and it yield to he hand reveal a lamp-lit passage narrow old-fashioned and low he think it likely that lady maulevrier 's maid might occupy a room in this half-deserted wing as he push open the door he see a elderly man come towards he with a candle in he hand and with the appearance of have huddle on he clothes hastily ` you hear that scream ' say hammond ` yes it be she ladyship i suppose nightmare she be subject to nightmare ' ` it be very dreadful she whole countenance be convulse just now when i go into she room to see what be wrong i be almost afraid of a fit of some kind ought not she maid to go to she ' ` she want no assistance ' the man answer coolly ` it be only a dream it be not the first time i have be awaken by a shriek like that it be a kind of nightmare no doubt and it pass off in a few minute and leave she sleeping calmly ' he go to she ladyship 's door push it open a little way and look in ` yes she be sleep as quietly as a infant ' he say shut the door softly as he speak ' i be very glad but surely she ought to have she maid near she at night if she be subject to those attack ' ` it be no attack i tell you it be nothing but a dream ' answer steadman impatiently ` yet you be frightened just as i be or you would not have get up and dress ' say hammond look at the man suspiciously he have hear of this old servant steadman who be suppose to enjoy more of she ladyship 's confidence than any one else in the household but he have never speak to the man before that night ` yes i come it be my duty to come know she ladyship 's habit i be a light sleeper and that scream wake I instantly if she ladyship 's maid be wanted i should call she i be a kind of watch-dog you see sir ' ` you seem to be a very faithful dog ' ' i have be in she ladyship 's service more than forty year i have reason to be faithful i know she ladyship 's habit better than any one in the house i know that she have a great deal of trouble in she early life and i believe the memory of it come back upon she sometimes in she dream and get the better of she ' ` if it be memory that wring that agonised shriek from she just now she recollection of the past must be very terrible ' ` ah sir there be a skeleton in every house ' answer jame steadman gravely this be exactly what maulevrier have say under the yew tree which wordsworth plant ` good-night sir ' say steadman ` good-night you be sure that lady maulevrier may be leave safely -- that there be no fear of illness of any kind ' ` no sir it be only a bad dream good-night sir ' steadman go back to he own quarter mr hammond hear he draw the bolt of the swing door thus cut off all communication with the corridor the eight-day clock on the staircase strike two as mr hammond return to he room even less inclined for sleep than when he leave it strange that nocturnal disturbance of a mind which seem so tranquil in the day or be that tranquillity only a mask which she ladyship wear before the world : and be the bitter memory of event which happen forty year ago still a source of anguish to that highly strung nature ` there be some mind which can not forget ' john hammond say to himself as he meditate upon she ladyship 's character and history ` the story of she husband 's crime may still be fresh in she memory though it be only a tradition for the outside world he crime may have involve some deep wrong do to herself some outrage against she love and faith as a wife one of the story maulevrier speak of the other day be of a wicked woman 's influence upon the governor -- a much more likely story than that of any traffic in british interest or british honor which would have be almost impossible for a man in lord maulevrier 's position if the scandal be of a darker kind -- a guilty wife -- the mysterious disappearance of a husband -- the horror of the thing may have make a deeper impression on lady maulevrier than even she nearest and dearest dream of : and that superb calm which she wear like a royal mantle may be maintain at the cost of struggle which tear she heart-string and then at night when the will be dormant when the nervous system be no longer rule by the power of wake intelligence the old familiar agony return the hate image flash back upon the brain and in proportion to the fineness of the temperament be the intensity of the dreamer 's pain ' and then he go on to reflect upon the long monotonous year spend in that lonely house shut in from the world by those everlasting hill albeit the house be a ideal house set in a landscape of infinite beauty the monotony must be none the less oppressive for a mind burden with dark memory weigh down by sorrow which could seek no relief from sympathy which could never become familiarise by discussion ' i wonder that a woman of lady maulevrier 's intellect should not have better know how to treat she own malady ' think hammond mr hammond inquire after she ladyship 's health next morning and be tell she be perfectly well ` grandmother be in capital spirit ' say lady lesbium ` she be please with the contents of yesterday 's _ globe _ lord denyer the son of one of she oldest friend have be make a great speech at liverpool in the conservative interest and she ladyship think we shall have a change of party before long ' ' a general shuffle of the card ' say maulevrier look up from he breakfast ` i be sure i hope so i be no politician but i like a row ' ' i hope you be a conservative mr hammond ' say lesbium ' i have hope you would have know that ever so long ago lady lesbium ' lesbium blush at he tone which be almost a reproach ' i suppose i ought to have understand from the general tenor of you conversation ' she say ` but i be terribly stupid about politics i take so little interest in they i be always hear that we be be badly govern -- that the man who legislate for we be stupid or wicked yet the world seem to go on somehow and we be no worse ' ` it be just the same with sport ' say maulevrier ` every rainy spring we be tell that all the young bird have be drown or that the grouse-disease have decimate the father and mother and that we shall have nothing to shoot but when August come the bird be there all the same ' ` it be the nature of mankind to complain ' say hammond ` cain and abel be the first farmer and you see one of they grumble ' they be rather lively at breakfast that morning -- maulevrier 's last breakfast but one -- for he have announce he determination of go to scotland next day other fellow would shoot all the bird if he dawdle any longer mary be in deep despondency at the idea of he departure yet she laugh and talk with the rest and perhaps lesbium feel a little move at the thought of lose mr hammond maulevrier would come back to mary but john hammond be hardly likely to return they parting would be for ever ` you need not sit quite in my pocket molly ' say maulevrier to he younger sister ' i like to make the most of you now you be go away ' sigh mary ` oh dear how dull we shall all be when you be go ' ` not a bit of it you will have some fox-hunting perhaps before the snow be on the hill ' at the very mention of fox-hounds lady mary 's bright young face crimsoned and maulevrier begin to laugh in a provoke way with side-long glance at he younger sister ` do you ever hear of molly 's fox-hunting by-the-by hammond ' he ask mary try to put she hand before he lip but it be useless ` why should not i tell ' he exclaim ` it be quite a heroic adventure you must know we fox-hunting here be rather a peculiar institution -- very good in its way but strictly local no horse could live among we hill so we hunt on foot and as the pace be good and the work hard nobody who start with the hound be likely to be in at the death except the huntsman we be all mad for the sport and off we go over the hill and far away pick up a fresh field as we go the ploughman leave he plough and the shepherd leave he flock and the farmer leave he thrashing to follow we in every field we cross we get fresh blood while those who join we at the start fall off by degree well it happen one day late in October when there be long ridge of snow on helvellyn and patch of white on fairfield mistress mary here must need take she bamboo staff and start for the stride edge it be just the day upon which she might have meet she death easily on that perilous point but happily something occur to divert she juvenile fancy for scarcely have she get to the bottom of dolly waggon pike -- you know dolly -- ' ` intimately ' say hammond with a nod ` scarcely have she near the base of dolly waggon when she hear the huntsman 's horn and the hound at full cry streaming along towards dunmail raise off fly molly all among the butcher boy and farmer ' man and rosy-cheeked squireen of the district -- race over the rugged field -- clamber over the low stone wall -- up hill down hill -- shout when the other shout -- never lose sight of the wave stern -- wind and double and still go upward and upward till she stand panting and puff like a young grampus on the top of seat sandal still all among the butcher boy and the farmer 's man and the guide and the red-cheeked squireen she frock tear to ribbon she hat lose in a ditch she hair streaming down she back and every inch of she from she nose downward splash and spatter with mire and clay what a spectacle for god and man guide and butcher boy and there she stand with the sun go down beyond coniston old man and a seven-mile walk between she and fellside ` poor lady mary ' say hammond look at she very kindly : but mary do not see that friendly glance which betoken sympathy rather than scorn she sit silent and very red with droop eyelid think she brother horribly cruel for thus publish she foolishness ` poor indeed ' exclaim maulevrier ` she come crawl home after dark footsore and draggle look like a beggar girl and as evil fate would have it she ladyship who so seldom go out must need have be take afternoon tea at the vicarage upon that particular occasion and be drive up the avenue as mary crawl to the gate the storm that follow may be more easily imagine than describe ' ` it be year and year ago ' expostulate mary look very angry ` grandmother need not have make such a fuss about it ' ` ah but in those day she still have hope of civilise you ' answer maulevrier ` since then she have abandon all endeavor in that direction and have give you over to you own device -- and I since then you have become a chartered libertine you have letter of mark ' ' i do not care what you call I ' say mary ' i only know that i be very happy when you be at home and very miserable when you be away ' ` it be hardly kind of you to say that lady mary ' remonstrate fräulein müller who up to this point have be busily engage with muffin and gooseberry jam ` oh i do not mean that any one be unkind to I or use I badly ' say mary ' i only mean that my life be empty when maulevrier be away and that i be always longing for he to come back again ' ' i think you adore the hill and the lake and the villager and you pony and maulevrier 's dog ' say lesbium faintly contemptuous ` yes but one want something human to love ' answer mary make it very obvious that there be no warmth of affection between herself and the feminine member of she family she have not think of the significance of she speech she be very angry with maulevrier for have hold she up to ridicule before mr hammond who already despise she as she believe and whose contempt be more galling than it need have be consider that he be a mere casual visitor who would go away and return no more never till he come have she feel she deficiency but in he presence she writhe under the sense of she unworthiness and have a almost agonising consciousness of all those fault which she grandmother have tell she about so often with not the slightest effect in those day she have not care what lady maulevrier or any one else might say of she or think of she she live she life and defy fortune she be worse than she reputation to-day she feel it a bitter thing that she have grow to the age of womanhood lack all those grace and accomplishment which make she sister adorable and which might make even a plain woman charming never till john hammond 's come have she feel a pang of envy in the contemplation of lesbium 's beauty or lesbium 's grace but now she have so keen a sense of the difference between herself and she sister that she begin to fear that this cruel pain must indeed be that lowest of all vice even the difference in they gown be a source of humiliation to she how lesbium be look she loveliest this morning in a gown that be all lace and soft madra muslin flow cloud-like while mary 's tailor gown with its trim tight bodice horn button and kilted skirt seem to cry aloud that it have be make for a tomboy and this tailor gown be a costume to which mary have condemn herself by she own folly only a year ago move by a artistic admiration for lesbium 's delicate breakfast gown mary have tell she grandmother that she would like to have something of the same kind whereupon the dowager who do not take the faintest interest in mary 's toilet but who have a stern sense of justice reply -- ' i do not think lesbium 's frock and you habit will agree but you can have some pretty morning gown if you like ' and the order have be give for a confection in muslin and lace for lady mary mary come down to breakfast one bright June morning in the new frock feeling very proud of herself and look very pretty ` fine feather make fine bird ' say fräulein müller ' i should hardly have know you ' ' i wish you would always dress like that ' say lesbia ` you really look like a young lady ' and mary dance about on the lawn feeling sylph-like and quite in love with she own elegance when a sudden uplifting of canine voice in the distance have send she fly to see what be the matter with the terrier pack in the kennel there be riot and confusion ahab be demolish angelina absalom have agamemnon in a deadly grip dog-whip in hand mary rush to the rescue and lay about she like the knight of old utterly forgetful of she frock she soon succeed in restore order but the madras muslin the breton lace have perish in the conflict she leave the kennel panting and in rag and tatters some of the muslin and lace hang about she in strip a yard long but the greater part remain in the possession of the terrier who have maul and munch she finery to they heart ' content while she be read the riot act she go back to the house bow down by shame and confusion and march straight to the dowager 's morning-room ` look what the terrier have do to I grandmother ' she say with a sob ` it be all my own fault of course i ought not to have go near they in that stupid muslin please forgive I for be so foolish i be not fit to have pretty frock ' ' i think my dear you can now have no doubt that the tailor gown be fittest for you ' answer lady maulevrier with crush placidity ` we have try the experiment of dress you like lesbium and you see it do not answer tell kibble to throw you new gown in the rag-bag and please let I hear no more about it ' after this dismal failure mary could not feel herself ill-used in have to wear tailor gown all the year round she be allow cotton frock for very warm weather and she have pretty gown for evening wear but she usual attire be cloth or linsey woolsey make by the local tailor sometimes maulevrier order she a gown or a coat from he own man in conduit street and then she feel herself smart and fashionable and even the local tailor contrived to make she gown prettily have a great appreciation of she straight willowy figure and deem it a privilege to work for she so that hitherto mary have feel very well content with she cloth and linsey but now that john hammond so obviously admire lesbium 's delicate raiment poor mary begin to think she woollen gown odious after breakfast mary and maulevrier go straight off to the kennel he lordship have numerous instruction to give on this last day and he lieutenant have to receive and register he order lesbium go to the garden with she book and with fräulein -- the inevitable fräulein as hammond think she -- in close attendance it be a lovely morning sultry summer-like albeit September have just begin the tennis lawn which have be level on one side of the house be surround on three side by shrubbery plant forty year ago in the beginning of lady maulevrier 's widowhood all loveliest tree grow there in perfection sheltered by the mighty wall of the mountain feed by the mist from the lake larch and mountain ash and lawsonian cyprus -- deodara and magnolia arbutus and silver broom acacia and lilac flourish here in that rich beauty which make every cottage garden in the happy district a little paradise and here in a semi-circular recess at one end of the lawn be rustic chair and table and a umbrella tent this be lady lesbium 's choose retreat on summer morning and a favorite place for afternoon tea mr hammond follow the two lady to they bower ` this be to be my last morning ' he say look at lesbium ` will you think I a great bear if i spend it with you ' ` we shall think it very nice of you ' answer lesbium without a vestige of emotion ` especially if you will read to we ' ' i will do any thing to make myself useful what shall i read ' ` anything you like what do you say to tennyson ' ` that he be a noble poet a teacher of all good but too philosophical for my present mood may i read you some of heine 's ballad those song which you sing so exquisitely or rather some you do not sing and which will be fresher to you my german be far from perfect but i be tell it be passable and fräulein müller can throw she scissors at I when my accent be too dreadful ' ` you speak german beautifully ' say fräulein ' i wonder where you learn it ' ' i have be a good deal in germany and i have a hanoverian valet who be quite a gentleman and speak admirably i think i learn more from he than from grammar or dictionary i 'll go and fetch heine ' ` what a very agreeable person mr hammond be ' say fräulein when he be go ` we shall quite miss he ' ` yes i have no doubt we shall miss he ' say lesbium again without the faintest emotion the governess begin to think that the ordeal of a agreeable young man 's presence at fellside have be pass in safety and that she pupil be unscathed she have keep a close watch on the two as in duty bind she know that hammond be in love with lesbium but she think lesbium be heart-whole mr hammond come back with a shabby little book in he hand and establish himself comfortably in one of the two beaconsfield chair he open he book at that group of short poem call heimkehr and read here and there as fancy lead he sometimes the strain be a love-song brief passionate as the cry of a soul in pain sometimes the verse be bitter and cynical sometimes full of tenderest simplicity tell of childhood and youth and purity sometimes dark with hidden meaning grim awful cold with the chill breath of the charnel-house sometimes lesbium 's heart beat a little faster as mr hammond read for it seem as if it be he who be speak to she and not the dead poet a hour or more pass in this way fräulein müller be charm at hear some of she favorite poem ask now for this little bit and anon for another and expatiate upon the merit of german poet in general and heine in particular in the pause of the lecture she be quite carry away by she delight in the poet and be so entirely uplift to the ideal world that when a footman come with a message from lady maulevrier request she presence she trip gaily off at once without a thought of danger in leave those two together on the lawn she have be a faithful watch-dog up to this point but she be now lull into a false sense of security by the idea that the time of peril be all but end so she leave they but could she have look hack two minute afterwards she would have perceive the unwisdom of that act no sooner have the fräulein turn the corner of the shrubbery than hammond lay aside he book and draw nearer lesbium who sit look downward with she eye upon the delicate piece of fancy work which have occupy she finger all the morning ` lesbium this be my last day at fellside and you and i may never have a minute alone together again while i be here will you come for a little walk with I on the fell there be something i must say to you before i go ' lesbium 's delicate cheek grow a shade more pale instinct tell she what be come though never mortal man have speak to she of love nor until now have mr hammond ever address she by she christian name without the ceremonious prefix there be a deeper tone in he voice a graver look in he eye than she have ever notice before she rise and take up she sunshade and go with he meekly through the cultivate shrubbery of ornamental timber to the rougher pathway that wind through a copse of scotch fir which form the outer boundary of lady maulevrier 's domain beyond the fir tree rise the grassy slope of the hill on the brow of which sheep be feed deep down in the hollow below the lawn and shrubberry of fellside the placid bosom of the lake shone like a emerald floor in the sunlight reflect the verdure of the hill and the white sheep dot about here and there there be not a breath in the air around they as those two saunter slowly side by side in the pine wood not a cloud in the dazzling blue sky above and for a little time they too be silent as if bind by a spell which neither dare to break then at last hammond speak ` lesbia you know that i love you ' he begin in he low grave voice tremulous with feeling ` no word i can say to-day can tell you of my love more plainly than my heart have be tell you in every hour of this happy happy time that you and i have spend together i love you as i never hope to love fervently completely believe that the perfection of earthly bliss will be mine if i can but win you dearest be there such a sweet hope for I be you indeed my own as i be yours heart and soul and mind and be till the last throb of life in this poor clay ' he try to take she hand but she draw herself away from he with a frightened look she be very pale and there be infinite distress in the dark violet eye which look entreatingly deprecatingly at she lover ' i dare not answer as you would like I to answer ' she falter after a painful pause ' i be not my own mistress my grandmother have bring I up devoted herself to I almost and she have she own view she own plan i dare not frustrate they ' ` she would like to marry you to a man of rank and fortune -- a man who will choose you perhaps because other people admire you rather than because he himself love you as you ought to be love who will choose you because you be altogether the best and most perfect thing of you year just as he would buy a yearling at newmarket or doncaster she ladyship mean you to make a great alliance -- coronet not heart be the counter for she game but lesbium would you in the bloom and freshness of youth -- you with the pulse of youth throb at you heart -- lend yourself to the calculation of age which have live its life and forget the very meaning of love would you submit to be play as a card in the game of a dowager 's ambition trust I dearest in the crisis of a woman 's life there be one only counsellor she should listen to and that counsellor be she own heart if you love I -- as i dare to hope you do -- trust in I hold by I and leave the rest to heaven i know that i can make you life happy ' ` you frighten I by you impetuosity ' say lesbia ` surely you forget how short a time we have know each other ' ` a age all my life before the day i see you be a dead dull blank as compare with the magical hour i have spend with you ' ' i do not even know who and what you be ' ` first i be a gentleman or i should not be you brother 's friend a poor gentleman if you like with only my own right arm to hew my pathway through the wood of life to the temple

he look like a demi-god tall straight as the pine trunk amongst which he be stand a frame form for strength and activity a face instinct with mental power dark eye that glow with the fire of intellect and passion the sunlight give a almost unearthly radiance to the clear dark of he complexion the curly brown hair cut close to the finely shaped head the broad brow and boldly model feature lesbia feel in she heart that such a man must be destine for success bear to be a conqueror in all strife a victor upon every field ` have i the thew and sinew of a man doom to be beat in the battle ' he ask she ` no dearest heaven mean I to succeed and with you to fight for i shall not be beat by adverse fortune can you not trust providence and I ' ' i can not disobey my grandmother if she will consent -- ' ` she will not consent you must defy lady maulevrier lesbium if you mean to reward my love but i will promise you this much darling that if you will be my wife -- with you brother 's consent -- which i be sure of before i ask for it within one year of we marriage i will find means of reconcile she ladyship to the match and win she entire forgiveness for you and I ' ` you be talk of

if i marry a poor man i should be a outcast ' ` we would be outcast together -- happy outcast besides we should not always be poor i tell you i be predestine to conquer fate ' ` but we should have to begin from the begin ' ` yes we should have to begin from the beginning as adam and eve do when they leave paradise ' ` we be not tell in the bible that they have any happiness after that it seem to have be all trouble and weariness and toil and death after the angel with the flaming sword drive they out of eden ' ` they be together and they must have be happy oh lesbia if you do not feel that you can face poverty and the world 's contempt by my side and for my sake you do not love I love never calculate so nicely love never fear the future and yet you do love I lesbium ' he say try to fold she in he arm but again she draw herself away from he -- this time with a look almost of horror -- and stand face he cling to one of the pine trunk like a scared wood-nymph ` you have no right to say that ' she say ' i have the divine right of my own deep love -- of heart which cry out to heart do you think there be no magnetic power in true love which can divine the answering love in another

forgive you and all would be well with we before we have be marry a year why can not you believe I lesbium ' ` because i can not believe impossibility even from you lip ' she answer sullenly she stand before he with downcast eye the tear streaming down she pale cheek exquisitively lovely in she agitation and sorrow yes she do love he she heart be beat passionately she be longing to throw herself on he breast to be fold upon that manly heart in trust in that brave bright look which seem to defy fortune yes he be a man bear to conquer he be handsome intellectual powerful in all mental and physical gift a man of man but he be by he own admission a very obscure and insignificant person and he have no money life with he mean a long fight with adverse circumstance life for he wife must mean patience submission long wait upon destiny and perhaps with old age and gray hair the tardy turning of fortune 's wheel and be she for this to resign the kingdom that have be promise to she the giddy height which she be bear to scale the triumph and delight and victory of the great world yes lesbia love this fortuneless knight but she love herself and she prospects of promotion still better ` oh lesbium can you not be brave for my sake -- trustful for my sake god will be good to we if we be true to each other ' ` god will not be good to I if i disobey my grandmother i owe she too much ingratitude in I would be doubly base i will speak to she i will tell she all you have say and if she give I the faintest encouragement -- ' ` she will not that be a foregone conclusion tell she all

or poor i will share he fate tell she boldly bravely nobly as a true woman should and if she be adamant still proclaim you right to disobey she worldly wisdom rather than the voice of you own heart and then come to I darling and be my own and the world which you and i will face together shall not be a bad world i will answer for that no trouble shall come near you no humiliation shall ever touch you only believe in I ' ' i can believe in you but not in the impossible ' answer lesbium with measure accent the voice be silver-sweet but pass cold just then there be a rustling among the pine branch and lesbium look round with a startled air ` be there any one listen ' she exclaim ` what be that ' ` only the breath of heaven oh lesbia if you be but a little less wise a little more trustful do not be a dumb idol say that you love I or do not love I if you can look I in the face and say the last i will leave you without another word i will take my sentence and go ' but this be just what lesbium could not do she could not deny she love and yet she could not sacrifice all thing for she love she lift the heavy lid which veil those lovely eye and look up at he imploringly ` give I time to breathe time to think ' she say ` and then will you answer I plainly truthfully without a shadow of reserve remember that the fate of two life hang on you word ' ' i will ' ` let it be so then i 'll go for a ramble over the hill and return in time for afternoon tea i shall look for you on the tennis lawn at half-past four ' he take she in he arm and this time she yield herself to he and the beautiful head rest for a few moment upon he breast and the soft eye look up at he in confide fondness he bent and kiss she once only but a kiss that mean for life and death in the next moment he be go leave she alone among the pine tree chapter xi ` if i be to do as iseult do ' lady maulevrier rarely appear at luncheon she take some slight refection in she morning-room among she book and papers and in the society of she canine favorite whose company suit she better at certain hour than the noisier companionship of she grandchild she be a studious woman love the silent life of book better than the inane chatter of everyday humanity she be a woman who think much and read much and who live more in the past than the present she live also in the future counting much upon the splendid career of she beautiful granddaughter which should be in a manner a lengthen out a renewal of she own life she look forward to the day when lesbium should reign supreme in the great world a famous beauty and leader of fashion she every act and word inspire and direct by she grandmother who would be the shadow behind the throne it be possible -- nay probable -- that in those day lady maulevrier would herself re-appear in society establish she salon and draw around she closing year all that be wittiest best and wisest in the great world she ladyship be repose in she low reading-chair with a volume of tyndall on the book-stand before she when the door be open softly and lesbium come glide in and seat herself without a word on the hassock at she grandmother 's foot lady maulevrier pass she hand caressingly over the girl 's soft brown hair without look up from she book ` you be a late visitor ' she say ` why do you not come to I after breakfast ' ` it be such a lovely morning we go straight from the breakfast table to the garden i do not think you want I ' ' i do not want you but i be always glad to see my pet what be you do in the garden all the morning i do not hear you play tennis ' lady maulevrier have already interrogate the german governess upon this very subject but she have she own reason for wish to hear lesbium 's account ` no it be too warm for tennis fräulein and i sit and work and mr hammond read to we ' ` what do he read ' ` heine 's ballad he read german beautifully ` indeed i daresay he be at school in germany there be cheap school there to which middle-class people send they boy ' this be like a thrust from a rusty knife ` mr hammond be at oxford ' lesbium say reproachfully and then after a longish pause she clasp she hand upon the arm of lady maulevrier 's chair and say in a plead voice ` grandmother mr hammond have ask I to marry he ' ` indeed only that and pray do he tell you what be he means of maintain lord maulevrier 's sister in the position to which she birth entitle she ' inquire the dowager with crush calmness ` he be not rich indeed i believe he be poor but he be brave and clever and he be full of confidence in he power to conquer fortune ' ` no doubt that be you true adventurer 's style he confide implicitly in he own talent and in somebody else 's banker mr hammond would make a tremendous figure in the world i daresay and while he be make it you brother would have to keep he well my dear lesbium i hope you give this gentleman the answer he insolence deserve or that you do better and refer he to I i should be glad to give he my opinion of he conduct -- a person admit to this house as you brother 's hanger-on -- tolerate only on you brother 's account such a person nameless penniless friendless -lrb- except for maulevrier 's too facile patronage -rrb- to dare to lift he eye to my granddaughter it be ineffable insolence ' lesbium crouch by she grandmother 's chair she face hide from lady maulevrier 's falcon eye every word utter by she ladyship sting like the knotted cord of a knout she know not whether to be most ashamed of she lover or of herself -- of she lover for he obscure position he hopeless poverty of herself for she folly in loving such a man and she do love he and would fain have plead he cause have she not be cow by the authority that have rule she all she life ` lesbia if i think you have be silly enough degrade enough to give this young man encouragement to have justify he audacity of to-day by any act or word of yours i should despise i should detest you ' say lady maulevrier sternly ` what could be more contemptible more hateful in a girl rear as you have be than to give encouragement to the first comer -- to listen greedily to the first adventurer who have the insolence to make love to you to be eager to throw yourself into the arm of the first man who ask you that my granddaughter a girl rear and teach and watch and guard by I should have no more dignity no more modesty or womanly feeling than a barmaid at a inn ' lesbium begin to cry ' i do not see why a barmaid should not be a good woman or why it should be a crime to fall in love ' she say in a voice break by sob ` you need not speak to I so unkindly i be not go to marry mr hammond ' ` oh you be not that be very good of you i be deeply grateful for such a assurance ' ` but i like he better than anyone i ever see in my life before ' ` you have see to many people you have have such a wide area for choice ' ` no i know i have be keep like a nun in a convent : but i do not think when i go

child look I in the face and listen to I for i be go to speak seriously and with I when i be in earnest what be say once be say for ever ' lady maulevrier grasp she granddaughter 's arm with long slender finger which hold it as tightly as the grasp of a vice she draw the girl 's slim figure round till they be face to face look into each other 's eye the dowager 's eagle countenance light up with impassioned feeling severe awful as the face of one of the fatal sister the avenger of blood the harbinger of doom ` lesbia i think i have be good to you and kind to you ' she say ` you have be all that be kind and dear ' falter lesbia ` then give I measure for measure my life have be a hard one child hard and lonely and loveless and joyless my son to whom i devoted myself in the vigor of

maulevrier and i get on very well together but ours be no love-match ' ` do nobody in we rank ever marry for love be all marriage a mere exchange and barter ' ` no there be love-match now and then

` and if -- instead of waiting-for this king arthur of yours -- i be to do as iseult do -- as guinevere do -- choose for myself -- ' ` iseult and guinevere be wanton i wonder that you can name they in comparison with yourself ' ` if i be to marry a good and honorable man who have he place to make in the world would you never forgive I ' ` you mean mr hammond you may just as well speak plainly ' say lady maulevrier freezingly ` if you be capable of such idiocy as that lesbium i would pluck you out of my heart like a foul weed i would never look upon you or hear you name speak or think of you again as long as i live my life would not last very long after that blow old age can not bear such shock oh lesbia i have be father and mother to you do not bring my gray hair in sorrow to the grave ' lesbium give a deep sigh and brush the tear from she cheek yes the very idea of such a marriage be foolishness just now in the pine wood carry away by the force of she lover 's passion by she own softer feeling it have seem to she as if she could count the world well lose for he sake but now at lady maulevrier 's foot she become again true to she training and the world be too much to lose ` what can i do grandmother ' she ask submissively despairingly ` he love I and i love he how can i tell he that he and i can never be anything to each other in this world ' ` refer he to I i will give he he answer ' ` no no that will not do i have promise to answer he myself he have go for a walk on the hill and will come back at four o'clock for my answer ' ` sit down at that table and write as i dictate ' ` but a letter will be so formal ' ` it be the only way in which you can answer he when he come back from he walk you will have leave fellside i shall send you off to st bee with fräulein you must never look upon that man 's face again ' lesbium brush away a few more tear and obey she have be too well train to attempt resistance defiance be out of the question chapter xii ` the greater cantle of the world be lose ' the sky be still cloudless when john hammond stroll slowly up the leafy avenue at fellside he have be across the valley and up the hill to easedale tarn and then by rough untrodden way across a chaos of rock and heather into a second valley long narrow and sterile know as far easedale a desolate gorge a rugged cleft in the heart of the mountain the walk have be long and laborious but only in such clambering and toiling such expenditure of muscular force and latent heat could the man 's restless soul endure those long hour of suspense ` how will she answer I oh my god how will she answer ' he say within himself as he walk up the romantic wind road which make so picturesque a approach to lady maulevrier 's domain ` be my idol gold or clay how will she come through the crucible oh dearest sweetest loveliest only be true to the instinct of you womanhood and my cup will be full of bliss and all my day will flow as sweetly as the burden of a song but if you prove heartless if you love the world 's wealth better than you love I -- ah then all be over and you and i be lose to each other for ever i have make up my mind ' he face settle into a expression of indomitable determination as of a man who would die rather than be false to he own purpose there be no glow of hope in he heart he have no deep faith in the girl he love indeed in he heart of heart he know that this be to whom he have trust he hope of bliss be no heroine she be a lovely loveable girl nothing more how would she greet he when they meet presently on the tennis lawn with tear and entreaty and pretty little deprecating speech irresolution timidity vacillation perhaps hardly with heroic resolve to act and dare for he sake there be no one on the tennis lawn when he go there though the hour be close at hand at which lesbium have promise to give he he answer he sit down in one of the low chair glad to rest after he long ramble have have no refreshment but a bottle of soda-water and a biscuit at the cottage by easedale tarn he wait calmly as to outward seeming but with a heavy heart ` if it be mary now whom i love i should have little fear of the issue ' he think weigh he sweetheart 's character as he weigh he chance of success ` that young termagant would defy the world for she lover ' he sit in the summer silence for nearly half-an-hour and still there be no sign of lady lesbia she satin-lined workbasket with the work throw carelessly across it be still on the rustic table just as she have leave it when they go to the pine wood waiting be weary work when the bliss of a lifetime tremble in the balance and yet he do not want to be impatient she might find it difficult to get away from she family perhaps she be closely watch and guard as the most precious thing at fellside at last the clock strike five and hammond could endure delay no longer he go round by the flower garden to the terrace before the drawing-room window and through a open window to the drawing-room lady maulevrier be in she accustomed seat with she own particular little table magazine book newspaper at she side lady mary be pour out the tea a most unusual thing and maulevrier be sit on a stool at she foot with he knee up to he chin very warm and dusty eating pound cake ` where the mischief have you be hide yourself all day jack ' he call out as hammond appear look round the room as he enter with eager interrogate eye for that one figure which be absent ' i have be for a walk ' ` you might have have the civility to announce you design and molly and i would have share you peregrination ' ' i be sorry that i lose the privilege of you company ' ' i suppose you lose you luncheon which be of more importance ' say maulevrier ` will you have some tea ' ask mary who look more womanly than usual in a cream-coloured surah gown -- one of she Sunday gown she have a faint hope that by this essentially feminine apparel she might lessen the prejudicial effect of maulevrier 's cruel story about the fox-hunt mr hammond answer absently hardly look at mary and quite unconscious of she pretty gown ` thanks yes ' he say take the cup and saucer and look at the door by which he momently expect lady lesbium 's entrance and then as the door do not open he look down at mary very busy with china teapot and a brass kettle which hiss and throb over a spirit lamp ` will not you have some cake ' she ask look up at he gently grieve at the distress and disappointment in he face ' i be sure you must be dreadfully hungry ' ` not in the least thanks how come you to be entrust with those sacred vessel lady mary what have become of fräulein and you sister ' ` they have rush off to st bee grandmother think lesbium look pale and out of spirit and pack she off to the seaside at a minute 's notice ' ` what she have leave fellside ' ask hammond paling suddenly as if a man have strike he ` lady maulevrier do i understand that lady lesbium have go away ' he ask the question in a authoritative tone with the air of a man who have a right to be answer the dowager wonder at he surpassing insolence ` my granddaughter have go to the seaside with she governess ' she say haughtily ` at a minute 's notice ' ` at a minute 's notice i be not in the habit of hesitate about any step which i consider necessary for my grandchild 's welfare ' she look he full in the face with those falcon eye of hers and he give she back a look as resolute and every whit as full of courage and of pride ` well ' he say after a very perceptible pause ` no doubt you ladyship have do wisely and i must submit to you jurisdiction but i have ask lady lesbium a question and i have be promise a answer ' ` you question have be answer by lady lesbium she leave a note for you ' reply lady maulevrier ` thanks ' answer mr hammond briefly and he hurry from the room without another word the letter be on the table in he bedroom he have little hope of any good wait for he in a letter so write the dowager and the world have triumph over a girl 's dawn love no doubt this be lesbium 's letter : ` dear mr hammond -- lady maulevrier desire I to say that the proposal which you honor I by make this morning be one which i can not possibly accept and that any idea of a engagement between you and I could result only in misery and humiliation to both she think it best under these

in the balance and find you want would to god it have be otherwise if you have be brave and bold for love 's sake where be that pure and perfect chrysolite for which i would have barter you ' he fling himself into a chair and sit with he head bow upon he fold arm and he eye not innocent of tear what would he not have give to find truth and courage and scorn of the world 's wealth in that heart which he have try to win do he think she altogether heartless because she so glibly renounce he no he be too just for that he call she only half-hearted she be like the cat in the adage ` let i dare not wait upon i would ' but he tell himself with one deep sigh of resignation that she be lose to he for ever ' i have try she and find she not worth the win ' he say the house even the lovely landscape smile under he window the pastoral valley smooth lake and willowy island seem hateful to he he feel himself hem round by those green hill by yonder brown and rugged wall of nabb scar stifle

believe the fairy help the housewife at she spinning-wheel those October evening be very long and weary for lesbium and she sister lady maulevrier read and muse in she low chair beside the fire with she book pile upon she own particular table and light by she own particular lamp she talk very little but she be always gracious to she granddaughter and they governess and she like they to be with

interval and when every sound of the light wood-ash drop on the tiled hearth be distinctly audible this state of thing go on for about three week after lesbium 's return from st bee lady maulevrier watchful of she granddaughter all the time though say nothing she see that lesbium be not happy not as she have be in the time before the come of john hammond she have never be particularly gay or light-hearted never gifted with the wild spirit and buoyancy which make girlhood so lovely a season to some nature a time of dance and song and joyousness a morning of life steep in the beauty and gladness of the universe she have never be gay as young lamb and foal and fawn and kitten and puppy dog be gay by reason of the well-spring of delight within they need no stimulus from the outside world she have be just a little inclined to murmur at the dulness of she life at fellside yet she have bear herself with a placid sweetness which have be lady maulevrier 's delight but now there be a marked change in she manner she be not the less submissive and dutiful in she bearing to she grandmother whom she both loved and fear but there be moment of fretfulness and impatience which she could not conceal she be captious and sullen in she manner to mary and the fräulein she would not walk or drive with they or share in any of they amusement sometimes of a evening that studious silence of the drawing-room be suddenly break by lesbium 's weary sigh breathe unawares as she bent over she work lady maulevrier see too that lesbium 's cheek be paler than of old she eye less bright there be a heavy look that tell of broken slumber there be a pinched look in that oval check good heaven if she beauty be to pale and wane before society have bow down and worship it if this fair flower be to fade untimely if this prize rise in the garden of beauty be to wither and decay before it win the prize she ladyship be a woman of action and no sooner do this fear shape itself in she mind than she take step to prevent the evil she thought foreshadow among those friend of she youth and ally of she house with whom she have always maintain a affectionate correspondence be lady kirkbank the fashionable wife of a sport baronet owner of a castle in scotland a place in yorkshire a villa at canne and a fine house in arlington street with a income large enough for they enjoyment when lady

snob when i marry i shall marry a gentleman ' ` when ' echo the parent with a sneering laugh ` have not you better say if ' at this period georgina 's wane good look be in some measure counterbalance by the cumulative effect of half a dozen season in good society which have give style to she person ease to she manners and sharpness to she tongue nobody in society say sharper or more unpleasant thing than miss lorimer and by virtue of this gift she get invite about a great deal more than she might have do have she be distinguish for sweetness of speech and manner georgie lorimer 's presence at a dinner table give just that pungent flavor which be like the faint suspicion of garlic in a fricassee or of tarragon in a salad now in this very season when colonel lorimer be incline to speak of he daughter as sainte beuve write of musset as a young woman with a very brilliant past a lucky turn of event give georgina a fresh start in life which may be call a new departure lady diana

be steadily maintain and a regular correspondence with lady kirkbank whose pen be as sharp as she tongue be one of the means by which lady maulevrier have keep herself thoroughly post in all those small event unrecorded by newspaper which make up the secret history of society it be of she old friend georgie that she ladyship think in she present anxiety lady kirkbank have more than once suggest that lady maulevrier 's granddaughter should vary the monotony of fellside by a visit to she place near doncaster or she castle north of aberdeen but she ladyship have evade these friendly suggestion be very jealous of any strange influence upon lesbium 's life now however there have come a time when lesbium must have a complete change of scenery and surroundings lest she should pine and dwindle in sullen submission to fate or else defy the world and elope with john hammond now therefore lady maulevrier decide to accept lady kirkbank 's hospitality she tell she friend the whole story with perfect frankness and she letter be immediately answer by a telegram ' i start for scotland to-morrow will break my journey by stay a night at fellside and will take lady lesbium on to kirkbank with I

to-morrow she be prepare for unwillingness resistance even but lesbia receive the news with evident pleasure ' i shall be very glad to go ' she say ` this place be so dull of course i shall be sorry to leave you grandmother and i wish you would go with I but any change will be a relief i think if i have to stay here all the winter count the day and the hour i should go out of my mind ' the tear come into she eye but she wipe they away hurriedly ashamed of she emotion ` my dearest child i be so sorry for you ' murmured lady maulevrier ` but believe I the day will come when you will be very glad that you conquer the first foolish inclination of you girlish heart ' ` yes i daresay when i be eighty ' lesbium answer impatiently she have make up she mind to submit to the inevitable she have love john hammond -- have be as near break she heart for he as it be in she nature to break she heart for anybody but she want to make a great marriage to be renowned and admire she have be rear and train for that and she be not go to belie she training a visitor from the great london world be so rare a event that there be naturally a little excitement in the idea of lady kirkbank 's arrival the handsomest and most spacious of the spare bedroom be prepare for the occasion the housekeeper be tell that the dinner must be perfect there must be nothing old-fashioned or ponderous there must be mind as well as matter in everything rarely do lady maulevrier look at a bill of fare but on this particular morning she go carefully through the menu and correct it with she own hand a pair of post-horse bring lady kirkbank and she maid from windermere station in time for afternoon tea and the friend who have only meet twice within the last forty year embrace each other on the threshold of lady maulevrier 's morning-room ` my dearest di ' cry lady kirkbank ` what a delight to see you again after such age and what a too lovely spot you have choose for you retreat from the world the flesh and the devil if i could be a recluse anywhere it would be amongst just such delicious surroundings ' without twilight shades be gather within there be only the light of a fire and a shaded lamp upon the tea table there be just light enough for the two woman to see each other 's face and the change which time have work there never do womanhood in advanced year offer a more striking contrast than that present by the woman of fashion and the recluse lady maulevrier be almost as handsome in the winter of she day as she have be when life be in its spring the tall slim figure erect as a dart the delicately chisel feature and alabaster complexion the soft silvery hair the perfect hand whiter and more transparent than the hand of girlhood the stately movement and bear all combine to make lady maulevrier a queen among woman she brocade gown of a deep shade of red with a border of dark sable on cuff and collar suggest a portrait by velasquez she wear no ornament except the fine old brazilian diamond which flash and sparkle upon she slender finger if lady maulevrier look like a picture in the escurial lady kirkbank resemble a caricature in _ la vie parisienne _ everything she wear be in the very latest fashion of the parisian _ demi-monde _ that exaggerate elegance of a fashion plate which only the most exquisite of woman could redeem from vulgarity plush brocade peacock 's feather golden bangle mousquetaire glove a bonnet of purple plumage set off by ornament of filagree gold a infantine little muff of lace and wild flower buttercup and daisy and hair eyebrow and complexion as artificial as the flower on the muff all that art could do to obliterate the trace of age have be do for georgina kirkbank but seventy year be not to be obliterate easily and the crow 's foot show through the bloom de ninon and the eye under the paint arch be glassy and haggard the carnation lip have a withered look age be make all the more palpable by the artifice which would have disguise it lady maulevrier suffer a absolute shock at behold the friend of she youth she have not accustomed herself to the idea that woman in society could raddle they cheek stain they lip and play trick before high heaven with they eyebrow and eyelash in she own youth paint face have be the ghastly privilege of a class of womankind of which the woman of society be suppose to know nothing person who show they ankle and rouge they cheek be to be see of a afternoon in bond street but lady diana angersthorpe have be teach to pass they by as if she see they not to behold without see these creature outside the pale and now she see she own dearest friend a person distinctly within the pale plaster with bismuth and stain with carmine and wear hair of a color so obviously false and inharmonious that child-like faith could hardly accept it as reality forty year ago lady kirkbank 's long ringlet have be darkest glossiest brown to-day she wear a tousled fringe of bright yellow piquantly contrast with vandyke brown eyebrow it take lady maulevrier some moment to get over the shock she draw a chair to the fire and establish she friend in it and then with a little gasp she say : ' i be charm to see you again georgie ' ` you darling i be sure you would be glad but you must find I awfully change -- awfully ' for world lady maulevrier could not have deny this truth happily lady kirkbank do not wait for a answer ` society be so wear and george and i never seem to get a interval of quiet kirkbank be to be full of man next week you granddaughter will have a good time ' ` there will be a few woman of course ' ` oh yes there be no avoid that only one do not reckon they sir george only count he gun we expect a splendid season i shall send you some bird of my own shooting ' ` you shoot ' exclaimed lady maulevrier amaze ` shoot i should think i do what else be there to amuse one in scotland after the salmon fishing be over i have never miss a season for the last thirty year unless we have be abroad ' ` please do not innoculate lesbium with you love of sport ' ` what you would not like she to shoot well perhaps you be right it be hardly the thing for a pretty girl with she fortune to make it spoil the delicacy of the skin but i be afraid she 'll find kirkbank dull if she do not go out with the gun she can meet we with the rest of the woman at luncheon we have some capital picnic luncheon on the moor i can assure you ' ' i know she will enjoy herself with you she have be accustom to a very quiet life here ' ` it be a lovely spot but i own i can not understand how you can have live here exclusively during all these year -- you who use to be all life and fire loving change action political and diplomatic society to dance upon the crest of the wave as it be you whole nature must have suffer some curious change ' they close intimacy of the past warrant freedom of speech in the present ` my nature do undergo a change and a severe one ' answer lady maulevrier gloomily ` it be that horrid -- and i daresay unfortunate scandal about he lordship and then the sad shock of he death ' murmured lady kirkbank sympathetically ` most woman with you youth and beauty would have forget the scandal and the husband in a twelvemonth and would have make a second marriage more brilliant than the first but no indian widow who ever perform suttee be more worthy of praise than you or even that person of ephesus whose story i have hear somewhere indeed i have always speak of you life as a long suttee but you mean to re-appear in society next season i hope when you present you granddaughter ' ' i shall certainly go up to london to present she and possibly i may spend the season in town but i shall feel like rip van winkle ' ` no no you will not my dear di you have keep yourself _ au courant _ i know even my silly gossip letter may have be of _ some _ use ' ` they have be most valuable let I give you another cup of tea ' say lady maulevrier who have be officiate at she own exquisite tea-table a arrangement of inlaid wood antique silver and modern china which she friend pronounce a perfect poem indeed the whole room be poetic lady kirkbank declare and there be many highly praise scene which less deserve the epithet the dark red wall and cedar dado the stamped velvet curtain of a indescribable shade between silver-grey and olive the sheraton furniture the parqueterie floor and persian prayer-rug the deep yet brilliant hue of crackle porcelain and chinese cloisonné enamel the artistic fireplace with dog-stove low brass fender and ingle-nook recess under the high mantelpiece all combine to form a luxurious and harmonious whole lady kirkbank admire the _ tout ensemble _ in the fitful light of the fire the dim gray of deepen twilight ` there never be a more delicious cell ' she exclaim ` but still i should feel it a prison if i have to spend six week in the year in it i never stay more than six week anywhere out of london and i always find six week more than enough the first fortnight be rapture the third and fourth week be calm content the fifth be weariness the sixth a fever to be go i once try a seventh week at pontresina and i hate the place so intensely that i dare not go back there for the next three year but now tell I diana have you really perform suttee have you bury yourself alive in this sweet spot deliberately or have the love of retirement grow upon you and have you become a kind of lotus-eater ' ' i believe i have become a kind of lotus-eater my retirement here have be no sentimental sacrifice to lord maulevrier 's memory ' ' i be glad to hear that for i really think the worst possible use a woman can make of she life be in waste it on lamentation for a dead and go husband life be odiously short at the best and it be mere imbecility to fritter away any of we scanty portion upon the dead who can never be any the better for we tear ' ` my motive in live at fellside be not reverence for the dead and now let we talk of the gay world of which you know all the secret have you hear anything more about lord hartfield ' ` ah there be a subject in which you have reason to be interested i have not forget the romance of you youth -- that first season in which ronald hollister use to haunt every place at which you appear do you remember that wet afternoon at the chiswick flower-show when you and he and i take shelter in the orange house and you two make love to each other most audaciously in a atmosphere of orange-blossom that almost stifle I yes those be glorious day ' ' a short summer of gladness a brief dream ' sigh lady maulevrier ` be young lord hartfield like he father ' ` no he take after the ilmington but still there be a look of you old sweetheart -- yes i think there be a expression i have not see he for nearly a year he be still abroad roam about somewhere in search of adventure these young man who belong to the geographical and the alpine club be hardly ever at home ' ` but though they may be sometimes lose to society they be all the more worthy of society 's esteem when they do appear ' say lady maulevrier ' i think there must be a ennobling influence in alpine travel or in the vast solitude of the dark continent a man find himself face to face with unsophisticated nature and with the grandest force of the universe professor tyndall write delightfully of he alpine experience he mind seem to have ripen in the solitude and untainted air of the alp and i believe lord hartfield be a young man of very high character and of considerable cultivation be he not ' ` he be a splendid young fellow i never hear a word to he disparagement even from those people who pretend to know something bad about everybody what a husband he would make for one of you girl ' ` admirable but those perfect arrangement which seem predestine by heaven itself be so rarely realize on earth ' answer the dowager lightly she be not go to show she card even to a old friend ` well it would be very sweet if they be to meet next season and fall in love with each other ' say lady kirkbank ` he be enormously rich and i daresay you girl will not be portionless ' ` lesbium may take a modest place among heiress ' answer lady maulevrier ' i have live so quietly during the last forty year that i could hardly help save money ' ` how nice ' sigh georgie ' i never save sixpence in my life and be always in debt ' ` the little fortune i have save be much too small for division lesbium will therefore have all i can leave she mary have the usual provision as a daughter of the maulevrier house ' ` and i suppose lesbium have that provision also ' ` of course ' ` lucky lesbium i only wish hartfield be come to we for the shooting i would engage he should fall in love with she kirkbank be a splendid place for match-making but the fact be i be not very intimate with he he be almost always travel and when he be at home he be not in we set and now my dear diana tell I more about yourself and you own life in this delicious place ' ` there be so little to tell the book i have read the theory of literature and art and science which i have adopt and dismiss learn and forget -- those be the history of my life the idea of the outside world reach I here only in book and newspaper but you who have be live in the world must have so much to say let I be the listener ' lady kirkbank desire nothing better she rattle on for three-quarter of a hour about she doings in the great world she social triumph the wonderful thing she have do for sir george who seem to be as a puppet in she hand the prince and princeling she have entertain the song she have compose the comedy she have write for private representation only albeit the haymarket manager be die to produce it the scathing witticism with which she have wither she social enemy she would have go on much longer but for the gong which remind she that it be time to dross for dinner half-an-hour later lady kirkbank be in the drawing-room where mary have retire to the most shadowy corner anxious to escape the gaze of the fashionable visitor but lady kirkbank be not incline to take much notice of mary lesbium 's brilliant beauty the exquisite greek head the faultless complexion the deep violet eye catch georgina kirkbank 's eye the moment she have enter the room and she see that this girl and no other must be the beauty the beloved and choose grandchild ` how do you do my dear ' she say take lesbium 's hand and then as if with a gush of warm feeling suddenly draw the girl towards she and kiss she on both cheek ' i be go to be desperately fond of you and i hope you will soon contrive to like I -- just a little ' ' i feel sure that i shall like you very much ' lesbium answer sweetly ' i be prepare to love you as grandmother 's old friend ' ` oh my dear to think that i should ever be the old friend of anybody 's grandmother ' sigh lady kirkbank with unaffected regret ` when i be you age i use to think all old people odious it never occur to I that i should live to be one of they ' ` then you have no dear grandmother whom you love ' say lesbia ` or you would have like old people for she sake ' ` no my love i have no grandparent i have a father and he be all-sufficient -- anything beyond he in the ancestral line would have be a burden lay upon I greater than i could bear as the poet say ' dinner be announce and mary come shyly out of she corner blush deeply ` and this be lady mary i suppose ' say lady kirkbank in a off-hand way ` how do you do my dear i be go to steal you sister ' ' i be very glad ' falter mary ' i mean i be glad that lesbium should enjoy herself ' ` and some fine day when lesbium be marry and a great lady i shall ask you to come to scotland ' say lady kirkbank condescendingly and than she murmur in she friend 's ear as they go to the dining-room ` quite a english girl very fresh and frank and nice ' which be great praise for such a second-rate young person as lady mary ` what do you think of lesbium ' ask lady maulevrier in the same undertone ` she be simply adorable you letter prepare I to expect beauty but not such beauty my dear i think the progress of the human race be all in a downward line since we time but you granddaughter be as handsome as you be in you first season and that be go very far ' chapter xiv ` not yet ' lady kirkbank carry off lesbium early next day the girl radiant at the idea of see life under new condition she have a few minute ' serious talk with she grandmother before she go ` lesbia you be go into the world ' say lady maulevrier ` yes even a country house be the world in little you will have many admirer instead of one but i think i believe that you will be true to I and to yourself ' ` you need not fear grandmother i have be a idiot but -- but it be only a pass folly and i shall never be so weak again ' lesbium 's scornful lip and kindling eye give intensity to she speech it be evident that she despise herself for that one touch of womanly softness which have make she as ready to fall in love with she first wooer as any peasant girl in grasmere vale ' i be delighted to hear you speak thus dearest ' say lady maulevrier ` and if mr hamilton -- hammond i mean -- should have the audacity to follow you to kirkbank and to intrude himself upon you there -- perhaps to persecute you with clandestine address -- ' ' i do not believe he would do anything clandestine ' say lesbium draw herself up ` he be quite above that ' ` my dear child we know absolutely nothing about he he have he way to make in the world unaided by family or connection he be clever -- daring such a man can not help be a adventurer and a adventurer be capable of anything i warn you to beware of he ' ' i do not suppose i shall ever see he face again ' retort lesbium irritably she have make up she mind that she life be not to be spoil she brilliant future sacrifice for the sake of john hammond but the wound which she have suffer in renounce he be still fresh she feeling be still sore any contemptuous mention of he sting she to the quick ' i hope not and you will beware of other adventurer lesbia man of a worse stamp than mr hammond more experienced in ruse and iniquity man steep to the lip in worldly knowledge man who look upon woman as mere counter in the game of life the world think that i be rich and you will no doubt take rank as a heiress you will therefore be a mark for every spendthrift noble or otherwise who want to restore he broken fortune by a wealthy marriage and now my dearest good-bye half my heart go with you nothing could induce I to part with you even for a few week except the conviction that it be for you good ' ` but we shall not be part next year i hope grandmother ' say lesbia affectionately ` you say something about present I and then leave I in lady kirkbank 's care for the season i should not like that at all i want you to go everywhere with I to teach I all the mystery of the great world you have always promise I that it should be so ' ` and i have always intend that it should be so i hope that it will be so ' answer she grandmother with a sigh ` but i be a old woman lesbium and i be root to this place ' ` but why should you be root here what charm can keep you here when you be so fit to shine in society you be old in nothing but year and not even old in year in comparison with woman whom we hear of go everywhere and mix in every fashionable amusement you be full of fire and energy and as active as a girl why should you not enjoy a london season grandmother ' plead lesbium nestle she head lovingly against lady maulevrier 's shoulder ' i should enjoy it dearest with you it would be a renewal of my youth to see you shine and conquer i should be as proud as if the glory be all my own yes dear i hope that i shall be a spectator of you triumph but do not let we plan the future life be so full of change remember what horace say -- ' ` horace be a bear ' say lesbium ' i hate a poet who be always harp upon change and death ' the carriage which be to take the traveller to windermere station be announce at this moment and lesbium and she grandmother give each other the farewell embrace ` you like lady kirkbank i hope ' say lady maulevrier as they go towards the ball where that lady be wait for they with lady mary and fräulein müller in attendance upon she ` she seem very kind but i should like she better if she do not paint -- or if she paint better ' ` my dear child i be afraid it be the fashion of the day just as it be in pope 's time and we ought to think nothing about it ' ` well i suppose i shall get harden in time ' ` my dearest lesbium ' shriek lady kirkbank from below ` remember we have to catch a train ' lesbium hurry downstairs follow by lady maulevrier who have to bid she friend adieu the luggage have be send on in a cart lesbium 's trunk and dress basket form no small item she be so well furnished with pretty gown of all kind that there have be no difficulty in get she ready for this sudden visit she maid be on the box beside the coachman lady kirkbank 's attendant a frenchwoman of

world to see all kind of people -- clever people -- distinguished people -- musical artistic political people -- hunting and shooting people -- while mary be to stay at home all the winter among the old familiar face dearly as she love these hill and vale she heart sink a little at the thought of those long lonely month day and evening that would be all alike and which must be spend without sympathetic companionship and there would be dreary day on which the weather would keep she a prisoner in she luxurious gaol when the mountain and the rugged path beside the mountain stream would be inaccessible when she would be restricted to fräulein 's phlegmatic society that lady be stout and lazy fond of she meal and give to afternoon slumber lesbium and mary be not by any means sympathetic yet after all blood be thicker than water and lesbium be intelligent and could talk of the thing mary loved which be better than total dumbness even if she generally take a antagonistic view of they ' i shall miss she dreadfully ' thought mary as she stroll listlessly in the garden where the leaf where fall and the flower fading ' i wonder if she will see mr hammond at lady kirkbank 's ' muse mary ` if he be anything like a lover he would find out all about she visit and seize the opportunity of she be away from grandmother but then if he have be much of a lover he would have follow she to st bee ' lady maulevrier sorely miss she favorite grandchild in a life spend in such profound seclusion so remote from the busy interest of the world this beloved companionship have become a necessity to she she have concentrate she affection upon lesbium and the girl 's absence make a fearful blank but she ladyship 's dignity be not compromise by any outward sign of trouble or loss she spend she morning in she own room reading and write and muse at she leisure she drive or walk every fine afternoon sometimes alone sometimes attend by mary who hate these stately drive and walk she dine _ tête-à-tête _ with mary except on those rare occasion when there be visitor -- the vicar and he wife or some wander star from other world mary live in profound awe of she grandmother but be of far too frank a nature to be able to adapt she speech or she manners to she ladyship 's idea of feminine perfection she be silent and shy under those falcon eye but she be still the same mary the girl to whom pretence or simulation of any kind be impossible letter come almost every day from kirkbank castle letter from lesbium describe the bright gay life she be live at that hospitable abode the excursion the ride the picnic luncheon after the morning 's sport the dinner party the dance ` it be the most delightful house you can imagine ' write lesbia ` and lady kirkbank be a admirable hostess i have quite forgive she for wear false eyebrow for after all you know one must _ have _ eyebrow they be a necessity but why do she not have the two arch alike they be _ never _ a pair and i really think

young society and will be horribly vex if i refuse to go with they and lady kirkbank think my chest be just a little weak -- i almost break down the other night in that lovely little song of jensen 's -- and that a winter in the south be just what i want but of course dear grandmother i will not ask you to let I be away so long if you think you will miss I ' ` if i think i shall miss she ' repeat lady maulevrier ` have the girl no heart that she can ask such a question but can i wonder at that of what account be i or my love to she father although i sacrifice myself for he good name can i expect that she should be of a different clay ' and then meditate upon the event of the summer that be go lady maulevrier think -- she renounce she first lover at my bidding she renounce she love for I at the bidding of the world or be it not rather self-interest the fear of make a bad marriage which influence she in she renunciation of mr hammond it be not obedience to I it be not love for I

own villa do consent to this plan dear grandmother and then we shall not be part for a long winter of course mary would be quite happy at home run wild ' lady maulevrier sigh as she read this letter sigh again and heavily as she put it back into the envelope alas how many and many a year have go long monotonous colourless year since she have see that bright southern world which she be now urge to revisit in fancy she see it again to-day the tideless sea of deepest sapphire blue the little wavelet break on a yellow beach the white triangular sail the wood full of asphodel and great purple and white lily the atmosphere steep in warmth and light and perfume the glare of white house in the sun the red and yellow blind the pot of green and orange and crimson clay with oleander abloom the wonderful glow of color everywhere and upon all thing and then as the eye of the mind recall these vivid image she bodily eye look out upon the rain-blotted scene the mountain rise in a dark and dismal circle round that sombre pool below wall she in from the outer world ' i be at the bottom of a grave ' she say to herself ' i be in a living tomb from which there be no escape forty year forty year of patience and hope for what for dream which may never be realize for descendant who may never give I the price of my labor yes i should like to go to my dear one i should like to revisit the south of france to go on to italy i should feel young again amidst that eternal unchangeable loveliness i should forget all i have suffer but it can not be not yet not yet ' presently with a smile of concentrated bitterness she repeat the word ` not yet ' ` surely at my age it must be folly to dream of the future and yet i feel as if there be half a century of life in I as if i have lose nothing in either mental or bodily vigor since i come here forty year ago ' she rise as she say these word and begin to pace the room with quiet firm step erect stately beautiful in she advanced year as she have be in she bloom and freshness only with another kind of beauty -- a empress among woman the boast that she have make to herself be no idle boast at sixty-seven year of age she physical power show no sign of decay she mental quality be at they best and brightest long year of thought and study have ripen and widen she mind she be a woman fit to be the friend and counsellor of statesman the companion and confidant of she sovereign : and yet fate will that she should be bury alive in a westmoreland valley see the same hill and stream the same rustic face from year 's end to year 's end surely it be a hard fate a heavy penance albeit self-imposed lesbium go straight from scotland to pari with sir george and lady kirkbank here they stay at the bristol for just two day during which she hostess go all over the fashionable quarter buy clothes for the canne campaign and assist lesbium to spend the hundred pound which she grandmother have send she for the replenishment of she well-provided wardrobe it be astonishing how little way a hundred pound go among the dressmaker corset-maker and shoemaker of lutetium ' i have no notion that clothes be so dear ' say lesbium when she see how little she have get for she money ` my dear you have two gown which be absolutely _ chien _ ' reply lady kirkbank ` and you have a corset which give you a figure which you must forgive I for say you never have before ' lady kirkbank have to explain that _ chien _ as apply to a gown or bonnet be the same thing as _ chic _ only a little more so ' i hope my gown will always be _ chien _ ' say lesbium meekly next evening they be dine at canne with the blue sea in front of they window dine at a table all abloom with orange flower tea rose mignonette waxen camellia and pale parma violet while lady maulevrier and mary dine _ tête-à-tête _ at fellside with the feathery snow flake fall outside and the world whitening all around they next day the world be all white and mary 's beloved hill be inaccessible who could tell how long they might be cover the wind track hide the narrow force look like black water or molten iron against that glittering whiteness mary could only walk along the road by loughrigg to the bench call ` rest and be thankful ' from which she look with longing eye across towards the langdale pike and to the sharp cone-shaped peak know as coniston old man just visible above the nearer hill fräulein müller suggest that it be in just such weather as this that a well bring up young lady a young lady with _ vernunft _ and _ anstand _ should devote herself to the improvement of she mind ` let we read german this _ abscheulich _ afternoon ' say the fräulein ` suppose we go on with the sorrow of werther ' ` werther be a fool ' cry mary ` any book but that ' ` will you choose you own book ' ` let I read heine ' fräulein look doubtful there be thing in heine -- a all-pervading tone -- which render he hardly a appropriate poet for ` the young person ' but fräulein compromise the matter by let mary read atta troll the exact bearing of which neither of they understand ` how beautifully mr hammond read heine that morning ' say mary break off suddenly from a perfectly automatic reading ` you do not hear he do you you be not there ' say the fräulein ' i be not _ there _ but i hear he i -- i be sit on the bank among the pine tree ' ` why do you not come and sit with we it would have be more ladylike than to hide yourself behind the tree ' mary blush crimson ' i have be in the kennel with maulevrier i be not fit to be see ' she say ` hardly a ladylike admission ' reply the fräulein who feel that with lady mary she chief duty be to reprove chapter xv ` of all man else i have avoid thee ' it be afternoon the white hill yonder and all the length of the valley be touch here and there with gleam of wintry sunlight and lady maulevrier be take she solitary walk in the terrace in front of she house a stately figure wrap in a furred mantle tall erect move with measure pace up and down the smooth gravel path now and then at the end of the walk the dowager stop for a minute or so and stand as if in deep think with she eye dreamily contemplate the landscape a intense melancholy shadow she face as she thus gaze with brooding eye on the naked monotony of those wintry hill so have she look in many and many a winter and it seem to she that she life be of a piece with those bleak hill where in the dismal winter time nothing living tread she stand gaze at the sink sun a fiery ball shine at the end of a long gallery of crag and rock like a lamp at the end of a corridor and as she gaze the red round orb drop suddenly behind the edge of a crag as if she have be a enchantress and have dismiss it with a wave of she wand ' o lord how long how long ' she say ` how many time have i see that sun go down from this spot in winter and summer in spring and autumn and now that the one be i loved and care for be far away i feel all the weariness and emptiness of my life ' as she turn to resume she walk she hear the muffle sound of wheel in the road below that road which be completely hide by foliage in summer but which be now visible here and there between the leafless tree a carriage with a pair of horse be come along the road from ambleside lady maulevrier stand and watch until the carriage draw up at the lodge gate and then when the gate have be open slowly ascend the wind drive to the house she expect no visitor indeed there be no one likely to come to she from the direction of ambleside she heart begin to beat heavily with the apprehension of come evil what kind of evil she know not bad news about she granddaughter perhaps or about maulevrier and yet that could hardly be evil tiding of that kind would have reach she by telegram perhaps it be maulevrier himself he movement be generally erratic lady maulevrier hurry back to the house she go through the conservatory where the warm whiteness of azalium and spirea and arum lily contrast curiously with the cold white snow out of door to the hall where a stranger be stand talk to the butler he be a man of foreign appearance wear a cloak line with sable and a sable cap which he remove as lady maulevrier approach he be thin and small with a clear olive complexion olive incline to pale bronze sleek raven hair and black almond-shaped eye at the first glance lady maulevrier know that he be a oriental she heart sink within she and seem to grow chill as death at sight of he anything associate with indium be horrible to she the stranger come forward to meet she bowing deferentially he have those lithe glide movement which she remember of old when she have see prince and dignitary of the east creep shoeless to she husband 's foot ` will you ladyship do I the honor to grant I a interview ' he say in very good english ' i have travel from london expressly for that privilege ' ` then i fear you have waste you time sir whatever you mission may be ' the dowager answer haughtily ` however i be willing to hear anything you may have to say if you will be good enough to come this way ' she move towards the library the butler precede she to open the door and the stranger follow she into the spacious room where coal and log be heap high upon the wide dog stove deeply recess beneath the old english mantelpiece it be one of the handsomest room of the

wealth and taste of the owner while one side of the room be absorb by a wide gothic window beyond which appear the panorama of lake and mountain beautiful in every season a tawny velvet curtain divide this room from the drawing-room but there be also a strong oak door behind the curtain which be generally close in cold weather lady maulevrier go over to this door and take the precaution to draw the bolt before she seat herself in she arm-chair by the hearth she have she own particular chair in all the room she occupy -- a chair which be sacred as a throne she draw off she sealskin glove and motion with a slender white hand to the stranger to be seat ` to whom have i the honor of speak ' she ask look he through and through with a unflinching gaze as she would have look at death himself

thrice with passionate hand and a servant fly to answer that impatient summons ` show this gentleman to he carriage ' she say imperiously the gentleman who call himself loui asoph bow and retire without another word as the door close upon he lady maulevrier stand with clench hand and frown brow stare into vacancy she right arm be outstretch as if she would have wave the intruder away suddenly a strange numbness creep over that uplifted arm and it fall to she side from she shoulder down to she foot that proud form grow cold and feelingless and dead and she who have so long carry herself as a queen among woman sink in a senseless heap upon the floor chapter xvi ` she face resign to bliss or bale ' lady mary and the fräulein have be sit in the drawing-room all this time wait for lady maulevrier to come to tea they hear she come in from the garden and then the footman tell they that she be in the library with a stranger not even the muffle sound of voice penetrate the heavy velvet curtain and the thick oak door it be only by the loud ringing of the bell and the sound of footstep in the hall that lady mary know of the guest 's departure she go to the door between the two room and be surprise to find it bolt ` grandmamma will not you come to tea ' she ask timidly knock on the oaken panel but there be no reply she knock again and louder still no reply ` perhaps she ladyship be go to take tea in she own room ' she say afraid to be officious attendance upon she grandmother at afternoon tea have be one of lesbium 's particular duty but mary feel that she be a unwelcome substitute for lesbium she want to get a little nearer she grandmother 's heart if she could but she know that she attention be endure rather than like she go into the hall where the footman on duty be stare at the light snowflake dance past the window perhaps wish he be a snowflake himself and enjoy himself in that white whirligig ` be she ladyship have tea in the morning-room ' ask mary the footman give a little start as if awaken out of a kind of trance the sheer vacuity of he mind might naturally slide into mesmeric sleep he tell lady mary that she ladyship have not leave the library and mary go in timidly wonder why she grandmother have not join they in the drawing-room when the stranger be go the sky be dark outside the wide window white hill and valley shroud in the shades of night the library be only light by the glow of the log on the hearth and in that ruddy light the spacious room look empty mary be turn to go away think the footman have be mistake when she eye suddenly light upon a dark figure lie on the ground and then she hear a awful stertorous breathing and know that she grandmother be lie there stricken and helpless mary shriek aloud with a cry that pierce curtain and door and bring fräulein and half-a-dozen servant to she help one of the man bring a lamp and among they they lift the smitten figure oh god how ghastly the face look in the lamplight -- the feature draw to one side the skin livid ` she ladyship have have a stroke ' say the butler ` be she die ' falter mary white as ash ` oh grandmother dear grandmother do not look at we like that ' one of the servant rush off to the stable to send for the doctor of course be a indoor man he no more think of go out himself into the snowy night on such a errand than noah thought of go out of the ark to explore the face of the water in person they carry lady maulevrier to she bed and lay she there like a figure carve out of stone she be not unconscious she eye be open and she moan every now and then as if in bodily or mental pain once she try to speak but have no power to shape a syllable aright and end with a shudder sigh once she lift she leave arm and wave it in the air as if wave some one off in fear or anger the right arm indeed the whole of the right side be lifeless motionless as a stone it be a piteous sight to see the beautiful feature draw and distort the lip so accustomed to command mouth the broken syllable of a unknown tongue lady mary sit beside the bed with clasped hand pray dumbly with she eye fix on she grandmother 's altered face mr horton come as soon as he stout mountain pony could bring he he do not seem surprised at she ladyship 's condition and accept the situation with professional calmness ' a marked case of hemiplegium ' he say when he have observe the symptom ` will she die ' ask mary ` oh dear no she will want great care for a little while but we shall bring she round easily a splendid constitution a noble frame but i think she have overwork she brain a little reading huxley and darwin and the german physiologist upon whom huxley and darwin have build themselves metaphysics too schopenhauer and the rest of they a wonderful woman very few brain could hold what hers have have pour into it in the last thirty year the conducting nerve between the brain and the spinal marrow have be overwork : too much activity too constant a strain even the rail and sleeper on the railroad wear out do not you know if there be excessive traffic ' mr horton have know mary from she childhood have give she gregory 's powder and see she safely through measles and other infantine ailment so he be quite at home with she and at fellside generally lady maulevrier have give he a good deal of she confidence during those thirty year in which he have practice as he father 's partner and successor at grasmere he use to tell people that he owe the best part of he education to she ladyship who condescend to talk to he of the new book she read and generally give he a volume to put in he pocket when he be leave she ` do not be downheart lady mary ' he say ' i shall come in two or three time a day and see how thing be go on and if i see the slightest difficulty in the case i 'll telegraph for jenner ' mary and the fräulein sit up with the invalid all that night lady maulevrier 's maid be also in attendance and one of the manservant sleep in he clothes on a couch in the corridor ready for any emergency but the night pass peacefully the patient sleep a good deal and next day there be evident improvement the stroke which have prostrate the body which reduce the vigorous active frame to a awful statue -- like stillness -- a quietude as of death of itself -- have not overcloud the intellect lady maulevrier lay on she bed in she luxurious room with wide tudor window command half the circle of the hill and be still the ruling spirit of the house albeit powerless to move that slender hand the lightest wave of which have be as potent to command in she little world as royal sign-manual or sceptre in the great world outside now there remain only one thing unimpaired by that awful shock which have lay the stately frame low and that be the will and sovereign force of the woman 's nature voice be altered speech be confuse and difficult but the strength of will the supreme power of mind seem undiminished when lady maulevrier be ask if lesbium should be telegraph for she reply no not unless she be in danger of sudden death ' i should like to see she before i go ' she say labor to pronounce the word ` dear grandmother ' say mary tenderly ` mr horton say there be no danger ' ` then do not send for she do not even tell she what have happen not yet ' ` but she will miss you letter ' ` true you must write twice a week at my dictation you must tell she that i have hurt my hand that i be well but can not use a pen i would not spoil she pleasure for the world ' ` dear grandmother how unselfish you be and maulevrier shall he be send for he be not so far away ' say mary hope she grandmother would say yes what a relief what a unspeakable solace maulevrier 's presence would be in that dreary house smitten to a sudden and awful stillness as if by the angel of death ` no i do not want maulevrier ' answer she ladyship impatiently ` may i sit here and read to you grandmother ' mary ask timidly ` mr horton say you be to be keep very quiet and that we be not to let you talk or talk much to you but that we might read to you if you like ' ' i do not wish to be read to i have my thought for company ' say lady maulevrier mary feel that this imply a wish to be alone she bent over the invalid 's pillow and kiss the pale cheek feeling as if she be take a liberty in venture so much she would hardly have do it have lesbium be at home but she have a feeling that in lesbium 's absence lady maulevrier must want somebody 's love -- even hers and then she creep away leave halcott the maid in attendance sit at she work at the window furthest from the bed ` alone with my thought ' mused lady maulevrier look out at the panorama of wintry hill white ghost-like against a iron sky ` pleasant thought truly wall in by the hill -- wall in and hem round for ever this place have always feel like a grave : and now i know that it _ be _ my grave ' fräulein and lady mary and the maid halcott a sedate personage of forty summer have all be instruct by the doctor that lady maulevrier be to be keep profoundly quiet she must not talk much since speech be likely to be a painful effort with she for some little time she must not be talk to much by anyone least of all must she be speak to upon any agitating topic life must be make as smooth and easy for she as for a new-born infant no rough breath from the outer world must come near she she be to see no one but she maid and she granddaughter mr horton a plain family man take it for grant that the granddaughter be dear to she heart and likely to exercise a soothing influence thus it happen that although lady maulevrier ask repeatedly that jame steadman should be bring to she she be not allow to see he she whose will have be paramount in that house whose word have be law be now treat as a little child while the will be still as strong the mind as keen as ever ` she would talk to he of business ' say mr horton when he be tell of she ladyship 's desire to see steadman ` and that can not be allow not for some little time at least ' ` she be very angry with we for refuse to obey she ' say lady mary ` naturally but it be for she own welfare she be disobey she can have nothing to say to steadman which will not keep till she be better this establishment go by clockwork ' mary wish it be a little less like clockwork since lady maulevrier have be lie upstairs -- the voice which have once rule over the house muffle almost to dumbness -- the monotony of life at fellside have seem all the more oppressive the servant creep about with stealthier tread mary dare not touch either piano or billiard ball and be naturally seize with a longing to touch both the house have a darkened-look as if the shadow of doom overhang it during this regimen of perfect quiet lady maulevrier be not allow to see the newspaper and mary be warn that in read to she grandmother she be to avoid all exciting topic thus it happen that the account of a terrible collision between the scotch express and a luggage train a little way beyond preston a accident in which seven people be kill and about thirty seriously hurt be not make know to she ladyship and yet that fact would have be of intense interest and significance to she since one of those passenger whose injury be fatal bear the name of loui asoph chapter xvii ` and the spring come slowly up this way ' the wintry week glide smoothly by in a dull monotony and now lady maulevrier still helpless still compel to lie on she bed or she invalid couch motionless as marble have at least recover she power of speech be allow to read and to talk and to hear what be go on in that metropolitan world which she seem unlikely ever to behold again lady lesbium be still at canne whence she write of she pleasure and she triumph of flower and sapphire sea and azure sky of all thing which be not in the gray bleak mountain world that hem in fellside she be meet many of the people whom she be to meet again next season in the london world she have make a informal _ début _ in a very select circle a circle in which everybody be more or less _ chic _ or _ chien _ or _ zinc _ and she be tasting all the sweet of success but in none of she letter be there any mention of lord hartfield he be not in the little great world by the blue tideless sea there be no talk of lesbium 's return she be to stay till the carnival she be to stay till the week before easter lady kirkbank insist upon it and both lesbium and lady kirkbank upbraid lady maulevrier for she cruelty in not join they at canne so lady maulevrier have to resign herself to that solitude which have become almost the habit of she life and to the society of mary and the fräulein mary be eager to be of use to sit with she grandmother to read to she to write for she the warm young heart be deeply move by the spectacle of this stately woman stricken into helplessness chained to she couch immure within four wall to mary who so love the hill and the stream the sun and the wind this imprisonment seem unspeakable woe in she pity for such a martyrdom she would have do anything to give pleasure or solace to she grandmother unhappily there be very little mary could do to increase the invalid 's sum of pleasure lady maulevrier be a woman of strong feeling not capable of loving many people she have concentrate she affection upon lesbium : and she could not open she heart to mary all at once because lesbium be out of the way ` if i have a dog i loved and he be to die i would never have another in he place ' lady maulevrier say once and that speech be the keynote of she character she be very courteous to mary and seem grateful for she attention but she do not cultivate the girl 's society mary write all she letter in a fine bold hand and with a rapid pen but when the letter-writing be over lady maulevrier always dismiss she ` my dear you want to be out in the air ride you pony or scamper about with you dog ' she say kindly ` it would

dowager not angry at this daring reproach ' i know you sister and i know she be not the kind of woman to be happy in a ignoble life -- to bear poverty and deprivation if it have be you now whom mr hammond have choose i might have take the subject into my consideration ' mary flame crimson ` mr hammond never give I a thought ' she say ` unless it be to think I contemptible he be world too good for such a tomboy maulevrier tell he about the fox-hunt and they both laugh at I -- at least i have no doubt mr hammond laugh though i be too much ashamed to look at he ' ` poor mary you be begin to find out that a young lady ought to be ladylike ' say lady maulevrier ` and now my dear you may go i be only joke with you mr hammond would be no match for any granddaughter of mine he be nobody and have neither friend nor interest if he have go into the church maulevrier could have help he but i daresay he idea be too broad for the church and he will have to starve at the bar where nobody can help he i hope you will bear this in mind mary if maulevrier should ever bring he here again ' ` he be never likely to come back again he suffer too much he be treat too badly in this house ' ` lady mary be good enough to remember to whom you be speak ' say she ladyship with a frown ` and now please go and tell some one to send steadman to I ' mary retire without a word give lady maulevrier 's message to a footman in the corridor slip off to she room put on she sealskin hat and jacket take she staff and go out for a long ramble the hill and valley be still white it have be a long cold winter and spring be still far off -- February have only just begin lady maulevrier 's couch have be wheel into the morning-room -- that luxurious room which be furnish with all thing needful to she quiet life she book she favorite color she favorite flower every detail studiously arrange for she pleasure and comfort she be wheel into this room every day at noon when the day be bright and sunny she couch be place near the window : and when the day be dull and gray the couch be draw close to the low hearth which flash and glitter with brightly color tile and artistic brass to-day the sky be dull and the velvet couch stand beside the hearth halcott sit at work in the adjoining bed-chamber and come in every now and then to replenish the fire : a footman be always on duty in the corridor a spring bell stand among the elegant trifle upon she ladyship 's table and the lightest touch of she left hand upon the bell bring she attendant to she side she resolutely refuse to have any one sit with she all day long solitude be a necessity of she be she tell mr horton when he recommend that she should have some one always in attendance upon she as the week wear on she feature have be restore to they proud calm beauty she articulation be almost as clear as of old : yet now and then there would be a sudden falter the tongue and lip would refuse they office or she would forget a word or use a wrong word unconsciously but there be no recovery of power or movement on that side of the body which have be stricken the paralysed limb be still motionless lifeless as marble and it be clear that mr horton have begin to lose heart about he patient there be nothing obscure in the case but the patient 's importance make the treatment a serious matter and the surgeon beg to be allow to summon sir william jenner this however lady maulevrier refuse ' i do not want any fuss make about I ' she say ' i be content to trust myself to you skill and i beg that no other doctor may be summon ' mr horton understand he patient 's feeling on this point she have a sense of humiliation in she helplessness and like some wound animal that crawl to its covert to die she would fain have hide she misery from the eye of stranger she have allow no one not even maulevrier to be inform of the nature of she illness ` it will be time enough for he to know all about I when he come here ' she say ' i shall be oblige to see he whenever he do come ' maulevrier have spend christmas and new year in paris mr hammond still he companion she ladyship comment upon this with a touch of scorn ` mr hammond be like the umbra you be read about the other day in lord lytton 's last day of pompeius ' she say to mary ` it must be very nice for he to go about the world with a friend who frank he everywhere ' ` but we do not know that maulevrier frank he ' protest mary blush ` we have no right to suppose that mr hammond do not pay he own expense ' ` my dear child be it possible for a young man who have no private means to go gad about the world on equal term with a spendthrift like maulevrier -- to pay for moor in scotland and apartment at the bristol ' ` but they be not stay at the bristol ' exclaimed mary ` they be stay at a old-established french hotel on the left side of the seine they be go about amongst the student and the workman dine at popular restaurant hear people talk maulevrier say it be delightfully amusing -- ever so much better than the beaten track of life in anglo-american pari ' ' i daresay they be lead a bohemian life and will get into trouble before they have do ' say she ladyship gloomily ` maulevrier be as wild as a hawk ' ` he be the dearest boy in the world ' exclaimed mary she be deeply grateful for she brother 's condescension in write she a letter of two page long let she into the secret of he life she feel as if mr hammond be ever so much nearer to she now she know where he be and how he be amusing himself ` hammond be such a queer fellow ' write maulevrier ` the strangest thing interest he he sit and talk to the workman for hour he poke he nose into all sort of place -- hospital workshop poverty-stricken den -- and people be always civil to he he be what lesbium call _ sympatico _ ah what a mistake lesbium and my grandmother make when they reject hammond what a pearl above price they throw away but you see neither my lady nor lesbium could appreciate a gem unless it be richly set ' and now lady maulevrier lay on she couch by the fire wait for jame steadman she have see he several time since the day of she seizure but never alone there be a idea that steadman must necessarily talk to she of business matter or cause she mind to trouble itself about business matter so there have be a well-intentioned conspiracy in the house to keep he out of she way but now she be much better and she desire to see steadman need no longer be thwart he come at she bidding and stand a little way within the door tall erect square-shouldered resolute-looking with a quiet force of character express in every feature he be very much the same man that he have be forty year ago when he go with she ladyship to southampton and accompany he master and mistress on that tedious journey which be destine to be lord maulevrier 's last earthly pilgrimage time have do little to steadman in those forty year except to whiten he hair and beard and imprint some thoughtful line upon he sagacious forehead time have do something for he mentally insomuch as he have read a great many book and cultivate he mind in the monotonous quiet of fellside altogether he be a superior man for the passage of those forty year he have marry within the time choose for himself the buxom daughter of a lodgekeeper whose wife have long be lay at rest in grasmere churchyard the buxom girl have grow into a bulky matron but she be a colourless personage and she existence make hardly any difference in jame steadman 's life she have bring he no child and they fireside be lonely but steadman seem to be one of those self-contained personage to whom a solitary life be no affliction ' i hope i see you in better health my lady ' he say standing straight and square like a soldier on parade ' i be better thank you steadman better but a poor lifeless log chained to this sofa i send for you because the time have come when i must talk to you upon a matter of

shall not be so treated my lady while i be in this house but i know there be no member of the household who would presume so to treat you ' ` they might do it out of kindness but i should loathe such

this house whose come you have not be tell of ' ` then i be content ' say she ladyship with a sigh of relief after this there follow some conversation upon business matter jame steadman be trust with the entire management of the dowager 's income the investment of she savings he honesty be above all suspicion he be a man of simple habit he want few he have save money in every year of he service and for a man of he station be rich enough to be unassailable by the tempter he have reconcile he mind to the monotonous course of life at fellside in the beginning of thing and as the year glide smoothly by he character and want and inclination have as it be mould themselves to fit that life he have easy duty a comfortable home supreme authority in the household he be look up to and make much of in the village whenever he condescend to appear there and by the rareness of he visit to the inn or the reading-room and he unwillingness to accept hospitality from the tradesman of grasmere and ambleside he maintain he dignity and exaggerate he importance he have he book and he newspaper he evening leisure which no one ever dare to disturb he have the old wing of the house for he exclusive occupation and no one venture to intrude upon he in he privacy there be a bell in the corridor which communicate with he room and by this bell he be always summon there be servant who have be ten year at fellside and who have never cross the threshold of the red cloth door which be the only communication between the new house and the old one steadman 's wife perform all household duty of cooking and cleaning in the south wing where she and she husband take all they meal and live entirely apart from the other servant a exclusiveness which be secretly resent by the establishment ` mr steadman may be a very superior man ' say the butler ` and i know that in he own estimation the premier be not in it compare with he but i never be fond of people who set themselves upon pinnacle and i be not fond of the steadman ' ` mr steadman 's plain and homely enough ' reply the housekeeper ` and i know she would like to be more sociable and drop into my room for a cup of tea now and then but steadman do so keep she under he thumb : and because he be a misanthrope she be oblige to sit and mope alone ' if steadman want to drive there be a dogcart and horse at he disposal but he do not often leave fellside he seem in he humble way to model he life upon lady maulevrier 's secluded habit it be grow dusk when steadman leave he mistress and she lay for some time look at the landscape over which twilight shadow be steal and think of she own life over that life too the shadow of evening be creep she have begin to realize the fact that she be a old woman that for she all personal interest in life be nearly over she have never feel she age while she activity be unimpaired she have be oblige to remind herself very often that the afternoon and evening of life have slip away unawares in that tranquil retirement and that the night be at hand for she the close of earthly life mean actual night no new dawn no mysterious after-life shone upon she with magical gleam of a unknown light upon the other side of the dark river she have accept the materialist 's bitter and barren creed and have teach herself that this little life be all she have learn to scorn the idea of a great artificer outside the universe a mighty spirit ride amidst the cloud and rule the course of nature and the fate of man she have school herself to think that the idea of a blind unconscious nature work automatically through infinite time and space be ever so much grander than the old-world notion of a personal god a being of infinite power and inexhaustible beneficence mighty to devise and direct the universe with knowledge reach to the farthest confines of space with ear to listen to the prayer of he lowest creature she belief stop short even of the deist 's faith in a almighty will she see in creation nothing but the inevitable development of material law and it seem to she that there be quite as much hope of a heavenly world after death for the infusorium in the pool as for man in he pride and power she read she bible as diligently as she read she shakespeare and the word of the royal preacher in some measure embody she own dreary creed and now in the darken winter day she watch the gloomy shadow creep over the rugged breast of nabb scar and she think how there be a time for all thing and that she day of hope and ambition be past of late year she have live for lesbium look forward to the day when she be to introduce this beloved grandchild to the great world of london and now that hope be go for ever what could a helpless cripple do for a fashionable beauty what good would it be for she to be convey to london and to lie on a couch in mayfair while lesbium ride in the row and go to three or four party every night with a more active chaperon she have hope to go everywhere with she darling to glory in all she success to shield she from all possibility of failure and now lesbium must stand or fall alone it be a hard thing but perhaps the hardest part of it be that lesbium seem so very well able to get on without she the girl write in the highest spirit and although she letter be most affectionately word they be all about self that note be dominant in every strain she triumph she admirer she bonnet she gown she have have more money from she grandmother and more gown from paris ` you have no idea how the people dress in this place ' she write ' i should have be quite out in the cold without my three new frock from worth the little princess bonnet i wear be the rage worth recommend I to adopt special flower and color so i have worn nothing but primrose since i have be here and my little primrose bonnet be to be see everywhere sometimes on hideous old woman lady kirkbank hope you will be able to go to london directly after easter she say i must be present at the may drawing-room -- that be imperative people have begin to talk about I and unless i make my _ début _ while they interest be fresh i shall be a failure there be a american beauty here and i believe she and i be consider rival and young man lay wager about we as to which will look best at a ball or a regatta what color we shall wear and so on it be immense fun i only wish you be here to enjoy it the american girl be a most insolent person but i have have the pleasure of crush she on several occasion in the calmest way in the description of the concert in last week 's newspaper i be call _ l'anglais de marbre _ i certainly have the decency to hold my tongue while faure be singing miss bolsover 's voice be hear ever so many time above the music accord to we english idea she have most revolting manners and the money she spend on she clothes would make you hair stand on end now do dearest grandmother make all you arrangement for begin the campaign directly after easter you must take a house in the very choicest quarter -- lady kirkbank suggest grosvenor-place -- and it _ must _ be a large house for of course you will give a ball lady k say we might have

have it for a song will you get steadman to write to he lordship 's steward and see what can be do ' i hope the dear hand be better you have never tell I how you hurt it it be very sweet of mary to write I such long letter and quite a pleasant surprise to find she can spell but i want to see you own dear hand once more ' chapter xviii ` and come agen be it by night or day ' those winter month be unutterably dreary for lady mary haselden she feel weigh down by a sense of death and woe near at hand the horror of that dreadful moment in which she find she grandmother lie senseless on the ground the terror of that distorted countenance those start eye that stertorous breathing be not easily banish from a vivid girlish imagination see how few distraction there be to divert mary 's thought and how the sun sink and rise again upon the same inevitable surroundings to the same monotonous routine she grandmother be kinder than she have be in day go by less inclined to find fault but mary know that she society give lady maulevrier very little pleasure that she could do hardly anything towards fill the gap make by lesbium 's absence there be no one to scold she no one to quarrel with she fräulein müller lecture she mildly from time to time but that stout german be too lazy to put any force or fire into she lecture she reproof be like the fall of waterdrop on a stone and infinite age would have be need to cause any positive impression February come to a end without sign or token from the outer world to disturb the even tenor of life at fellside mary read and read and read till she feel she be make up of the contents of book cram with other people 's idea she read history or natural science or travels or german poetry in the morning and novel or english poetry in the evening she have pledge herself to devote she morning indoor hour to instructive literature and to accomplish some portion of study in every day she be carry on she education on parole as before state and she be too honorable to do less than be expect from she march come in with its most leonine aspect howl and bluster north-east wind shriek along the gorge and wail from height to height ' i wonder the lion and the lamb be not blow into the lake ' say mary look at helm crag from the library window she scamper about the garden in the very tooth of those bitter blast and take she shiver terrier for run on the green slope of the fall the snow have gradually melt from the tide of the lowermost range of hill but the mountain peak be still white and ghostly the ground be still hard and slippery in the early morning mary have to take she walk alone in this bleak weather fräulein have a convenient bronchial affection which forbid she to venture so much as the point of she nose outside the house in a east wind and which justify she in occasionally take she breakfast in bed she spend she day for the most part in she arm-chair draw close to the fireplace which she still insist upon call the oven knit diligently or read the _ rundschau _ even music which have once be she strong point be neglect in this try weather it be such a cold journey from the oven to the piano mary play a good deal in she desultory manner now that she have the drawing-room all to herself and no fear of lady maulevrier 's critical ear or lesbium 's superior smile the fräulein be please to hear she pupil ramble on with she favorite bit from raff and hensel and schubert and mendelssohn and mozart and be very well content to let she play just what she like and to escape the trouble of train she to that exquisite perfection into which lady lesbium have be drill lesbium be not a genius and the training process have be quite as hard for the governess as for the pupil thus the slow day wear on till the first week in march and on one bleak bitter afternoon when fräulein müller stick to the oven even a little closer than usual mary feel she must go out in the face of the east wind which be toss the leafless branch in the valley below until the tree look like a angry crowd hurl its arm in the air fighting struggle writhe she must leave that dreary house for a little while be it even to be lash and bruise and break by that fierce wind so she tell fräulein that she really must have she constitutional and after a feeble remonstrance fräulein let she go and subside luxuriously into the pillowed depth of she arm-chair there have be a hard frost and all the mountain way be perilous so mary set out upon a steady tramp along the road lead towards the langdale the wind seem to assail she from every side but she have accustom herself to defy the element and she only hug she sealskin jacket closer to she and quicken she pace chirrup and whistle to ahab and ariadne the two fox-terrier which she have select for the privilege of a walk the terrier race along the road and mary see that she have the road all to herself race after they a light snow-shower large feathery flake fly wide apart fall from the steel-grey sky but mary mind the snow no more than she mind the wind she race on the terrier scamper rush fly before she until just where the road take a curve she almost run into a horse which be step along at a tremendous pace with a light high dogcart behind he ` hi ' cry the driver ` where be you come young woman have you never see a horse till to-day ' some one beside the driver leap out and run to see if mary be hurt the horse have swerve to one side rear a little and then spin on for a few yard leave she standing in the middle of the road ` why it be molly ' cry the driver who be no less distinguish a whip than lord maulevrier and who have recognize the terrier ' i hope you be not hurt ' say the gentleman who have alight maulevrier 's friend and shadow john hammond mary be cover with confusion by she exploit and could hardly answer mr hammond 's very simple question she look up at he piteously try to speak and he take alarm at she scared expression ' i be sure you be hurt ' he say earnestly ` the horse must have strike you or the shaft perhaps which be worse be it you shoulder that be hurt or you chest lean on I if you feel faint or giddy maulevrier you have better drive you sister home and get she look after ' ` indeed i be not hurt not the least little bit ' gasp mary who have recover she sens by this time ' i be only frightened and it be such a surprise to see you and maulevrier ' a surprise -- yes -- a surprise which have set she heart throb so violently as to render she speechless have horse or shaft-point strike she ever so she would have hardly be more tremulous than she feel at this moment never have she hope to see he again he have set he all upon one cast -- love woo and lose she sister why should he ever come again what be there at fellside worth come for and then she remember what she grandmother thought of he he be a hanger-on a sponge a lead captain he be maulevrier 's umbra and must go where he patron go it be a hard thing so to think of he and mary 's heart sink at the think that lady maulevrier 's worldly wisdom might have reckon aright ` it be very foolish of I to run into the horse ' say mary while mr hammond stand wait for she to recover herself ` it be very foolish of maulevrier to run into you if he do not drive at such a break-neck pace it would not have happen ' umbra be very plain-spoken at any rate ` there be rank ingratitude ' cry maulevrier who have turn back and be look down at they from he elevated perch ` after my come all the way round by langdale to oblige you with a view of elterwater molly 's all safe and sound she would not have mind if i would run over she come along child get up beside I hammond will take the back seat ' this be easier say than do for the back of the dogcart be pile with gladstone bag fishing rod and hat-box but umbra be ready to oblige he hand mary up to the seat by the driver and clamber up at the back when he hook himself on somehow among the luggage ` dear maulevrier how delicious of you to come ' say mary when they be rattle on towards fellside ' i hope you be go to stay for age ' ` well i dare say if you make yourself very agreeable i may stay till after easter ' mary 's countenance fall ` easter be in three week ' she say despondingly ` and be not three week a age at such a place as fellside i do not know that i should have come at all on this side of the August sport only as the grandmother be ill i think it a duty to come and see she a fellow may not care much for ancestor when they be well you know but when a poor old lady be down on she luck she people ought to look after she so here i be and as i know i should be mope to death here -- ' ` thank you for the compliment ' say mary ' i bring hammond along with I of course i know lesbium be safe out of the way ' add maulevrier in a undertone ` it be very oblige of mr hammond always to go where you wish ' return mary who could not help a bitter feeling when she remember she grandmother 's cruel suggestion ` have he no taste or inclination of he own ' ` yes he have plenty of they and much loftier taste than mine i can tell you but he be kind enough to let I hang on to he and to put up with my frivolity there never be two man more different than he and i be and i suppose that be why we get on so well together when we be in paris he be always up to he eye in serious work -- lecture public library workman 's syndicate mary anne the international -- heaven know what make himself master of the political situation in france while i be _ rigolant _ and _ chaloupant _ at the bal bullier ' it be generous of maulevrier to speak of he hanger-on thus and no doubt the society of a well-informed earnest young man be a great good for maulevrier a good far above the price of those pound shilling and penny which the earl might spend for he dependent 's benefit but when a girl of mary 's ardent temper have make a hero of a man it gall she to think that she hero 's dignity should be sacrifice he honor impeach be it by the merest tittle maulevrier make a good many inquiry about he grandmother and seem really full of kindness and sympathy but it be with a feeling of profound awe nay of involuntary reluctance and shrink that he presently enter she ladyship 's sitting-room usher in by mary who have be to she grandmother beforehand to announce the grandson 's arrival the young man have hardly ever be in a sick room before he half expect to see lady maulevrier in bed with a crowd of medicine bottle and a cut orange on a table by she side and a sick nurse of the ancient-crone species cower over the fire it be a infinite relief to he to find he grandmother lie on a sofa by the fire in she pretty morning room a little tea-table be draw close up to she sofa and she be take she afternoon tea it be rather painful to see she lifting she tea-cup slowly and carefully with she left hand but that be all the dark eye still flash with the old eagle glance the line of the lip be as proud and firm as ever all sign of contraction or distortion have pass away in hour of calm she ladyship 's beauty be unimpaired but with any strong emotion there come a convulsive working of the feature and the face be momentarily draw and distort as it have be at the time of the seizure maulevrier 's presence have not a unduly agitating effect on she ladyship she receive he with tranquil graciousness and thank he for he come ' i hope you have spend you winter profitably in pari ' she say ` there be a great deal to be learn there if you go into the right circle ' maulevrier tell she that he have find much to learn and that he have go into circle where almost everything be new to he whereupon he grandmother question he about certain noble family in the faubourg saint germain who have be know to she in she own day of power and whose movement she have observe from a distance since that time but here she find she grandson dark he have not happen to meet any of the people she speak about : the plain truth be that he have live altogether as a bohemian and have not use one of the letter of introduction that have be give to he ` you friend mr hammond be with you i be tell ' say lady maulevrier not altogether with delight ` yes i make he come but he be quite safe he will bolt like a shot at the least hint of lesbium 's return he do not want to meet that young lady again i can assure you ' ` pray do not talk in that injured tone mr hammond be a gentlemanlike person very well inform very agreeable i have never deny that but you could not expect I to allow my granddaughter to throw herself away upon the first adventurer who make she a offer ' ` hammond be not a adventurer ' ` very well i will not call he so if the term offend you but mr hammond be -- mr hammond and i can not allow lesbium to marry mr hammond or mr anybody and i be very sorry you have bring he here again there be mary a silly romantic girl i be very much afraid he have make a impression upon she she color absurdly when she talk of he and fly into a passion with I the other day when i venture to hint that he be not a rothschild and that he society must be expensive to you ' ` he society do not cost I anything hammond be the soul of independence he work as a blacksmith in canada for three month just to see what life be like in a wild district there never be such a fellow to rough it and as for molly well now really if he happen to take a fancy to she and if she happen to like he i would not bosh the business if i be you grandmother take my word for it molly might do worse ' ` of course she might marry a chimney sweep there be no answering for a girl of she erratic nature she be silly enough and romantic enough for anything but i shall not countenance she if she want to throw herself away on a person without prospects or connection and i look to you maulevrier to take care of she now that i be a wretched log chained to this room ' ` you may rely upon I grandmother molly shall come to no harm if i can help it ' ` thank you ' say she ladyship touch she bell twice the two clear silvery stroke be a summons for halcott the maid who appear immediately ` tell mr power to get he lordship 's room ready immediately and to give mr hammond the room he have last summer ' say lady maulevrier with a sigh of resignation while maulevrier be with he grandmother john hammond be smoke a solitary cigar on the terrace contemplate the mountain landscape in its cold march greyness and wonder very much to find himself again at fellside he have go forth from that house full of passionate indignation shake off the dust from he foot sternly resolve never again to cross the threshold of that fateful cave where he have meet he cold-hearted circe and now because circe be safe out of the way he have come back to the cavern and he be feel all the pain that a man feel who behold again the scene of a great past sorrow be this the old love and the old pain again he wonder or be it only the sharp thrust of a bitter memory he have believe himself cure of he useless love -- a great and noble love waste on a smaller nature than he own he have think that because he eye be open and he understand the character of the girl he love he cure must need be complete yet now face to face with the well-remembered landscape look down upon that dull gray lake which he have see smile in the sunshine he begin to doubt the completeness of he cure he recall the lovely face the graceful form the sweet low voice -- the perfection of gracious womanhood manner dress movement tone smile all faultless and in the absence of that one figure it seem to he as if he have come back to a tenantless dismantle house where there be nothing that make life worth live the red sun go down -- a fierce and lurid face that seem to scowl through the gray -- and mr hammond feel that it be time to arouse himself from gloomy meditation and go in and dress for dinner maulevrier 's valet be to arrive by the coach with the heavier part of the luggage and maulevrier 's valet do that very small portion of valet which be ever require by mr hammond a man who have work at a forge in the backwoods be not likely to be finick in he way or dependent upon servant for look after he raiment despite mr hammond 's gloomy memory of past joy and disillusion he contrived to make himself very agreeable by-and-by at dinner and in the drawing-room after dinner and the evening be altogether gay and sprightly maulevrier be in high spirit full of he parisian experience and talk slang as glibly as a student of the quartier latin he would talk nothing but french protest that he have almost forget he native tongue and he french be the language of larchey 's dictionary of argot in which nothing be call by its right name mary be enchant with this new vocabulary and want to have every word explain to she but maulevrier confess that there be a good deal that be unexplainable the evening be much livelier than those summer evening when the dowager and lady lesbium be present there be something less of refinement perhaps and fräulein remonstrate now and then about some small violation of the unwritten law of ` anstand ' but there be more mirth maulevrier feel for the first time as if he be master at fellside they all go to the billiard room soon after dinner and fräulein and mary sit by the fire look on while the two young man play in such a evening there be no time for bitter memory : and john hammond be surprise to find how little he have miss that enchantress whose absence have make the house seem desolate to he when he re-enter it he be tire with he journey and the vary emotion of the day for it be not without strong emotion that he have consent to return to fellside -- and he sleep soundly for the earlier part of the night but he have train himself long ago to do with a very moderate portion of sleep and he be up and dress while the dawn be still slowly creep along the edge of the hill he go quietly down to the hall take one of the bamboo from a collection of cane and mountain stick and set out upon a morning ramble over the snowy slope the snow shower of yesterday have only sprinkle the greensward upon the lower ground but in the upper region the winter snow still linger give a alpine character to the landscape john hammond be too experience a mountaineer to be deter by a little snow he go up silver howe and from the rugged breast of the mountain see the sun leap up from amidst a chaos of hill and crag in all he majesty while the gray mist of night slowly float up from the valley that have lie hide below they and grasmere lake sparkle and flash in the light of the newly-risen sun the church clock be striking eight as hammond come at a brisk pace down to the valley there be still a hour before breakfast so he take a circuitous path to fellside and descend upon the house from the fell as he have do that summer morning when he see jame steadman saunter about in he garden within about a quarter of a mile of lady maulevrier 's shrubbery mr hammond encounter a pedestrian who like himself be evidently take a constitutional ramble in the morning air but on a much less extend scale for this person do not look capable of go far afield he be a old man something under middle height but look as if he have once be taller for he shoulder be much bent and he head be sink on he chest he whole form look waste and shrunken and john hammond thought he have never see so old a man -- or at any rate any man who be so deeply marked with all the sign of extreme age and yet in the backwoods of america he have meet ancient settler who remember franklin and who have be boy when the battle of bunker 's hill be fresh in the memory of they father and mother the little old man be clothe in a thick gray overcoat of some shaggy kind of cloth which look like homespun he wear a feel hat and carry a thick oak stick and there be nothing in he appearance to indicate that he belong to any higher grade than that of the shepherd and guide with whom hammond have make himself familiar during he previous visit and yet there be something distinctive about the man hammond think something wild and uncanny which make he unlike any of those hale and hearty-looking dalesman on whom old age sate so lightly no john hammond could not fancy this man with he pallid countenance and pale crafty eye to be of the same race as those rugged and honest-looking descendant of the norseman perhaps it be the man 's exceed age for john hammond make up he mind that he must be a centenarian which give he so strange and unholy a air he have the aspect of a man who have be bury and bring back to life again so might look one of those indian fakir who have the power to suspend life by some mysterious process and to lie in the darkness of the grave for a give period and then at they own will to resume the function of the live he long white hair fall upon the collar of he gray coat and would have give he a patriarchal appearance have the face possess the dignity of age : but it be a countenance without dignity a face deeply score with the line of evil passion and guilty memory -- the face of the vulture with a touch of the ferret -- altogether a most unpleasant face mr hammond thought and yet there be a kind of fascination about that bent and shrunken figure those feeble movement and shuffling gait john hammond turn to look after the old man when he have pass he and stand to watch he as he go slowly up the fell plant he crutch stick upon the ground before every footstep as if it be a third leg and more serviceable than either of the other two mr hammond watch he for two or three minute but as the old man 's movement have a automatic regularity the occupation soon pall and he turn and walk toward fellside a few yard nearer the grounds he meet jame steadman walk briskly and smoke he morning pipe ` you be out early this morning ' say hammond by way of civility ' i be always pretty early sir i like a mouthful of morning air ' ` so do i by-the-bye can you tell I anything about a queer-looking old man i pass just now a little higher up the fell such a old old man with long white hair ' ` yes sir i believe i know he ' ` who be he do he live in grasmere ' steadman look puzzle ` well you see sir you description might apply to a good many but if it be the man i think you mean he live in one of the cottage behind the church old barlow they call he ' ` there can not be two such man -- he must be at least a century old if any one tell I he be a hundred and twenty i should not be incline to doubt the fact i never see such a shrivel wrinkled visage bloodless too as if the poor old wretch never feel you fresh mountain air upon he hollow cheek a dreadful face it will haunt I for a month ' ` it must be old barlow ' reply steadman ` good day sir ' he walk on with he swing step and at such a pace that he be up the side of the fell and close upon old barlow 's heel when hammond turn to look after he five minute later ` there be a man who show few trace of age at any rate ' thought hammond ` yet she ladyship tell I that he be over seventy ' chapter xix the old man on the fell have make up he mind to stay at fellside until after easter maulevrier settle down very quietly -- for he he ride a good deal fish a little look after he dog play billiards make a devout appearance in the big square pew at st oswald 's on Sunday morning and behave altogether as a reform character even he grandmother be fain to admit that maulevrier be improve and that mr hammond 's influence upon he must be exercise for good and not for evil ' i plunge awfully last year and the year before that ' say maulevrier sit at tea in she ladyship 's morning room one afternoon about a week after he return when she have express she gracious desire that the two young man should take tea with she mary be in charge of the tea-pot and brass kettle and look as radiant and as fresh as a summer morning a regular gainsborough girl hammond call she when he praise she to she brother a true english beauty unsophisticate a little rustic but full of youthful sweetness ` you see i do not know what a racing stable mean ' continue maulevrier mildly apologetic -- ` in fact i think it be a easy way for a nobleman to make as good a living as you city swell with they soft goods or they brummagem ware a respectable trade for a gentleman to engage in and it be only when i be half ruin that i begin to understand the business and as soon as i do understand it i make up my mind to get out of it and i be happy to say that i sell the very last of my stud in February and tony lumpkin be he own man again so you may welcome the prodigal grandson and order the fat calf to be slay grandmother ' lady maulevrier stretch out she left hand to he and the young man bent over it and kiss it affectionately he feel really touch by she misfortune and be fonder of she than he have ever be before she have be somewhat hard with he in he boyhood but she have always care for he dignity and protect he interest : and after all she be a noble old woman a grandmother of whom a man might be justly proud he think of the paint harridan the bare-shouldered skeleton whom some of he young friend be oblige to own in the same capacity and he be thankful that he could reverence he father 's mother ` that be the best news i have hear for a long time maulevrier ' say she ladyship graciously ` better medicine for my nerve than any of mr horton 's preparation if mr hammond 's advice have influence you to get rid of you stable i be deeply grateful to mr hammond ' hammond smile as he sip he tea sit close to mary 's tray ready to fly to she assistance on the instant should the brazen kettle become troublesome it have a threatening way of hiss and bubble over its spirit lamp ` oh you have no idea what a fellow hammond be to lecture ' answer maulevrier ` he be a tremendous radical and he think that every young man in my position ought to be a reformer and devote the greater part of he time and trouble to turn out the dirty corner of the world upset those poor dear family who like to pig together in one room order all the child off to school marry the father and mother thrust himself between free labor and free beer and interfere with the liberty of the subject in every direction ' ` all that may sound like radicalism but i think it be the true conservatism and that every young man ought to do as much if he want this timeworn old country to maintain its power and prosperity ' answer lady maulevrier with a approve glance at john hammond 's thoughtful face ` right you be grandmother ' return maulevrier ` and i believe hammond call himself a conservative and mean to vote with the conservative ' means to vote a idle phrase surely think she ladyship where the young man 's chance of get into parliament be so remote that afternoon tea in lady maulevrier 's room be almost as cheerful as the tea-drinking in the drawing-room unrestrained by she ladyship 's presence she be please with she grandson 's conduct and be therefore incline to be friendly to he friend she could see a improvement in mary too the girl be more feminine more subdue graver sweeter more like that ideal woman of wordsworth 's whose image embody all that be purest and fairest in womanhood mary have not forget that unlucky story about the fox-hunt and ever since hammond 's return she have be as it be on she best behavior refrain from she race with the terrier and hold herself aloof from maulevrier 's masculine pursuit she sheltered herself a good deal under the fräulein 's substantial wing and take care never to intrude herself upon the amusement of she brother and he friend she be not one of those young woman who think a brother 's presence a excuse for a perpetual _ tête-à-tête _ with a young man yet when maulevrier come in quest of she and entreat she to join they in a ramble she be not too prudish to refuse the pleasure she so thoroughly enjoy but afternoon tea be she privileged hour -- the time at which she wear she prettiest frock and forget to regret she inferiority to lesbium in all the grace of womanhood one afternoon when they have all three walk to easedale tarn and be come back by the side of the force pick they way among the gray stone and the narrow thread of silvery water it suddenly occur to hammond to ask mary about that queer old man he have see on the fall nearly a fortnight before he have often think of make the inquiry when he be away from mary but have always forget the thing when he be with she indeed mary have a wonderful knack of make he forget everything but herself ` you seem to know every creature in grasmere down to the two-year-old baby ' say hammond mary have just stop to converse with a infantine group straggling and struggle over the boulder ` pray do you happen to know a man call barlow a very old man ' ` old sam barlow ' exclaim mary ` why of course i know he ' she say it as if he be a near relative and the question palpably absurd ` he be a old man a hundred at least i should think ' say hammond ` poor old sam not much on the wrong side of eighty i go to see he every week and take he he week 's tobacco poor old dear it be he only comfort ' ` be it ' ask hammond ' i should have doubt he have so humanise a taste as tobacco he look too evil a creature ever to have yield to the softening influence of a pipe ' ` a evil creature what old sam why he be the most genial old thing and as cheery -- love to hear the newspaper read to he -- the murder and railway accident he do not care for politics everybody like old sam barlow ' ' i fancy the grasmere idea of reverend and amiable age must be strictly local i can only say that i never see a more unholy countenance ' ` you must have be dream when you see he ' say mary ` where do you meet he ' ` on the fell about a quarter of a mile from the shrubbery gate ' ' _ do _ you i should not have think he could have get so far i have a good mind to take you to see he this very afternoon before we go home ' ` do ' exclaim hammond ' i should like it immensely i think he a hateful-looking old person but there be something so thoroughly uncanny about he that he exercise a absolute fascination upon I : he magnetise I i think as the green-eyed cat magnetise the bird i have be positively longing to see he again he be a kind of human monster and i hope some one will have a big bottle make ready for he and preserve he in spirit when he die ' ` what a horrid idea no sir dear old barlow shall lie beside the rotha under the tree wordsworth plant he be such a man as wordsworth would have love ' mr hammond shrug he shoulder and say no more mary 's little vehement way she enthusiasm she love of that valley which might be call she native place albeit she eye have open upon heaven 's light far away she humility be all very delightful in they way she be not a perfect beauty like lesbium but she be a fresh pure-minded english girl frank as the day and if he have have a brother he would have recommend that brother to choose just such a girl for he wife mr samuel barlow occupy a little old cottage which seem to consist chiefly of a gable end and a chimney stack in that cluster of dwelling behind st oswald 's church which be once know as the kirk town visitor go downstairs to get to mr barlow 's ground-floor for the influence of time and advance civilisation have raise the pathway in front of mr barlow 's cottage until he parlor have become of a cellar-like aspect yet it be a very nice little parlor when one get down to it and it enjoy winter and summer a perpetual twilight since the light that creep through the lead casement be temper by a screen of flowerpot which be old barlow 's particular care there be no finer geranium in all grasmere than barlow 's no bigger carnation or picotee aster or arum it be about five o'clock in the march afternoon when mary usher john hammond into mr barlow 's dwelling and in the dim glow of a cheery little fire and the faint light that filter through the screen of geranium leave the visitor look for a moment or so doubtfully at the owner of the cottage but only for a moment those bright blue eye and apple cheek that benevolent expression bear no likeness to the strange old man he have see on the fell mr barlow be toothless and nut-cracker like of outline he be thin and shrunken and bent with the burden of long year but he healthy visage have none of those deep line those cross marking and hollow which make the pallid countenance of that other old man as ghastly as would be the abstract idea of life 's last stage embody by the bitter pencil of a hogarth ' i have bring a gentleman from london to see you sam ' say mary ` he fancy he meet you on the fall the other morning ' barlow rise and quaver a cheery welcome but protest against the idea of he have get so far as the fell ` with my bless rheumatic you know it be not in I lady mary i shall never get no further than the churchyard but i like to sit on the wall hard by wordsworth 's tomb in a warm afternoon and to see the folk pass over the bridge and i can potter about look after my flower i can but it would be a dull life now the poor old missus be go and the bairn all out at service if it be not for some one drop in to have a chat or read I a bit of the news sometimes and there be not anybody in grasmere gentle or simple that be kinder to I than you lady mary lord bless you i do look forward to my newspaper any more of they dreadful smash ' ` no sam thank heaven there have be no railway accident ' ` ah we shall have 'em in August and September ' say the old man cheerily ` they be bind to come then there be a time for all thing as solomon say when the season come t ` smash all coom and no more of these mysterious murder i suppose which baffle t ` police and keep I awake o ' night think of 'em ' ` surely you do not take delight in murder mr barlow ' say hammond ` no sir i do not wish my fellow-creature to mak ' awa ' wus ' each other but if there be a murder go in the papers i like to get the benefit of it i like to sit in front of my fire of a evening and wonder about it while i smoke my pipe and fancy i can see the murderer hiding in a garret in a out-of-the-way alley or as a stowaway on board a gert ship or as a miner deep down in a coalpit and never think that even there t ` police can track he do you ever hear tell o ' mr de quincey sir ' ' i believe i have read every line he ever write ' ` ah you should have hear he talk about murder it would have make you dream queer dream just as he do he live for year in the white cottage that wordsworth once live in just behind the street yonder -- a nice neat lile gentleman in a houseful of book i have have many a talk with he when i be a young man ' ` and how old may you he now mr barlow ' ` get on for eighty four sir ' ` but you be not the oldest man in grasmere i should say by twenty year ' ' i do not think there be many much older than I sir ' ` the man i see on the fell look at least a hundred i wish you could tell I who he be i feel a morbid curiosity about he ' he go on to describe the old man in the gray coat as minutely as he could dwelling on every characteristic of that singular-looking old person but samuel barlow could not identify the description with any one in grasmere yet a man of that age see walk on the hill-side at eight in the morning could hardly have come from far afield chapter xx lady maulevrier 's letter-bag although maulevrier have assure he grandmother that john hammond would take flight at the first warning of lesbium 's return lady maulevrier 's dread of any meeting between she granddaughter and that ineligible lover determine she in make such arrangement as should banish lesbium from fellside so long as there seem the slightest danger of such a meeting she know that lesbium have love she fortuneless suitor and she do not know that the wound be cure even by a season in the little-great world of canne now that she the ruler of that household be a helpless captive in she own apartment she feel that lesbium at fellside would be she own mistress and hem round with the danger that beset richly-dowered beauty and inexperienced youth john hammond might be play a very deep game perhaps assist by maulevrier he might ostensibly leave fellside before lesbium 's return yet lurk in the neighborhood and contrive to meet she every day if maulevrier encourage this folly they might be marry and over the border before she ladyship -- fettered impotent as she be -- could interfere lady maulevrier feel that georgie kirkbank be she strong rock so long as lesbium be under that astute veteran 's wing there could be no danger in that embody essence of worldliness and diplomacy there be a ever-present defense from all temptation that spring from romance and youthful impulse it be a bitter thing perhaps to steep a young and pure soul in such a atmosphere to harden a fresh young nature in the fiery crucible of fashionable life but lady maulevrier believe that the end would sanctify the means lesbium once marry to a worthy man such a man as lord hartfield for instance would soon rise to a higher level than that belgravian swamp over which the malarian vapor of falsehood and slander and self-seeking and prurient imagining hang dense and thick she would rise to the loftier table-land of that really great world which govern and admonish the ruck of mankind by example of noble deed and noble thought the world of statesman and soldier and thinker and reformer the salt wherewithal society be salt but while lesbium be tread the tortuous maze of fashion it be well for she to be guide and guard by such a old campaigner as lady kirkbank a woman who in the language of she friend ` know the rope ' lesbium 's last letter have be to the effect that she be to go back to london with the kirkbank directly after easter and that directly they arrive she would set off with she maid for fellside to spend a week or a fortnight with she dearest grandmother before go back to arlington street for the may campaign ` and then dearest i hope you will make up you mind to spend the season in london ' write lesbium ' i shall expect to hear that you have secure lord porlock 's house how dreadfully slow you poor dear hand be to recover i be afraid horton be not treat the case cleverly why do you not send for mr erichsen it be a shock to my nerve every time i receive a letter in mary 's masculine hand instead of in you lovely italian penmanship strange -- be not it -- how much better the woman of you time write than the girl of the present day lady kirkbank receive letter from stylish girl in a hand that would disgrace a housemaid ' lady maulevrier allow a post to go by before she answer this letter while she deliberate upon the best and wisest manner of arrange she granddaughter 's future it be a agony to she not to be able to write with she own hand to be oblige to so shape every sentence that mary might learn nothing which she ought not to know it be impossible with such a amanuensis to write confidentially to lady kirkbank the letter to lesbium be of less consequence for lesbium albeit so intensely beloved be not in she grandmother 's confidence least of all about those scheme and dream which concern she own fate however the letter have to be write so mary be tell to open she desk and begin the letter to lesbium run thus : -- ` my dearest child ` this be a world in which we brightest day-dream generally end in mere dream for year past i have cherish the hope of present you to you sovereign to whom i be present six and forty year ago when she be so fair and girlish a creature that she seem to I more like a queen in a fairy tale than the actual ruler of a great country i have beguile my monotonous day with thought of the time when i should return to the great world full of pride and delight in show old friend what a sweet flower i have rear in my mountain home but alas lesbia it may not be ` fate have will otherwise the maim hand do not recover although horton be very clever and thoroughly understand my case i be not ill i be not in danger so you need feel no anxiety about I but i be a cripple and i be likely to remain a cripple for month so the idea of a london season this year be hopeless ` now as you have in a manner make you _ début _ at canne it would never do to bury you here for another year you complain of the dullness last summer but you would find fellside much duller now that you have taste the elixir of life no my dear love it will be well for you to be present as lady kirkbank propose at the first drawing-room after easter and lady kirkbank will have to present you she will be please to do this i know for she letter be full of enthusiasm about you and after all i do not think you will lose by the exchange clever as i think myself i fear i should find myself sorely at fault in the society of to-day all thing be change : opinion manners creed moral even act that be crime in my day be now venial error -- opinion that be scandalous be now the mark of advanced thought i should be too formal for this easy-going age should be ridicule as old-fashioned and narrow-minded should put you to the blush a dozen time a day by my prejudice and opinion ` it be very good of you to think of travel so long a distance to see I and i should love to look at you sweet face and hear you describe you new experience but i could not allow you to travel with only the protection of a maid and there be many reason why i think it better to defer the meeting till the end of the season when lady kirkbank will bring my treasure back to I eager to tell I the history of all the heart she have break ' the dowager 's letter to lady kirkbank be brief and business-like she could only hope that she old friend georgie whose acuteness she know of old would divine she feeling and she wish without be explicitly tell what they be ` my dear georgie ' i be too ill to leave this house indeed i doubt if i shall ever leave it till i be take away in my coffin but please say nothing to alarm lesbium indeed there be no ground for fear as i be not dangerously ill and may drag out a imprisonment of long year before the coffin come to fetch I there be reason which you will understand why lesbium should not come here till after the season so please keep she in arlington street and occupy she mind as much as you can with the preparation for she first campaign i give you _ carte blanche _ if carson be still in business i should like she to make my girl 's gown but you must please yourself in this matter as it be quite possible that carson be a little behind the time ' i must ask you to present my darling and to deal with she exactly as if she be a daughter of you own i think you know all my view and hope about she and i feel that i can trust to you friendship in this my day of need the dream of my life have be to launch she myself and direct she every step in the maze of town life but that dream be over i have keep age and infirmity at a distance have even forget that the year be go by and now i find myself a old woman all at once and my golden dream have vanish ' lady kirkbank 's reply come by return of post and happily this gush epistle have not to be submit to mary 's eye ` my dearest di ` my heart positively bleed for you what be the matter with you hand that you talk of be a life-long prisoner to you room pray send for paget or erichsen and have yourself put right at once no doubt that local simpleton be make a mess of you case perhaps while he be dab with lint and lotion the real remedy be the knife i be sure amputation would be less melancholy than the despondent state of feeling which you be now suffer if any limb of mine go wrong i should say to the surgeon cut it off and patch up the stump in you best style i give you a fortnight and at the end of that time i expect to be go to party again life be not long enough for dawdle surgery ` as regard lesbium i can only say that i adore she and i be enchant at the idea that i be to run she myself i intend she to be _ the _ beauty of the season -- not _ one of the loveliest debutante _ or any rot of that kind -- but just the girl whom everybody will be crazy about there shall be a mob wherever she appear di i promise you that there be no one in london who can work a thing of that kind better than you humble servant and when once the girl be the talk of the town all the rest be easy she can choose for herself among the very best man in society offer will pour in as thickly as circular from undertaker and mourning warehouse after a death ` lesbium be so cool-headed and sensible that i have not the least doubt of she success with a impulsive or romantic girl there be always the fear of a _ fiasco _ but this sweet child of yours have be well bring up and know she own value she behave like a queen here where i need not tell you society be just a little mixed though of course we only cultivate we own set you heart would swell with pride if you could see the way she put down man who be not quite good style and the ease with which she crush those odious american girl with they fine complexion and loud manners ` be assure that i shall guard she as the apple of my eye and that the detrimental who circumvent I will be a very satan of schemer ' i can but smile at you mention of carson whose gown use to fit we so well in we girlish day and whose bill seem moderate compare with the exorbitant account i get now ` carson have long be forget my dear soul go with the snow of last year a long procession of fashionable french dressmaker have pass across the stage since she time like the phantom king in macbeth and now the last rage be to have we gown make by a englishman who work for the princess and who give himself most insufferable air or a irishwoman who be employ by all the best actress it be to the latter kate kearney i shall entrust we sweet lesbium 's toilette ' the same post bring a loving letter from lesbium full of regret at not be allow to go down to fellside and yet full of delight at the prospect of she first season ` lady kirkbank and i have be discuss my court dress ' she write ` and we have decide upon a white cut-velvet train with a border of ostrich feather over a satin petticoat embroider with seed pearl it will be expensive but we know you will not mind that lady kirkbank take the idea from the costume buckingham wear at the louvre the first time he meet anne of austrium be not that clever of she she be not a deep thinker like you be horribly ignorant of science metaphysics poetry even she ask I one day who plato be and whether he take he name from the battle of platoea and she say she never could understand why people make a fuss about shakespeare but she have read all the secret history and memoirs that ever be write and know all the in and out of court life and high life for the last three hundred year and there be not a person in the peerage whose family history she have not at she finger ' end except my grandfather when i ask she to tell I all about lord maulevrier and he achievement as governor of madras she have not a word to say so perhaps she draw upon she invention a little in talk about other people and feel herself restrain when she come to speak of my grandfather ' this passage in lesbium 's letter affect lady maulevrier as if a scorpion have wriggle from underneath the sheet of paper she fold the letter and lay it in the satin-lined box on she table with a deep sigh ` yes she be in the world now and she will ask question i have never warn she against pronounce she grandfather 's name there be some who will not be so kind as georgie kirkbank some perhaps who will delight in humiliating she and who will tell she the worst that can be tell my only hope be that she will make a great marriage and speedily once the wife of a man with a high place in the world worldling will be too wise to wind she by tell she that she grandfather be a unconvicted felon ' the die be cast lady maulevrier might dread the hazard of evil tongue of slanderous memory but she could not recall she consent to lesbium 's _ début _ the girl be already launch she have be see and admire the next stage in she career must be to be woo and win by a worthy wooer chapter xxi on the dark brow of helvellyn while these plan be be settle and while lesbium 's future be the all-absorbing subject of lady maulevrier 's thought mary contrived to be happier than she have ever be in she life before it be happiness that grow and strengthen with every day and yet there be no obvious reason for this deep joy she life run in the same familiar groove she walk and ride on the old pathway she row on the lake she have know from babyhood she visit she cottager and teach in the village school just the same as of old the change be only that she be no longer alone and of late the solitude of she life the ever-present consciousness that nobody share she pleasure or sympathise with she upon any point have weigh upon she like a actual burden now she have maulevrier who be always kind who understand and share almost all she taste and maulevrier 's friend who although not give to say smooth thing seem warmly interested in she pursuit and opinion he encourage she to talk although he generally take the opposite side in every argument and she no longer feel oppressed or irritated by the idea that he despise she indeed although he never flatter or even praise she mr hammond let she see that he like she society she have go out of she way to avoid he very fearful lest he should think she bold or masculine but he have take pain to frustrate all she effort in that direction he have refuse to go upon excursion which she could not share ` lady mary must come with we ' he say when they be plan a morning 's ramble thus it happen that mary be he guide and companion in all he walk and roam with he bamboo in hand over every one of those mountainous path she know and love so well distance be as nothing to they -- sometimes a boat help they and they go over wintry windermere to climb the picturesque height above bowness sometimes they take pony and a groom and leave they steed to perform the wilder part of the way on foot in this wise john hammond saw all that be to be see within a day 's journey of grasmere except the top of helvellyn maulevrier have shirk the expedition have always put off mary and mr hammond when they propose it the season be not advance enough -- the rugged pathway by the tongue ghyll would be as slippery as glass -- no pony could get up there in such weather ` we have not have any frost to speak of for the last fortnight ' plead mary who be particularly anxious to do the honor of helvellyn as the real lion of the neighborhood ` what a simpleton you be molly ' cry maulevrier ` do you suppose because there be no frost in you grandmother 's garden -- and if you be to ask staple about he peach he would tell you a very different story -- that there be a tropical atmosphere on dolly waggon pike why i would wager the ice on grisdale tarn be thick enough for skate helvellyn will not run away child you and hammond can dance the highland schottische on stride edge in June if you like ' ` mr hammond will not be here in June ' say mary ` who know -- the train service be pretty fair between london and windermere hammond and i would think nothing of put ourselves in the mail on a Friday night and come down to spend Saturday and Sunday with you -- if you be good ' there come a sunny morning soon after easter which seem mild enough for June and when hammond suggest that this be the very day for helvellyn maulevrier have not a word to say against the truth of that proposition the weather have be exceptionally warm for the last week and they have play tennis and sit in the garden just as if it have be actually summer patch of snow might still linger on the crest of the hill -- but the approach to those bleak height could hardly be glacial mary clasp she hand delightedly ` dear old maulevrier ' she exclaim ` you be always good to I and now i shall be able to show you the red tarn the highest pool of water in england ' she say turn to hammond ` and you will see windermere wind like a silvery serpent between the hill and grasmere shine like a jewel in the depth of the valley and the sea glitter like a line of white light between the edge of earth and heaven and the dark scotch hill like couchant lion far away to the north ' ` that be to say these thing be all suppose to be on view from the top of the mountain but as a peculiar and altogether exceptional state of the atmosphere be essential to they be see i need not tell you that they be rarely visible ' say maulevrier ` you be talk to old mountaineer molly hammond have do cotapaxus and have he little clamber on the equatorial ande and i -- well child i have do my righus and i have always find the boast panorama envelop in dense fog ' ` it will not be foggy to-day ' say mary ` shall we do the whole thing on foot or shall i order the pony ' mr hammond inquire the distance up and down and be tell that it involve only a matter of eight mile decide upon walk ` i 'll walk and lead you pony ' he say to mary but mary declare herself quite capable of go on foot so the pony be dispense with as a possible encumbrance this be plan and discuss in the garden before breakfast fräulein be tell that mary be go for a long walk with she brother and mr hammond a walk which might last over the usual luncheon hour so fräulein be not to wait luncheon mary go to she grandmother 's room to pay she duty visit there be no letter for she to write that morning so she be perfectly free the three pedestrian start a hour after breakfast in light march order the two young man wear they argyleshire shooting clothes -- homespun knickerbockers and jacket thick-ribbed hose knit by highland lass in inverness they carry a couple of hunting flask fill with claret and a couple of sandwich box and that be all mary wear she substantial tailor-gown of olive tweed and a little toque to match with a silver mount grouse-claw for she only ornament it be a delicious morning the air fresh and sweet the sun comfortably warm a little too warm perhaps presently when they have trodden the narrow path by the tongue ghyll and be begin to wind slowly upwards over rough boulder and last year 's bracken tough and brown and tangled towards that rugged wall of earth and stone tuft with rank grass which call itself dolly waggon pike here they all come to a stand-still and wipe the dew of honest labor from they forehead and here maulevrier fling himself down upon a big boulder with the sole of he stout shooting boot in run water and take out he cigar case ` how do you like it ' he ask he friend when he have light he cigarette ' i hope you be enjoy yourself ' ' i never be happier in my life ' answer hammond he be stand on higher ground with mary at he elbow point out and expatiate upon the detail of the prospect there be the lake -- grasmere a disk of shine blue rydal a patch of silver and windermere wind amidst a labyrinth of wooded hill ` be not you tire ' ask maulevrier ` not a whit ' ` oh i forget you have do cotapaxus or as much of cotapaxus as live mortal ever have do that make a difference i be go home ' ` oh maulevrier ' exclaim mary piteously ' i be go home you two can go to the top you be both hardened mountaineer and i be not in it with either of you when i rashly consent to a pedestrian ascent of helvellyn i have forget what the gentleman be like and as to dolly waggon i have actually forget she existence but now i see the lady -- as steep as the side of a house and as stony -- no naught but herself can be she parallel in stoniness no molly i will go no further ' ` but we shall go down on the other side ' urge mary ` it be a little steeper on the cumberland side but not nearly so far ' ' a little steeper i can anything be steeper than dolly waggon yes you be right it be steeper on the cumberland side i remember come down a sheer descent like a exaggerated sugar-loaf but i be on a pony and it be the brute 's look-out i will not go down the cumberland side on my own leg no molly not even for you but if you and hammond want to go to the top there be nothing to prevent you he be a skilled mountaineer i 'll trust you with he ' mary blush and make no reply of all thing in the world she least want to abandon the expedition yet to climb helvellyn alone with she brother 's friend would no doubt be a terrible violation of those law of maidenly propriety which fräulein be always expound if mary be to do this thing which she long to do she must hazard a lecture from she governess and probably a bite reproof from she grandmother ` will you trust yourself with I lady mary ' ask hammond look at she with a gaze so earnest -- so much more earnest than the occasion require -- that she blush deepen and she eyelid fall ' i have do a good deal of climb in my day and i be not afraid of anything helvellyn can do to I i promise to take great care of you if you will come ' how could she refuse how could she for one moment pretend that she do not trust he that she heart do not yearn to go with he she would have climb the shingly steep of cotapaxus with he -- or cross the great sahara with he -- and fear nothing she trust in he be infinite -- as infinite as she reverence and love ' i be afraid fräulein would make a fuss ' she falter after a pause ` hang fräulein ' cry maulevrier puffing at he cigarette and kick about the stone in the clear run water ` i 'll square it with fräulein i 'll give she a pint of fiz with she lunch and make she see everything in a rosy hue the good soul be fond of she heidseck you will be back by afternoon tea why should there be any fuss about the matter hammond want to see the red tarn and you be die to show he the way go and joy go with you both climb a stony hill be a form of pleasure to which i have not yet rise i shall stroll home at my leisure and spend the afternoon on the billiard-room sofa reading mudie 's last contribution to the comfort of home ' ` what a sybarite ' say hammond ` come lady mary we must not loiter if we be to be back at fellside by five o'clock ' mary look at she brother doubtfully and he give she a little nod which seem to say ` go by all means ' so she dig the end of she staff into dolly 's rugged breast and mount cheerily step lightly from boulder to boulder the sun be not so warm as it have be ten minute ago when maulevrier fling himself down to rest the sky have cloud over a little and a cooler wind be blow across the breast of the hill fairfield yonder that long smooth slope of verdure which a little while ago look emerald green in the sunlight now wear a soft and shadowy hue all the world be greyer and dimmer in a moment as it be and coniston lake in its distant valley disappear beneath a veil of mist while the shimmering sea-line upon the verge of the horizon melt and vanish among the cloud that overhang it the weather change very quickly in this part of the world sharp drop of rain come spit at hammond and mary as they climb the crest of the pike and stop somewhat breathless to look back at maulevrier he be trudge blithely down the wind way and seem to have do wonder while they have be do very little ` how fast he be go ' say mary ` easy be the descent of avernus he be go down-hill and we be go upward that make all the difference in life you see ' answer hammond mary look at he with divine compassion she think that for he the hill of life would be harder than helvellyn he be brave honest clever but she grandmother have impress upon she that modern civilisation hardly have room for a young man who want to get on in the world without either fortune or powerful connexion he have better go to australia and keep sheep than attempt the impossible at home the rain be a pass shower hardly worth speaking of but the glory of the day be over the sky be gray and there be dark cloud creep up from the sea-line silvery windermere have take a leaden hue and now they turn they last fond look upon the westmoreland valley and set they face steadily towards cumberland and the fine grassy plateau on the top of the hill all this be not do in a flash it take they some time to scale dolly 's stubborn breast and it take they another hour to reach seat sandal and by the time they come to the iron gate in the fence which at this point divide the two county the atmosphere have thicken ominously and dark wreath of fog be float about and around they whirl here and there by a boisterous wind which shriek and roar at they with savage fury as if it be the voice of some titan monarch of the mountain protest against this intrusion upon he domain ` i be afraid you will not see the scottish hill ' shout mary holding on she little cloth hat she be oblige to shout at the top of she voice though she be close to mr hammond 's elbow for that shrill scream wind would have drown the voice of a stentor ` never mind the view ' reply hammond in the same fortissimo ` but i really wish i have not bring you up here if this fog should get any worse it may be dangerous ' ` the fog be sure to get worse ' say mary in a brief lull of the hurly-burly ` but there be no danger i know every inch of the hill and i be not a bit afraid i can guide you if you will trust I ' ` my bravest of girl ' he exclaim look down at she ` trust you yes i would trust my life to you -- my soul -- my honor -- secure in you purity and good faith ' never have eye of live man or woman look down upon she with such tenderness such fervent love she look up at he look with eye which at first bewildered then grow bold and lose themselves as it be in the dark gray depths of the eye they meet the savage wind hustle and howl blow she nearer to he as a reed be blow against a rock dark gray mist be rise round they like a sea but have that ever-thickening ever-darkening vapor be the sea itself and death inevitable mary haselden would have hardly care for in this moment the one precious gift for which she soul have long be yearning have be freely give to she she know all at once that she be fondly love by that one man whom she have choose for she idol and she hero what matter that he be fortuneless a nobody with but the poorest chance of success in the world what if he must need only to win the bare means of existence go to australia and keep sheep or to the bed river valley and grow corn what if he must labor as the peasant labor on the side of this rude hill gladly would she go with he to a strange country and keep he log cabin and work for he and share he toilsome life rough or smooth no loss of social rank could lessen she pride in he she belief in he they be stand side by side a little way from the edge of the sheer descent below which the bed tarn show black in a basin scoop out of the naked hill like water hold in the hollow of a giant 's hand ` look ' cry mary point downward ` you must see the red tarn the highest water in england ' but just at this moment there come a blast which shake even hammond 's strong frame and with a cry of fear he snatch mary in he arm and carry she away from the edge of the hill he fold she in he arm and hold she there thirty yard away from the precipice safely sheltered against he breast while the wind rave round they blow she hair from the broad white brow and show he that noble forehead in all its power and beauty while the darkness deepen round they so that they could see hardly anything except each other 's eye ` my love my own dear love ' he murmur fondly ' i will trust you with my life will you accept the trust i be hardly worthy for less than a year ago i offer myself to you sister and i think she be the only woman in this wide world who could make I happy and when she refuse I i be in despair mary and i leave fellside in the full belief that i have do with life and happiness and then i come back only to oblige maulevrier and determine to be utterly miserable at fellside i be miserable for the first two hour memory of dead and go joy and disappointed hope be very bitter and i try honestly to keep up my feeling of wretchedness for the first few day but it be no use molly there be a genial spirit in the place a laughing fairy who would not let I be sad and i find myself become most unromantically happy eating my breakfast with a hearty appetite think my cup of afternoon tea nectar for love of the dear hand that give it and so and so till the new love the purer and better love grow and grow into a mighty tree which be as a oak to a orchid compare with that passion flower of earlier growth mary will you trust you life to I as i trust mine to you i say to you almost in the word i speak last year to lesbium ' and here he tone grow grave almost to solemnity ` trust I and i will make you life free from the shadow of care -- trust I for i have a brave spirit and a strong arm to fight the battle of life -- trust I and i will win for you the position you have a right to occupy -- trust I and you shall never repent you trust ' she look up at he with eye which tell of infinite faith child-like unquestioning faith ' i will trust you in all thing and for ever ' she say ' i be not afraid to face evil fortune i do not care how poor you be -- how hard we life may be -- if -- if you be sure you love I ' ` sure there be not a beat of my heart or a thought of my mind that do not belong to you i be yours to the very depths of my soul my innocent love my clear-eyed clear-souled angel i have study you and watch you and thought of you and sound the depths of you lovely nature and the result be that you be for I earth 's one woman i will have no other mary no other love no other wife ' ` lady maulevrier will be dreadfully angry ' falter mary ` be you afraid of she anger ' ` no i be afraid of nothing for you sake ' he lift she hand to he lip and kiss it reverently and there be a touch of chivalry in that reverential kiss he eye cloud with tear as he look down into the trustful face the fog have darken to a denser blackness and it be almost as if they be engulf in sudden night ` if we be never to find we way down the hill if this be to be the last hour of we life mary would you be content ' ` quite content ' she answer simply ' i think i have live long enough if you really love I -- if you be not make fun ' ` what molly do you still doubt be it strange that i love you ' ` very strange i be so different from lesbium ' ` yes very different and the difference be you highest charm and now love we have better go down whichever side of the hill be easiest for this fog be rather appalling i forgive the wind because it blow you against my heart just now and that be where i want you to dwell for ever ' ` do not be frighten ' say mary ' i know every step of the way ' so lean on she lover and yet guide he slowly step by step grope they way through the darkness lady mary lead mr hammond down the wind track along which the pony and the guide travel so often in the summer season and soon they begin to descend out of that canopy of fog which envelop the brow of helvellyn and to see the whole world smile beneath they a world of green pasture and sheepfold with a white homestead here and there amidst the field look so human and so comfortable after that gloomy mountain top round which the tempest howl so outrageously beyond those pasture stretch the dark water of thirlmere look like a broad river the descent be pass steep but hammond 's strong arm and steady step make mary 's progress very easy while she have in no wise exaggerate she familiarity with the winding and twisting of the track yet as they have need to travel very slowly so long as the fog still surround they the journey downward last a considerable time and it be past five when they arrive at the little roadside inn at the foot of the hill here mr hammond insist that mary should rest at least long enough to take a cup of tea she be very white and tired she have be profoundly agitate and look on the point of faint although she protest that she be quite ready to walk on ` you be not go to walk another step ' say hammond ` while you be take you tea i will get you a carriage ' ` indeed i have rather hurry on at once ' urge mary ` we be so late already ' ` you will get home all the sooner if you obey I it be you duty to obey I now ' say hammond in a lowered voice she smile at he but it be a weak wan little smile for that descent in the wind and the fog have quite exhaust she mr hammond take she into a snug little parlor where there be a cheerful fire and see she comfortably seat in a arm chair by the hearth before he go to look after a carriage there be no such thing as a conveyance to be have but the windermere coach would pass in about half a hour and for this they must wait it would take they back to grasmere sooner than they could get there on foot in mary 's exhaust condition the tea-tray be bring in presently and hammond pour out the tea and wait upon lady mary it be a reversal of the usual formulum but it be very pleasant to mary to sit with she foot on the low brass fender and be wait upon by she lover that fog on the brow of helvellyn -- that pierce wind -- have chill she to the bone and there be unspeakable comfort in the glow and warmth of the fire in the refreshment of a good cup of tea ` mary you be my own property now remember ' say hammond watch she tenderly as she sip she tea she glance up at he shyly now and then with eye full of innocent wonder it be so strange to she as strange as sweet to know that he love she such a marvellous thing that she have pledge herself to be he wife ` you be my very own -- mine to guard and cherish mine to think and work for ' he go on ` and you will have to trust I sweet one even if the beginning of thing be not altogether free from trouble ' ' i be not afraid of trouble ' ` bravely speak first and foremost then you will have to announce you engagement to lady maulevrier she will take it ill no doubt will do she utmost to persuade you to give I up have you courage and resolution do you think to stand against she argument can you hold to you purpose bravely and cry no surrender ' ` there shall be no surrender ' answer mary ' i promise you that no doubt grandmother will be very angry but she have never care for I very much it will not hurt she for I to make a bad match as it would have do in lesbium 's case she have have no day-dream -- no grand ambition about I ' ` so much the better my wayside flower when you have say all that be sweet and dutiful to she and have let she know at the same time that you mean to be my wife come weal come woe i will see she and will have my say i will not promise she a grand career for my darling : but i will pledge myself that nothing of that kind which the world call evil -- no penury or shabbiness of surroundings -- shall ever touch mary haselden after she be mary hammond i can promise at least so much as that ' ` it be more than enough ' say mary ' i have tell you that i would gladly share poverty with you ' ` sweet it be good of you to say as much but i would not take you at you word you do not know what poverty be ' ` do you think i be a coward or self-indulgent you be wrong jack may i call you jack as maulevrier do ' ` may you ' the question evoke such a gush of tenderness that he be fain to kneel beside she chair and kiss the little hand hold the cup before he consider he have answer properly ` you be wrong jack i do know what poverty mean i have study the way of the poor try to console they and help they a little in they trouble and i know there be no pain that want of money can bring which i would not share willingly with you do you suppose my happiness be dependent on a fine house and powdered footman i should like to go to the red river with you and wear cotton gown and tuck up my sleeve and clean we cottage ' ` very pretty sport dear for a summer day but my mary shall have a sweeter life and shall occasionally walk in silk attire ' that tea-drinking by the fireside in the inn parlor be the most delicious thing within john hammond 's experience mary be a bewitching compound of earnestness and simplicity so humble so confide so perplexed and astounded at she own bliss ` confess now in the summer when you be in love with lesbium you think I a horrid kind of girl ' she say presently when they be stand side by side at the window wait for the coach ` never mary my crime be to have think very little about you in those day i be so dazzle by lesbium 's beauty so charm by she accomplishment and girlish grace that i forget to take notice of anything else in the world if i thought of you at all it be as another maulevrier -- a younger maulevrier in petticoat very gay and good-humoured and nice ' ` but when you see I rush about with the terrier -- i must have seem utterly horrid ' ` why dearest there be nothing essentially horrible in terrier or in a bright lively girl run race with they you make a very pretty picture in the sunlight with you hat hang on you shoulder and you curly brown hair and dancing hazel eye if i have not be deep in love with lesbium 's peerless complexion and grecian feature i should have look below the surface of that gainsborough picture and discover what treasure of goodness and courage and truth and purity those frank brown eye and that wide forehead betoken i be sowing my wild oats last summer mary and they bring I a crop of sorrow but i be wiser now -- wiser and happier ` but if you be to see lesbium again would not the old love revive ' ` the old love be dead mary there be nothing left of it but a handful of ash which i scatter thus to the four wind ' with a wave of he hand towards the open casement ` the new love absorb and master my be if lesbium be to re-appear at fellside this evening i could offer she my hand in all brotherly frankness and ask she to accept I as a brother here come the coach we shall be at fellside just in time for dinner ' chapter xxii wiser than lesbium lady mary and mr hammond be back at fellside at a quarter before eight by which time the star be shine on pine wood and fall they manage to be in the drawing-room when dinner be announce after the hastiest of toilet yet she lover think mary have never look prettier than she look that night in she limp white cashmere gown and with she brown hair brush into a largo loose knot on the top of she head there have be great uneasiness about they at fellside when evening begin to draw in and the expect hour of they return have go by scout have be send in quest of they but in the wrong direction ' i do not think you would be such idiot as to come down the north side of the hill in a tempest ' say maulevrier ` we could see the cloud race over the crest of seat sandal and know it be blow pretty hard up there though it be calm enough down here ' ` blow pretty hard ' echo hammond ' i do not think i be ever out in a worse gale and yet i have be across the bay of biscay when the wave strike the side of the steamer like batter ram and when the whole surface of the sea be white with seething foam ' ` it be a most imprudent thing to go up helvellyn in such weather ' say fräulein müller shake she head gloomily as she eat she fish mary feel that the fräulein 's manner bode ill there be a storm brewing a scolding be inevitable mary feel quite capable of do battle with the fräulein but she feeling be altogether different when she think of face that stern old lady upstairs and of the confession she have to make it be not that she courage falter so far as resolution go she be as firm as a rock but she feel that there be a terrible ordeal to be go through and it seem a mockery to be sit there and pretend to eat she dinner and take thing lightly with that ordeal before she ` we do not go up the hill in bad weather miss müller ' say mr hammond ` the sun be shine and the sky be blue when we start we could not foresee darkness and storm at the top of the hill that be the fortune of war ' ' i be very sorry lady mary have not more good sense ' reply fräulein with unabated gloom but on this maulevrier take up the cudgel ` if there be any want of sense in the business that be my look-out fräulein ' he say glaring angrily at the governess ` it be i who advise hammond and lady mary to climb the hill and here they be safe and sound after they journey i see no reason why there should be any fuss about it ' ` people have different way of look at thing reply fräulein plod steadily on with she dinner mary rise directly the dessert have be hand round and march out of the room : like a warrior go to a battle in which the chance of defeat be strong fräulein müller shuffle after she ` will you be kind enough to go to she ladyship 's room at once lady mary ' she say ` she want to speak to you ' ` and i want to speak to she ' say mary she run quickly upstairs and arrive in the morning room a little out of breath the room be light by one low moderator lamp under a dark red velvet shade and there be the glow of the wood fire which give a more cheerful light than the lamp lady maulevrier be lie on she couch in a loose brocade tea-gown with old brussels collar and ruffle she be as well dress in she day of affliction and helplessness as she have be in she day of strength for she know the value of surroundings and that she stateliness and power be in some manner dependent on detail of this kind the one hand which she could use glitter with diamond as she wave it with a little imperious gesture towards the chair on which she desire lady mary to seat herself and mary sit down meekly know that this chair represent the felon 's dock ` mary ' begin she grandmother with freezing gravity ' i have be surprise and shock by you conduct to-day yes surprise at such conduct even in you ' ' i do not think i have do anything very wrong grandmother ' ` not wrong you have do nothing wrong you have do something absolutely outrageous you my granddaughter well bear well breed rear under my roof to go up helvellyn and lose yourself in a fog alone with a young man you could hardly have do worse if you be a cockney tourist ' conclude she ladyship with ineffable disgust ' i could not help the fog ' say mary quietly the battle have to be fight and she be not go to flinch ' i have no intention of go up helvellyn alone with mr hammond maulevrier be to have go with we but when we get to dolly waggon he be tired and would not go any further he tell I to go on with mr hammond ' ' _ he _ tell you maulevrier -- a young man who have spend some of the best hour of he youth in the company of jockey and trainer -- who have not the faintest idea of the fitness of thing you allow maulevrier to be you guide in a matter in which you own instinct should have guide you -- you womanly instinct but you have always be a unwomanly girl you have put I to shame many a time by you hoydenish trick but i bear with you believe that you madcap folly be at least harmless to-day you have go a step too far and have be guilty of absolute impropriety which i shall be very slow to pardon ' ` perhaps you will be still more angry when you know all grandmother ' say mary lady maulevrier flash she dark eye at the girl with a look which would have almost kill a nervous subject but mary face she steadfastly very pale but as resolute as she ladyship ` when i know all what more be there for I to know ' ` only that while we be on the top of helvellyn in the fog and the wind mr hammond ask I to be he wife ' ' i be not surprise to hear it ' retort she ladyship with a harsh laugh ' a girl who could act so boldly and flirtingly be a natural mark for a adventurer mr hammond no doubt have be tell that you will have a little money by-and-by and think he might do worse than marry you and see how you have fling yourself at he head he naturally conclude that you will not be too proud to accept you sister 's leavings ' ` there be nothing gain by make cruel speech grandmother ' say mary firmly ' i have promise to be john hammond 's wife and there be nothing you nor anyone else can say which will make I alter my mind i wish to act dutifully to you if i can and i hope you will be good to I and consent to this marriage but if you will not consent i shall marry he all the same i shall be full of sorrow at have to disobey you but i have promise and i will keep my promise ' ` you will act in open rebellion against I -- against the kinswoman who have rear you and educate you and care for you in all these year ' ` but you have never love I ' answer mary sadly ` perhaps if you have give I some portion of that affection which you lavish on my sister i might be willing to sacrifice this now deep love for you sake -- to lay down my broken heart as a sacrifice on the altar of gratitude but you never love I you have tolerate I endure my presence as a disagreeable necessity of you life because i be my father 's daughter you and lesbium have be all the world to each other and i have stand aloof outside you charmed circle almost a stranger to you can you wonder grandmother recall this that i be unwilling to surrender the love that have be give I to-day -- the true heart of a brave and good man ' lady maulevrier look at she for some moment in scornful wonderment look at she with a slow deliberate smile ` poor child ' she say ` poor ignorant inexperienced baby for what a will-o-the-wisp be you ready to sacrifice my regard and all the privilege of you position as my granddaughter no doubt this mr hammond have say all manner of fine thing to you but can you be weak enough to believe that he who half a year ago be sigh and die at the foot of you sister can have one spark of genuine regard for you the thing be not in nature it be a obvious absurdity but it be easy enough to understand that mr hammond without a penny in he pocket and with he way to make in the world would be very glad to secure lady mary haselden and she five hundred a year and to have lord maulevrier for he brother in-law ' ` have i really five hundred a year shall i have five hundred a year when i marry ' ask mary suddenly radiant ` yes if you marry with you brother 's consent ' ' i be so glad -- for he sake he could hardly starve if i have five hundred a year he need not be oblige to emigrate ' ` have he be offer you the prospect of emigration as a additional inducement ' ` oh no he do not say that he be very poor but since you say he be penniless i think we might be oblige to emigrate but as i have five hundred a year -- ' ` you will stay at home and set up a lodging-house i suppose ' sneer lady maulevrier ' i will do anything my husband please we can live in a humble way in some quiet part of london while mr hammond work at literature or politics i be not afraid of poverty or trouble i be willing to endure both for he sake ' ` you be a fool ' say she grandmother sternly ` and i have nothing more to say to you go away and send maulevrier to I ' mary do not obey immediately she go over to she grandmother 's couch and knelt by she side and kiss the poor maimed hand which lay on the velvet cushion ` dear grandmother ' she say gently ' i be very sorry to rebel against you but this be a question of life or death with I i be not like lesbium i can not barter love and truth for worldly advantage -- for pride of race do not think I so weak or so vain as to be win by a few fine speech from a adventurer mr hammond be no adventurer he have make no fine speech -- but i will tell you a secret grandmother i have like and admire he from the first time he come here i have look up to he and reverence he and i must be a very foolish girl if my judgment be so poor that i can respect a worthless man ' ` you _ be _ a very foolish girl ' answer lady maulevrier more kindly than she have speak before ` but you have be very good and dutiful to I since i have be ill and i do not wish to forget that i never say that mr hammond be worthless but i say that he be no fit husband for you if you be as yield and obedient as lesbium it would be all the better for you for then i should provide for you establishment in life in a become manner but as you be wilful and bent upon take you own way -- well -- my dear you must take the consequence and when you be a struggle wife and mother old before you time weigh down with the weary burden of petty care do not say my grandmother might have save I from this martyrdom ' ' i will run the risk grandmother i will be answerable for my own fate ' ` so be it mary and now send maulevrier to I ' mary go down to the billiard room where she find she brother and she lover engage in a hundred game ` take my cue and beat he if you can molly ' say maulevrier when he have hear mary 's message ` i be fifteen ahead of he for he have be fall asleep over he shot i suppose i be go to get a lecture ' ' i do not think so ' say mary ` well my dearest how do you fare in the encounter ' ask hammond directly maulevrier be go ` oh it be dreadful i make the most rebellious speech to poor grandmother and then i remember she affliction and i ask she to forgive I and just at the last she be ever so much kinder and i think that she will let I marry you now she know i have make up my mind to be you wife -- in spite of fate ' ` my bravest and best ' ` and do you know jack ' -- she blush tremendously as she utter this familiar name -- ' i have make a discovery ' ` indeed ' ' i find that i be to have five hundred a year when i be marry it be not much but i suppose it will help will not it we can not exactly starve if we have five hundred a year let I see it be more than a pound a day a sovereign ought to go a long way in a small house and of course we shall begin in a very wee house like de quincey 's cottage over there only in london ' ` yes dear there be plenty of such cottage in london in mayfair for instance or belgravium ' ` now you be laugh at my rustic ignorance but the five hundred pound will be a help will not it ' ` yes dear a great help ' ` i be so glad ' she have chalk she cue while she be talk but after take she aim she drop she arm irresolutely ` do you know i be afraid i can not play to-night ' she say ` helvellyn and the fog and the wind have quite spoilt my nerve shall we go to the drawing-room and see if fräulein have recover from she gloomy fit ' ' i would rather stay here where we be free to talk but i 'll do whatever you like best ' mary prefer the drawing-room it be very sweet to be alone with she lover but she be weigh down with confusion in he presence the novelty the wonderment of she position overpower she she yearn for the shelter of fräulein müller 's wing albeit the company of that most prosaic person be certain death to romance miss müller be in she accustomed seat by the fire knit she customary muffler she have appropriate lady maulevrier 's place much to mary 's disgust it irk the girl to see that stout clumsy figure in the chair which have be fill by she grandmother 's imperial form the very room seem vulgarise by the change fräulein look up with a surprised air when mary and hammond enter together the girl smile and happy she have expect that mary would have leave she ladyship 's room in tear and would have retire to she own apartment to hide she swollen eyelid and humiliate aspect but here she be after the fiery ordeal of a interview with she offended grandmother not in the least crestfallen ` be we not to have any tea to-night ' ask mary look round the room ' i think you be unconscious of the progress of time lady mary ' answer fräulein stiffly ` the tea have be bring in and take out again ' ` then it must be bring again if lady mary want some ' say hammond ring the bell in the coolest manner fräulein feel that thing be come to a pretty pass if maulevrier 's humble friend be go to give order in the house quiet and commonplace as the hanoverian be she have she ambition and that be to grasp the household sceptre which lady maulevrier must need in some wise resign now that she be a prisoner to she room but so far fräulein have meet with but small success in this endeavor she ladyship 's authority still rule the house she ladyship 's keen intellect take cognisance even of trifle : and it be only in the most insignificant detail that fräulein feel herself a power ` well you ladyship what be the row ' say maulevrier march into he grandmother 's room with a free and easy air he be prepare for a skirmish and he mean to take the bull by the horn ' i suppose you know what have happen to-day ' say she ladyship ` molly and hammond 's expedition yes of course i go part of the way with they but i be out of training get pump out after a couple of mile and be not such a fool as to go to the top ' ` do you know that mr hammond make mary a offer while they be on the hill and that she accept he ' ' a queer place for a proposal be not it the wind blow great gun all the time i should have choose a more tranquil spot ' ` maulevrier can not you be serious do you forget that this business of to-day must affect you sister 's welfare for the rest of she life ' ` no i do not i will be as serious as a judge after he have put on the black cap ' say maulevrier seat himself near he grandmother 's couch and alter he tone altogether ` seriously i be very glad that hammond have ask mary to be he wife and still more glad that she be tremendously in love with he i tell you some time ago not to put you speak in that wheel there could not be a happier or a better marriage for mary ' ` you must have rather a poor opinion of you sister 's attraction personal or otherwise if you consider a penniless young man -- of no family -- good enough for she ' ' i do not consider my sister a piece of merchandise to be sell to the highest bidder grant that hammond be poor and a nobody he be a honorable man highly gifted brave as a lion and he be my dearest friend can you wonder that i rejoice at my sister 's have win he for she adoring lover ' ` can he really care for she after have love lesbium ' ` that be the desire of the eye this be the love of the heart i know that he love mary ever so much better than he love lesbium i can assure you ladyship that i be not such a fool as i look i be very fond of my sister mary and i have not be blind to she interest i tell you on my honor that she ought to be very happy as john hammond 's wife ' ' i be oblige to believe what you say about he character ' say lady maulevrier ` and i be willing to admit that the husband 's character have a great deal to do with the wife 's happiness from a moral point of view but still there be material question to be consider have you friend any means of support a wife ' ` yes he have mean quite sufficient means for mary 's view which be very simple ' ` you mean to say he would keep she in decent poverty can not you be explicit maulevrier and say what mean the man have whether a income or none if you can not tell I i must question mr hammond himself ' ` pray do not do that ' exclaim she grandson urgently ` do not take all the flavor of romance out of molly 's love story by go into pound shilling and penny she be very young you would hardly wish she to marry immediately ' ` not for the next year at the very least ' ` then why enter upon this sordid question of way and mean make hammond and mary happy by consent to they engagement and trust the rest to providence and to I take my word for it hammond be not a beggar and he be a man likely to make he mark in the world if a year hence he income be not enough to allow of he marry i will double mary 's allowance out of my own purse hammond 's friendship have steady I and save I a good deal more than five hundred a year ' ' i can quite believe that i believe mr hammond be a worthy man and that he influence have be very good for you but that do not make he a good match for mary however you seem to have settle the business among you and i suppose i must submit you have better all drink tea with I to morrow afternoon and i will receive you friend as mary 's future husband ' ` that be the best and kindest of grandmother ' ` but i should like to know more of he antecedent and he relation ' ` he antecedent be altogether creditable he take honor at the university he have be like and respect everywhere he be a orphan and it be better not to talk to he of he family he be sensitive on that point like most man who stand alone in the world ' ` well i will hold my peace you have take this business into you hand maulevrier and you must be responsible for the result ' maulevrier leave he grandmother soon after this and go downstairs whistle for very joyousness find the billiard-room desert he repair to the drawing-room where he find mary playing scrap of melody to she lover at the shadowy end of the room while fräulein sit by the fire weave she web as steadily as one of the fatal sister and with a brow prophetic of evil maulevrier creep up to the piano and come stealthily behind the lover ` bless you my child ' he say hover over they with outspread hand ' i be the dive come back to the ark i be the bearer of happy tiding lady maulevrier consent to you acquire the legal right to make each other miserable for the rest of you life ' ` god bless you maulevrier ' say hammond clasp he by the hand ` only as this sister of mine be hardly out of the nursery you will have to wait for she at least a year so say the dowager whose word be like the law of the mode and persian and altereth not ' ' i would wait for she twice seven year as jacob wait and toil for she as jacob toil ' answer hammond ` but i should like to call she my own to-morrow if it be possible ' nothing could be happier or gayer than the tea-drinking in lady maulevrier 's room on the follow afternoon she ladyship have once give way upon a point know how to make she concession gracefully she extend she hand to mr hammond as frankly as if he have be she own particular choice ' i can not refuse my granddaughter to she brother 's dearest friend ' she say ` but i think you be two most imprudent young people ' ` providence take care of imprudent lover just as it do of the bird in they nest ' answer hammond smile ` just as much and no more i fear providence do not keep off the cat or the tax-gatherer ' ` bird must take care of they nest and husband must work for they home ' argue hammond ` heaven give sweet air and sunlight and a beautiful world to live in ' ' i think ' say lady maulevrier look at he critically ` you be just the kind of person who ought to emigrate you have idea that would do for the bush or the yosemite valley but which be too primitive for a over-crowded country ' ` no lady maulevrier i be not go to steal you granddaughter when she be my wife she shall live within call i know she love she native land and i do not think either of we would care to put a ocean between we and rugged old helvellyn ' ` of course have make idiot of yourselve up there in the fog and the storm you be go to worship the mountain for ever afterwards ' say she ladyship laugh never have she seem gayer or brighter perhaps in she heart of heart she rejoice at get mary engage even to so humble a suitor as fortuneless john hammond ever since the visit of the so-called rajah she have live as damocle live with the sword of destiny -- the avenge sword -- hang over she by the finest hair every time she hear carriage wheel in the drive -- every time the hall-door bell ring a little louder than usual she heart seem to stop beat and she whole be to hang suspend on a thread if the thread be to snap there would come darkness and death the blow that have paralyse one side of she body must need if repeat bring total extinction she who believe in no after life saw in she maim and waste arm the beginning of death she who recognize only the life of the body feel that one half of she be already dead but month have go by and loui asoph have make no sign she begin to hope that he boast document and witness be altogether mythical and yet the engine of the law be slow to put in motion he might be work up he case line upon line with some hard-headed london lawyer arrange and marshal he fact prepare he witness wait for affidavit from indium work slowly but surely underground like the mole and all at once in a hour he case might be before the law court he story and the story of lord maulevrier 's infamy might be town talk again as it have be forty year ago when the true story of that crime have be happily unknown yes with the present fear of this loui asoph 's revelation of a new scandal if not a calamity lady maulevrier feel that it be a good thing to have she younger granddaughter 's future in some measure secure john hammond have say of himself to lesbia that he be not the kind of man to fail and look at he critically to-day lady maulevrier see the stamp of power and dauntless courage in he countenance and bear it be the inner mind of a man which mould the line of he face and figure and a man 's character may be read in the way he walk and hold himself the action of he hand he smile he frown he general outlook as clearly as in any phrenological development john hammond have a noble outlook : bold without impudence or self-assertion self-possessed without vanity yes assuredly a man to wrestle with difficulty and to conquer fate when that little tea-drinking be over and maulevrier and he friend be go away to dress for dinner lady maulevrier detain mary for a minute or two by she couch she take she by the hand with unaccustomed tenderness ` my child i congratulate you ' she say ` last night i think you a fool but i begin to think that you be wiser than lesbium you have win the heart of a noble young man ' chapter xxiii ' a young lamb 's heart among the full-grown flock ' for three most happy day mary rejoice in she lover 's society maulevrier be with they everywhere by brookside and fall on the lake in the garden in the billiard-room playing propriety with admirable patience but this could not last for ever a man who have to win name and fortune and a home for he young wife can not spend all he day in the primrose path fortune and reputation be not make in dawdle beside a mountain stream or watch the play of sunlight and shadow on a green hill-side unless indeed one be a new wordsworth and even then fortune and renown be not quickly make and again maulevrier who have be a marvel of good-nature and contentment for the last eight week be begin to be tire of this lovely lakeland just when lakeland be daily develop into new beauty maulevrier begin to feel a itch for london where he have a comfortable nest in the albany and which be to he mind a metropolis expressly create as a center or start point for newmarket epsom ascot and goodwood so there come a morning upon which mary have to say good-bye to those two companion who have so blest and gladden she life it be a bright sunshiny morning and all the world look gay which seem very unkind of nature mary thought and yet even in the sadness of this parting she have much reason to be glad as she stand with she lover in the library in the three minute of _ tête-à-tête _ she steal from the argus-eyed fräulein fold in he arm look up at he manly face it seem to she that the mere knowledge that she belong to he and be beloved by he ought to sustain and console she even in long year of severance yes even if he be one of the knight of old go to the holy land on a crusade full of peril and uncertainty even then a woman ought to be brave have such a lover but she parting be to be only for a few month maulevrier promise to come back to fellside for the August sport and hammond be to come with he three month -- or a little more -- and they be to meet again yet in spite of these argument for courage mary 's face blanch and she eye grow unutterably sad as she look up at she lover ` you will take care of yourself jack for my sake will not you dear ' she murmur ` if you should be ill while you be in london if you should die -- ' ` life be very uncertain love but i do not feel like sickness or death just at present ' answer hammond cheerily ` indeed i feel that the present be full of sweetness and the future full of hope do not suppose dear that i be not grieve at this good-bye but before we be a year older i hope the time will have come when there will be no more farewell for you and I i shall be a very exacting husband molly i shall want to spend all the day and hour of my life with you to have not a fancy or a pursuit in which you can not share or with which you can not sympathise i hope you will not grow tired of I ' ` tired ' then come silence and a long farewell kiss and then the voice of maulevrier shout in the hall just in time to warn the lover before miss müller open the door and exclaim ` oh mr hammond we have be look for you _ everywhere _ the luggage be all in the carriage and maulevrier say there be only just time to get to windermere ' in another minute or so the carriage be drive down the hill and mary stand in the porch look after the traveller ` it seem as if it be my fate to stand here and see everybody drive away ' she say to herself and then she look round at the lovely garden bright with spring flower the tree glorious with they young fresh foliage and the vast panorama of hill and dale and feel that it be a wicked thing to murmur in the midst of such a world and she remember the great unhoped-for bliss that have come to she within the last four day and the cloud upon she brow vanish as she clasp she hand in child-like joyousness ` god bless you dear old helvellyn ' she exclaim look up at the sombre crest of the mountain ` perhaps if it have not be for you he would have never propose ' but she be oblige to dismiss this idea instantly for to suppose john hammond 's avowal of he love a accident the mere impulse of a weak moment would be despair have he not tell she how she have grow nearer and nearer to he heart day by day and hour by hour until she have become part of he life he have tell she this -- he in whom she believe as in the very spirit of truth she wander about the garden for a hour after the carriage have start for windermere revisit every spot where she and she lover have walk together within the last three day live over again the rapture of those hour repeat to herself he word recall he look with the fatuity of a first girlish love and yet amidst the silliness inseparable from love 's young dream there be a depth of true womanly feeling thoughtful unselfish forecasting a future which be not to travel always along the primrose path of dalliance -- a future in which the rose be not always to be thornless john hammond be go to london to work for a position in the world to strive and labor among the seething mass of struggler all press onward for the same goal -- independence wealth renown little as mary know of the world by experience she have at least hear the wiseacre talk and that which she have hear be calculate to depress rather than to inspire industrious youth she have hear how the profession be all over-crowded : how a mighty army of young man be walk the hospital all intent on feel the pulse and pick the pocket of the rise generation : how at the bar man be grow old and gray before they see they first brief : how competitor be elbow and hustle each other upon every road thronging at every gate and while masculine youth strove and wrestle for place in the race aunt and sister and cousin be press into the same arena do they best to crowd out the uncle and the brother and the nephew ` poor jack ' sigh mary ` at the worst we can go to the red river country and grow corn ' this be she favorite fancy that she and she lover should find they first dwelling in the new world live as humbly as the peasant live round grasmere and patiently wait upon fortune and yet that would not be happiness unless maulevrier be to come and stay with they every autumn nothing could reconcile mary to be separate from maulevrier for any lengthen period there be hour in which she be more hopeful and defy the wiseacre clever young man have succeed in the past -- clever man whose hair be not yet gray have come to the front in the present grant that these be the exceptional man the fine flower of humanity do she not know that john hammond be as far above average youth as helvellyn be above yonder mound in she grandmother 's shrubbery yes he would succeed in literature in politics in whatever career he have choose for himself he be a man to do the thing he set himself to do be it ever so difficult to doubt he success would be to doubt he truth and he honesty for he have swear to she he would make she life bright and happy and that evil day should never come to she and he be not the man to promise that which he be not able to perform the house seem terribly dull now that the two young man be go there be a oppressive silence in the room which have lately resound with maulevrier 's frank boyish laughter and with he friend 's deep manly tone -- a silence break only by the click of fräulein müller 's needle the fräulein be not dispose to be sympathetic or agreeable about lady mary 's engagement firstly she have not be consult about it the thing have be do she consider in a underhand manner and lady maulevrier who have begin by strenuously oppose the match have be talk over in a way that prove the latent weakness of that great lady 's character secondly miss müller have herself for some reason miss such joy as be involve in be woo and win be dispose to look sourly upon all love affair and to take a despondent view of all matrimonial engagement she do not say anything openly uncivil to mary haselden but she let the damsel see that she pity she and despise she infatuated condition and this be so unpleasant that mary be fain to fall back upon the society of pony and terrier and to take up she pilgrim 's staff and go wander over the hill carry she happy thought into solitary place and sit for hour in a heathery hollow steep in a sea of summer light and try to paint the mountain side and the rush of the waterfall she sketch-book be a excuse for hour of solitude for the indulgence of a endless day-dream sometimes she go among she humble friend in the grasmere cottage or in the village of great and little langdale and she have now a new interest in these visit for she have make up she mind that it be she solemn duty to learn housekeeping -- not such housekeeping as might have be learn at fellside suppose she have muster the courage to ask the dignified upper-servant in that establishment to instruct she but such domestic art as be need in the dwelling of the poor the art of make a very little money go a great way the art of give grace neatness prettiness to the smallest room and the shabbiest furniture the art of pack all the ugly appliance and baser necessity of daily life the pot and kettle and broom and pail into the narrowest compass and hide they from the aesthetic eye mary think that if she begin by learn the homely device of the villager -- the very a b c of cookery and housewifery -- she might gradually enlarge upon this simple basis to suit a income of from five to seven hundred a year the house-mother from whom she seek information be puzzle at this sudden curiosity about domestic matter they look upon the thing as a freak of girlhood which drift into eccentricity from sheer idleness yet they be not the less ready to teach mary anything she desire to learn they tell she those secret art by which copper and brass be make thing of beauty and meet adornment for a old oak mantelshelf they allow she to look on at the milking of the cow and at the churning of the butter and at bread making and cake making and pie and pudding making and some pleasant hour be spend in the acquirement of this useful knowledge mary do not neglect the invalid during this new phase of she existence lady maulevrier be a lover of routine and she like she granddaughter to go to she at the same hour every day from eleven to twelve be the time for mary 's duty as amanuensis sometimes there be no letter to be write sometimes there be several but she ladyship rarely allow the task to go beyond the stroke of noon at noon mary be free and free till five o'clock when she be generally in attendance ready to give lady maulevrier she afternoon tea and sit and talk with she and tell she any scrap of local news which she have gather in the day there be day on which she ladyship prefer to take she tea alone and mary be leave free to follow she own device till dinner-time ' i do not feel equal even to you society to-day my dear ' she ladyship would say ` go and enjoy yourself with you dog and you tennis ' forget that there be very seldom anybody on the premise with whom lady mary could play tennis but in these lonely day of mary haselden 's life there be one crowning bliss which be almost enough to sweeten solitude and take away the sting of separation and that be the delight of expect and receive she lover 's letter busily as mr hammond must be engage in fight the battle of life he be in no way want in he duty as a lover he write to mary every other day but though he letter be long they tell she hardly anything of himself or he occupation he write about picture book music such thing as he know must be interesting to she but of he own struggle not a word ` poor fellow ' think mary ` he be afraid to sadden I by tell I how hard the struggle be ' she own letter to she betroth be simple outpouring of girlish love breathing that too flattering-sweet idolatry which a innocent girl give to she first lover mary write as if she herself be of the least possible value among create thing with one of mr hammond 's earlier letter come the engagement ring no half-hoop of brilliant or sapphire ruby or emerald no gorgeous triple circlet of red white and green but only a massive band of dead gold on the inside of which be engrave this posy -- ` for ever ' mary think it the loveliest ring she have ever see in she life may be half over and the last patch of snow have vanish from the crest of helvellyn from eagle 's crag and raven 's crag and coniston old man spring -- slow to come along these shadowy gorge -- have come in real earnest now spring that be almost summer and lady maulevrier 's garden be as lovely as dreamland but it be a unpeopled paradise mary have the grounds all to herself except at those state time when the fräulein who be grow lazier and larger day by day in she leisurely and placid existence take she morning and afternoon constitutional on the terrace in front of the drawing-room or solemnly perambulate the shrubbery on fine day mary live in the garden save when she be far afield learn the domestic art from the cottager she read french and german and work conscientiously at she intellectual education as well as at domestic economy for she tell herself that accomplishment and culture might be useful to she in she married life she might be able to increase she husband 's means by give lesson abroad or take pupil at home she be ready to do anything she would teach the stupidest child or scrub floor or bake bread there be no service she would deem degrade for he sake she mean when she marry to drop she courtesy title she would not be lady mary hammond a poor sprig of nobility but plain mr hammond a work man 's wife lesbium 's presentation be over and have realize all lady kirkbank 's expectation the society papers be unanimous in pronounce lord maulevrier 's sister the prettiest _ débutante _ of the season they praise she classical feature the admirable poise of she head she peerless complexion they describe she dress at the drawing-room they describe she ` frock ' in the park and at sandown they expatiate on the impression she have make at great assembly they hint at even royal admiration all this frivolous fribble though it might be lady maulevrier read with delight and she be still more gratify by lesbium 's own account of she success but as the season advance lesbium 's letter to she grandmother grow briefer -- mere hurry scrawl dash off while the carriage be at the door or while she maid be brushing she hair lady maulevrier divine with the keen instinct of love that she count for very little in lesbium 's life now that the whirligig of society the fret and fever of fashion have begin one afternoon in may at that hour when hyde park be fullest and the carriage move slowly in triple rank along the lady 's mile and the mount constable jog up and down with a business-like air which set every one on the alert for the advent of the princess of wale just at that hour when lesbium sit in lady kirkbank 's barouche and distribute gracious bow and enthralling smile to she numerous acquaintance mary ride slowly down the fell after a rambling ride on the safest and most venerable of mountain pony the pony be gray and mary be gray for she wear a neat little homespun habit make by the local tailor and a neat little feel hat with a ptarmigan 's feather all be very quiet at fellside as she go in at the stable gate there be not a underling stir in the large old stable-yard which have remain almost unaltered for a century and a half for lady maulevrier whilst spending thousand on the new part of the house have deem the exist stable good enough for she stud they be spacious old stable build as solidly as a norman castle and with all the virtue and all the vice of they age mary look round she with a sigh the stillness of the place be oppressive and within door she know there would be the same stillness make still more oppressive by the society of the fräulein who grow duller and duller every day as it seem to mary she take she pony into the dusky old stable where four other pony begin rattle they halter in the gloom by way of greet a bundle of purple tare lay ready in a corner for mary to feed she favorite and for the next ten minute or so she be happily employ go from stall to stall and gratify that inordinate appetite for green meat which seem natural to all horse not a groom or stable-boy appear while she be in the stable and she be just go away when she attention be catch by a flood of sunshine streaming into a old disused harness-room at the end of the stable -- a room with one small window face the fell whence could that glow of western light come assuredly not from the low-latticed window which face eastward and be generally obscure by a screen of cobweb the room be only use as a storehouse for lumber and it be nobody 's business to clean the window mary look in curious to solve the riddle a door which she have often noticed but never see open now stand wide open and the old quadrangular garden which be jame steadman 's particular care smile at she in the golden evening light see thus this little old dutch garden seem to mary the prettiest thing she have ever look upon there be bed of tulip and hyacinth ranunculus narcissus tuberose make a blaze of color against the old box border a foot high the crumble old brick wall of the outbuilding and that dungeon-like wall which form the back of the new house be clothe with clemati and wistarium woodbine and magnolia all that loving labor could do have be do day by day for the last forty year to make this confine space a thing of beauty mary go out of the dark stable into the sunny garden and look round she full of admiration for jame steadman 's work ` if ever jack and i can afford to have a garden i hope we shall be able to make it like this ' she think ` it be such a comfort to know that so small a garden can be pretty : for of course any garden we could afford must be small ' lady mary have no idea that this quadrangle be spacious as compare with the narrow strip allot to many a suburban villa call itself ` a eligible residence ' in the center of the garden there be a old sundial with a stone bench at the base and as she come upon a opening in the circular yew tree hedge which environ this sundial and from which the flower bed radiate in a geometrical pattern lady mary be surprise to see a old man -- a very old man -- sit on this bench and basking in the low light of the westering sun he figure be shrunken and bent and he sit with he chin rest on the handle of a crutched stick and he head lean forward he long white hair fall in thin straggle lock over the collar of he coat he have a old-fashioned mummyfied aspect and mary think he must be very very old very very old in a flash there come back upon she the memory of john hammond 's curiosity about a hoary and withered old man whom he have meet on the fell in the early morning she remember how she have take he to see old sam barlow and how he have protest that sam in no wise resemble the strange-looking old man of the fell and now here close to the fell be a face and figure which in every detail resemble that ancient stranger whom hammond have describe so graphically it be very strange could this person be the same she lover have see two month ago and if so have he be live at fellside all the time or be he only a occasional visitor of steadman 's while she stand for a few moment meditate thus the old man raise he head and look up at she with eye that burn like red-hot coal under he shaggy white brow the look scare she there be something awful in it like the gaze of a evil spirit a soul in torment and she begin to move away with side-long step she eye rivet on that uncanny countenance ` do not go ' say the man with a authoritative air rattle he bony finger upon the bench ` sit down here by my side and talk to I do not be frightened child you would not if you know what they say of I indoors ' he make a motion of he head towards the window of the old wing -- ` harmless they say quite harmless let he alone he be harmless a tiger with he claw cut and he tooth draw -- a old grey-bearded tiger ghastly and grim but harmless -- a cobra with the poison-bag pluck out of he jaw the venom grow again child -- the snake 's venom -- but youth never come back : old and helpless and harmless ' again mary try to move away but those evil eye hold she as if she be a bird rivet by the gaze of a serpent ` why do you shrink away ' ask the old man frown at she ` sit down here and let I talk to you i be accustom to be obey ' old and feeble and shrunken as he be there be a power in he tone of command which mary be unable to resist she feel very sure that he be imbecile or mad she know that madman be apt to imagine themselves great personage and to take upon themselves with a wonderful power of impersonation the dignity and authority of they imaginary rank and she suppose that it must be thus with this strange old man she struggle against she sense of terror after all there could be no real danger in the broad daylight within the precinct of she own home within call of the household she seat herself on the bench by the unknown willing to humor he a little and he turn himself about slowly as if every bone in he body be stiff with age and look at she with a deliberate scrutiny chapter xxiv ` now nothing leave to love or hate ' the old man sit look at mary in silence for some moment not a great space of time perhaps as mark by the shadow on the dial behind they but to mary that gaze be unpleasantly prolong he look at she as if he could read every pulsation in every fiber of she brain and know exactly what it mean ` who be you ' he ask at last ` my name be mary haselden ' ` haselden ' he repeat musingly ' i have hear that name before ' and then he resume he former attitude he chin rest on the handle of he crutch-stick he eye bent upon the gravel path they unholy brightness hide under the penthouse brow ` haselden ' he murmur and repeat the name over and over again slowly dreamily with a troubled tone like some one try to work out a difficult problem ` haselden -- when where ' and then with a profound sigh he mutter ` harmless quite harmless you may trust he anywhere memory a blank a blank a blank my lord ' he head sink lower upon he breast and again he sigh the sigh of a spirit in torment mary think she vivid imagination be already interested she quick sympathy be awaken she look at he wonderingly compassionately so old so infirm and with a mind astray and yet there be indication in he speech and manner that tell of reason struggle against madness like the light behind storm-cloud he have tone that speak of a keen sensitiveness to pain not the lunatic 's imbecile placidity she observe he intently try to make out what manner of man he be he do not belong to the peasant class : of that she feel assure the shrunken taper hand have never work at peasant 's work the profile turn towards she be delicate to effeminacy the man 's clothes be shabby and old-fashioned but they be a gentleman 's garment the cloth of a finer texture than she have ever see worn by she brother the coat with its velvet collar be of a old-world fashion she remember have see just such a coat in a engraved portrait of count d'orsay a print nearly fifty year old no dalesman bear and breed ever wear such a coat no tailor in the dale could have make it the old man look up after a long pause during which mary feel afraid to move he look at she again with inquire eye as if she presence there have only just become know to he ` who be you ' he ask again ' i tell you my name just now i be mary haselden ' ` haselden -- that be a name i know -- once mary i think my mother 's name be mary yes yes i remember that you have a sweet face mary -- like my mother 's she have brown eye like yours and auburn hair you do not recollect she perhaps ' ` alas poor maniac ' think mary ` you have lose all count of time fifty year to you in the confusion of you distraught brain be but as yesterday ' ` no of course not of course not ' he mutter ` how should she recollect my mother who die while i be a boy impossible that must be half a century ago ' ` good evening to you ' say mary rise with a great effort so strong be she feeling of be spellbound by the uncanny old man ' i must go indoors now ' he stretch out he withered old hand small semi-transparent with the blue vein show darkly under the parchment-coloured skin and grasp mary 's arm ` do not go ' he plead ' i like you face child i like you voice -- i like to have you here what do you mean by go indoors where do you live ' ` there ' say mary point to the dead wall which face they ` in the new part of fellside house i suppose you be stay in the old part with jame steadman ' she have make up she mind that this crazy old man must be a relation of steadman 's to whom he give hospitality either with or without she ladyship 's consent all powerful as lady maulevrier have ever be in she own house it be just possible that now when she be a prisoner in she own room certain small liberty might be take even by so faithful a servant as steadman ` stay with jame steadman ' repeat the old man in a meditative tone ` yes i stay with steadman a good servant a worthy person it be only for a little while i shall be leave westmoreland next week and you live in that house do you ' point to the dead wall ` whose house ' ` lady maulevrier 's i be lady maulevrier 's granddaughter ' ` lady mau-lev-rier ' he repeat the name in syllable ' a good name -- a old title -- as old as the conquest a norman race those maulevrier and you be lady maulevrier 's granddaughter you should be proud the maulevrier be always a proud race ' ` then i be no true maulevrier ' answer mary gaily she be begin to feel more at she ease with the old man he be evidently mad as mad as a march hare but he madness seem only the harmless lunacy of extreme old age he have flash of reason too mary begin to feel a friendly interest in he to youth in its flush of life and vigor there seem something so unspeakably sad and pitiable in feebleness and age -- the brief weak remnant of life the wreck of body and mind sun itself in the decline ray of a sun that be so soon to shine upon its grave ` what be you not proud ' ask the old man ` not at all i have be teach to consider myself a very insignificant person and i be go to marry a poor man it would not become I to be proud ' ` but you ought not to do that ' say the old man ` you ought not to marry a poor man poverty be a bad thing my dear you be a pretty girl and ought to marry a man with a handsome fortune poor man have no pleasure in this world -- they might just as well be dead i be poor as you see you can tell by this threadbare coat ' -- he look down at the sleeve from which the nap be worn in place -- ' i be as poor as a church mouse ' ` but you have kind friend i dare say ' mary say soothingly ` you be well take care of i be sure ' ` yes i be well take care of -- very well take care of how long be it i wonder -- how many week or month or year since they have take care of I it seem a long long time but it be all like a dream -- a long dream once i use to try and wake myself i use to try and struggle out of that weary dream but that be age ago i be satisfied now -- i be quite content now -- so long as the weather be warm and i can sit out here in the sun ' ` it be grow chilly now ' say mary ` and i think you ought to go indoors i know that i must go ' ` yes i must go in now -- i be get shivery ' answer the old man meekly ` but i want to see you again mary -- i like you face -- and i like you voice it strike a chord here ' touch he breast ` which have long be silent let I see you again child when can i see you again ' ` do you sit here every afternoon when it be fine ' ` yes every day -- all day long sometimes when the sun be warm ' ` then i will come here to see you ' ` you must keep it a secret then ' say the old man with a crafty look ` if you do not they will shut I up in the house perhaps they do not like I to see people for fear i should talk i have hear steadman say so yet what should i talk about heaven help I steadman say my memory be quite go and that i be childish and harmless -- childish and harmless i have hear he say that you 'll come again will not you and you 'll keep it a secret ' mary deliberate for a few minute ' i do not like secret ' she say ` there be generally something dishonourable in they but this would be a innocent secret would not it well i 'll come to see you somehow poor old man and if steadman see I here i will make everything right with he ' ` he must not see you here ' say the old man ` if he do he will shut I up in my own room again as he do once year and year ago ' ` but you have not be here long have you ' mary ask wonderingly ' a hundred year at least that be what it seem to I sometimes and yet there be time when it seem only a dream be sure you come again to-morrow ' ` yes i promise you to come good-night ' ` good-night ' mary go back to the stable the door be still open but how could she be sure that it would be open to-morrow there be no other access that she know of to the quadrangle except through the old part of the house and that be at time inaccessible to she she find a key -- a big old rusty key -- in the inside of the door so she shut and lock it and put the key in she pocket the door she suppose have be leave open by accident at any rate this key make she mistress of the situation if any question should arise as to she conduct she could have a explanation with steadman but she have pledge she word to the poor mad old man and she mean to keep she promise if possible as she leave the stable she see steadman ride towards the gate on he gray cob she pass he as she go back to the house next day and the day after that and for many day mary use she key and go into the quadrangle at sundown to sit for half a hour or so with the strange old man who seem to take a intense pleasure in she company the weather be grow warmer as may wear on towards June and this evening hour between six and seven be deliciously bright and balmy the seat by the sundial be screen on every side by the clip yew hedge dense and tall surround the circular gravelled space in the center of which stand the old granite dial with its octagonal pedestal and moss-grown step there as in a closely-shaded arbor lady mary and she old friend be alone and unobserved the yew-tree boundary be at least eight foot high and mary and she companion could hardly have be see even from the upper window of the low old house mary have fall into the habit of go for she walk or she ride at five o'clock every day when she be not in attendance on lady maulevrier and after she walk or ride she slip through the stable and join she ancient friend stable and courtyard be generally empty at this hour the man only appear at the sound of a big bell which summon they from they snuggery when they be want most of lady maulevrier 's servant have arrive at that respectable stage of long service in which fidelity be count as a substitute for hard work the old man be not particularly conversational and be apt to repeat the same thing over and over again with a sublime unconsciousness of be prosy but he like to hear mary talk and he listen with seem intelligence he question she about the world outside he cloistered life -- the war and rumor of war -- and although the name of the question and the man of the day seem utterly strange to he and he have to have they repeat to he again and again he seem to take a intelligent interest in the stir fact of the time and listen intently when mary give he a synopsis of she last newspaper reading when the news be exhaust mary hit upon a more childish form of amusement and that be to tell the story of any novel or poem she have be lately read this be so successful that in this manner mary related the story of most of shakespeare 's play of byron 's bride of abydo and corsair of keat 's lamium of tennyson 's idyll and of a heterogenous collection of poetry and romance in all of which story the old man take a vivid interest ` you be better to I than the sunshine ' he tell mary one day when she be leave he ` the world grow darker when you leave I ' once at this parting moment he take both she hand and draw she nearer to he peer into she face in the clear evening light ` you be like my mother ' he say ` yes you be very like she and who else be it that you be like there be some one else i know yes some one else i remember it be a face in a picture -- a picture at maulevrier castle ' ` what do you know of maulevrier castle ' ask mary wonderingly maulevrier be the family seat in herefordshire which have not be occupy by the elder branch for the last forty year lady maulevrier have let it during she son 's minority to a younger branch of the family a branch which have intermarry with the world of successful commerce and be richer than the head of the house this occupation of maulevrier castle have continue to the present time and be likely still to continue maulevrier have no desire to set up housekeeping in a feudal castle in the march ` how come you to know maulevrier castle ' repeat mary ' i be there once there be a picture by lely a portrait of a lady maulevrier in charle the second 's time the face be yours my love i have hear of such hereditary face my mother be proud of resemble that portrait ' ` what do you mother know of maulevrier castle ' the old man do not answer he have lapse into that dream-like condition into which he often sink when he brain be not stimulate to attention and coherency by he interest in mary 's narration mary conclude that this man have once be a servant in the maulevrier household perhaps at the place in herefordshire and that all he old memory run in one grove -- the house of maulevrier the freedom of she intercourse with he be undisturbed for about three week and at the end of that time she come face to face with jame steadman as she emerge from the circle of greenery ` you here lady mary ' he exclaim with a angry look ` yes i have be sit talk to that poor old man ' mary answer cheerily conclude that steadman 's look of vexation arise from he be detect in the act of harbour a contraband relation ` he be a very interesting character a relation of yours i suppose ' ` yes he be a relation ' reply steadman ` he be very old and he mind have long be go she ladyship be kind enough to allow I to give he a home in she house he be quite harmless and he be in nobody 's way ' ` of course not poor soul he be only a burden to himself he talk as if he life have be very weary have he be long in that sad state ' ` yes a long time ' steadman 's manner to lady mary be curt at the best of time she have always stand somewhat in awe of he as a person delegate with authority by she grandmother a servant who be much more than a servant but to-day he manner be more abrupt than usual ` he speak of maulevrier castle just now ' say mary determine not to be put down too easily ` be he once in service there ' ` he be pray how do you find you way into this garden lady mary ' ' i come through the stable as it be my grandmother 's garden i suppose i do not take a unwarrantable liberty in come ' say mary draw herself up and ready for battle ` it be lady maulevrier 's wish that this garden should be reserve for my use ' answer steadman ` she ladyship know that my uncle walk here of a afternoon and that owe to he age and infirmity he can go nowhere else and if only on that account it be well that the garden should be keep private lunatic be rather dangerous company lady mary and i advise you to give they a wide berth wherever you may meet they ' ' i be not afraid of you uncle ' say mary resolutely ` you say yourself just now that he be quite harmless : and i be really interested in he poor old creature he like I to sit with he a little of a afternoon and to talk to he and if you have no objection i should like to do so whenever the weather be fine enough for the poor old man to be out in the garden at this hour ' ' i have a very great objection lady mary and that objection be chiefly in you interest ' answer steadman firmly ` no one who be not experience in the way of lunatic can imagine the danger of any association with they -- they consummate craftiness they capacity for crime every madman be harmless up to a certain point -- mild inoffensive perhaps up to the very moment in which he commit some appalling crime and then people cry out upon the want of prudence the want of common-sense which allow such a act to be possible no lady mary i understand the benevolence of you motive but i can not permit you to run such a risk ' ' i be convince that the poor old creature be perfectly harmless ' say mary with suppress indignation ' i shall certainly ask lady maulevrier to speak to you on the subject perhaps she influence may induce you to be a little more considerate to you unhappy relation ' ` lady mary i beg you not to say a word to lady maulevrier on this subject you will do I the greatest injury if you speak of that man i entreat you -- ' but mary be go she pass steadman with she head hold high and she eye sparkling with anger all that be generous compassionate womanly in she nature be up in arm against she grandmother 's steward of all other thing mary haselden most detested cruelty and she could see in steadman 's opposition to she wish nothing but the most cold-hearted cruelty to a poor dependent on he charity she go in at the stable door shut and lock it and put the key in she pocket as usual but she have little hope that this mode of access would be leave open to she she know enough of jame steadman 's character from hearsay rather than from experience to feel sure that he would not easily give way she be not surprised therefore on return from she ride on the follow afternoon to find the disused harness-room half fill with truss of straw and the door of communication completely block it would be impossible for she to remove that barricade without assistance and then how could she be sure that the door itself be not nail up or secure in some way it be a delicious sunny afternoon and she could picture the lonely old man sit in he circle of greenery beside the dial which for he have register so many dreary and solitary hour wait for the little ray of social sunlight which she presence shed over he monotonous life he have tell she that she be like the sunshine to he -- better than sunshine -- and she have promise not to forsake he she picture he wait with he hand clasp upon he crutch-stick he chin rest upon he hand he eye pore on the ground as she have see he for the first time and as the stable clock chime the quarter he would begin to think himself abandon forget if indeed he take any count of the passage of time of which she be not sure he mind seem to have sink into a condition which be between dream and wake a state to which the outside world seem only half real -- a phase of be in which there be neither past nor future only the insufferable monotony of a everlasting _ now _ pity be so near akin to love that mary in she deep compassion for this lonely joyless loveless existence feel a regard which be almost affection for this strange old man whose very name be unknown to she true that there be much in he countenance and manner which be sinister and repellant he be a be calculate to inspire fear rather than love but the fact that he have court she presence and look to she for consolation have touch mary 's heart and she have become reconcile to all that be forbid and disagreeable in the lunatic physiognomy be he not the victim of a visitation which entitle he to respect as well as to pity for some day mary hold she peace remember steadman 's vehement entreaty that she should not speak of this subject to she grandmother she be silent but the image of the old man haunt she at all time and season she see he even in she dream -- those happy dream of the girl who love and be beloved and before whom the pathway of the future smile like a vision of paradise she hear he call to she with a piteous cry of distress and on wake from this troubled dream she fancy that he must be die and that this sound in she dream be one of those ghostly warning which give notice of death she be so unhappy about he altogether so distressed at be compel to break she word that she could not prevent she thought from dwelling upon he not even after she have pour out all she trouble to john hammond in a long letter in which she garden adventure and she little skirmish with steadman be graphically describe to she intense discomforture hammond reply that he thoroughly approve of steadman 's conduct in the matter however agreeable mary 's society might be to the lunatic mary 's life be far too precious to be put within the possibility of peril by any such _ tête-à-têtes _ if the person be the same old man whom hammond have see on the fell he be a most sinister-looking creature of whom any evil act might be fairly anticipate in a word mr hammond take steadman 's view of the matter and entreat he dearest mary to be careful and not to allow she warm heart to place she in circumstance of peril this be most disappointing to mary who expect she lover to agree with she upon every point and if he have be at fellside the difference of opinion might have give rise to they first quarrel but as she have a few hour ' leisure for reflection before the post go out she have time to get over she anger and to remember that promise of obedience give half in jest half in earnest at the little inn beyond dunmail raise so she write submissively enough only with just a touch of reproach at jack 's want of compassion for a poor old man who have such strong claim upon everybody 's pity the image of the poor old man be not to be banish from she thought and on that very afternoon when she letter be dispatch mary go on a visit of exploration to the stable to see if by any chance mr steadman 's plan for isolate he unhappy relative might be circumvent she go all over the stable -- into loose box harness and saddle room shed for wood and shed for root but she find no door open into the quadrangle save that door by which she have enter and which be securely defend by a barricade of straw that have be double by a fresh delivery of truss since she first see it but while she be prowl about the sweet-scented stable much disappointed at the result of she investigation she stumble against a ladder which lead to a open trap-door mary mount the ladder and find herself amidst the dusty atmosphere of a large hayloft half in shadow half in the hot bright sunlight a large shutter be open in the sloping roof the roof that slope towards the quadrangle a open patch admit light and air mary light and active as a squirrel spring upon a truss of hay and in another moment have swing herself in the opening of the shutter and be stand with she foot on the wooden ledge at the bottom of the massive frame and she figure support against the slope of thick thatched roof perch or half suspend thus she be just high enough to look over the top of the yew-tree hedge into the circle round the sundial yes there be the unhappy victim of fate and man 's inhumanity to man there sit the shrunken figure with drooping head and melancholy attitude -- the bent shoulder of feeble old age the patriarchal lock so appeal to pity there he sit with eye pore upon the ground just as she have see he the first time and while she have sit with he and talk with he he have seem to awaken out of that dull despondency gleam of pleasure have light up he wrinkled face -- he have grow animated a sentient living instead of a corpse alive it be very hard that this little interval of life these stray gleam of gladness should be deny to the poor old creature at the behest of jame steadman mary would have feel less angrily upon the subject have she believe in steadman 's supreme carefulness of she own safety but in this she do not believe she look upon the house-steward 's prudence as a hypocritical pretence a affectation of fidelity and wisdom by which he contrived to gratify the evil tendency of he own hard and cruel nature for some reason of he own perhaps constrain thereto by necessity he have give the old man a asylum for he age and infirmity : but while thus give he shelter he consider he a burden and from mere perversity of mind refuse he all such consolation as be possible to he afflict state mew he up as a prisoner cut he off from the companionship of he fellow-men two year ago before mary emerge from she tomboyhood she would have think very little of let herself out of the loft window and clamber down the side of the stable which be well furnished with those projection in the way of gutter drain-pipe and century-old ivy which make such a descent easy two year ago mary 's light figure would have swing itself down among the ivy leave and she would have glory in the thought of circumvent jame steadman so easily but now mary be a young lady -- a young lady engage to be marry and impress with the responsibility of she position deeply sensible of a new dignity for the preservation of which she be in a manner answerable to she lover ` what would _ he _ think of I if i go scramble down the ivy ' she ask herself ` and after he have approve of steadman 's heartless restriction it would be rank rebellion against he if i be to do it poor old man thou art so near and yet so far as lesbium 's song say ' she blow a kiss on the tip of she finger towards that sad solitary figure and then drop back into the dusty duskiness of the loft but although she new idea upon the subject of ` anstand ' -- or good behavior -- prevent she get the better of steadman by foul means she be all the more intent upon have she own way by fair means now that the impression of the old man 's sadness and solitude have be renew by the sight of the droop figure by the sundial she go back to the house and walk straight to she grandmother 's room lady maulevrier 's couch have be place in front of the open window from which she be watch the westward-sloping sun above the long line of hill dark helvellyn rugged nabb scarr and verdant fairfield with its two giant arm stretch out to enfold and shelter the smile valley ` heaven child what a object you be ' exclaim she ladyship as mary draw near ` why you gown be all over dust and you hair be -- why you hair be sprinkle with hay and clover i think you have learn to be tidy since you engagement what have you be do with yourself ' ' i have be up in the hayloft ' answer mary frankly and intent on one idea she say impetuously ` dear grandmother i want you to do I a favor -- a very great favor there be a poor old man a relation of steadman 's who live with he out of he mind but quite harmless and he be so sad and lonely so dreadfully sad and he like I to sit with he in the garden and tell he story and recite verse to he poor soul just as if he be a child do not you know and it be such a pleasure to I to be a little comfort to he in he lonely wretched life and jame steadman say i must not go near he because he may change at any moment into a dangerous lunatic and do I some kind of harm and i be not a bit afraid and i be sure he will not do anything of the kind and please grandmother tell steadman that i be to be allow to go and sit with he poor old prisoner half a hour every afternoon ' carry along the current of she own impetuous thought mary have talk very fast and have not once look at she grandmother while she be speak but now at the end of she speech she eye seek lady maulevrier 's face in gentle entreaty and she recoil involuntarily at the sight she see there the classic feature be distort almost as they have be in the worst period of the paralytic seizure lady maulevrier be ghastly pale and she eye glare with a awful fire as they gaze at mary she whole frame be convulse and she the cripple whose right limb lay numbed and motionless upon the couch make a struggle motion as she raise herself a little with the left arm as if by very force of angry will she would have lift herself up erect before the girl who have offend she for a few moment she lip move dumbly and there be something unspeakably awful in those convulse feature that livid countenance and those voiceless syllable tremble upon the white dry lip at last speech come ` girl you be create to torment I ' she exclaim ` dear grandmother what harm have i do ' falter mary ` what harm you be a spy you very existence be a torment and a danger would to god that you be marry yes marry to a chimney-sweep even -- and out of my way ' ` if that be you only difficulty ' say mary haughtily ' i dare say mr hammond would be kind enough to marry I to-morrow and take I out of you ladyship 's way ' lady maulevrier 's head sink back upon she pillow those velvet and satin pillow rich with delicate point lace and crewel-work adornment the labor of mary and fräulein pillow which could not bring peace to the weary head or deaden the torture of memory the pale face recover its wonted calm the heavy lip droop over the weary eye and for a few moment there be silence in the room then lady maulevrier raise she eyelid and look at she granddaughter imploringly pathetically ` forgive I mary ' she say ' i do not know what i be say just now but whatever it be forgive and forget it i be a wretched old woman heart sick heart sore wear out by pain and weariness there be time when i be beside myself moment when i be not much saner than steadman 's lunatic uncle this be one of my worst day and you come bounce in upon I and tortured my nerve by you breathless torrent of word pray forgive I if i say anything rude ' ` if ' think mary : but she try to be charitable and to believe that lady maulevrier 's attack upon she be a new phase of hysteria so she murmur meekly ` there be nothing for I to forgive grandmother and i be very sorry i disturbed you ' she be go to leave the room think that she absence would be a relief to the invalid when lady maulevrier call she back ` you be ask I something -- something about that old man of steadman 's ' she say with a weary air half indifference half the lassitude natural to a invalid who sink under the burden of monotonous day ` what be it all about i forget ' mary repeat she request but this time in measure tone ` my dear i be sure that steadman be only properly prudent ' answer lady maulevrier ` and that it would never do for I to interfere in this matter it stand to reason that he must know he old kinsman 's temperament much better than you can after you half-hour interview with he in the garden pray how long have these garden scene be go on by-the-by ' ask she ladyship with a search look at mary 's downcast face the girl have not altogether recover from the rude shock of she grandmother 's late attack ` about three week ' falter mary ` but it be more than a week now since i be in the garden it be quite by accident that i first go there perhaps i ought to explain ' and mary not be gainsay go on to describe that first afternoon when she have see the old man brood in the sun she draw quite a pathetic picture of he joyless solitude whilst all nature around and about he be look so glad in the spring sunshine there be a long silence a silence of some minute when she have do and lady maulevrier lay with lowered eyelid deep in think mary begin to hope that she have touch she grandmother 's heart and that she request would be grant : but she be soon undeceived ' i be sorry to be oblige to refuse you a favor mary but i must stand by steadman ' say she ladyship ` when i give steadman permission to shelter he aged kinsman in my house i make it a condition that the old man should be keep in the strictest care by himself and he wife and that nobody in this establishment should be trouble by he this condition have be so scrupulously adhere to that the old man 's existence be know to no one in this house except you and I and you have discover the fact only by accident i must beg you to keep this secret to yourself steadman have particular reason for wish to conceal the fact of he uncle 's residence here the old man be not actually a lunatic if he be we should be violate the law by keep he here he be only imbecile from extreme old age the body have outlive the mind that be all but should any officious functionary come down upon fellside this imbecility might be call madness and the poor old creature whom you regard so compassionately and whose case you think so pitiable here would be carry off to a pauper lunatic asylum which i can assure you would be a much worse imprisonment than fellside manor ' ` yes indeed grandmother ' exclaim mary whose vivid imagination conjure up a vision of padded cell strait-waist-coats murderously-inclined keeper chain handcuffs and bread and water diet ` now i understand why the poor old soul have be keep so close -- why nobody know of he existence i beg steadman 's pardon with all my heart he be a much better fellow than i think he ' ` steadman be a thoroughly good fellow and as true as steel ' say she ladyship ` no one can know that so well as the mistress he have serve faithfully for nearly half a century i hope mary you have not be chatter to fräulein or any one else about you discovery ' ` no grandmother i have not say a word to a mortal but -- ' ` oh there be a but be there i understand you have not be so reticent in you letter to mr hammond ' ' i tell he all that happen to I there be very little to write about at fellside yet i contrive to send he volume i often wonder what poor girl do in the day of miss austen 's novel when letter cost a shilling or eighteen penny for postage and have to be pay for by the recipient it must have be such a terrible check upon affection ' ` and upon twaddle ' say lady maulevrier ` well you tell mr hammond about steadman 's old uncle what do he say ' ` he thoroughly approve steadman 's conduct in forbid I to go and see he ' answer mary ' i could not help think it rather unkind of he but of course i feel that he must be right ' conclude mary as much as to say that she lover be necessarily infallible ' i always think mr hammond a sensible young man and i be glad to find that he conduct do not belie my good opinion ' say lady maulevrier ` and now my dear you have better go and make yourself decent before dinner i be very weary this afternoon and even we little talk have exhaust I ' ` yes dear grandmother i be go this instant but let I ask one question : what be the poor old man 's name ' ` he name ' say she ladyship look at mary with a puzzle air like a person whose thought be far away ` he name -- oh steadman i suppose like he nephew 's but if i ever hear the name i have forget it and i do not know whether the kinship be on the father 's or the mother 's side steadman ask my permission to give shelter to a helpless old relative and i give it that be really all i remember ' ` only one other question ' plead mary who be brimful of curiosity upon this particular subject ` have he be at fellside very long ' ` oh i really do not know a year or two or three perhaps life in this house be all of a piece i hardly keep count of time ' ` there be one thing that puzzle I very much ' say mary still linger near she grandmother 's couch the balmy evening air caress she as she lean against the embrasure of the wide tudor window the sun draw nearer to the edge of the hill a orb of yellow flame soon to change to a gigantic disk of lurid fire ' i think from the old man 's talk that he too must be a old servant in we family he talk of maulevrier castle and say that i remind he of a picture by lely a portrait of a lady maulevrier ` it be quite possible that he may have be in service there though i do not remember to have hear anything about it ' answer she ladyship carelessly ` the steadman come from that part of the country and theirs be a hereditary service good-night mary i be utterly weary look at that glorious light yonder that mighty world of fire and flame without which we little world would be dark and dreary i often think of that speech of macbeth 's i ` gin to be aweary of the sun there come a time mary when even the sun be a burden ' ` only for such a man as macbeth ' say mary ' a man steep in crime who can wonder that he want to hide himself from the sun but dear grandmother there ought to be plenty of happiness leave for you even if you recovery be slow to come you be so clever you have such resource in you own mind and memory and you have you grandchild who love you dearly ' add mary tenderly she nature be so full of pity that a entirely new affection have grow up in she mind for lady maulevrier since that terrible evening of the paralytic stroke ` yes and whose love as exemplify by lesbium be show in a hurry scrap of a letter scrawl once a week -- a bone throw to a hungry dog ' say she ladyship bitterly ` lesbia be so lovely and she be so surround by flatterer and admirer ' murmured mary excusingly ` oh my dear if she have a heart she would not forget I even in the midst of she flatterer good-night again mary do not try to console I for some nature consolation and soothing suggestion be like flower throw upon a granite tomb they do just as much and just as little good to the heart that lie under the stone good-night ' mary stoop to kiss she grandmother 's forehead and find it cold as marble she murmur a loving good-night and leave the mistress of fellside in she loneliness a footman would come in and light the lamp and draw the velvet curtain presently and shut out the later glory of sunset and then the butler himself would come and arrange the little dinner table by she ladyship 's couch and would himself preside over the invalid 's simple dinner which would be serve exquisitely with all that be daintiest and most costly in salviatus glass and antique silver yet better the dinner of herb and love and peace withal than the choicest fare or the most perfect service before the come of the servant and the lamp there be a pause of silence and loneliness a interval during which lady maulevrier lay gaze at the decline orb the lower rim of which now rest on the edge of the hill it seem to grow larger and more dazzling as she look at it suddenly she clasp she leave hand across she eye and say aloud -- ` oh what a hateful life almost half a century of lie and hypocricy and prevarication and meanness for what for the glory of a empty name and for a fortune that may slip from my dead hand to become the prey of rogue and adventurer who can forecast the future ' chapter xxv carte blanche lady kirkbank 's house in arlington street be know to half

to think of it all society be fast nowadays or at any rate all society worth living in and then again lesbium be just one of those cool-headed girl who would keep herself head uppermost in a maelstrom she know on which side she bread be buttered look how easily she chuck you up because she do not think you good enough she 'll make use of this lady kirkbank who be a good soul i be tell and will make

we last year : the south american girl with the big eye and a complexion like a toad the forfarshire girl with freckle and unsophisticated carrot those lovely spanish eye say lady k -- that titianesque auburn hair but it do not answer both the girl be plain and they have go back to they native obscurity spinster still but this be a real thorough-bred one -- blood form pace all there ' ` who be she ' drawl he friend ` lord maulevrier 's sister lady lesbium haselden have money too i believe rich grandmother old lady bury alive in westmoreland horrid old miser ' ' i should not mind marry a miser 's granddaughter ' say the other ` so nice to know that some wretched old idiot have scrape and hoard through a lifetime of deprivation and self-denial in order that one may spend he money when he be under the sod ' lady lesbium be accept everywhere or almost everywhere as the beauty of the season there be six or seven other girl who aspire to the same proud position who be assert by they own particular friend to have win it just as there be generally four or five horse which claim to be first favorite but the bet be all in favor of lady lesbium lady kirkbank tell she that she be turn everyone 's head and lesbium be quite willing to believe she but be lesbium 's own head quite steady in this whirlpool that be a question which she do not take the trouble to ask herself she heart be tranquil enough cold as marble no shield and safeguard so secure against the fire of new love as a old love hardly cold lesbium tell herself that she heart be a sepulchre a urn which hold a handful of ash the ash of she passion for john hammond it be a fire quite burn out she think but that extinguish flame have leave death-like coldness this be lesbium 's own diagnosis of she case : but the real truth be that among the herd of man she have meet almost all of they ready to fall down and worship she there be not one who have catch she fancy she nature be shallow enough to be pass fickle the passion which she have take for love be little more than a girl 's fancy but the man who have power to awaken that fancy as john hammond have do have not yet appear in lady kirkbank 's circle ` what a cold-hearted creature you must be ' say georgie ` you do not seem to admire any of my favorite man ' ` they be very nice ' lesbium answer languidly ` but they be all alike they say the same thing -- wear the same clothes -- sit in the same attitude one would think they be all drill in a body every morning before they go out mr nightshade the actor who come to supper the other night be the only man i have see who have a spark of originality ' ` you be right ' answer lady kirkbank ` there be a appalling sameness in man : only it be odd you should find it out so soon i never discover it till i be a old woman how i envy cleopatra she caesar and she antony no mistake one of those for the other mary stuart too what mark variety of character she have a opportunity of study in rizzio and chastelard darnley and bothwell ah child that be what it be to _ live _ ' ` mary be very interesting ' sigh lesbia ` but i fear she be not a correct person ' ` my love what correct person ever be interesting history draw a misty halo round a sinner of that kind till one almost believe she a saint i think mary stuart froude 's mary simply perfect ' lesbium have begin by blush at lady kirkbank 's opinion but she be now use to the audacity of the lady 's sentiment and the almost infantile candor with which she give utterance to they lady kirkbank like to make she friend laugh it be all she could do now in order to be admire and there be nothing like audacity for make people laugh nowadays lady kirkbank be a close student of all those delightful book of french memoirs which bring the tittle-tattle of the regency and the scandal of loui the fifteenth 's reign so vividly before we : and she have unconsciously found she manners and she way of think and talk upon that easy-going but elegant age she do not want to seem better than woman who have be so altogether charming she fortify the frivolity of historical parisian manners by a dash of the british sport character she drive shot jump over five-barred gate contrived on the verge of seventy to be as active we a young woman and she flatter herself that the mixture of wit audacity sport and good-nature be full of fascination however this might be it be certain that a good many people like she chiefly perhaps because she be good-natured and a little on account of that admirable cook to lesbium who have be weary to loathing of she old life amidst the hill and waterfall of westmoreland this new life be one perpetual round of pleasure she fling herself with all she heart and mind into the amusement of the moment she know neither weariness nor satiety to ride in the park in the morning to go to a luncheon party a garden party to drive in the park for half a hour after the garden party to rush home and dress for the fourth or fifth time and then off to a dinner and from dinner to drum and from drum to big ball at which rumor say the prince and princess be to be present : and so from eleven o'clock in the morning till four or five o'clock next morning the giddy whirl go on : and every hour be so occupy by pleasure engagement that it be difficult to squeeze in a occasional morning for shopping -- necessary to go to the shop sometimes or one would not know how many thing one really want -- or for a indispensable interview with the dressmaker those morning at the shop be hardly the least agreeable of lesbium 's hour to a girl bring up in one perpetual _ tête-à-tête _ with green hill-side and silvery watercourse the west end shop be as garden of eden as aladdin cave as anything everything that be rapturous and intoxicating lesbium the clear-headed the cold-hearted fairly lose she sens when she go into one of those exquisite shop where a confusion of brocade and satin lay about in dazzling mass of richest color with here and there a bunch of lily a cluster of rose a tortoise-shell fan a ostrich feather or a flounce of peerless point d'alençon fling carelessly athwart the sheen of a wine-dark velvet or golden-hued satin lady maulevrier have say lesbium be to have _ carte blanche _ so lesbia buy everything she want or fancy she want or that the shop-people thought she must want or that lady kirkbank happen to admire the shop-people be so obliging and so deeply oblige by lesbium 's patronage she be exactly the kind of customer they like to serve she flit about they showroom like a beautiful butterfly hover over a flower-bed -- she eye catch by every novelty she never ask the price of anything : and lady kirkbank inform they in confidence that she be a great heiress with a millionaire grandmother who indulge she every whim other high bear young lady shop upon fix allowance and sorely perplexed to make both end meet look with eye of envy upon this girl and then come the visit to the dressmaker it happen after all that kate kearney be not intrust with lady lesbium 's frock miss kearney be the fashion and could pick and choose she customer and as she be a young lady of good business aptitude she have a liking for ready money or at least half-yearly settlement and find that lady kirkbank be much more willing to give new order than to pay old account she have respectfully inform she ladyship that a pressure of business would prevent she execute any further demand from arlington street while the necessity of post she ledger oblige she to request the favor of a immediate cheque the little skirmish -- per letter -- occur while lady kirkbank be at canne and miss kearney 's conduct be stigmatise as insolent and ungrateful since have not she lady kirkbank by the mere fact of she patronage give this young person she chief claim to fashion ' i shall drop she ' say georgie ` and go back to poor old seraphine who be worth a cartload of such irish adventuress ' so to madame seraphine of clanricarde place lady lesbium be take as a lamb to the slaughter-house seraphine have make lady kirkbank 's clothes off and on for the last thirty year seraphine and georgium have grow old together lady kirkbank be always drop seraphine and take she up again quarrel and make friend with she they write each other little note in which lady kirkbank call the dressmaker she _ cher ange _ -- she _ bonne chatte _ she _ chère vielle sotte _ -- and all manner of affectionate name -- and in which seraphine occasionally threaten the lady with the dire engine of the law if money be not forthcoming before Saturday evening lady kirkbank within those thirty year have pay seraphine many thousand but she have never once get herself out of the dear creature 's debt all she payment be payment on account a hundred pound or fifty -- or a occasional cheque for two hundred and fifty when sir george have be lucky at newmarket and doncaster but the roll nucleus of debt go roll on grow bigger every year until the payment on account need to be larger or more numerous than of old to keep seraphine in good humor seraphine be a woman of genius and versatility and have more than one art at she finger ' end -- those skinny and claw-shaped finger the nail whereof be not always clean she take charge of she customer 's figure and make they corset and lecture they if they allow nature to get the upper hand ` if madame 's waist get one quarter of a inch thicker it must be that i renounce to make she gown ' she would tell a ponderous matron with cool insolence and the matron would stand abashed before the little sallow hooked-nosed keen eyed jewess like a child before a severe mother ` oh seraphine do you really think that i be stouter ' the customer would ask feebly pant in she tighten corset ` be it that i think so why that jump to the eye madame have always that little air of reuben even in the flower of she youth -- but now -- it be a ruben of the fabourg du temple ' and horrify at the idea of she vulgarised charm the meek matron would consent to encase herself in one of seraphine 's severest corset call in bitterest mockery _ à la santé _ -- at five guinea -- in order that the dressmaker might measure she for a forty-guinea gown ' a plain satin gown my dear with a eighteenpenny frilling round the neck and sleeve and not so much trim as would go round my little finger it be positive robbery ' the matron tell she friend afterwards not the less proud of she skin-tight high shouldered sleeve and the peerless flow of she train seraphine be a artist in complexion and it be she who provide she middle-aged and elderly customer with the lily and rose of youth lady kirkbank 's town complexion be superintend by seraphine sometimes even manipulate by those harpy-like claw the eyebrow of which lesbium complain be only eyebrow _ de province _ -- eyebrow _ de voyage _ in london georgie be much more particular and seraphine be often in arlington street with she little morocco bag of wash and cream and brush and sponge to prepare lady kirkbank for some great party and to instruct lady kirkbank 's maid at such time georgie be all affection for the little dressmaker ' _ ma chatte _ you have make I positively adorable ' she would say peer at she reflection in the ivory hand-mirror a dazzling image of rouge and bismuth carmine lip diamond and frizzy yellow hair ' i verily believe i look under thirty -- but do not you think this gown be a thought too _ decolletée -- un peu trop de peau hein _ ' ` not for you lady kirkbank with you fine shoulder shoulder be of no age -- _ les épaules sont la vraie fontaine de jouvence pour les jolies femme _ ' ` you be such a witty creature seraphine fifine you ought to be a descendant of that wicked old madame du deffand rilboche give madame some more chartreuse ' and lady kirkbank and the dressmaker would chink they liqueur glass in amity before the lady gather up she satin train and allow she peerless shoulder to be muffle in a plush mantle to go down to she carriage fortify by that last glass of green chartreuse there be always the finest chartreuse and curaçoa in a liqueur cabinet on lady kirkbank 's dressing-table the cabinet form a companion to the dressing-case which contain all those creamy and rose-hued cosmetic powder brush and medicament which be necessary for the manufacture of georgie 's complexion the third bottle in the liqueur case hold cognac and this as rilboche the maid know be oftenest replenish yet nobody could accuse lady kirkbank of intemperate habit the liqueur box only supply the peg that be occasionally want to screw the superior mind to concert pitch ` one must always be at concert pitch in society do not you know my dear ' say georgie to she young protégée thus it happen that miss kearney have behave badly lesbium be carry off to dear old seraphine and deliver over to that modern witch as a sacrifice tie to the horn of the altar clanricarde place be a little nook of queen anne house -- genuine queen anne be it understand -- between piccadilly and st jame 's palace and hardly five minute ' walk from arlington street it be a quiet little _ cul de sac _ in the very heart of the fashionable world and here of a afternoon might be see the carriage of madame seraphine 's customer block the whole of the carriage way and choke up the narrow entrance to the street which widen considerably at the inner end madame seraphine 's house be at the end a narrow house with tall old-fashioned window curtain with amber satin it be a small dark house and exhale occasional odour of garlic and main sewer : but the staircase be a gem in old oak and the furniture in the triple telescopic drawing room dwindle to a closet at the end be genuine loui seize seraphine herself be the only shabby thing in the house -- a wizened little woman with a wicked old jewish face and one shoulder higher than the other dress in a shiny black moire gown year after moire have be explode and with a rag of old lace upon she sleek black hair -- raven black hair and the only good thing about she appearance one ornament and one only have seraphine ever be guilty of wear and that be a old-fashioned half-hoop ring of brazilian diamond brilliant of the first water this ring she call she yard measure and she be in the habit of use it as she standard of purity and compare it with any diamond which she customer submit to she inspection for the clever little dressmaker have a feeling heart for a lady in difficulty and be in the habit of lend money on good security and on term that be almost reasonable as compare with the usurious rate one read of in the newspaper lesbium 's first sensation upon have this accomplish person present to she be one of shrink and disgust there be something sinister in the sallow face the small shrewd eye and long hooked nose the crooked figure and claw-shaped hand but when madame seraphine begin to talk about gown and bid she acolyte -- smartly-dressed young woman with please countenance -- bring forth marvel of brocade and satin embroidery stamped velvet bullion fringe and ostrich feather flouncing lesbia become interested and forget the unholy aspect of the high priestess lady kirkbank and the dressmaker discuss lesbium 's charm as calmly as if she have be out of the room ` what do you think of she figure ' ask lady kirkbank ` one can not criticise what do not exist ' reply the dressmaker in french ` the young lady have no figure she have evidently be bring up in the country ' and then with rapid bird-like movement and with she head on one side seraphine measure lesbium 's waist and bust mutter little argotic expression _ sotto voce _ as she do so ` waist three inch too large shoulder six inch too narrow ' she say decisively and she dictate some figure to one of the damsel who write they down in a order-book ` what do that mean ' ask lesbia not at all approve of such cavalier treatment ` only that seraphine will make you corset the right size ' answer lady kirkbank ` what three inch too small for my waist and six too wide for my shoulder ' ` my love you must have a figure ' reply lady kirkbank conclusively ` it be not what you be but what you ought to be that have to be consider ' so lesbia the cool-headed who be also the weak-minded consent to have she figure adjust to the regulation mark of absolute beauty as understand by madame seraphine it be only when she complexion come under discussion and seraphine venture to suggest that she would be all the better for a little accentuation of she eyebrow and darken of she lash that lesbia make a stand ` what would my grandmother think of I if she hear i paint ' she ask indignantly lady kirkbank laugh at she _ naïveté _ ` my dear child you grandmother be just half a century behind the age ' she say ' i hope you be not go to allow you life in london to be regulate by a oracle at grasmere ' ' i be not go to paint my face ' reply lesbium firmly ` well perhaps you be right the eyebrow be a little weak and undecided seraphine as you say and the lash would be all the better for you famous cosmetic but after all there be a charm in what the painter call sincerity and any little error of detail will prove the genuineness of lady lesbium 's beauty one _ may _ be too artistic ' and lady kirkbank give a complacent glance at she own image in one of the marie antoinette mirror pleased with the general effect of arched brow darken eyelid and a daisy bonnet the fair georgie generally affect field-flower and other simplicity which would have be become to a beauty of eighteen ` one be oblige to smother one 's self in satin and velvet for ball and dinner ' say lady kirkbank when she discuss the great question of gown ` but i know i always look my best in my cotton frock and straw hat ' that first visit to seraphine 's den -- den as terrible do one but know it as that antediluvian hyena-cave at torquay where the threshold be worn by the body of beast drag across it and the ground pave with they bone -- that first visit be a serious business later interview might be mere frivolity half-an-hour waste in look at new fashion a order give carelessly on the spur of the moment but upon this occasion lady kirkbank have to arm she young _ protégée _ for the come campaign and the question be to the last degree serious the chaperon and the dressmaker put they head together look at fashion plate talk solemnly of worth and he compeer of the gown that be be worn by bernhardt and pierson and croisette and other star of the parisian stage and then lady kirkbank give she order lesbium listen and assent nothing be say about price but lesbium have a vague idea that some of the thing would be rather expensive and she venture to ask lady kirkbank if she be not order too many gown ` my dear lady maulevrier say you be to have _ carte blanche _ ' reply georgie solemnly ` you dear grandmother be as rich as croesus and she be generosity itself and how should i ever forgive myself if i allow you to appear in society in a inadequate style you have to take a high place the very highest place lesbium and you must be dress in accordance with that position ' lesbium say no more after all it be lady kirkbank 's business and not hers see have be entrust to lady kirkbank as to a person who thoroughly know the great world and she must submit to be govern by the wisdom and experience of she chaperon if the bill be heavy that would be lady kirkbank 's affair and no doubt dear grandmother be rich enough to afford anything lesbia want she have be tell that she be to take rank among heiress lady maulevrier have give she granddaughter some old-fashioned ornament topaz amethyst turquoise -- jewel that have belong to dead and go talmash and angersthorpe -- to be reset this entail a visit to a bond street jeweller and in the dazzling glass-case on the counter of the bond street establishment lesbium see a good many thing which she feel be real necessity to she new phase of existence and these with lady kirkbank 's approval she order they be not important matter half-a-dozen gold bangle of real oriental workmanship three or four jewelled arrow fly and beetle and caterpillar to pin on she lace and flower a diamond clasp for she pearl necklace a dear little gold hunter to wear when she ride in the park a diamond butterfly to light up that old-fashioned amethyst _ parure _ which the jeweller be to reset with a artistic admixture of brilliant ' i be sure you would not like the effect without diamond ' say the jeweller ` you amethyst be very fine but they be dark and heavy in tone and want a good deal of lighting-up especially for the present fashion of half-lighted room if you will allow I to use my own discretion and mix in a few brilliant i shall be able to produce a really artistic _ parure _ otherwise i would not recommend you to touch they the present setting be clumsy and inelegant but i really do not know that i could improve upon it without a admixture of brilliant ' ` will the diamond add very much to the expense ' lesbium inquire timidly ` my dear child you be perfectly safe in leave the matter in mr cabochon 's hand ' interpose lady kirkbank who have particular reason for wish to be on good term with the head of the establishment ` you dear grandmother give you the amethyst to be reset and of course she would wish it to be do in a artistic manner otherwise as mr cabochon judiciously say why have the stone reset at all better wear they in all they present hideousness ' of course after this lesbium consent to the amethyst be deal with accord to mr cabochon 's taste ` which be simply perfect ' interjected lady kirkbank and now lesbium 's campaign begin in real earnest -- a life of pleasure a life of utter selfishness and self-indulgence which would go far to pervert the strongest mind tarnish the purest nature to dress and be admire -- that be what lesbium 's life mean from morning till night she have no higher or nobler aim even on Sunday morning at the fashionable church where the woman sit on one side of the nave and the man on the other where divinest music be as a pair of wing on which the enraptured soul fly heavenward -- even here lesbium think more of she bonnet and glove -- the _ chic _ or non - _ chic _ of she whole costume than of the service she might kneel gracefully with she bent head just reveal the ivory whiteness of a lovely throat between the edge of she lace frilling and the flower in she bonnet she might look the fairest image of devotion but how could a woman pray whose heart be a milliner 's shop whose highest ambition be to be prettier and better dress than other woman the season be six week old it be ascot week the crowning glory of the year and lesbium and she chaperon have secure ticket for the royal enclosure -- or it may be say rather that lesbium have secure they -- for the master of the royal buckhound might have omit poor old lady kirkbank 's familiar name from he list if it have not be for that lovely girl who go everywhere under the veteran 's wing six week and lesbium 's appearance in society have be one perpetual triumph but as yet nothing serious have happen she have have no offer half a dozen man have try they hardest to propose to she -- have sit out dance have waylay she in conservatory and in back drawing-room in lobby while she wait for she carriage -- have look at she piteously with tenderest declaration tremble on they lip but she have contrived to keep they at bay to strike they dumb by she coldness or confound they by she coquetry for all these be ineligible whom lady lesbium haselden do not want to have the trouble of refuse lady kirkbank be in no haste to marry she _ protégée _ -- nay it be much more to she interest that lesbium should remain single for three or four season and that she lady kirkbank might have the advantage of close association with the young beauty and the privilege of spending lady maulevrier 's money but she would have like to be able to inform lesbium 's grandmother of some tremendous conquest -- the subjugation of a worthy victim this herd of nobody -- younger son with courtesy title and empty pocket ruin guardsman briefless barrister -- what be the use of tell lady maulevrier about such barren victory lady kirkbank therefore contented herself with expatiate upon lesbium 's triumph in a general way : how graciously the princess speak to she and about she how she have be ask to sit on the dais at the ball at marlborough house and have dance in the royal quadrille ` have lesbium happen to meet lord hartfield ' lady maulevrier ask incidentally in one of she letter no lord hartfield be in london for he have make a great speech in the lord on a question of vital interest but he be not go into society or at any rate into society of a frivolous kind he have give himself up to politics as so many young man do nowadays which be altogether horrid of they he name have appear in the list of guest at one or two cabinet dinner but the world of polo match and afternoon tea dance and drum private theatricals and orlean house supper know he not as a competitor on the fashionable race-course lord hartfield be in common parlance out of the running and now on this glorious June day this Thursday of thursday the ascot cup day for the first time since lesbium 's début lady kirkbank have occasion to smile upon a admirer whose pretension be worthy of the highest consideration mr smithson of park lane and rood hall near henley and formosa cowe and le bouge deauville and a good many other place too numerous to mention be repute to be one of the richest commoner in england he be a man of that uncertain period of life which enemy call middle age and friend call youth that he would never see a five-and-thirtieth birthday again be certain but whether he have pass the rubicon of forty be open to doubt it be possible that he be enjoy those few golden year between thirty-five and forty which for the wealthy bachelor constitute verily the prime and summer-tide of life wisdom have come experience have be buy taste have be cultivate the man have educate himself to the uttermost in the great school of daily life he know he world thoroughly whatever that world be and he know how to enjoy every gift and every advantage which providence have bestow upon he mr smithson be a great authority on the stock exchange though he have cease for the last three or four year to frequent the ` house ' or to be see in the purlieus of throgmorton street indeed he have a air of hardly know he way to the city of be acquaint with that part of london only by hearsay he complain that he horse shy at pass temple bar and yet a few year ago mr smithson 's city operation have be on a very extensive scale : it be in the rise and fall of commodity rather than of stock and share that horace smithson have make he money he have exercise occult influence upon the trade of the great city of the world itself whereof that city be in a manner the keystone iron have rise or fall at he beck at the breath of he nostril cochineal have go up in the market at a almost magical rate as if the whole civilised world have become suddenly intent upon dye its garment red nay as if even the naked savage of the gold coast and the tribe of central africa be bent on stain they dusky skin with the body of the female coccus favor by a hint from smithson he particular friend follow he lead and rush into the market to buy all the cochineal that could be have to buy at any price since the market be rise hourly and then all in a moment as the sky cloud over on a summer day there come a dulness in the cochineal market and the female coccus be be sell at a enormous sacrifice and anon it leak out that mr smithson have grow tired of cochineal and have be sell for the last week or two and it be noised abroad that this rise and fall in coccus have bring mr smithson seventy thousand pound mr smithson be say to have commence life in a very humble capacity there be some who declare he be the very youth who stoop to pick up a pin in a parisian banker 's courtyard after he service as clerk have just be reject by the firm and who be thereupon recognize as a youth worthy of favor and take into the banker 's office but this touching incident of the pin be too ancient a tradition to fit mr smithson still under forty some there be who remember he eighteen year ago as a adventurer in the great wilderness of london penniless friendless a jack-of-all-trade live as the bird of the air live and with as little certainty of future maintenance and then mr smithson disappear for a space -- he go under as he friend call it to re-appear fifteen year later as smithson the millionaire he have be in peru mexico californium he have trade in hide in diamond in silver in stock and share and now he be the great smithson whose voice be the voice of a oracle who be suppose to be able to make the fortune of other man by a word or a wink a nod or a little look across the crowd and whom all the man and woman in london society -- short of that exclusive circle which do _ not _ open its rank to smithson -- be ready to cherish and admire mr smithson have be in petersburg pari vienna all over civilised europe during the last five week whether on business or on pleasure bent nobody know he affect to be a elegant idler but it be say by the initiate that wherever smithson go the market rise or fall and hide iron copper or tin feel the influence of he presence he come back to london in time for the cup day and in time to fall desperately in love with lesbium whom he meet for the first time in the royal enclosure she be dress in white purest ivory white from top to toe -- radiant dazzling under a immense sunshade fringe with creamy marabout she complexion -- untouched by seraphine -- she dark and glossy hair she large violet eye luminous dark almost to blackness be all set off and accentuate by the absence of color in she costume even the cluster of exotic on she shoulder be of the same pure tint gardenia and lily of the valley mr smithson be formally present to the new beauty and receive with a cool contempt which rivet he chain he be so accustomed to be run after by woman that it be a new sensation to meet one who be not in the least impressed by he superior merit ' i do not suppose the girl know who i be ' he say to himself for although he have a very good idea of he intrinsic worth he know that he wealth rank first among he merit but on after occasion when lesbium have be tell all that could be tell to the advantage of mr smithson she accept he homage with the same indifference and treat he with less favor than she accord to the ruin guardsman and younger son who be die for she chapter xxvi ` proud can i never be of what i hate ' it be a Saturday afternoon and even in that great world which have no occupation in life except to amuse itself whose day be all holiday there be a sort of exceptional flavor a kind of extra excitement on Saturday afternoon distinguish by polo match at hurlingham just as Saturday evening be by the production of new play at fashionable theater there be a great military polo match for this particular Saturday -- lancer against dragoon it be a lovely June afternoon and hurlingham would be at its best the cool greensward the branch tree the flowing river would afford a unspeakable relief after the block of carriage in bond street and the heated air of london where even the park feel baked and arid and to hurlingham lady kirkbank drive directly after luncheon lesbium lean back in the barouche listen calmly while she chaperon expatiate upon the wealth and possession of horace smithson it be now ten day since the meeting at ascot and mr smithson have contrived to see a great deal of lesbium in that short time he be invite almost everywhere and he have haunt she at afternoon and evening party he have sup in arlington street after the opera he have play card with lesbium and have enjoy the felicity of win she money he admiration be obvious and there be a seriousness in he manner of pursue she which show that in lady kirkbank 's unromantic phraseology ` the man mean business ' ` smithson be catch at last and i be glad of it ' say georgie ` the creature be a abominable flirt and have break more heart than any man in london he be all but the death of one of the dearest girl i know ' ` mr smithson break heart ' exclaimed lesbium languidly ' i should not have think that be in he line mr smithson be not a adoni nor be he manners particularly fascinating ' ` my child how fresh you be do you suppose it be the handsome man or the fascinating man for whom woman break they heart in society it be the rich man they all want to marry -- man like smithson who can give they diamond and yacht and a hunting stud and half a dozen fine house those be the prize -- the blue ribbon of the matrimonial race-course -- man like smithson who pretend to admire all the pretty woman who dangle and dangle and keep off other offer and give ten guinea bouquet and then at the end of the season be off to hombourg or the scotch moor without a word do you think that kind of treatment be not hard enough to break a penniless girl 's heart she see the golden prize within she grasp as she believe she think that she and poverty have part company for ever she imagine herself mistress of town house and country house yacht and stable and then one fine morning the gentleman be off and away do not you think that be enough to break a girl 's heart ' ' i can imagine that girl steep to the lip in poverty might be willing to marry mr smithson 's house and yacht ' answer lesbium in she low sweet voice with a faint sneer even amidst the sweetness ` but i think it must have be a happy release for any one to be let off the sacrifice at the last moment ' ` poor belle trinder do not think so ' ` who be belle trinder ' ` a essex parson 's daughter whom i take under my wing five year ago -- a splendid girl large and fair and just a trifle coarse -- not to be speak of in the same day with you dearest but still a decidedly handsome creature and she take remarkably well she be a very lively girl never run mute sir george use to say sir george be very fond of she she amuse he poor girl with she rather brainless rattle ' ` and mr smithson admire she ' ` follow she about everywhere send she whole flower garden in the way of bouquet and japanese basket and floral _ parure _ for she gown and opera box and concert ticket they name be always couple people use to call they bel and the dragon the poor child make up she mind she be to be mrs smithson she use to talk of what she would do for she own people -- the poor old father bury alive in a damp parsonage and struggle every winter with chronic bronchitis the four younger sister pine in dulness and penury the mother who hardly know what it be to rest from the continual worry of daily life ' ` poor thing ' sigh lesbium gaze admiringly at the handle of she last new sunshade ` belle use to talk of what she would do for they all ' pursued lady kirkbank ` father should go every year to the villa at monte carlo mother and the girl should have a month in park lane every season and they autumn holiday at one of mr smithson 's country house i know the world well enough to be sure that this kind of thing would never answer with a man like smithson it be only one man in a thousand -- the modern arthur the modern quixote -- who will marry a whole family i tell belle as much but she laugh she feel so secure of she power over the man he will do anything i ask he she say ' ` miss trinder must be a extraordinary young person ' observe lesbium scornfully ` the man have not propose have he ' ` no the actual proposal hang fire but belle think it be a settle thing all the same everybody talk to she as if she be engage to smithson and those poor ignorant vicarage girl use to write she long letter of congratulation envy she good fortune speculate about what she would do when she be marry the girl be too open and candid for london society -- talk too much give the view before she be sure of she fox sir george say all this silly talk come to smithson 's ear and one morning we read in the post that mr smithson have start the day before for algier where he be to stay at the house of the english consul and hunt lion we wait all day hope for some letter of explanation some friendly farewell which would mean _ à revoir _ but there be nothing and then poor belle give way altogether she shut herself up in she room and go out of one hysterical fit into another i never hear a girl sob so terribly she be not fit to be see for a week and then she go home to she father 's parsonage in the flat swampy country on the border of suffolk and eat she heart as byron call it and the worst of it be that she have no actual justification for consider herself jilt she have talk and other people have talk and among they they have settle the business but smithson have say hardly anything he have only flirt to he heart 's content and have spend a few hundred upon flower glove fan and opera ticket which perhaps would not have be accept by a girl with a strong sense of she own dignity ' ' i should think not indeed ' interject lesbia ` but which poor belle be only too delighted to get ' ` miss trinder must be very bad style ' say lesbium with languid scorn ` and mr smithson be a execrable person do she die ' ` no my dear she be alive poor soul ' ` you say she break she heart ' ` the heart may break yet brokenly live on ' quote lady kirkbank ` the disappointed young woman do not all die they take to district visit or rational dress or china painting or a ambulance brigade the lucky one marry well-to-do widower with large family and so slip into a comfortable groove by the time they be five-and-thirty poor belle be still single still bury in the damp parsonage where she paint plate and teacup and wear out my old gown just as she be wear out she own life poor creature ' ` the idea of any one want to marry mr smithson ' say lesbia ` it seem too dreadful ' ' a case of real destitution you think wait till you have see smithson 's house in park lane -- he team he yacht he orchid house in berkshire ' lesbium sigh she knowledge of london society be only seven week old and yet already the day of disenchantment have begin she be have she eye open to the stern reality of life a year ago when she appearance in the great world be still only a dream of the future she have picture to herself the crowd of suitor who would come to woo and she have resolve to choose the worthiest what would he be like that worthiest among the wooer that king arthur among she knight first and foremost he would be of rank higher than she own -- duke a marquis or one of the first and oldest among earl title and lofty lineage be indispensable it would be a fall a failure a disappointment be she to marry a commoner however distinguish the worthy one must be noble therefore and of the old nobility he must be young handsome intellectual he must stand out from among he peer by he gift of mind and person he must have win distinction in the arena of politics or diplomacy arm or letter he must be ` somebody ' she have be seven week in society and this modern arthur have not appear so far as she have be able to discover there be no such person the duke and marquis be mostly man of advanced year the young unmarried nobility be give over to sport play and foolishness she have hear of only one man who at all correspond with she ideal and he be lord hartfield but lord hartfield have give himself up to politics and be no doubt a prig lady kirkbank speak of he with contempt as a intolerable person but then lord hartfield be not in lady kirkbank 's set he belong to that serious circle to which lady kirkbank 's house appear about as reputable a place of gathering as a booth on a race-course and now lady kirkbank tell lesbium that this mr smithson a nobody with a great fortune be a man whose address she the sister of lord maulevrier ought to welcome mr smithson who claim to be a lineal descendant of that sir michael carrington standard-bearer to coeur de lion in the holy land whose descendant change they name to smith during the war of the rose mr smithson bodily proclaimed himself a scion of this good old county family and bear on he plate and he coach panel the elephant 's head and the three demi-griffin of the hertfordshire smith who only smile and shrug they shoulder when they be compliment upon the splendid surroundings of they cousin who could tell some lateral branch of the standard-bearer 's family tree might have bear this illustrious twig lady kirkbank and all lady kirkbank 's friend seem to have conspire to teach lesbium haselden one lesson and that lesson mean that money be the first prize in the great game of life money rank before everything -- before title before noble lineage genius fame beauty courage honor money be alpha and omega the beginning and the end mr smithson whose antecedent be as cloudy as those of aphrodite be a greater man than a peer whose broad acre only bring he two per cent or half of whose farm be tenantless and he field grow cockle instead of barley yes one by one lady lesbium 's illusion be reft from she a year ago she have fancy beauty all-powerful a gift which must ensure to its possessor dominion over all the kingdom of the earth rank intellect fame would bow down before that magical diadem and behold she have be shine upon london society for seven week and only empty head and empty pocket have bow down -- the frivolous the ineligible -- and mr smithson another illusion which have be dispel be lesbium 's comfortable idea of she own expectation she grandmother have tell she that she might take rank among heiress and she have hold herself accordingly deem that she place be among the wealthiest and now since mr smithson 's appearance upon the scene lady kirkbank have inform she young friend with noble candor that lady maulevrier 's fortune however large it might seem at grasmere would be a poor thing in london and that lady maulevrier 's idea about money be as old-fashioned as she notion about moral ` life be about six time as expensive as it be in you grandmother 's time ' say lady kirkbank as the carriage roll softly along the shabby road between knightsbridge and fulham ` it be the pace that kill society which use to jog along comfortably like the old brighton stage at ten mile a hour now go as fast as the brighton express in my mother 's time poor lord byron be hold up to the execration of respectable people as the type of cynical profligacy in my own time people talk about lord waterford but my dear the young man now be all byron and waterford without the genius of the one or the generosity of the other we be all go at steeplechase rate social success without money be impossible the rich american the successful jew will crowd we out unless we keep pace with they ah lesbia my dear girl there would be a great future before you if you could only make up you mind to accept mr smithson ' ` how do you know that he mean to propose to I ' ask lesbia mockingly ` perhaps he be only go to behave as he do to miss trinder ' ` lady lesbium haselden be a very different person from a country parson 's daughter ' answer she chaperon ` smithson tell I all about it afterwards he be really take with belle 's fine figure and good complexion but one of she particular friend tell he of she foolish talk about she sister and how well she mean to get they marry when she be mrs smithson this disgusted he he go down to essex reconnoiter the parsonage see one of the sister hang out cuff and collar in the orchard -- another feed the fowl -- both in shabby gown and country-made boot one of they with red hair and freckle the mother be bargaining for fish with a hawker at the kitchen door and these be the people he be expect to import into park lane under ceiling paint by leighton these be the people he be to exhibit on board he yacht to cart about on he drag i have half make up my mind to marry the girl but i would sooner have hang myself than marry she mother and sister so i take the first train for dover en route for algier say smithson and upon my word i could hardly blame the man ' conclude lady kirkbank they be drive up the narrow avenue to the gate of hurlingham by this time lesbium shock out she frock and look at she glove tan-coloured mousquetaire reach up to the elbow and embroidered to match she frock to-day she be a study in brown and gold brown satin petticoat embroider with marsh marigold little bronze shoe with marsh marigold tie on the lachet brown stocking with marsh marigold clock tunic brown foulard smother with quilling of soft brown lace princess bonnet of brown straw with a wreath of marsh marigold and a neat little buckle of brown diamond parasol brown satin with a immense bunch of marsh marigold on the top fan to match parasol the seat in front of the field be nearly all full when lady kirkbank and lesbium leave they carriage but they interest have be protect by a gentleman who have turn down two chair and sit between they on guard this be mr smithson ' i have be sit here for a hour keep you chair ' he say as he rise to greet they ` you have no idea what work i have have and how ferociously all the woman have look at I ' the match be go on the lancer be scuffle for the ball and afford a fine display of hog-maned pony and close-cropped young man in ideal boot but lesbium care very little about the match she be look along the serried rank of youth and beauty to see if anybody 's frock be smarter than she own no she could see nothing she like so well as she brown satin and buttercup she sit down in a perfectly contented frame of mind pleased with herself and with seraphine -- pleased even with mr smithson who have show himself devote by he patient attendance upon the empty chair after the match be over the two lady and they attendant stroll about the garden other man come and flutter round lesbium and woman and girl exchange endearing smile and pretty little word of greet with she and envy she the brown frock and buttercup and mr smithson at she chariot wheel and then they go to the lawn in front of the club-house which be so crowd that even mr smithson find it difficult to get a tea-table and would hardly have succeed so soon as he do if it have not be for the assistance of a couple of lesbium 's devoted guardsman who run to and fro and badger the waiter after much skirmishing they be seat at a rustic table the blue river gleam and glance in the distance the good old tree spread they broad shadow over the grass the company crowd and chatter and laugh -- a animated picture of pretty face smart gown big parasol japanese fan lesbium pour out the tea with the prettiest air of domesticity ` can you really pour out tea ' gasp a callow lieutenant gaze upon she with goggle enraptured eye ' i do not think you could do anything so earthly ' ' i can and drink it too ' answer lesbium laugh ' i adore tea cream and sugar ' ` i -- i beg you pardon -- how many ' murmur the youth who have lose himself in gaze and no longer understand plain english mr smithson frown at the intruder and contrived to absorb lesbium 's attention for the rest of the afternoon he have a good deal more to say for himself than she military admirer and be altogether more amusing he have a little cynical air which lesbia 's recent education have teach she to enjoy he depreciate all she female friend -- abuse they gown and bonnet and give she to understand between the line as it be that she be the only woman in london worth think about she look at he curiously wonder how belle trinder have be able to resign herself to the idea of marry he he be not absolutely bad look -- but he be in all thing unlike a girl 's ideal lover he be short and stout with a pale complexion and sunken fade eye as of a man who have spend the greater part of he life by candle light and have pore much over ledger and bank book share list and prospectus he dress well or allow himself to be dress by the most correct of tailor -- the prince 's tailor -- but he never attempt to lead the fashion in he garment he have no originality such sublime flight as that of the man who revive corduroy or of that daring genius who resuscitate the half-forgotten inverness coat be unknown to he he could only follow the lead of the highest he have small foot of which he be intensely proud podgy white hand on which he wear the most exquisite ring he change he ring every day like a roman emperor be report to have summer and winter ring -- onyx and the coolest look intaglio set in filagree for warm weather -- fiery ruby and diamond in massive band of dull gold for winter he be say to devote half-an-hour every morning to the treatment of he nail which be perfect all the inkstain of he youth have be obliterate and those nail which have once be bite to the quick during the throe of financial study be now thing of beauty lady lesbium survey mr smithson critically and shudder at the thought that this person be the best substitute which the season have yet offer she for she ideal knight she think of john hammond the tall strong figure straight and square the head so proudly carry on a neck which would have grace a greek arena the straight clearly-cut feature the flash eye bright with youth and hope and the promise of all good thing yes there be indeed a man -- a man in all the nobility of manhood as god make he a adam before the fall ah if john hammond have only possess a quarter of mr smithson 's wealth how gladly would lesbia have defy the world and marry he but to defy the world upon nothing a year be out of the question ` why do not he go on the stock exchange and make he fortune ' thought lesbium pettishly ` instead of talk vaguely about politics and literature ' she feel angry with she reject lover for have come to she empty-handed she have see no man in london who be or who seem to she he equal and yet she do not repent of have reject he the more she know of the world and the more she know of herself the more deeply be she convince that poverty be a evil thing and that she be not the right kind of person to endure it she be inwardly make these comparison as they stroll back to the carriage while mr smithson and lady kirkbank talk confidentially at she side ` do you know that lady kirkbank have promise and vow three thing for you ' say mr smithson ` indeed i think i be past the age at which one can be compromise by other people 's promise pray what be those three thing ' ` first that you will come to breakfast in park lane with lady kirkbank next Wednesday morning i say Wednesday because that will give I time to ask some nice people to meet you secondly that you will honor I by occupy my box at the lyceum some evening next week and thirdly that you will allow I to drive you down to the orlean for supper after the play the drive only take a hour and the moonlight night be delicious at this time of the year ' ' i be in lady kirkbank 's hand ' answer lesbium laugh ' i be she goods she chattel she take I wherever she like ' ` but would you refuse to do I this honor if you be a free agent ' ' i can not tell i hardly know what it be to be a free agent at grasmere i do whatever my grandmother tell I in london i obey lady kirkbank i be transfer from one master to another why should we breakfast in park lane instead of in arlington street what be the use of cross piccadilly to eat we breakfast ' this be a cool-headed style of treatment to which mr smithson be not accustomed and which charm he accordingly young woman usually throw themselves at he head as it be but here be a girl who talk to he as indifferently as if he be a tradesman offer he wares ` what a dreadfully practical person you be ' he exclaim ` what be the use of cross piccadilly well in the first place you will make I ineffably happy but perhaps that do not count in the second place i shall be able to show you some rather good picture of the french school -- ' ' i hate the french school ' interject lesbia ` tricky flashy chalky shallow smell of the footlights and the studio ' ` well sink the picture you will meet some very charming people belong to that artist world which be not to be meet everywhere ' ' i will go to park lane to meet you people if lady kirkbank like to take I ' say lesbium and with this answer mr smithson be bind to be content ` my pet if you have make it the study of you life how to treat that man you could not do it better ' say lady kirkbank when they be drive along the dusty road between dusty hedge and dusty tree past that last remnant of country which be daily be debase into london ` upon my word lesbium i begin to think you must be a genius ' ` do you see any gown you like better than mine ' ask lesbia recline reposefully with she little bronze shoe upon the opposite cushion ` not one -- seraphine have surpass herself ' ` you be always say that one would suppose you be a sleep partner in the firm but i really think this brown and buttercup be rather nice i see that odious american girl just now -- miss -- miss milwaukee that mop-stick girl people rave about at canne she be in pale blue and cream color a milk and water mixture and look positively plain ' chapter xxvii lesbium cross piccadilly lady kirkbank and lady lesbium drive across piccadilly at eleven o'clock on Wednesday morning to breakfast with mr smithson and although lesbium have question whether it be worth while cross piccadilly to eat one 's breakfast she have subsequently consider it worth while order a new gown from seraphine for the occasion or it may be rather that the breakfast make a plausible excuse for a new gown the pleasure of order which be one of those joy of a london life that have not yet lose they savor the gown devise especially for the early morning be simplicity itself -- rusticity even it be a dresden shepherdess gown make of a soft flowered stuff with rose and forget-me-not on a creamy ground there be a great deal of creamy lace and innumerable yard of palest azure and palest rise ribbon in the confection and there be a coquettish little hat the regular dresden hat with a wreath of rosebud ` dresden china incarnate ' exclaim smithson as he welcome lady lesbium on the threshold of he marble hall under the glass marquise which sheltered arrival at he door ` why do you make yourself so lovely i shall want to keep you in one of my loui seize cabinet with the rest of my dresden ' lady kirkbank have consider the occasion suitable for one of she favorite cotton frock and rustic hat -- a leghorn hat with cluster of dog-rose and honeysuckle and a trail of the same hedge-flower to fasten she muslin fichu mr smithson 's house in park lane be simply perfect it be wonderful what good use a _ parvenu _ can make of he money nowadays and how rarely he disgrace himself by any marked offence against good taste there be so many people at hand to teach the _ parvenu _ how to furnish he house or how to choose he stud if he go wrong it must be by sheer perversity a arrogant insistence upon be govern by he own ignorant inclination mr smithson be too good a tactician to go wrong in this way he have take the trouble to study the market before he go out to buy he goods he know that taste and knowledge be to be buy just as easily as chair and table and he go to the right shop he employ a clever scotchman a artist in domestic furniture to plan he house and make drawing for the decoration and furniture of every room -- and for six month he give himself up to the task of furnish money be spend like water painter decorator cabinet-maker have a merry time of it royal academician be impress into the service by large offer and the final result of mr macwalter 's taste and mr smithson 's bullion be a palace in the style of the italian renaissance fresco ceiling paint panel a staircase of sculptured marble as beautiful as a dream a conservatory as exquisite as a jewel casket by benvenuto cellinus a picture gallery which be the admiration of all london and of the enlighten foreigner and of the inquire american this be the house which lesbium have be bring to see and through which she walk with the calmly critical air of a person who have see so many palace that one more or less could make no difference in vain do mr smithson peruse she countenance in the hope of see that she be impress by the splendor of he surroundings and by the power of the man who command such splendor lesbium be as cold as the italian sculptor 's reading girl in a alcove of mr smithson 's picture gallery and the stockbroker feel very much as aladdin might have do if the fair badroulbador have show herself indifferent to the hall of the jewelled window in that magical palace which spring into be in a single night lesbium have be impress by that story of poor belle trinder and by lady kirkbank 's broad assertion that half the young woman in london be run after mr smithson and she have make up she mind to treat the man with supreme scorn she do not want he house or he yacht nothing could induce she to marry such a man she tell herself but she vanity feed upon the idea of he subjugation and she pride be gratify by the sense of she power over he the guest be few and choice there be mr meander the poet one of the lead light in that new sect which pride itself upon the cultivation of abstract beauty and occasionally touch the verge of concrete ugliness there be a newspaper man -- the editor of a fashionable journal -- and a middle-aged man of letter playwright critic humourist a man whose society be in demand everywhere and who say sharp thing with the most supreme good-nature the only lady whose society mr smithson have deem worthy the occasion be a fashionable actress with she younger sister the younger a pretty copy of the elder both dress picturesquely in flow cashmere gown of faint sea-green with old lace fichus leghorn hat and a general limpness and simplicity of style which suit they cast of feature and delicate coloring lesbium wonder to see how good a effect could be produce by a costume which could have cost so little mr nightshade the famous tragedian have be also ask to grace the feast but the early hour make the invitation a mockery it be not to be suppose that a man who go to bed at daybreak would get up again before the sun be in the zenith for the sake of mr smithson 's society or mr smithson 's strasbourg pie for the manufacture whereof a particular breed of goose be suppose to be set apart like sacred bird in egypt while a particular vineyard in the gironde be suppose to be devoted wholly and solely to the production of mr smithson 's claret it be a cabinet wine like those rare vintage of the rhineland which be reserve exclusively for german prince breakfast be serve in mr smithson 's smallest dining-room -- there be three apartment give up to feast begin with a spacious banqueting-room for great dinner and dwindle down to this snuggery which hold about a dozen comfortably with ample room and verge enough for the attendant the wall be old gold silk the curtain a tawny velvet of deeper tone the cabinet and buffet of dark italian walnut inlay with lapis-lazulus and amber the fireplace be a masterpiece of cabinet work with high narrow shelf and curious recess hold priceless jar of oriental enamel the deep hearth be fill with arum lily and azalia like a font at easter lady kirkbank who pretend to adore genius be affectionately effusive to miss fitzherbert the popular actress but she rather ignore the sister lesbium be less cordial and be not enchant at find that miss fitzherbert shone and sparkle at the breakfast table by the gaiety of she spirit and the brightness of she conversation there be something frank and joyous almost to childishness in the actress 's manner which be full of fascination and lesbium feel herself at a disadvantage almost for the first time since she have be in london the editor the wit the poet the actress have a language of they own and lesbium feel herself out in the cold unable to catch the ball as it glance past she not quick enough to follow the wit that evoke those ripple of silvery laughter from the two fair-haired pale-faced girl in sea-green cashmere she feel as a englishman may feel who have make himself master of academical french and who take up one of zolum 's novel or go into artistic society and find that there be another french a complete and copious language of which he know not a word lesbium begin to think that she have a great deal to learn she begin to wonder even whether in the event of she have make rather too free use of lady maulevrier 's _ carte blanche _ it might not be well to make a new departure in the art of dress and to wear untrimmed cashmere gown and rag of limp lace after breakfast they all go to look at mr smithson 's picture gallery he picture be as he have tell lesbium chiefly of the french school and there may have be a remote period -- say in the time of good queen charlotte -- when such picture would hardly have be exhibit to young lady he picture be mr smithson 's own unaided choice here the individual taste of the man stand reveal there be two or three gerome and in the place of honor at the end of the gallery there be a grand delaroche anne boleyn 's last letter to the king the hapless girl-queen sit at a table in she gloomy cell in the tower a shaft of golden light from the narrow window streaming on the fair disorder hair the face bleached with unutterable woe a sublime image of despair and self-abandonment the larger picture be historical classic grand : but the smaller picture -- the lively little bit of color dot in here and there -- be of that new school which mr smithson affect they be of that school which be call impressionist in which ballet dancer and jockey burlesque actress mask ball and all the humor of the side scene be represent with the sublime audacity of a art which disdain finish and rely on _ chic fougue chien flou v ` lan _ the inspiration of the moment lesbium blush as she look at the ballet girl the masker in they scanty raiment the _ demi-mondaine _ loll out of they opera box and half out of they gown with false smile and frizzled hair and then there come the work of that other school which lavish the finish of a meissonier on the most meretricious composition a woman in a velvet gown warm she dainty little foot on a gilded fender in a boudoir all aglow with color and lamplight a cavalier in satin raiment buckle he sword-belt before a venetian mirror a pair of lover kiss in a sunlit corridor a girl in a hansom cab a milliner 's shop and so on and so on then come the classical subject of the last new school weak imitation of alma tadema nero admire he mother 's corpse claudius interrupt messalina 's marriage with she lover silus clodius disguise among the woman of caesar 's household pyrrha 's grotto lady kirkbank expatiate upon all the picture and generally make unlucky guess at the subject of they classical literature be not she strong point mr meander the poet discover that all the beautiful head be like miss fitzherbert ` it be the same line ' he exclaim ` the line of lily and flow water -- the gracious ineffable upward return ripple of the true _ retroussé _ nose the divine _ flou _ the loveliness which have lie dormant for century -- nay be at one period of debased art scorn and trample under foot by the porcine multitude as akin to the pug and the turn-up until discover and enshrine on the altar of the beautiful by the boticellus revivalist ' miss fitzherbert simpered and accept these remark as mere statement of obvious fact she be accustom to hear of boticellus and the early italian painter in connection with she own charm of face and figure lesbium whose faultless feature be of the aquiline type regard the bard 's rhapsody as insufferable twaddle and begin to think mr smithson almost a wit when he make fun of the bard smithson be enchant when she laugh at he jokelet even although she do not scruple to tell he that she think he favorite picture detestable and look with the eye of indifference on a collection of jade that be worth a small fortune mr meander fall into another rhapsody over those classic cup and shallow little bowl of absinthe-coloured jade ` here if you like be color and beauty ' he murmur caress one of the little cup with the roseate tip of he supple finger ` these dearest smithson be worth all the rest of you collection worth vanload of you cloisonné enamel you dragon-jar in blood-colour and blue this cloudy indefinable substance not crudely transparent nor yet distinctly opaque a something which touch the boundary line of two world -- the real and the ideal and then the color great heaven can anything be lovelier than this shadowy tint which be neither yellow nor green faint faint as the dawn of newly-awakened day after the siege of blood-bedabbled delhus baron rothschild send a special agent to indium to buy he a little jade tea-pot which have be the joy of eastern king only a tea-pot yet rothschild deem it worth a voyage from england to indium that be what the love of the beautiful means in jew or gentile ' conclude the bard smile on the company as they gather round the florentine table on which the jade specimen be set out lady kirkbank look at the little cup and basin as if she think they be go to do something after all this fuss have be make about they it seem hardly credible that any reasonable be could have give thirty guinea for one of those bit of greenish-yellow clouded glass unless the thing have some peculiar property of expansion or contraction after this breakfast in park lane lady lesbium and she admirer meet daily he go to all she party he sit out waltz with she in conservatory and on staircase for horace smithson be much too shrewd a man too enter himself in the race for dance man handicap by he forty year and he fourteen stone he contrived to amuse lesbium by he conversation which be essentially mundane depreciate people whom all the rest of the world admire or pretend to admire tell she of the secret spring by which the society she see around she be move he be judicious in he revelation of hidden evil and careful to say nothing which should offend lady lesbium 's modesty yet he contrived in a very short time to teach she that the world in which she live be a utterly corrupt world whose high priest be satan that all lofty aspiration and noble sentiment be out of place in society and that the worst among the people she meet be the people who lay any claim to be better than they neighbor ` that be why i adore lady kirkbank ' he say confidentially ` the dear soul never pretend to be any better than the rest of we she gamble and we all know she gamble she peg and we all know she peg and she make rather a boast of be up to she eye in debt no humbug about dear old georgie ' lesbium have see enough of she chaperon by this time to know that mr smithson 's description of the lady be correct and this be so she suppose that the fact and trait of character which he tell she about in other people be also true she thus adopt the smithsonian or fashionable-pessimist view of society in general and resign herself to the idea that the world be a very wicked world as well as a very pleasant world that the wickedest people be generally the pleasantest and that it do not much matter the fact that mr smithson be at lesbium haselden 's foot be obvious to everybody lesbium who have at first treat he with supreme hauteur have grow more civil as she begin to understand the place he hold in the world and how much social influence go along with unlimited wealth she be civil but she have quite make up she mind that nothing could ever induce she to become horace smithson 's wife that offer which have hang fire in the case of poor belle trinder be not too long delay on this occasion mr smithson call in arlington street about ten day after the breakfast in park lane before luncheon and before lady kirkbank have leave she room he bring ticket for a _ matinée d'invitation _ in belgrave square at which a new and wonderful russian pianiste be to make a kind of semi-official _ début _ before a audience of critic and distinguish amateur and the elect of the musical world they wear ticket which money could not buy and be thus a meet offer for lady lesbium and a plausible excuse for a early call mr smithson succeed in see lesbium alone and then and there with very little circumlocution ask she to be he wife she social education have advance considerably since that summer day in the pine-wood when john hammond have woo she with passionate woo mr smithson be a much less ardent suitor and make he offer with the air of a man who expect to be accept lesbium 's beautiful head bent a little like a lily on its stalk and a faint blush deepen the pale rise tint of she complexion she reply be courteous and conventional she be flatter she be grateful for mr smithson 's high opinion of she but she be deeply grieve if anything in she manner have give he reason to think that he be more to she than a friend a old friend of dear lady kirkbank 's whom she be naturally predispose to like as lady kirkbank 's friend horace smithson turn pale as death but if he be angry he give no utterance to he angry feeling he only ask if lady lesbium 's answer be final -- and on be tell that it be so he dismiss the subject in the easiest manner and with a gentlemanlike placidity which very much astonish the lady ` you say that you regard I as you friend ' he say ` do not withdraw that privilege from I because i have ask for a higher place in you esteem forget all i have say this morning be assure i shall never offend you by repeat it ' ` you be more than good ' murmured lesbium who have expect a wild outbreak of despair or fury rather than this friendly calm ' i hope that you and lady kirkbank will go and hear madame metzikoff this afternoon ' pursued mr smithson return to the subject of the _ matinée _ ` the duchess 's room be lovely but no doubt you know they ' lesbium blush and confess that the duchess of lostwithiel be one of those select few who be not on lady kirkbank 's visit list ` there be people lady kirkbank can not get on with ' she say ` perhaps she will hardly like to go to the duchess 's as she do not visit she ' ` oh but this affair count for nothing we go to hear metzikoff not to bow down to the duchess all the people in town who care for music will be there and you who play so divinely must enjoy fine professional playing ' ' i worship a really great player ' say lesbia ` and if i can drag lady kirkbank to the house of the enemy we will be there ' on this mr smithson discreetly murmur ' _ au revoir _ ' take up he hat and cane and depart without in sir george 's parlance have turn a hair ` refusal number one ' he say to himself as he go downstairs with he leisurely catlike pace that velvet step by which he have gradually creep into society ` we may have to go through refusal number two and number three but she mean to have I she be a very clever girl for a countrybred one and she know that it be worth she while to be lady lesbium smithson ' this soliloquy may be take to prove that horace smithson know lesbium haselden better than she know herself she have refuse he in all good faith but even to-day after he have leave she she fall into a day-dream in which mr smithson 's house and yacht drag and hunter form the shift picture in a dissolve view of society and lesbium wonder if there be any other young woman in london who would refuse such a offer as that which she have quietly reject half-an-hour ago lady kirkbank surprise she while she be still absorb in this dreamy review of the position it be just possible that the fair georgie may have have notice of mr smithson 's morning visit and may have keep out of the way on purpose for she be not a person of lazy habit and be generally ready for she nine o'clock breakfast and she morning stroll in the park however late she might have be out overnight ` mr smithson have be here i understand ' say lady kirkbank settle herself in a arm-chair by the open window after she have kiss she _ protégée _ ` rilboche pass he on the stair ' ` rilboche be always pass people on the stair ' answer lesbium rather pettishly ' i think she must spend she life on the landing listen for arrival and departure ' ' i have a kind of vague idea that smithson would call to-day he be so fussy about those ticket for the metzikoff recital i hate pianoforte recital and i detest that starch old duchess but i suppose i shall have to take you there -- or poor smithson will be miserable ' say lady kirkbank watch lesbium keenly over the top of the newspaper she expect lesbium to confide in she to announce herself blushingly as the betrothed of one of the richest commoner in england but lesbium sit gaze dreamily across the flower in the balcony at the house over the way and say never a word so lady kirkbank 's curiosity burst into speech ` well my dear have he propose there be something in he manner last night when he put on you wrap that make I think the crisis be near ' ` the crisis be come and be past and mr smithson and i be just as good friend as ever ' ` what ' scream lady kirkbank ` do you mean to tell I that you have refuse he ' ` certainly you know i never mean to do anything else do you think i be like miss trinder bent upon marry town and country house stable and diamond ' ' i do not think you be a fool ' cry lady kirkbank almost beside herself with vexation for it have be bear in upon she as the methodist sometimes say that if mr smithson should prosper in he woo it would be better for she lady kirkbank who would have a claim upon he kindness ever after ` what can be you motive in refuse one of the very best match of the season -- or of ever so many season you think perhaps you will marry a duke if you wait long enough for he grace to appear : but the number of marry duke be rather small lady lesbium and i do not think any of those would care to marry lord maulevrier 's granddaughter ' lesbium start to she foot pale as ash ` why do you fling my grandfather 's name in my face -- and with that diabolical sneer ' she exclaim ` when i have ask you about he you have always evade my question why should a man of the highest rank shrink from marry lord maulevrier 's granddaughter my grandfather be a distinguished man -- governor of madras such post be not give to nobody how can you dare to speak as if it be a disgrace to I to belong to he ' chapter xxviii ` club diamond heart in wild disorder see ' lady kirkbank have considerable difficulty in smooth lesbium 's ruffle plumage she do all in she power to undo the effect of she rash word -- declare that she have be carry away by temper -- she have speak she know not what -- word of no meaning of course lesbium 's grandfather have be a great man -- governor of madras altogether a important and celebrated person -- and lady kirkbank have mean nothing could have mean nothing to he disparagement ` my dearest girl i be beside myself and talk sheer nonsense ' say georgie ` but you know really now dearest any woman of the world would be provoke at you foolish refusal of that dear good smithson only think of that too lovely house in park lane a palace in the style of the italian renaissance -- such a house be in itself equivalent to a peerage -- and there be no doubt smithson will be offer a peerage before he be much older i have hear it confidently assert that when the present ministry retire smithson will be make a peer you have no idea what a useful man he be or what henchman 's service he have do the ministry in financial matter and then there be he villa at deauville -- you do not know deauville -- a positively perfect place the villa i mean build by the duke de morny in the golden day of the empire -- and another at cowe and he palace in berkshire a manor my love with a glorious old tudor manor-house and he have a _ pie à terre _ in paris in the faubourg a ground-floor furnished in the pompeian style half-a-dozen room open one out of the other and surround a small garden with a fountain in the middle some of the greatest people in pari occupy the upper part of the house and they room of course be splendid but smithson 's ground-floor be the gem of the faubourg however i suppose there be no use in talk any more for there be the gong for luncheon ' lesbium be in no humor for luncheon ' i would rather have a cup of tea in my own room ' she say ` this smithson business have give I a abominable headache ' ` but you will go to hear metzikoff ' ` no thanks you detest the duchess of lostwithiel and you do not care for pianoforte recital why should i drag you there ' ` but my dearest lesbium i be not such a selfish wretch as to keep you at home when i know you be passionately fond of good music forget all about you headache and let I see how that lovely little catherine of aragon bonnet suit you i be so glad i happen to see it in seraphine 's hand yesterday just as she be go to send it to lady fonvielle who give herself such intolerable air on the strength of a pretty face and always want to get the _ primeure _ in bonnet and thing ' ` another new bonnet ' reply lesbia ` what a infinity of thing i seem to be have from seraphine i be afraid i must owe she a good deal of money ' this be a vague way of speak about actual fact lady lesbium might have speak with more certainty she wardrobe and old-fashioned hanging closet and chest of drawer in arlington street be cram to overflow with finery and then there be all the thing that she have grow tired of or have think unbecoming and have give away to kibble she own maid or to rilboche who have in a great measure supersede kibble on all important occasion for how could a westmoreland girl know how to dress a young lady for london ball and drawing-room ` if you have only accept mr smithson it would not matter how much money you owe people ' say lady kirkbank ` you have better come down to lunch a glass of heidseck will bring you up to concert pitch ' champagne be lady kirkbank 's idea of a universal panacea and she have gradually succeed in teaching lesbium to believe in the sovereign power of heidseck as a restorative for shattered nerve at fellside lesbium have drunk only water but then at fellside she have never know that feeling of exhaustion and prostration which follow day and night spend in society the wear and tear of a mind forever on the alert and brilliant spirit which be more often force than real for she chief stimulant lesbium have recourse to the teapot but there be occasion when she find that something more than tea be need to maintain that indispensable vivacity of manner which lady kirkbank call concert pitch to-day she allow herself to be persuade she go down to luncheon and take a couple of glass of dry champagne with she cutlet and thus restore be equal to put on the new bonnet which be so become that she spirit revive as she contemplate the effect in she glass so lady kirkbank carry she off to the musical _ matinée _ beam and radiant have forget all about that dark hint of evil glancing at the name of she long dead grandfather the duchess be not on view when lady kirkbank and she _ protégée _ arrive and a good many people belong to georgie 's own particular set be scatter like flower among those real music-lover who have come solely to hear the new pianiste the music-lover be mostly dowdy in they attire and seem a race apart among they be several young woman of the bless damozel school who wear flow garment of sap-green or orche or puffed raiment of venetian red and among whom the cartwheel hat the elizabethan sleeve and the toby frill be conspicuous there be very few man except the musical critic in this select assemblage and lesbium begin to think that it be go to be very dreary she have live in such a atmosphere of masculine adulation while under lady kirkbank 's wing that it be a new thing to find herself in a room where there be none to love and very few to praise she she feel out in the cold as it be those ungloved critic with they shabby coat and dubious shirt snuffy smoky everything they ought not to be seem to she a race of barbarian find herself thus cold and lonely in the midst of the duchess 's splendor of peacock-blue velvet and peacock-feather decoration lesbium be almost glad when in the middle of madame metzikoff 's open gondoly -- airy fairy music execute with surpass delicacy -- mr smithson creep gently into the _ fauteuil _ just behind hers and lean over the back of the chair to whisper a inquiry as to she opinion of the pianist 's style ` she be exquisite ' lesbium murmur softly but the whisper question and the murmured answer low as they be provoke indignant look from a brace of damsel in venetian red who shake they toby frill with a outraged air lesbium feel that mr smithson 's presence be hardly correct it would have be ` better form ' if he have stay away and yet she be glad to have he here at the worst he be some one -- nay accord to lady kirkbank he be the only one amongst all she admirer whose offer be worth have all lesbium 's other conquest have count as barren honor but if she could have bring herself to accept mr smithson she would have secure the very best match of the season to marry a plain mr smithson -- a man who have make he money in iron -- in cochineal -- on the stock exchange -- have seem to she absolute degradation the surrender of all she lofty hope she golden dream but lady kirkbank have put the question in a new light when she say that smithson would be offer a peerage smithson the peer would be altogether a different person from smithson the commoner but be lady kirkbank sure of she fact or truthful in she statement lesbium 's experience of she chaperon 's somewhat loose notion of truth and exactitude make she doubtful upon this point be this it might she be incline to be civil to smithson albeit she be inwardly surprised and offend at he take she refusal so calmly ` you see that i be determine not to lose the privilege of you society because i have be foolish ' he say presently in the pause after the first part of the recital ' i hope you will consider I as much you friend to-day as i be yesterday ' ` quite as much ' she answer sweetly and then they talk of raff and rubenstein and henselt and all the composer about whom it be the correct thing to discourse nowadays before they leave belgrave square lady kirkbank have offer mr smithson sir george 's place in she box at the gaiety that evening and have invite he to supper in arlington street afterwards it be sarah bernhardt 's first season in london -- the never-to-be-forgotten season of the comédie française ' i should love of all thing to be there ' say mr smithson meekly he have a couple of stall in the third row for the whole of the season ` but how can i be sure that i shall not be turn sir george out of door ' ` sir george can never sit out a serious play he only care for chaumont or judie the demi-monde be much too prosy for he ' ` the demi-monde be one of the finest play in the french language ' say smithson ` you know it of course lady lesbium ' ` alas no at fellside i be not allow to read french play or novel : or only a novel now and then which my grandmother select for I ' ` and now you read everything i suppose -- include zolum ' ` the book be lie about and i dip into they sometimes while i be have my hair brush ' answer lesbium lightly ' i believe that be the only time lady devote to literature during the season ' say mr smithson ` well i envy you the delight of see the demi-monde without know what it be all about beforehand ' ' i daresay there be a good many people who would not take they girl to see a play by duma ' say lady kirkbank ` but i make a point of let _ my _ girl see everything it widen they mind and awaken they intelligence ' ` and do away with a good many silly prejudice ' reply mr smithson lady kirkbank and lesbium be due at a kensington garden-party after the recital and from the garden-party for which any hour suffice they go to show themselves in the park then back to arlington street to dress for the play then a hurry dinner and they be in they place at the theater in time for the rising of the curtain ` if it be a english play we would not care for be punctual ' say lady kirkbank ` but i should hate to lose a word of duma in he play every speech tell ' there be royalty present and the house be good but not so full as it have be on some other night for the english public have be tell that sarah bernhardt be the person to admire and have be flock sheep-like after that golden-haired enchantress whereby many of these sheep -- fight greedily for sarah 's night and ignore all other talent -- lose some of the finest act on the french stage notably that of croizette delaunay and febvre in this very demi-monde lesbium who in spite of she affectation be still fresh enough to be charm with fine acting and a powerful play be enthral by the stage so wrapt in the scene that she be quite unaware of she brother 's presence in a stall just below lady kirkbank 's box he too have a stall at the gaiety he have come in very late when the play be half over lesbium be surprise when he present himself at the door of the box after the fourth act maulevrier and he sister have meet very seldom since the young lady 's _ début _ the young earl do not go to many party and the society he cultivate be chiefly masculine and as he neither play polo nor shot pigeon he masculine pursuit do not bring he in he sister 's way lady kirkbank have ask he to she house with that wide and general invitation which be so easily evade he have promise to go and he have not go and thus lesbium and he have pursue they several way only cross each other 's path now and then at a race meeting or in a theater ` how d'ye do lady kirkbank -- how d'ye do lesbia just catch sight of you from below as the curtain be go down ' say maulevrier shake hand with the lady and salute mr smithson with a somewhat supercilious nod ` rather surprised to see you and lesbium here to-night lady kirkbank be not the demi-monde rather strong meat for babe eh not _ exactly _ the play one would take a young lady to see ' ` why should a young lady be forbid to see a fine play because there be some hard and bitter truth tell in it ' ask lady kirkbank ` lesbium see madame d'ange and all she sisterhood in the park and about london every day of she life why should not she see they on the stage and hear they history and understand how cruel they fate be and learn to pity they if she can i really think this play be a lesson in christian charity and i should like to see that oliver man strangle though delaunay play the part divinely what a voice what a manner how polish how perfect and they tell I he be go to leave the stage in a year or two what will the world do without he ' maulevrier do not attempt to suggest a solution of this difficulty he be watch mr smithson as he lean against the back of lesbium 's chair and talk to she the two seem very familiar laughingly discuss the play and the actor smithson know or pretend to know all about the latter he tell lesbium who make croizette 's gown -- the upholsterer who furnish that lovely house of hers in the boi -- the sum pay for she horse she picture she diamond it seem to lesbia when she have hear all that croizette be a much-to-be-envied person mr smithson have unpublished _ bon-mot _ of duma at he finger end he know daudet and sarcey and sardou and seem to be thoroughly at home in parisian artistic society lesbium begin to think that he would hardly be so despicable a person as she have at first suppose no wonder he and he wealth have turn poor belle trinder 's head how could a rural vicar 's daughter accustom to poverty help be dazzle by such magnificence maulevrier stay in the box only a short time and refuse lady kirkbank 's invitation to supper she do not urge the point as she have surprise one or two very unfriendly glance at mr smithson in maulevrier 's honest eye she do not want a antagonistic brother to interfere with she plan she have make up she mind to ` run ' lesbium accord to she own idea and any counter influence might be fatal so when maulevrier say he be due at the marlborough after the play she let he go ' i might as well be at fellside and you in london for anything i see of you ' say lesbia ` you be up to you eye in engagement and i do not suppose you want to see any more of I ' maulevrier answer bluntly ` but i 'll call to-morrow morning if i be likely to find you at home i have some news for you ' ` then i 'll stay at home on purpose to see you news be always delightful be it good news by-the-bye ' ` very good at least i think so ' ` what be it about ' ` oh that be a long story and the curtain be just go up the news be about mary ' ` about mary ' exclaimed lesbium elevate she eyebrow ` what news can there possibly be about mary ' ` such news as there generally be about every nice jolly girl at least once in she life ' ` you do not mean that she be engage -- to a curate ' ` no not to a curate there go the curtain i 'll see you later as the yankee president use to say when people bother he and he do not like to say no ' engage : mary engage the idea of such a altogether unexpected event distract lesbium 's mind all through the last act of the demi-monde she hardly know what the actor be talk about mary she younger sister mary a good look girl enough but by no mean a beauty and with manners utterly unformed that mary should be engage to be marry while she lesbia be still free seem a obvious absurdity and yet the fact be on reflection easily to be account for these unattractive girl be generally the first to bind themselves with the vow of betrothal lady kirkbank have tell she of many such case the poor creature know that they chance will be few and therefore gratefully welcome the first wooer ` but who can the man be ' think lesbium ` mary have be keep as secluded as a cloistered nun there be so few family we have ever be allow to mix with the man must be a curate who have take advantage of grandmother 's illness to force he way into the family circle at fellside -- and who have make love to mary in some of she lonely ramble over the hill i daresay it be really very wrong to allow a girl to roam about in that way ' sir george and a couple of he horsey friend be wait for supper when lady kirkbank and she party arrive in arlington street the dining-room look a picture of comfort the oval table the low lamp the cluster of candle under color shades the great oriental bowl of wild flower -- eglantine honeysuckle foxglove all the sweet hedge flower of midsummer make a central mass of color and brightness against the subdue and even sombre tone of wall and curtain the room be old the furniture old nothing have be alter since the time of sir george 's great grandfather and the whirligig of time have just now make the old thing precious yes those chair and table and sideboard and bookcase and wine-cooler against which georgie 's soul have revolt in the early year of she wed life be now thing of beauty and georgie 's friend envy she the possession of indisputable chippendale furniture mr mostyn a distinguished owner of race-horse with he pretty wife make up the party the gentleman be full of he entry for liverpool and chester and discourse mysteriously with sir george and the horsey bachelor all supper time the lady have lately take up science as a new form of excitement not incompatible with frock bonnet hurlingham the ranelagh and sandown she rave about huxley and tyndall and be perpetually come down upon she friend with awful fact about the sun and startling proposition about latent heat or spontaneous generation she know all about gas and would hardly accept a glass of water without explain what it be make of draw by mr smithson for lesbium 's amusement the scientific matron be undoubtedly ` good fun ' the racing man be full of talk lesbium and lady kirkbank rave about the play they have just be see and praise delaunay with a enthusiasm which be calculate to make the rest of mankind burst with envy ` do you know you be make I positively wretched by you talk about that man ' say colonel delville one of sir george 's racing friend and a ancient adorer of the fair georgie 's ` no i tell you there be never anything offer higher than five to four on the mare ' interjectionally to sir george ` there be a day when i think i be you idea of a attractive man yes george a clear case of rope ' again interjectionally ` and to hear you rave about this play-acting fellow -- it be too humiliating ' lady kirkbank simper and then sigh ` we be get old together ' she murmur ' i have come to a age when one can only admire the charm of manner in the abstract -- the beautiful for the sake of the beautiful i think if i be lie in my grave the music of delaunay 's voice would thrill I under six foot of london clay will no one take any more wine no then we may as well go into the next room and begin we little nap ' the adjoining room be sir george 's snuggery and it be here that the cosy little round game after supper be always play sir george be not a studious person he never read and he never write except a occasional

view to comfort there be a round table in the center under a large moderator lamp which give a exceptionally brilliant light a divan cover with dark brown velvet occupy three side of the room a few choice piece of old blue oriental ware in the corner enliven the dark brown wall three or four easy chair stand about near the broad old-fashioned fireplace which have be improve with a modern-antique brass grate and a blue and white tiled hearth ` there be not a room in my house that look half as comfortable as this den of yours george ' say mr smithson as he seat himself by lesbium 's side at the card table they have agree to be partner ` partner at card even if we be not to be partner for life ' smithson have whisper tenderly and lesbium 's only reply have be a modest lowering of lovely eyelid and a faint faint blush lesbium 's blush be grow fainter every day ` that be because everything in you house be so confoundedly handsome and expensive ' retort sir george who do not very much care about be call george _ tout court _ by a person of mr smithson 's obscure antecedent but who have to endure the familiarity for reason know only to himself and mr smithson ` no man can expect to be comfortable in a house in which every room have cost a small fortune my wife re-arranged this den half-a-dozen year ago when we take to sittin ' here of a evenin ' she pick up the chair and the blue pot at bonham 's have everythin ' cover with brown velvet -- nice subdue tone suit old people -- hang up that yaller curtain just for a bit of color and here we be ' ` it be the cosiest room in

brown upon the retina and some curious fact relate to the optic machinery of water-flea as lately discover by a great naturalist unfortunately for science the game have now begin and the player be curiously indifferent as to the visual organ of water-flea the game go on merrily till the pearly light of dawn begin to creep through the chink of lady kirkbank 's yellow curtain everybody seem gay yet everybody could not be win fortune have not smile upon lesbium 's card or on those of she partner the smithson and haselden firm have come to grief lesbium 's little ivory purse have be empty of its three or four half-sovereign and mr smithson have be capitalise a lose concern for the last two hour and the play have be fast and furious although nominally for small stake ' i be afraid to think of how much i must owe you ' say lesbium when mr smithson bid she good night ` oh nothing worth speaking of -- sixteen or seventeen pound at most ' lesbium feel cold and creepy and hardly know whether it be the chill of new-born day or the sense of owe money to horace smithson those three or four half-sovereign to-night be the end of she last remittance from lady maulevrier she have have a great many remittance from that generous grandmother and the money have all go somehow it be go and yet she have pay for hardly anything she have account with all lady kirkbank 's tradesman the money have melt away -- it have ooze out of she pocket -- at card on the race-course in reckless gift to servant and people at fancy fair for trifle buy here and there by the way-side as it be for the sake of buy if she have be suddenly ask for a account of she stewardship she could not have tell what she have do with half of the money and now she must ask for twenty pound more and immediately to pay mr smithson she go up to she room in the clear early light and stand like a statue with fix thoughtful eye while kibble take off she finery the pretty pale yellow gown which set off she dark brown hair she violet eye for the first time in she life she feel the keen pang of anxiety about money matter -- the necessity to think of way and mean she have no idea how much money she have receive from she grandmother since she have begin she career in scotland last autumn the cheque have be send she as she ask for they sometimes even before she ask for they and she have keep no account she think she grandmother be so rich that expenditure could not matter she suppose that she be draw upon a inexhaustible supply and now lady kirkbank have tell she that lady maulevrier be not rich as the world reckon nowadays the savings of a dowager countess even in forty year of seclusion could be but a small fund to draw upon for the expense of life at high pressure ` the sum people spend nowadays be positively appalling ' say lady kirkbank ' a man with five or six thousand a year be a absolute pauper i be sure we existence be only genteel beggary and yet we spend over ten thousand ' enlighten thus by the lip of the worldly-wise lesbium think ruefully of the bill which she grandmother would have to pay for she at the end of the season bill of the amount whereof she could not even make a approximate guess seraphine 's charge have never be discuss in she hearing -- but lady kirkbank have admit that the creature be dear chapter xxix ` swift subtle post carrier of grisly care ' maulevrier call in arlington street before twelve o'clock next day and find lesbium just return from she early ride look as fresh and fair as if there have be no such thing as nap or late hour in the story of she life she be repose in a large easy chair by the open window in habit and hat just as she have come from the row where she have be laugh and chat with mr smithson who jog demurely by she side on he short-legged hunter drop out envenom little joke about the passer by people who see he ride by she side upon this particular morning fancy there be something more than usual in the gentleman 's manner and make up they mind that lady lesbium haselden be to be mistress of the fine house in park lane mr smithson have flutter and flutter for the last five season but this time the flutterer be catch in she newly-awakened anxiety about money matter lesbium have forget mary 's engagement : but the sight of maulevrier recall the fact ` come over here and sit down ' she say ` and tell I this nonsense about mary i be expire with curiosity the thing be too absurd ' ` why absurd ' ask maulevrier sit where she bid he and studiously peruse the name in he hat as if it be a revelation ` oh for a thousand reason ' answer lesbium switch the flower in the balcony with she light little whip ` first and foremost it be absurd to think of any one so bury alive as poor mary be find a admirer and secondly -- well -- i do not want to be rude to my own sister -- but mary be not particularly attractive ' ` mary be the dearest girl in the world ' ` very likely i only say that she be not particularly attractive ' ` and do you think there be no attraction in goodness in freshness and innocence candor generosity -- ' ' i do not know but i think that if mary 's nose have be a thought longer and if she have keep she skin free from freckle she would have be almost pretty ' ` do you really luckily for mary the man who be go to marry she think she lovely ' ' i suppose he like freckle i once hear a man say he do he say they be so original -- so much character about they and pray who be the man ' ` you old adorer and my dear friend john hammond ' lesbium turn as pale as death -- pale with rage and mortification it be not jealousy this pang which rent she shallow soul she have cease to care for john hammond the whirlpool of society have spin that first fancy out of she giddy brain but that a man who have love the highest who have worship she the peerless the beautiful should calmly transfer he affection to she younger sister be to the last degree exasperate ` you friend mr hammond must be a fickle fool ' she exclaim ` who do not know he own mind from day to day ' ` oh but it be more than a day after you reject he that he engage himself to molly it be all my do and i be proud of my work i take the poor fellow back to fellside last march bruise and break by you cruel treatment heartsore and depressed i give he over to molly and molly cure he unconsciously innocently she win that noble heart ah lesbium you do not know what a heart it be which you so nearly break ' ` girl in we rank of life can not afford to marry noble heart ' say lesbium scornfully ` do you mean to tell I that lady maulevrier consent to the engagement ' ` she cut up rather rough at first but molly hold she own like a young lioness -- and the grandmother give way you see she have a fixed idea that molly be a very second-rate sort of person compare with you and that a husband who be not nearly good enough for you might pass muster for molly and so she give way and there be not a happier young woman in the three kingdom than mary haselden ' ` what be they to live upon ' ask lesbium with a incredulous air ` mary will have she five hundred a year and hammond be a very clever fellow you may be sure he will make he mark in the world ' ` and how be they to live while he be make he mark five hundred a year will not do more than pay for mary 's frock if she go into society ' ` perhaps they will live without society ' ` in some horrid little hovel in one of those narrow street off ecclestone square ' suggest lesbium shudderingly ` it be too dreadful to think of -- a young woman doom herself to life-long penury just because she be so foolish as to fall in love ' ` you day for fall in love be over i suppose lesbium ' say maulevrier contemplate he sister with keen scrutiny the beautiful face so perfect in line and color curiously recall that other face at fellside the dowager 's face with its look of marble coldness and the half-expressed pain under that outward calm here be the face of one who have not yet know pain or passion here be the cold perfection of beauty with unawakened heart ' i do not know i be too busy to think of such thing ' ` you have do with love and you have begin to think of marriage of establish yourself properly people tell I you be go to marry mr smithson ' ` people tell you more about I than i know about myself ' ` come now lesbia i have a right to know the truth upon this point you brother -- you only brother -- should be the first person to be tell ' ` when i be engage i have no doubt you will be the first person or the second person ' answer lesbium lightly ` lady kirkbank living on the premise be likely to be the first ' ` then you be not engage to smithson ' ` do not i tell you so just now mr smithson do I the honor to make I a offer yesterday at about this hour and i do myself the honor to reject he ' ` and yet you be whisper together in the box last night and you be ride in the row with he this morning i just meet a fellow who see you together do you think it be right lesbium to play fast and loose with the man -- to encourage he if you do not mean to marry he ' ` how can you accuse I of encourage a person whom i flatly refuse yesterday morning if mr smithson like my society as a friend must i need deny he my friendship ask lady kirkbank to shut she door against he mr smithson be very pleasant as a acquaintance and although i do not want to marry he there be no reason i should snub he ' ` smithson be not a man to be trifle with you will find yourself entangled in a web which you will not easily break through ' ' i be not afraid of web by-the-bye be it true that mr smithson be likely to get a peerage ' ' i have hear people say as much smithson have spend no end of money on electioneering and be a power in the house though he very rarely speak he berkshire estate give he a good deal of influence in that county at the last general election he subscribe twenty thou to the conservative cause for like most man who have rise from nothing you friend smithson be a fine old tory he be specially elect at the carlton six year ago and have make himself uncommonly useful to he party he be suppose to be great on financial question and come out tremendously on colonial railway or drainage scheme about which the house in general be in profound ignorance on those occasion smithson score high a man with immense wealth have always chance no doubt if you be to marry he the peerage would be easily manage smithson 's money back by the maulevrier influence would go a long way my grandmother would move heaven and earth in a case of that kind you have better take pity on smithson ' lesbium laugh that idea of a possible peerage elevated smithson in she eye she know nothing of he political career as she live in a set which ignore politics altogether mr smithson have never talk to she of he parliamentary duty and it be a new thing for she to hear that he have some kind of influence in public affair ` suppose i be incline to accept he would you like he as a brother-in-law ' she ask lightly ' i think from you manner last night that you rather dislike he ' ' i do not quite like he or any of he breed the newly rich who go about in society swell with the sense of they own importance perspire gold as it be and one have always a faint suspicion of man who have get rich very quickly a idea that there must be some kind of juggle not in the case of a great contractor perhaps who can point to a viaduct and dock and railway and say i build that and that and that these be the source of my wealth but a man who get enormously rich by mere cipher where can he money come from except out of other people 's pocket i know nothing against you mr smithson but i always suspect that class of man ' conclude maulevrier shake he head significantly lesbium be not much influence by she brother 's notion she have never be teach to think he a oracle on the contrary she have be tell that he life hitherto have be all foolishness ' ` when be mary and mr hammond to be marry ' she ask ` grandmother say they must wait a year mary be much too young -- and so on and so forth but i see no reason for wait ' ` surely there be reason -- financial reason mr hammond can not be in a position to begin housekeeping ' ` oh they will risk all that molly be a daring girl he propose to she on the top of helvellyn in a storm of wind and rain ' ` and she never write I a word about it how very unsisterly ' ` she be as wild as a hawk and i daresay she be too shy to tell you anything about it ' ` pray when do it all occur ' ` just before i come to london ' ` two month ago how absurd for I to be in ignorance all this time well i hope mary will be sensible and not marry till mr hammond be able to give she a decent home it would be so dreadful to have a sister muddle in poverty and clamour for one 's cast-off gown ' maulevrier laugh at this gloomy suggestion ` it be not easy to foretell the future ' he say ` but i think i may venture to promise that molly will never wear you cast-off gown ' ` oh you think she would be too proud you do not know perhaps how poverty -- genteel poverty -- lower one 's pride i have hear story from lady kirkbank that would make you hair stand on end i be begin to know the world ' ' i be glad of that if you be to live in the world it be better that you should know what it be make of but if i have a voice or a choice in the matter i have rather my sister stay at grasmere and remain ignorant of the world and all its way ' ` while you enjoy you life in london that be just like the selfishness of a man under the pretence of keep he sister or he wife secure from all possible contact with evil he bury they alive in a country house while he have all the wickedness for he own share in london oh i be begin to understand the creature ' ' i be afraid you be begin to be wise remember that knowledge of evil be the prelude to the fall well good-bye ' ` will not you stay to lunch ' ` no thanks i never lunch -- frightful waste of time i shall drop in at the _ haute gomme _ and take a cup of tea later on ' the _ haute gomme _ be a new club in piccadilly which maulevrier and some of he friend affect lesbium go towards the drawing-room door with she brother and just as he reach the door she lay she hand caressingly upon he shoulder he turn and stare at she somewhat surprised for he and she have never be give to demonstration of affection ` maulevrier i want you to do I a favor ' she say in a low voice blush a little for the thing she be go to ask be a new thing for she to ask and she have a deep sense of shame in make she demand ` i -- i lose money at nap last night only seventeen pound mr smithson and i be partner and he pay my loss i want to pay he immediately and -- ' ` and you be too hard up to do it i 'll write you a cheque this instant ' say maulevrier goodnaturedly but while he be write the cheque he take occasion to remonstrate with lesbium on the foolishness of card playing ' i be oblige to do as lady kirkbank do ' she answer feebly ` if i be to refuse to play it would be a kind of reproach to she ' ' i do not think that would kill lady kirkbank ' reply maulevrier with a touch of scorn ` she have have to endure a good many imply reproach in she day and they do not seem to have hurt she very much i wish to heaven my grandmother have choose any one else in london for you chaperon ' ` i be afraid lady kirkbank 's be rather a rowdy set ' answer lesbium coolly ` and i sometimes feel as if i have throw myself away we go almost everywhere -- at least there be only just a few house to which we be not ask but those few make all the difference it be so humiliating to feel that one be not in quite the best society however lady kirkbank be a dear good old thing and i be not go to grumble about she ' ` i have make the cheque for five-and-twenty you can cash it at you milliner 's ' say maulevrier ' i should not like smithson to know that you have be oblige to ask I for the money ' ' _ apropo _ to mr smithson do you know if he be in quite the best society ' ask lesbia ' i do not know what you mean by quite the best a man of smithson 's wealth can generally poke he nose in anywhere if he know how to behave himself but of course there be people with whom money and fine house have no weight the conservative be all civil to smithson because he come down handsomely at general election and be useful to they in other way i believe that smithson 's wife if she be a thorough-bred one could go into any society she like and make she house one of the most popular in london perhaps that be what you really want to ask ` no it be not ' answer lesbium carelessly ' i be only talk for the sake of talk a thousand thanks for the cheque you best of brother ' ` it be not worth talk about but lesbium do not play card any more believe I it be not good form ' ` well i 'll try to keep out of it in future it be horrid to see one 's sovereign melt away but there be a delightful excitement in win ' ` no doubt ' answer maulevrier with a remorseful sigh he speak as a reform plunger and with many a bitter experience of the race-course and the card-room even now though he have steady himself wonderfully he could not get on without a little mild gambling -- half-crown pool whist with half-guinea point -- but when he condescend to such small stake he feel that he have settle down into a respectable middle-aged player and have a right to rebuke the folly of youth lesbium fly to the piano and sing one of she little german ballad directly maulevrier be go she feel as if a burden have be lift from she soul now that she be able to pay mr smithson without wait to ask lady maulevrier for the money and as she sing she meditate upon maulevrier 's remark about smithson he know nothing to the man 's discredit except that he have grow rich in a short space of time surely no man ought to be blame for that and he think that mr smithson 's wife might make she house the most popular in london lesbia in she mind 's eye behold a imaginary lady lesbium smithson give dance in that magnificent mansion entertaining royal personage and the doorway would be festoon with rose as she have see they the other night at a ball in grosvenor square but the house in grosvenor square be a hovel compare with the smithsonian palace lesbium be begin to be a little tired of lady kirkbank and she surroundings life take _ prestissimo _ be apt to pall lesbium sigh as she finish she little song she be begin to look upon she existence as a problem which have be give to she to solve and the solution just it present be all dark as she rise from the piano a footman come in with two letter on a salver -- bulky letter such package as lesbium have never see before she wonder what they could be she open the thickest envelope first it be seraphine 's bill -- such a bill page after page on creamy bath post write in a elegant italian hand by one of seraphine 's young woman lesbium look at it aghast with horror the total at the foot of the first page be appalling ever so much more than she could have suppose the whole amount of she indebtedness but the total go on increase at the foot of every page until at sight of the final figure lesbia give a wild shriek like a wretched creature who have receive a telegram announce bitterest loss the final total be twelve hundred and ninety-three pound seventeen and sixpence thirteen hundred pound for clothes in eight week no the thing be a cheat a mistake they have send she somebody else 's bill she have not have half these thing she read the first page she heart beat violently as she pore over the figure she eye dim and cloud with the trouble of she brain yes there be she court dress the description be too minute to be mistaken and the court dress with feather and shoe and glove and fan come to a hundred and thirty pound then follow innumerable item the very simplest of she gown cost five-and-twenty pound -- frock about which seraphine have talk so carelessly as if two or three more or less could make no difference bonnet and hat at five or seven guinea apiece swell the account parasol and fan be of fabulous price as it seem to lesbium and the shoe and stocking to match she various gown occur again and again between the more important item like the refrain of a old ballad all the useless and unnessary thing which she have order because she think they pretty or because she be tell they be fashionable rise up against she in the figure of the bill like the record of forget sin at the day of judgment she sink into a chair pallid with consternation and sit with the bill in she lap turn the page listlessly and stare at the figure ` it can not be so much ' she cry to herself ` it must be add up wrong ' and then she feebly try to cast up a column but arithmetic not be one of those accomplishment which lady maulevrier deem necessary to a patrician beauty 's success in life lesbium 's education have be somewhat neglect upon this point and she fling the bill from she in a rage unable to hold the figure in she brain she open the second envelope she jeweller 's account at the very first item she give another scream fainter than the first for she mind be get harden against such shock ` to re-set a suite of amethyst with forty-four finest brazilian brilliant three hundred and fifteen pound ' then follow the trifle she have buy at different visit to the shop -- casual purchase buy on the impulse of the moment these swell the account to a little over eight hundred pound lesbium sit like a statue numb by despair appal at the idea of owe over two thousand pound chapter xxx ` rose choke among thorn and thistle ' lady lesbium eat no luncheon that day she go to she own room and have a cup of tea to steady she nerve and send to ask lady kirkbank to go to she as soon as she have finish luncheon lady kirkbank 's luncheon be a serious business a substantial leisurely meal with which she fortify herself for the day 's work it enable she to endure all the fatigue of visit and park and to be airily indifferent to the charm of dinner for lady kirkbank be not one of those matron who with advanced year take to _ gourmandise _ as a kind of fine art she give good dinner because she know people would not come to arlington street to eat bad one but she be not a person who live only to dine at luncheon she give she healthy appetite full scope and eat like a ploughman she find lesbium in she white muslin dressing-gown with cheek as pale as the gown she wear she be sit in a easy chair with a low tea-table at she side and the two bill be in the tray among the tea-thing ` have you any idea how much i owe seraphine and cabochon ' she ask look up despairingly at lady kirkbank ` what have they send in they bill already ' ` already i wish they have send they before i should have know how deeply i be get into debt ' ` be they very heavy ' ` they be dreadful i owe over two thousand pound how can i tell lady maulevrier that two thousand one hundred pound it be awful ' ` there be woman in london who would think very little of owe twice as much ' say lady kirkbank in a comforting tone though the fact seriously consider could hardly afford comfort ` you grandmother say you be to have _ carte blanche _ she may think that you have be just a little extravagant but she can hardly be angry with you for have take she at she word two thousand pound yes it certainly be rather stiff ' ` seraphine be a cheat ' exclaim lesbium angrily ` she price be positively exorbitant ' ` my dear child you must not say that seraphine be positively moderate in comparison with the new people ' ` and mr cabochon too the idea of he charge I three hundred guinea for re-set those stupid old amethyst ' ` my dear you _ would _ have diamond mix with they ' say lady kirkbank reproachfully lesbium turn away she head with a impatient sigh she remember perfectly that it be lady kirkbank who have persuade she to order the diamond setting but there be no use in talk about it now the thing be do she be two thousand pound in debt -- two thousand pound to these two people only -- and there be ever so many shop at which she have account -- glover bootmaker habit-maker the tailor who make she newmarket coat and cloth gown the stationer who supply she with note-paper of every variety monogrammed floral sport illuminate with this or that device the folly of the pass hour hatch by penniless invention in a garret pandering to the vanity of the idle ' i must write to my grandmother by this afternoon 's post ' say lesbium with a heavy sigh ` impossible we have to be at the ranelagh by four o'clock smithson and some other man be to meet we there i have promise to drive mr mostyn down you have better begin to dress ' ` but i ought to write to-day i have better ask for this money at once and have do with it two thousand pound i feel as if i be a thief you say my grandmother be not a rich woman ' ` not rich as the world go nowadays nobody be rich now except you commercial magnate like smithson great peer unless they money be in london ground-rent be great pauper to own land be to be destitute i do not suppose two thousand pound will break you grandmother 's bank but of course it be a large sum to ask for at the end of two month especially as she send you a good deal of money while we be at canne if you be engage -- about to make a really good match -- you could ask for the money as a matter of course but as it be although you have be tremendously admire from a practical point of view you be a failure ' a failure it be a hard word but lesbium feel it be true she the reign beauty the cynosure of every eye have make no conquest worth talk about except mr smithson ` do not tell you grandmother anything about the bill for a week or two ' say lady kirkbank soothingly ` the creature can wait for they money give yourself time to think ' ' i will ' answer lesbium dolefully ` and now make haste and get ready for the ranelagh my love you eye be dreadfully heavy you _ must _ use a little belladonna i 'll send rilboche to you ' and for the first time in she life lesbium too depressed to argue the point consent to have she eye doctor by rilboche she be gay enough at the ranelagh and look she loveliest at a dinner party that evening and go to three party after the dinner and go home in the faint light of early morning after sit out a late waltz in a balcony with mr smithson a balcony bank round with hot-house flower which be begin to droop a little in the chilly morning air just as beauty droop under the search eye of day lesbium put the bill in she desk and give herself time to think as lady kirkbank advise she but the think progress result in very little good all the thought of which she be capable would not reduce the total of those two dreadful account and every day bring some fresh bill the stationer the bootmaker the glover the perfumer people who have court lady lesbium 's custom with a air which imply that the honor of serve fashionable beauty be the first consideration and the question of payment quite a minor point -- these now begin to ask for they money in the most prosaic way every straw add to lesbium 's burden and she heart grow heavier with every post ` one can see the season be wane when these people begin to pester with they account ' say lady kirkbank who always talk of tradesman as if they be she natural enemy lesbia accept this explanation of the avalanche of bill and never suspect lady kirkbank 's influence in the matter it happen however that the chaperon have she own reason for wish to bring mr smithson 's suit to a successful issue have tell seraphine and the other people to send in they bill immediately lady lesbium would be leave london in a week or so she inform these purveyor and would like to settle everything before she go away mr smithson appear in arlington street almost every day and be full of scheme for new pleasure -- or pleasure as nearly new as the world of fashion can afford he be particularly desirous that sir george and lady kirkbank with lady lesbium should stay at he berkshire place during the henley week he have a large steam launch and the regatta be a kind of carnival for he intimate friend who be not too proud to riot and batten upon the parvenu 's luxurious hospitality albeit they be apt to talk somewhat slightingly of he antecedent lady kirkbank feel that this invitation be a turn point and that if lesbium go to stay at rood hall she acceptance of mr smithson be a certainty she would see he at he place in berkshire in the most flattering aspect he surroundings as lord of the manor and owner of one of the finest old place in the county would lend dignity to he insignificance lesbium at first express a strong disinclination to go to rood hall there would be a most unpleasant feeling in stop at the house of a man whom she have refuse she tell lady kirkbank ` my dear mr smithson have forgive you ' answer she chaperon ` he be the soul of good nature ' ` one would think he be accustom to be refuse ' say lesbium ' i do not want to go to rood hall but i do not want to spoil you henley week could not i run down to grasmere for a week with kibble to take care of I and see dear grandmother i could tell she about those dreadful bill ' ` bury yourself at grasmere in the height of the season not to be think of besides lady maulevrier object before to the idea of you travel alone with kibble no if you can not make up you mind to go to rood hall george and i must make up we mind to stay away but it will be rather hard line for that henley week be quite the jolliest thing in the summer ' ` then i 'll go ' say lesbium with a resigned air ` not for world would i deprive you and sir george of a pleasure ' in she heart of heart she rather wish to see rood hall she be curious to behold the extent and magnitude of mr smithson 's possession she have see he italian villa in park lane the perfection of modern art modern skill modern taste revive the old eternally beautiful form recreate the pittus palace -- the home of the medicus -- the hall of dead and go doge -- and now she be tell that rood hall -- a genuine old english manor-house in perfect preservation -- be even more interesting than the villa in park lane at rood hall there be ideal stable and farm hot-house without number rise garden lawn the river and a deer park so the invitation be accept and mr smithson immediately lay himself at lesbium 's foot as it be with regard to all other invitation for the henley festival whom should he ask to meet she -- whom would she have ` you be very good ' she say ` but i have really no wish to be consult i be not a royal personage remember i could not presume to dictate ' ` but i wish you to dictate i wish you to be imperious in the expression of you wish ' ` lady kirkbank have a better right than i if anybody be to be consult ' say lesbium modestly ` lady kirkbank be a old dear who get on delightfully with everybody but you be more sensitive you comfort might be mar by a obnoxious presence i will ask nobody whom you do not like -- who be not thoroughly _ simpatico _ have you no particular friend of you own choosing whom you would like I to ask ' lesbium confess that she have no such friend she like everybody tolerably but she have not a talent for friendship perhaps it be because in the london season one be too busy to make friend ' i can fancy two girl get quite attach to each other out of the season ' she say ` but in may and June life be all a rush and a scramble -- ' ` and one have no time to gather wayside flower of friendship ' interjected mr smithson ` still if there be no people for whom you have a especial liking there _ must _ be people whom you detest ' lesbium own that it be so detestation come of itself naturally ` then let I be sure i do not ask any of you pet aversion ' say mr smithson ` you meet mr plantagenet parson the theatrical critic at my house shall we have he ' ' i like all amusing people ' ` and horace meander the poet shall we have he he be brimful of conceit and affectation but he be a tremendous joke ' ` mr meander be charming ' ` suppose we ask mostyn and he wife she scrap of science be rather good fun ' ' i have not the faintest objection to the mostyn ' reply lesbium ` but who be we ' ` we be you and i for the nonce the invitation will be issue ostensibly by I but they will really emanate from you ' ' i be to be the shadow behind the throne ' say lesbia ` how delightful ' ' i would rather you be the sovereign ruler on the throne ' answer smithson tenderly ` that throne shall be empty till you fill it ' ` please go on with you list of people ' say lesbium check this gush of sentiment she begin to feel somehow that she be drift from all she mooring that in accept this invitation to rood hall she be allow herself to be ensnare into a alliance about which she be still doubtful if anything better have appear in the prospect of she life -- if any worthier suitor have come forward she would have whistle mr smithson down the wind but no worthier suitor have offer himself it be smithson or nothing if she do not accept smithson she would go back to fellside heavily burden with debt and a obvious failure she would have run the gauntlet of a london season without definite result and this to a young woman so impressed with she own transcendent merit be a most humiliating state of thing other people 's name be suggest by mr smithson and approve by lesbium and a house party of about fourteen in all be make up mr smithson 's steam launch would comfortably accommodate that number he have a couple of barge for chance visitor and keep a open table on board they during the regatta the visit arrange the next question be gown lesbium have gown enough to have stock a draper 's shop but then as she and lady kirkbank deplore the difficulty be that she have wear they all some as many as three or four time they be doubtless all marked and know some of they have be describe in the society papers at henley she would be expect to wear something distinctly new to introduce some new fashion of gown or hat or parasol no matter how ugly the new thing might be so long as it be startling no matter how eccentric provide it be original ` what be i to do ' ask lesbia despairingly ` there be only one thing that can be do we must go instantly to seraphine and insist upon she invent something if she have no idea ready she must telegraph worth and get he to send something over you old thing will do very well for rood hall you have no end of pretty gown for morning and evening but you must be original on the race day you gown will be in all the papers ' ` but i shall be only get deeper into debt ' say lesbium with a sigh ` that can not be help if you go into society you must be properly dress we 'll go to clanricarde place directly after luncheon and see what that old harpy have to show we ' lesbium have a rather uncomfortable feeling about face the fair seraphine without be able to give she a cheque upon account of that dreadful bill she have quite accept lady kirkbank 's idea that bill never need be discharge in full and that the true system of finance be to give a occasional cheque on account as a sop to cerberus true that while cerberus fatten on the sop the bill seem always grow and the final crash when cerberus grow savage and sop could be no more accept be too awful to be think about lesbium enter seraphine 's louis-seize drawing-room with a faint expectation of unpleasantness but after a little whispering between lady kirkbank and the dressmaker the latter come to lesbium smile graciously and seemingly full of eagerness for new order ` miladi say you want something of the most original -- _ tant soit peu risqué _ -- for ` enley ' she say ` let we see now ' and she tap she forehead with a gold thimble which nobody have ever see she use but which look respectable ` there be ze dress that chaumont wear in zis new play _ une faute dan le passé _ yes zere be the watare dress -- a boat party at bougival a toilet of the most new striking _ écrasant _ what you english call a screamer ' ` what a genius you be fifine ' exclaimed lady kirkbank rapturously ` the _ faute dan le passé _ be only produce last week no one will have think of copying chaumont 's gown yet awhile the idea be a inspiration ' ` what be the boat costume like ' ask lady lesbium faintly ` a exquisite combination of simplicity with _ vlan _ ' answer the dressmaker ' a skin-tight indigo silk jersey bodice closely stud with dark blue bead a flounced petticoat of indigo and amber foulard a amber scarf draw tightly round the hip and a dark blue toque with a largo bunch of amber poppy tan-coloured mousquetaire glove and hessian boot of tan-coloured kid ' ` hessian boot ' ejaculate lesbium ` but yes miladi the petticoat be somewhat short you comprehend to escape the damp of the deck and after all hessian be much less indelicate than silk stocking leg _ à cru _ as one may say ' ` lesbia you will look enchant in yellow hessian ' say lady kirkbank ` let the dress be put in hand instantly seraphine ' lesbium be incline to remonstrate she do not admire the description of the costume she would rather have something less outrageous ` outrageous it be only original ' exclaim she chaperon ` if chaumont wear it you may be sure it be perfect ' ` but on the stage by gaslight in the midst of unreality ' argue lesbium ` that make such a difference ' ` my dear there be no difference nowadays between the stage and the drawing-room whatever chaumont wear you may wear and now let we think of the second day i think as you first costume be to be nautical and rather masculine you second should be somewhat languish and _ vaporeux _ creamy indian muslin wild flower a large leghorn hat ' ` and what will miladi herself wear ' ask the french woman of lady kirkbank ` she must have something of new ' ` no at my age it do not matter i shall wear one of my cotton frock and my dunstable hat ' lesbium shudder for lady kirkbank in she cotton frock be a spectacle at which youth laugh and age blush but after all it do not matter to lesbia she would have like a less rowdy chaperon but as a foil to she own fresh young beauty lady kirkbank be admirable they drive down to rood hall early next week sir george convey they in he drag with a change of horse at maidenhead the weather be peerless the country exquisite approach from london how different that river landscape look to the eye of the traveller return from the wild west of england the wooded gorge of cornwall and devon the tamar and the dart then how small and poor and mean seem silvery thame glide peacefully between he willowy bank singing he lullaby to the whisper sedge a poor little river a flat commonplace landscape say the traveller fresh from moorland and tor from the rocky shore of the atlantic the deep cleft of the great red hill to lesbium 's eye the placid stream and the green pasture breathe odour of meadow-sweet and clover seem pass lovely she be please with she own hat and parasol too which make she graciously dispose towards the landscape and the last packet of glove from north audley street fit without a wrinkle the glovemaker be begin to understand she hand which be a study for a sculptor but which have its little peculiarity nor be she ill-disposed to mr smithson who have come up to town by a early train in order to lunch in arlington street and go back by coach seat just behind lady lesbium who have the box seat beside sir george the drive be delightful it be a few minute after five when the coach drive past the picturesque old gate-house into mr smithson 's park and rood hall lay on the low ground in front of they with its back to the river it be a old red brick house in the tudor style with a advanced porch and four project wing three story high with picturesque spire roof overtop the main building around the house run a boldly-carved stone parapet bear the heron and bulrush which be the cognisance of the noble race for which the mansion be build numerous project mullioned window break up the line of the park front lesbium be fain to own that rood hall be even better than park lane in london mr smithson have create a palace but it be a new palace which still have a faint flavor of brick and mortar and which be apt to remind the spectator of that wonderful erection of aladdin the famous parvenu of eastern story here in berkshire mr smithson have drop into a nest which have be keep warm for he for three century air and beautify by generation of a noble race which have obligingly decay and dwindle in order to make room for mr smithson here the parvenu have buy a home mellow by the slow growth of year touch into poetic beauty by the chastening finger of time he artist friend tell he that every brick in the red wall be ` precious ' a mystery of color which only a painter could fitly understand and value here he have buy association he have buy history he have buy the dust of elizabeth 's senator the bone of she court beauty the coffin in the mausoleum yonder in the ferny depths of the park the village church just outside the gate -- these have all go with the property lesbium go up the grand staircase through the long corridor in a dream of wonder bring up at fellside in that new part of the westmoreland house which have be build by she grandmother and have no history she feel thrill by the sober splendor of this fine old manorial

and shadow on the river and on the subtle ineffable beauty of twilight which perhaps however utterly beautiful in the abstract would have be more agreeable to he personally if he have not be surround by a cloud of gnat which refuse to be buffet off he laurel-crowned head while mr meander poetise in he usual eloquent style mr mostyn as a still newer light discourse as eloquently to little a knot of

they hold vestry and have burial board they be most absorb creature if you only give yourself up to the study of they but it be no use to be half-hearted in a study of that kind i go without so much as a cup of tea for twenty-four hour watch my gnat for fear the opening of the door should startle they another time i shall make the nursery governess watch for I ' ` how interesting how noble of you ' exclaim the other lady and then they begin to talk about bonnet and about mr smithson to speculate how much money this house and all he other house have cost he and to wonder if he be really rich or if he be only one of those great financial windbag which so often explode and leave the world aghast marvelling at the ease with which it have be delude they wonder too whether lady lesbium haselden mean to marry he ` of course she do my dear ' answer mr mostyn decisively ` you do not suppose that after have study the habit of _ gnat _ i can not read such a poor shallow creature as a silly vain girl of course lady lesbium mean to marry mr smithson 's fine house and she be only amusing herself and swell she own importance by let he dangle in a kind of suspense which be not suspense for he know as well as she do that she mean to have he ' the next day be give up first to see the house a amusement which last very well for a hour or so after breakfast and then to wander in a desultory manner to rowing and canoeing and a little sailing and a good deal of scream and pretty timidity upon the blue bright river to gather wild flower and fern in rustic lane and to a _ al fresco _ luncheon in the wood at medmenham and then dinner and then music a evening spend half within and half without the music-room cigarette sparkling like glowworm on the terrace tall talk from mr meander

wet foot or damage raiment lesbium 's chaumount costume be a success the woman praise it the man stare and admire the dark-blue silken jersey sparkling with closely stud indigo bead fit the slim graceful figure as a serpent 's scale fit the serpent the coquettish little blue silk toque the careless cluster of gold-coloured poppy against the glossy brown hair the large sunshade of old gold satin line with indigo the flounced petticoat of softest indian silk the dainty little tan-coloured boot with high heel and point toe be all perfect after they fashion and mr smithson feel that the liege lady of he life the woman he mean to marry willy nilly would be the belle of the race-course nor be he disappoint everybody in london have hear of lady lesbium haselden she photograph be in all the west-end window be enshrine in the album of south kensington and clapham maida vale and haverstock hill people whose circle be far remote from lady lesbium 's circle be as familiar with she beauty as if they have know she from she cradle and all these outsider want to see she in the flesh just as they always thirst to behold royal personage so when it become know that the beautiful lady lesbium haselden be on board mr smithson 's launch all the people in the small boat or on neighbour barge make it they business if have a good look at she the launch be almost mob by those inquisitive little

everything and everybody i will never be photograph again ' ` oh yes you will and in that frock it be the prettiest thing i have see for a long time why do you hide yourself from those poor wretch who keep rowing backwards and forwards in a obviously aimless way just to get a peep at you _ en passant _ what happiness for we who live near you and can gaze when we will without all those absurd maneuver there go the signal -- and now for a hard-fought race ' lesbium pretend to be interested in the racing -- she pretend to be gay but she heart be as heavy as lead the burden of debt which have be grow ever since seraphine send in she bill be weigh she down to the dust she owe three thousand pound it seem incredible that she should owe so much that a girl 's frivolous fancy and extravagance could amount to such a sum within so short a span but thoughtless purchase ignorant order have run on from week to week and the main result be a indebtedness of close upon three thousand pound three thousand pound the sum be continually sound in she ear like the cry of a screech owl the very ripple of the river flow so peacefully under the blue summer sky seem to repeat the word three thousand pound ` be it much ' she wonder have no standard of comparison ` be it very much more than my grandmother will expect I to have spend in the time will it trouble she to have to pay those bill will she be very angry ' these be question which lesbia keep ask herself in every pause of she frivolous existence in such a pause as this for instance while the people round she be stand breathless open-mouthed gazing after the boat she do not care a straw for the boat who win or who lose the race it be all a hollow mockery indeed it seem just now that the only real thing in life be those accursed bill which would have to be pay somehow she have tell lady maulevrier nothing about they as yet she have allow herself to be advise by lady kirkbank and she have take time to think but think have give she no help the day be glide onward and lady maulevrier would have to be tell she meditate perplexedly about she grandmother 's income she have never hear the extent of it but have take for grant that lady maulevrier be rich would three thousand pound make a great inroad on that income would it be a year 's income -- half a year 's lesbium have no idea life at fellside be carry on in a elegant manner -- with considerable luxury in house and garden -- a luxury of flower a lavish expenditure of labor yet the expenditure of lady maulevrier 's existence spend always on the same spot must be as nothing to the money spend in such a life as lady kirkbank 's which involve the keep up of three or four house and costly journey to and fro and incessant change of attire no doubt lady maulevrier have save money yes she must have save thousand during she long seclusion lesbium argue she grandmother have tell she that she be to look upon herself as a heiress this could only mean that lady maulevrier have a fortune to leave she and this be so what could it matter if she have anticipate some of she portion and yet there be in she heart of heart a terrible fear of that stern dowager of the cold scorn in those splendid eye when she should stand reveal in all she foolishness she selfish mindless vain extravagance she who have never be reprove shrink with a sickly dread from the idea of reproof and to be tell that she career as a fashionable beauty have be a failure that would be the bitterest pang of all soon come luncheon and heidseck and then a afternoon which be gayer than the morning have be inasmuch as every one babble and laugh more after luncheon and then there be five o'clock tea on deck under the striped japanese awning to the jingle of banjo enliven by the wit of black-faced minstrel amidst wherry and canoe and gondola and ponderous houseboat and snort launch crowd the side of the sunlit river in full view of the crowd yonder in front of the red lion and here on this nearer bank and all along either shore fringe the green meadow with a gaudy border of smartly-dressed humanity it be a gay scene and lesbium give herself up to the amusement of the hour and talk and chaff as she have learn to talk and chaff in one brief season hold she own against all comer rood hall look lovely when they go back to it in the gloam a elizabethan pile crown with tower the four wing with they conical roof the massive project window gray stone ruddy brickwork lattice reflect the sunlight italian terrace and blue river in the foreground cedar and yew at the back all make a splendid picture of a english ancestral home ` nice old place be not it ' ask mr smithson see lesbium 's admiring gaze as the launch near the terrace they two be stand in the bow apart from

while lady lesbium be drain the cup of london folly and london care to the dregs lady mary be lead she usual quiet life beside the glassy lake where the green hill-side and sheep walk be reflect in

joy of a satisfied heart a mind at rest all life have take a new color since she engagement to john hammond a sense of new duty a awakening earnestness have give a graver tone to she character she spirit be less wild yet not less joyous than of old the joy be holier deeper she lover 's letter be the chief delight of she lonely day to read they again and again and ponder upon they and then to pour out all she heart and mind in answer they these be pleasure enough for she young like hammond 's letter be such as any woman might be proud to receive they be not love-letter only he write as friend to friend not descend from the proud pinnacle of masculine intelligence to the lower level of feminine silliness not write down to a simple country girl 's capacity but writing-fully and fervently as if there be no subject too lofty or too grave for the understanding of he betrothed he write as one sure of be sympathise with write as to he second self : and mary show herself not unworthy of the honor thus render to she intellect there be one world which have newly open to mary since she engagement and that be the world of politics hammond have tell she that he ambition be to succeed as a politician -- to do some good in he day as one of the govern body and of late she have make it she business to learn how england and the world outside england be govern she have no natural lean to the study of political economy instead she have always imagine any question relate to the government of she country to be inherently dry-as-dust and uninviting but have john hammond devoted he day to the study of coptic manuscript or the arrow head inscription upon assyrian tablet she would have toil she hardest in the endeavor to make herself a coptic scholar or a adept in the cuneiform character if he have be a student of chinese she would not have be discomfited by such a trifle as the fifty thousand character in the chinese alphabet and so as he be to make he name in the arena of public life she set herself to acquire a proper understanding of the science of politics and to this end she gorge herself with english history -- hume hallam green justin mccarthy palgrave

to repel she for be not she lover interested in the dryest thereof and what concern he and he welfare must need be full of interest for she to this end she read the debate religiously day by day and she one day venture shyly to suggest that she should read they aloud to lady maulevrier ` would it not be a little rest for you if i be to read you time aloud to you every afternoon grandmother ' she ask ` you read so many book french english and german and i think you eye must get a little tired sometimes ' mary venture the remark with some timidity for those falcon eye be fix upon she all the time bright and clear and steady as the eye of youth it seem almost a impertinence to suggest that such eye could know weariness ` no mary my sight hold out wonderfully for a old woman ' reply she ladyship gently ` the new theory of the last oculist whose book i dip into -- a very amusing and interesting book by-the-bye -- be that the sight improve and strengthen by constant use and that a agricultural labourer who hardly use he eye at all have rarely in the decline of life so good a sight as the watchmaker or the student i have read immensely all my life and find myself no worse for that indulgence but you may read the debate to I if you like my dear for if my eye be strong i myself be very tired sick to death mary sick to death ' the splendid eye turn from mary and look away to the blue sky to the hill in they ineffable beauty of color and light -- shift change with every moment of the summer day intense weariness a settle despair be express in that look -- tearless yet sadder than all tear ` it must be very monotonous very sad for you ' murmur mary she own eye brim over with tear ` but it will not be always so dear grandmother i hope a time will come when you will be able to go about again to resume you old life ' ' i do not hope mary no child i feel and know that time will never come my strength be ebb slowly day by day if i live for another year live to see

she ' mary change from red to pale so painful be she embarrassment what could she say in defense of she sister how could she deny that lesbium be a ingrate when those rare and hurry letter so careless in they tone express the selfishness of the writer in every syllable tell but too plainly of forgetfulness and ingratitude ` dear grandmother lesbium have so much to do -- she life be so full of engagement ' she falter feebly ` yes she go from party to party -- she give herself up heart and mind and soul to pleasure which she ought to consider only as the trivial means to great end and she

the mass and lord hartfield speak with a eloquence which rise in force and fire as he wind himself like a serpent into the heart of he subject -- begin quietly soberly with no opening flash of rhetoric but rise gradually to the topmost height of oratory ` what a speech ' cry lady maulevrier delight she cheek glowing she eye kindle ` what a noble fellow the speaker must be oh mary i must tell you a secret i love that man 's father yes my dear i love he fondly dearly truly as you love that young man of yours and he be the only man i ever really love fate part we but i have never forget

fight oh mary if i have only fight hard enough what a happy woman i might have be and how good a wife ' ` you be a good wife to my grandfather i be sure ' falter mary by way of say something consolatory a dark frown come over lady maulevrier 's face which have soften to deepest tenderness just before ' a good wife to maulevrier ' she say in a mock tone well yes as good a wife as such a husband deserve ' i be better than caesar 's wife mary for no breath of suspicion ever rest upon my name but if i have marry ronald hollister i should have be a happy woman and that i have never be

responsibility and escape almost all those vice which make young man detestable he mother die within a few month of he majority he be broken-hearted at lose she and leave europe immediately after she death from that time he have be a great traveller but i suppose now that he have take he seat in the house of lord and have speak a good many time he mean to settle down and take he place among the foremost man of he day i be tell that he be worthy to take such a place ' ` you must feel warmly interested in watch he career ' say mary sympathetically ' i be interested in everything that concern he i will tell you another secret mary i think i be get into my dotage my dear or i should hardly talk to you like this ' say lady maulevrier with a touch of bitterness mary be sit on a stool by the sofa close to the invalid 's pillow she clasp she grandmother 's hand and kiss it fondly ` dear grandmother i think you be talk to I like this to-day because you be begin to care for I a little ' she say tenderly ` oh my dear you be very good very sweet and forgiving to care for I at all after my neglect of you ' answer lady maulevrier with a sigh ' i have keep you out in the cold so long mary lesbium -- well lesbium have be a kind of infatuation for I and like all infatuation mine have end in disappointment and bitterness ambition have be the bane of my life mary and when i could no longer be ambitious for myself -- when my own existence have become a mere death in life i begin to dream and to scheme for the aggrandisement of my granddaughter lesbium 's beauty lesbium 's elegance seem to make success certain -- and so i dream my dream -- which may never be fulfil ' ` what be you dream grandmother may i know all about it ' ` that be the secret i speak of just now yes mary you may know for i fear the dream will never be realize i want my lesbium to become lord hartfield 's wife i would have bring they together myself could i have but go to london but fail that i fancied lady kirkbank would have divine my wish without be tell they and would have introduce hartfield to lesbium and now the london season be draw to a close and hartfield and lesbium have never meet he hardly go anywhere i be tell he devote himself exclusively to politics and he be not in lady kirkbank 's set a terrible disappointment to I mary ' ` it be a pity ' say mary ` lesbium be so lovely if lord hartfield be fancy-free he ought to fall in love with she could they but meet i think that in london all fashionable people know each other and be continually meet ' ` it use to be so in my day mary almack 's be a common ground even if there have be no other but now there be circle and circle i believe ring that touch occasionally but never break and mingle i be afraid poor georgie 's set be not quite so nice as i could have wish yet lesbia write as if she be in rapture with she chaperon and with all the people she meet and then georgie tell I that this mr smithson whom lesbia have refuse be a very important personage a millionaire and very likely to be make a peer ' ' a new peer ' say mary make a wry face ` one would rather have a old commoner i always fancy a newly-made peer must be like a newly-built house glaring and stare and arid and uncongenial ' ' _ c'est selon _ ' say lady maulevrier ` one would not despise a chatham or a wellington because of the newness of he title but a man who have only money to recommend he -- ' lady maulevrier leave she sentence unfinished save by a shrug while mary make another wry face she have that grand contempt for sordid wealth which be common to young people who have never know the want of money ' i hope lesbium will marry some one better than mr smithson ' she say ' i hope so too dear and yet do you know i have a idea that lesbium mean to accept mr smithson or she would hardly have consent to go to he house for the henley week here be a letter from georgie kirkbank which you will have to answer for I to-morrow -- a letter full of rapture about mr smithson 's place in berkshire rood hall i remember the house well i be there nearly fifty year ago when the heronville own it and now the heronville be all dead or ruin and this city person be master of the fine old mansion it be a strange world mary ' from that time forward mary and she grandmother be on more confidential term and when two day later fellside be startle into life by the unexpected arrival of lord maulevrier and mr hammond the dowager seem almost as pleased as she granddaughter at the arrival of the young man as for mary she be almost beside herself with joy when she hear they voice from the lawn and rush to the shrubbery see they walk up the hill as she have see they on that first evening nearly a year ago when john hammond come as a stranger to fellside she try to take she joy soberly though she eye be dance with delight as she go to the porch to meet they ` what extraordinary young man you be ' she say as she emerge breathless from she lover 's embrace ` the idea of you descend upon we without a moment 's notice why do you not write or telegraph that you room might be ready ' ` be i to understand that all the spare room at fellside be keep as damp as at the bottom of the lake ' ask maulevrier ' i do not think any preparation be necessary but we can go back if we be not wanted can not we jack ' ` you darling ' cry mary hanging affectionately upon she brother 's arm ` you _ know _ i be only joke you _ know _ how enraptured i be to have you ' ` to have _ I _ only I ' say maulevrier ` jack do not count i suppose ' ` you know how glad i be and that i want to hide my gladness ' answer mary radiant and blush like the rich red rose in the porch ` you man be so vain and now come and see grandmother she will be cheer by you arrival she have be so good to I just lately so sweet ' ` she might have be good and sweet to you all you life ' say hammond ' i be not prepare to be grateful to she at a moment 's notice for any crumb of affection she may throw you ' ` oh but you must be grateful sir and you must love she and pity she ' retort mary ` think how sadly she have suffer we can not be too kind to she or too fond of she poor dear ' ` mary be right ' say hammond half in jest and half in earnest ` what wonderful instinct these young woman have ' ` come and see she ladyship and then you must have dinner just as you have that first evening ' say mary ` we 'll act that first evening over again jack only you can not fall in love with lesbium as she be not here ' ' i do not think i surrender that first evening mary though i think you sister the loveliest girl i have ever see ' ` and what do you think of I sir tell I that ' say mary ` shall i tell you the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth ' ` of course ' ` then i freely confess that i do not think about you at all you be there -- a pretty innocent bright young maiden with big brown eye and auburn hair but i think no more about you than i do about the gainsborough on the wall which you very much resemble ' ` that be most humiliating ' say mary pout a little in the midst of she bliss ` no dearest it be only natural ' answer hammond ' i believe if all the happy lover in this world could be question at least half of they would confess to have think very little about each other at first meeting they meet and touch hand and part again and never guess the mystery of the future which wrap they round like a cloud never say of each other there be my fate and then they meet again and again as hazard will and never know that they be drift to they doom ' mary ring bell and give order just as she have do in that summer gloaming a year ago the young man have arrive just at the same hour on the stroke of nine when the eight o'clock dinner be over and do with for a _ tête-à-tête _ meal with fräulein müller be not a feast to be prolong on account of its felicity perhaps they have so contrived as to arrive exactly at this hour lady maulevrier receive they both with extreme cordiality but the young man see a change for the worse in the invalid since the spring the face be thinner the eye too bright the flush upon the hollow cheek have a hectic tinge the voice be feebler hammond be remind of a falcon or a eagle pining and waste in a cage ' i be very glad to see you mr hammond ' say lady maulevrier give he she hand and address he with unwonted cordiality ` it be a happy thought that bring you and maulevrier here when a old woman be as near the grave as i be she relative ought to look after she i shall be glad to have a little private conversation with you to-morrow mr hammond if you can spare I a few minute ' ` as many hour if you ladyship please ' say hammond ` my time be entirely at you service ' ` oh no you will want to be roam about the hill with mary discuss you plan for the future i shall not encroach too much on you time but i be very glad you be here ' ` we shall only trespass on you for a few day ' say maulevrier ` just a fly visit ' ` how be it that you be not both at henley ' ask mary ' i think all the world be at henley ' ` who be henley what be henley ' demand maulevrier pretend ignorance ' i believe maulevrier have lose so much money back he college boat on previous occasion that he be glad to run away from the regatta this year ' say hammond ' i have a sister there ' reply he friend ` that be a all-sufficient explanation when a fellow 's women-kind take to go to race and regatta it be high time for _ he _ to stop away ' ` have you see lesbium lately ' ask he grandmother ` about ten day ago ' ` and do she seem happy ' maulevrier shrug he shoulder ` she be vacillate between the refusal or the acceptance of a million of money and four or five fine house i do not know whether that condition of mind mean happiness i should call it a intermediate state ' ` why do you make silly joke about serious question do you think lesbium mean to accept this mr smithson ' ` all london think so ' ` and be he a good man ' ` good for a hundred thousand pound at half a hour 's notice ' ` be he worthy of you sister ' maulevrier pause look at he grandmother with a curious expression and then reply -- ' i think he be -- quite ' ` then i be content that she should marry he ' say lady maulevrier ` although he be a nobody ' ` oh but he be a very important nobody a nobody who can get a peerage next year back by the maulevrier influence which i suppose would count for something ' ` most of my friend be dead ' say lady maulevrier ` but there be a few survivor of the past who might help I ' ' i do not think there 'll be any difficulty or doubt about the peerage smithson stump up very handsomely at the last general election and the conservative be not strong enough to be ungrateful these have no master ' chapter xxxii way and mean the three day that follow be among the happiest day of mary haselden 's young life lady maulevrier have become strangely indulgent a soften influence of some kind have work upon that haughty spirit and it seem as if she whole nature be change -- or it might be mary thought that this softer side of she character have always be turn to lesbium while to mary herself it be altogether new lesbium have be the peach on the sunny southern wall ripen and redden in a flood of sunshine mary have be the stunt fruit grow in a north-east corner hide among leaf blow upon by cold wind green and hard and sour for lack of the warm bright light and now mary feel the sunshine and grow glad and gay in those glowing beam ` dear grandmother i believe you be begin to

scantiest -- still i feel somehow that i can trust he send you lover to I mary i want to have a serious talk with he ' mary run off to obey fluttered blushing and tremble this idea of marriage in the immediate future be to be the last degree startling a year have seem a very long time and she have be tell that she and she lover must wait a year at the very least so that vision of marriage have seem afar off in the dim shadowland of the future she have be tell nothing by she lover of where she be to live or what she life be to be like when she be he wife and now she be tell that they be to be marry almost immediately that they be to live in the house where she have be rear in that familiar land of hill and water that they be to roam about the dale and mountain together they two as man and wife the whole thing be wonderful bewildering impossible almost this be on the first morning after mr hammond 's arrival maulevrier have go off to hunt the rotha for otter and be up to he waist in the water no doubt by this time hammond be stroll up and down the terrace in front of the house look at the green expanse of fairfield the dark bulk of seat sandal the nearer crest of helm crag and

ladyship 's sitting-room and there leave he to go in alone she go to the library -- that room over which a gloomy shadow seem to have hang ever since that awful winter afternoon when mary find lady maulevrier lie on the floor in the twilight but it be a noble room and in she studious hour mary loved to sit here walled round with book and able to consult or dip into as many volume as she like to-day however she mind be not attuned to study she sit with a volume of macaulay open before she : but she thought be not with the author she be wonder what those two be say in the room overhead and find all attempt at read futile she let she head sink back upon the cushion of she deep luxurious chair and sit with she dreamy eye fix on the summer landscape and she thought with she lover lady maulevrier look very wan and tired in the bright morning light when mr hammond seat himself beside she sofa the change in she appearance since the spring be more marked to-day than it have seem to he last night in the dim lamplight yes there be need hero for a speedy settlement of air earthly matter the traveller be near the mysterious end of the journey the summons might come at any hour ` mr hammond i feel a confidence in you integrity you goodness of heart and high principle which i never think i could feel for a man of whom i know so little ' begin lady maulevrier gravely ` all i know of you or you antecedent be what my grandson have tell I -- and i must say that the information so give have be very meager and yet i believe in you -- and yet i be go to trust you wholly blindly implicitly -- and i be go to give you my granddaughter ever so much sooner than i intend to give she to you soon very soon if you will have she ' ' i will have she to-morrow if there be time to get a special licence ' exclaim hammond bend down to kiss the dowager 's hand radiant with delight ` you shall marry she very soon if you like marry she by special licence in this room i should like to see you wedding i have a strange impatience to behold one of my granddaughter happily marry to know that she future be secure that come weal come woe she be safe in the protection of a brave true man i be not scare by the idea of a little poverty that be often the best education for youth but while you and i be alone we may as well talk about way and mean perhaps you may hardly feel prepared to take upon yourself the burden of a wife this year ' ` as well this year as next i be not afraid ' ` young man be so rash however as long as i live you responsibility will be only nominal this house will be mary 's home and yours whenever you be able to occupy it of course i should not like to interfere with you professional effort -- but if you be cultivate literature -- why book can be write at fellside better than in london this lakeland of ours have be the nursery of deathless writer but i feel that my day be number -- and when i be dead -- well death be always a cause of change and trouble of some kind and mary will profit very little by my death the bulk of my fortune be leave to lesbia i have teach she to consider herself my heiress and it would be unjust to alter my will ' ` pray do not dream of such a thing -- there be no need -- mary will be rich enough ' exclaim hammond hastily ` with five hundred a year and the fruit of you industry ' say lady maulevrier ` yes yes with modest aspiration and simple habit people can live happily honourably on a few hundred a year and if you really mean to devote yourself to literature and do not mind bury yourself alive in this lake district until you have make you name as a writer why the problem of way and means will be easily solve ' ` dear lady maulevrier i be not afraid of way and mean that be the last question which need trouble you i tell lesbium when i offer myself to she nearly a year ago that if she would trust I if she would cleave to I poverty should never touch she sordid care should never come near she dwelling but she could not believe I she be like thoma the twin i could show she no palpable security for my promise -- and she would not believe for the promise ' sake mary trust I and mary shall not regret she confidence ' ` ah it be different with lesbium ' sigh lady maulevrier ' i teach she to be ambitious she have be school to set a high price upon herself i know she care for you -- very much even but she could not face poverty or if you like i will say that she could not face a obscure existence -- sacrifice she ambition a justifiable ambition in one so lovely at the bidding of she first wooer and then again she be tell that if she marry you she would for ever forfeit my regard you must not blame she for obey I ' ' i do not blame she for i have win the peerless pearl -- the jewel above all price -- a perfect woman and now dear lady maulevrier give I but you consent and i be off to york this afternoon to interview the archbishop and get the special licence which will allow I to wed my darling here by you couch to-morrow afternoon ' ' i have no objection to you get the licence immediately but you must let I write a cheque before you go a special licence be expensive -- i believe it cost fifty pound ' ` if it cost a thousand i should not think it dear but i have a notion that i shall be able to get the licence -- cheap you have make I wild with happiness ' ` but you must not refuse my cheque ' ` indeed i must lady maulevrier i be not quite such a pauper as you think I ' ` but fifty pound and the expense of the journey a outlay altogether unexpected on you part i begin to fear that you be very reckless a spendthrift shall never marry my granddaughter with my consent ' ' i have never yet spend above half my income ' lady maulevrier look at he in wonderment and perplexity have the young man go suddenly out of he mind overwhelm by the greatness of he bliss ` but i think you be poor ' she falter ` it have please you to think so dear lady maulevrier but i have more than enough for all my want and i shall be able to provide a fitting home for my mary when you can spare she to preside over she own establishment ' ` establishment ' seem rather a big word but lady maulevrier suppose that in this case it mean a cook and housemaid with perhaps later on a boy in button to break window and block the pantry sink with miss teaspoon ` well mr hammond this be quite a agreeable surprise ' she say after a brief silence ' i really think you be poor -- as poor as a young man of gentlemanlike habit could be and yet exist perhaps you will wonder why think this i bring myself to consent to you marriage with my granddaughter ' ` it be a great proof of you confidence in I or in providence ' reply hammond smile ` it be no such thing i be govern by a sentiment -- a memory it be my love for the dead which soften my heart towards you john hammond ' ` indeed ' he murmur softly ` there be but one man in this world i ever fondly love -- the love of my youth -- my dearest and best in the day when my heart be fresh and innocent and unambitious that man be ronald hollister afterwards lord hartfield and yours be the only face that ever recall he to my mind it be but a vague likeness -- a look now and then but slight as that likeness be it have be enough to make my heart yearn towards you as the heart of a mother to she son ' john hammond knelt beside the sofa and bent he handsome face over the pale face on the pillow imprint such a kiss as a son might have give he eye be full of tear ` dear lady maulevrier think that it be the spirit of the dead which bless you for you fidelity to old memory ' he say tenderly chapter xxxiii by special licence after that interview with john hammond all the arrangement for the marriage be plan by lady maulevrier with a calm and business-like capacity which seem extraordinary in one so frail and helpless for a little while after hammond leave she she remain lose in a reverie deeply affect by the speech and manner of she granddaughter 's lover as he give she that first kiss of duty and affection the affection of one who in that act declare the allegiance of a close and holy bond yes she tell herself this marriage humble as it might be be altogether satisfactory she own feeling towards the man of she granddaughter 's choice be one of instinctive affection she heart have yearn to he from the beginning of they acquaintance but she have school herself to hide all indication of she liking for he she have make every effort to keep he at a distance deem he very merit a source of danger in a household where there be two fresh impressionable girl and despite all she caution and care he have succeed in win one of those girl : and she be glad very glad that he have so succeed in baffle she prudence and now it be agreeable to discover that he be not quite such a pauper as she have suppose he to be she heart feel lighter than it have be for some time when she set about plan the wedding the first step in the business be to send for jame steadman he come immediately grave and quiet as of old and stand with he serious eye bent upon the face of he mistress await she instruction ` lady mary be go to be marry to mr hammond by special licence in this room to-morrow afternoon if it can be manage so soon ' say lady maulevrier ' i be very glad to hear it my lady ' answer steadman without the faintest indication of surprise ` why be you so -- particularly glad ' ask he mistress look at he sharply ` because lady mary 's presence in this house be a source of danger to -- you arrangement she be very energetic and enterprising -- very shrewd -- and -- well she be a woman -- so i suppose there can be no harm in say she be somewhat inquisitive thing will be much safer here when lady mary be go ' ` but she will not be go -- she be not go away -- except for a very brief honeymoon i can not possibly do without she she have become necessary to my life steadman and there be so little left of that life now that there be no need for I to sacrifice the last gleam of sunshine the girl be very sweet and loving and true i be not half fond enough of she in the past but she have make herself very dear to I of late there be many thing in this life steadman which we only find out too late ' ` but surely my lady lady mary will leave fellside to go to a home of she own after she marriage ' ` no i tell you steadman ' he mistress answer with a touch of impatience ` lady mary and she husband will make this house they home so long as i be here it will not be long ' ` god grant it may be very long before you cease to be mistress here ' answer steadman with real feeling and then in a lower tone he go on : ` pardon I my lady for the suggestion but do you think it wise to have mr hammond here as a resident ' ` why should it not be wise mr hammond be a gentleman ' ` true my lady but any accident such as that which bring lady mary into the old garden -- ' ` no such accident need occur -- it must not occur steadman ' exclaimed lady maulevrier with kindling eye she who have so long rule supreme be not incline to have any desire of hers question ` there must have be gross carelessness that day -- carelessness on you part or that stable door would never have be leave open the key ought to have be in you possession it ought not to have be in the power of the stableman to open that door as to mr hammond 's presence at fellside i can not see any danger -- any reason why harm should come of it more than of lord maulevrier 's presence here in the past ' ` the two gentleman be so different my lady ' say steadman with a gloomy brow ` he lordship be so light-hearted and careless he mind take up with he horse gun dog fishing shooting and all kind of sport he be not a gentleman to take much notice of anything out of he own line but this mr hammond be different -- a very thoughtful gentleman a inquire mind as one would say ' ` steadman you be get cowardly in you old age the danger -- such a risk as you hint at must be grow less and less every day after forty year of security -- ' ` security ' echo steadman with a monosyllabic laugh which express intense bitterness ` say forty year during which i have feel myself upon the edge of a precipice every day and every hour security but perhaps you be right my lady i be grow old and nervous a feebler man than i be a few year ago feebler in body and mind let mr hammond make he home here if it please you ladyship to have he so long as i be well and able to get about there can be no danger of anything awkward happen ' lady maulevrier look alarmed ` but you have no expectation of fall ill i hope steadman you have no premonition of any malady ' ` no my lady none -- except the malady of old age i feel that i be not the man i once be that be all my brain be get woolly and my sight be cloud now and then and if i be to fall ill suddenly -- ' ` oh it would be terrible it would be a dire calamity there be you wife certainly to look after thing but -- ' ` my wife would do she best my lady she be a faithful creature but she be not -- yes without any unkindness i must say that mr steadman be not a genius ' ` oh steadman you must

who have read everything that have be write worth reading during the last half century ' ' i have read a great deal mary but i hardly know if i be any wiser on that account ' answer lady maulevrier ` after all however much of other people 's wisdom we may devour it be in ourselves that we be thus or thus we past folly rise up against we at the end of life and we see how little we book-learning have help we to stand against foolish impulse against evil passion be good mary and let who will be wise as the poet say a faithful heart be you only anchor in the stormy sea of life my dear i be so glad you be go to be marry ' ` it be very sudden ' say mary ` very sudden yet in you case that do not much matter you have quite make up you mind about mr hammond i believe ' ` make up my mind i begin to worship he the first night he come here ' ` foolish child well there be no deed to wait for settlement you have only you allowance as lord maulevrier 's daughter -- a first charge on the estate which can not be make away with or anticipate and of which no husband can deprive you ' ` he shall have every sixpence of it ' murmur mary ` and mr hammond though he tell I he be better off than i suppose can have nothing to settle so there will be nothing forfeit by a marriage without settlement ' mary could not enter upon the question it be even of less importance than the wedding gown the gong sound for luncheon ` steadman 's dogcart be to take mr hammond to the station at half-past two ' say lady maulevrier ` so you have better go and give he he luncheon ' mary need no second bidding she fly downstairs and meet she lover in the hall what a happy luncheon it be fräulein ` mounch and mounch and mounch ' like the sailor 's wife eating chestnut : but those two lover lunch upon moonshine upon each other 's little word and little look upon they own ineffable bliss they sit side by side and help each other to the nicest thing 's on the table but neither could eat and they get considerably mix in they way of eat take chutnee with strawberry cream and currant jelly with asparagus what do it matter everything taste of bliss ` you have have absolutely nothing to eat ' say mary piteously as the dogcart come grind round upon the dry gravel ` oh i have do splendidly -- thanks i have just have a macaroon and some of that capital gorgonzolum god bless you dearest and _ à revoir à revoir _ to-morrow ' ` and to-morrow i shall be mary hammond ' cry mary clasp she hand ` be not it capital fun ' they be in the porch alone the servant be all at dinner save the groom with the cart miss müller be still munch at the well-spread table in the dining-room john hammond fold he sweetheart in he arm for one brief embrace there be no time for loitering in another moment he be spring into the cart a shake of the rein and he be drive slowly down the steep avenue ` life be full of parting ' mary say to herself as she watch the last glimpse of the dogcart between the tree down in the road below ` but this one be to be very short thank god ' she wonder what she should do with herself for the rest of the afternoon and finally find that she be not want by she grandmother until afternoon tea she set out upon a round of visit to she favorite cottager to bid they a long farewell as a spinster ` you 'll be away a long time i suppose lady mary ' say one of she humble friend ` you 'll be go to switzerland or italy or some of those foreign part where great lady and gentleman travel for they honeymoon ' but mary declare that she would be absent a week at longest she be come back to take care of she invalid grandmother and she be not go to marry a great gentleman but a man who would have to work for he live she go back to fellside and read the _ time _ and pour out lady maulevrier 's tea and sit on she low stool by the sofa and the old and the young woman be as happy and confidential together as if they have be always the nearest and dearest to each other she ladyship have see miss müller and have inform that excellent person that she service at fellside would no longer be require after lady mary 's marriage but that she devotion to she duty during the last fourteen year should be reward by a pension which together with she savings would enable she to spend the rest of she day in repose miss müller be duly grateful and own to a tender longing for the _ heimath _ and declare herself ready to retire from she post whenever she ladyship pleased ' i shall go back to germany directly i leave you and i shall live and die there unless i be want by one of my old pupil but should lady lesbium or lady mary need my service for they daughter in day to come they can command I for no one else will i abandon the fatherland ' the fräulein thus easily dispose of lady mary feel that matrimony would verily mean independence and yet she be prepare to regard she husband as she master she mean to obey he in all meekness and reverence of spirit she spend the rest of the afternoon and the whole of the evening in she grandmother 's sitting-room dine _ tête-à-tête _ with the invalid for the first time since she illness lady maulevrier talk much of mary 's future and of lesbium 's but it be evident that she be full of uneasiness upon the latter subject ' i do not know what lesbium be go to do with she life ' she say with a sigh ` she letter tell I of nothing but gown and party and georgina kirkbank can only expatiate upon mr smithson 's wealth and the grand position he be go to occupy by-and-by i should like to see both my granddaughter marry before i die -- yes i should like to see lesbium 's fate secure if she be to be only lady lesbium smithson ' ` she can not fail to make a good match grandmother ' say mary ' i be begin to lose faith in she future ' answer lady maulevrier ` there seem to be a fatality about the career of particularly attractive girl they be too confident of they power to succeed in life they trifle with fortune fascinate the wrong people and keep the right people at arm 's length i think if i have be lesbium 's guide in society she first season would have count for more than it be likely to count for under lady kirkbank 's management i should have awaken lesbium from the dream of dress and dancing -- the mere butterfly life of a girl who never look beyond the present moment but now go and give order about you packing mary it be past ten and clara have better pack you trunk early to-morrow morning ' clara be a modest easedale damsel who have be promote to be lady mary 's personal attendant when the more mature kibble have go away with lady lesbium mary require very little wait upon but she be not the less glad to have a neat little smile maiden devoted to she service ready to keep she room neat and trim to go on errand to the cottager to arrange the flower in the old china bowl and to make herself generally useful it seem a strange thing to have to furnish a trousseau from the wardrobe of everyday life -- a trousseau in which nothing except half-a-dozen pair of glove a pair of boot and a few odds and end of lace and ribbon would be actually new mary thought very little of the matter but the position of thing strike she maid as altogether extraordinary and unnatural ` you should have see the thing miss freeman have lady mary ' exclaim the damsel ` the daughter of that cotton-spinning gentleman from manchester who live at the gable -- you should have see she new gown and thing when she be marry mr freeman 's maid keep company with my brother jame -- he be in the stable at freeman 's you know lady mary -- and she ask I in to look at the trousseau two day before the wedding i never see such beautiful dress -- such hat -- such bonnet -- such jacket and mantle it be like go into one of those grand shop at york and have all the thing in the shop pull out for one to look at -- such silk and satin -- and trim -- ah how those dress be trim the mystery be how the young lady could ever get herself into they or sit down when she would get one of they on ' ` instrument of torture clara i should hate such gown even if i be go to marry a rich man as i suppose miss freeman be ' ` not a bit of it lady mary she be only go to marry a bolton doctor with a small practice but she maid tell I she be determine she would get all she could out of she pa in case he should lose all he money and go bankrupt they say that trousseau cost two thousand pound ' ` well clara i would rather have my tailor gown in which i can scramble about the ghyll and crag just as i like ' there be a pale yellow indian silk smother with soft yellow lace which would serve for a wedding gown for indifferent as mary be to the great clothes question she want to look in some wise as a bride a neat chocolate-coloured cloth almost new from the tailor 's hand with a little cloth toque to match would do for the wedding journey all the detail of mary 's wardrobe be the perfection of neatness she have grow very neat and careful in she habit since she engagement anxious to be industrious and frugal in all thing -- a really handy housewife for a hard-worked bread-winner and now she be tell that mr hammond be not so poor as she have think she would not be oblige to stint herself and manage as she have suppose when she go about among the cottager take lesson in household economy it be almost a disappointment she and clara finish the packing that night mary be much too excite for the possibility of sleep there be not much to pack only one roomy american trunk -- a trunk which hold everything -- a gladstone bag for thing that might possibly be want in a hurry and a handsome dressing-bag maulevrier 's last birthday gift to he sister mary have receive no gift from she lover save the plain gold engagement ring and a few new book send straight from the publisher clara take care to inform she young mistress that miss freeman 's sweetheart have send she all manner of splendid present scent bottle photograph album glove box and other thing of beauty albeit he means be suppose to be _ nil _ it be evident that clara disapprove of mr hammond 's conduct in this matter and even suspect he of meanness ` he do ought to have send you he photograph lady mary ' say clara with a reproachful air ' i daresay he would have do so clara but he have be photograph only once in he life ' ` lawk a mercy lady mary why most young gentleman have themselves photograph in every new place they go to and as mr hammond have be a traveller like he lordship i make sure he would have be photograph in knickerbockers and every other kind of attitude ' mary have not refrain from ask for she lover 's portrait and he have tell she that he have carefully abstain from have he countenance reproduce in any manner since he fifteenth year when he have be photograph at he mother 's desire ` the present fashion of photograph stare out of every stationer 's window make a man 's face public property ' he tell mary ' i do not want every street arab in london to recognize I ' ` but you be not a public man ' say mary ` you photograph would not be in all the window although in my humble opinion you be a very handsome man ' hammond blush laugh and turn the conversation and mary have to exist without any picture of she lover ` millais shall paint I in he grand reynold manner by-and-by ' he tell mary ` millais oh jack when will you and i be able to give a thousand or so for a portrait ' ` ah when indeed but we may as well enjoy we day-dream like alnaschar without smash we basket of crockery ' and now mary who have manage to exist without the picture be to have the original he be to be all she own -- she master she lord she love after to-morrow -- unto eternity in life and in the grave and in the dim hereafter beyond the grave they two be to be one in heaven there be to be no marry or give in marriage mary be tell but she own heart cry aloud to she that the happily wed must remain link in heaven god would not part the bless soul of true lover a short sleep break by happy dream and it be morning mary 's wedding morning fairest of summer day July in all she beauty mary go to she grandmother 's room and wait upon she at breakfast lady maulevrier be in excellent spirit ` everything be arrange mary i have have a telegram from hammond who have get the licence and will come at half-past one at three the vicar will come to marry you he daughter katie and laura act as you bridesmaid ' ` bridesmaid ' exclaimed mary ' i forget all about bridesmaid be i really to have any ' `

but in the spring ' henley regatta be over it have pass like a tale that be tell like epsom and ascot and all the other glory of the london season happy those for whom the glory of henley the grace of ascot the fever of epsom be not as weary as a twice-told tale bring with they only bitterest memory of youth that have flee of hope that have wither of day-dream that have never be realize there be some to whom that mad hastening from pleasure to pleasure that rush from scene to scene of excitement that eager crowding into one day and night of gaiety which might fairly relieve the placid monotony of a month 's domesticity a month 's professional work -- some there be to whom this vanity fair be as a treadmill or the turning of a crank the felon 's deepest humiliation purposeless unprofitable labor the regatta be over and lady kirkbank and she charge hasten back to arlington street theirs be the very first departure albeit mr smithson plead hard for a prolongation of they visit the weather be exceptionally lovely he urge water picnic be delightful just now -- the bank be alive with the color of innumerable wild flower as beautiful and more poetical than the gorgeous flora of the amazon or the paraguay river and lady lesbium have develop a genius for punting and lean against she pole with she hair fly loose and sleeve roll up above the elbow she be a subject for canvas or marble millai or adam acton ` when we be in italy i will have she model just in that attitude and that dress ' say mr smithson ` she will make a lovely companion for my reading girl : one all repose and reverie the other all life and action dear lady kirkbank you really must stay for another week at least why go back to the smoke and sultriness of town here we can almost live on the water and i will send to london for some people to make music for we in the evening or if you miss you little game at nap we will play for a hour or so every night it shall not be my fault if my house be not pleasant for you ' ` you house be charming and i shall be here only too often in the day to come you will have more than enough of I _ then _ i promise you ' reply georgie with she girlish laugh ` but we must not stop a day longer now people would begin to talk besides we have engagement for every hour of the week that be come and for a fortnight after : and then i suppose i ought to take lesbium to the north to see she grandmother and to discuss all the preparation and arrangement for this very serious event in which you and lesbium be to be the chief performer ' ' i shall be very glad to go to grasmere myself and to make the acquaintance of my future grandmother-in-law ' say mr smithson ` you will be charm with she she belong to the old school -- something of a fossil perhaps but a very dignified fossil she have grow old in a rustic seclusion and know less of _ we _ world than a mother abbess but she have read immensely and be wonderfully clever i be bind to tell you that she have very lofty idea about she granddaughter and i believe she will only be reconcile to lesbium 's marriage with a commoner by the notion that you be sure of a peerage i venture to hint as much in my letter to lady maulevrier yesterday ' a shade of sullenness creep over horace smithson 's visage ' i should hope that such settlement as i be in a position to make will convince lady maulevrier that i be a respectable suitor for she granddaughter ex peerage ' he say somewhat haughtily ` my dear smithson do i not tell you that poor lady maulevrier be a century behind the time ' exclaimed lady kirkbank with a aggrieved look ` if she be one of _ we _ of course she would know that wealth be the paramount consideration and that you be quite the best match of the season but she be dreadfully _ arriérée _ poor dear thing and she must have amuse herself with the day-dream of see lesbium a duchess or something of that kind i shall tell she that lesbium can be one of the queen of society without have strawberry leave on she coach panel and that my dear friend horace smithson be a much better match than a seedy duke so do not look cross my dear fellow in I you have a friend who will never desert you ' ` thanks ' say smithson inwardly resolve that so soon as this little transaction of he marriage be over he would see as little of georgie kirkbank and she cotton frock and schoolgirl hat as bare civility would allow he have promise she that she should be the richer by a neat little bundle of fat and flourishing railway stock when he happiness be secure and he be not go to break he promise but he do not mean to give george and georgie free quarter at rood hall or at cowe or deauville and he mean to withdraw he wife altogether from lady kirkbank 's pinchbeck set what be lesbium 's feeling in the early morning after the last day of the regatta as she slowly pace the lavender walk in the lady ' garden alone -- for happily mr smithson be not so early a riser as the grasmere-bred damsel and she have this fresh morning hour to herself of what be she think as she pace slowly up and down the broad gravel walk between two row of tall old bush on which mass of purple blossom stand up from the pale gray foliage silvery where the summer breeze touch it well she be think first what a grand old place rood hall be and that it be in a manner hers henceforward she be to be mistress of this house and of other house each after its fashion as perfect as rood hall she be to have illimitable money at she command to spend and give away as she like she who yesterday have be tortured by the idea of owe a paltry three thousand pound be henceforward to count she thousand by the hundred she sens reel before that dazzling vision of figure with row of cipher after they one cipher more or less mean the difference between thousand and million everybody have agree in assure she that mr smithson be inordinately rich everybody have consider it he or she business to give she information about the gentleman 's income clearly imply thereby that in the opinion of society mr smithson 's merit as a suitor be a question of so much bullion could she doubt -- she who have learn in one short season to know what the world be make of and what it most value -- could she steep to the lip in the wisdom of lady kirkbank 's set doubt for a instant that she be make a better match in the eye of society than if she have marry a man of the highest lineage in all england a peer of the highest rank without large means she know that money be power that a man might begin life as a pot-boy or a greengrocer a knacker or a dust contractor and climb to the topmost pinnacle be he only rich enough she know that society would eat such a man 's dinner and dance at he wife 's ball and pretend to think he a altogether exceptional man make believe to admire he for he own sake to think he wife most brilliant among woman if he be only rich enough and could she doubt that society would bow down to she as lady lesbium smithson she have learn a great deal in she single season and she know how society be influence and govern almost as well as sir robert walpole know how human nature could be mould and direct at the will of a shrewd diplomatist she know that in the fashionable world every man and every woman every child even have he or she price and may be buy and sell at pleasure she have she price she lesbia the pearl of grasmere and the price have be fairly bidden she have surrender to the bidder ' i suppose i always mean to marry he ' she think pause in she promenade to gaze across the verdant landscape a fertile vale against a background of low hill all the landscape to the edge of those hill belong to mr smithson ` yes i must have mean to give way at last or i should hardly have tolerate he attention it would have be a pity to refuse such a place as this and he be quite gentlemanlike and as i have do with all romantic idea i do not see why i should not learn to like he very much ' she dismiss the idea of smithson lightly with this conclusion which she believe very virtuous and then as she resume she walk she thought revert to the park lane palace ' i hardly know whether i like it ' she muse languidly ` beautiful as it be it be only a reproduction of bygone splendor and it be painfully excruciating now for my own part i would much rather have the shabbiest old house which have belong to one 's ancestor which have come to one as a heritage by divine right as it be instead of be buy with newly make money to my mind it would rank higher yet i doubt if anybody nowadays set a pin 's value upon ancestor people ask who be he but they only mean how much have he and provide a person be not absolutely in trade not actually engage in sell soap or match or mustard society do not care a straw how he money have be make the only secondary question be how long will it last and that be of course important ' musing thus wordly wisdom personify the maiden look up and see she lover enter at the light little iron gate which give entrance to this feminine eden she go to meet he look all simplicity and freshness in she white morning gown and neat little dunstable hat it seem to he as he gaze at she almost as if this delicate sylph-like beauty be some wild white flower of the wood personify she give he she hand graciously but he draw she to he breast and kiss she with the air of a man who be exercise a indisputable right she suppose that it be he right and she submit but release herself as quickly as possible ` my dearest how lovely you look in this morning light ' he exclaim ` while all the other woman be upstairs make up they face to meet the sun and we shall see every shade of bismuth by-and-by from pale mauve to purple ' ` it be very uncivil of you to say such a thing of you guest ' exclaimed lesbium ` but they all indulge in bismuth -- you must be quite aware of that they call the stuff by different name -- blanc rosatus crême de l'imperatrice milk of beauty perline opaline ivorine -- but it mean bismuth all the same expose you fashionable beauty to the fume of sewer-gas and that dazzling whiteness would turn to a dull brown hue or even black thank heaven my lesbium wear real lily and rose have you be here long ' ` about half a hour ' ' i only wish i have know i should not have dawdle so long over my dress ' ' i be very glad you do not know ' lesbium answer coolly ` do you suppose i never want to be alone life in london be perpetual turmoil one 's eye grow weary with ever-moving crowd one 's ear ache with try to distinguish one voice among the buzz of voice ' ` then why go back to town why go back to the turmoil and the treadmill it be only a kind of treadmill after all though we choose to call it pleasure stay here lesbium and let we live upon the river and among the flower ' urge smithson with as romantic a air as if he have never hear of contango or bulling and bearing and yet only half a hour ago while he valet be shave he he be debate within himself whether he should be bear or bull in he influence upon certain stock it be suppose that he never go near the city that he have shake the dust of lombard street and the house off he shoe that he fortune be make and he have no further need of speculation yet the proverb hold good with the stock-jobber ` he who have once drunk will drink again ' of that fountain there be no satiety ` stay and hear the last of the nightingale ' he murmur ` we be famous for we nightingale ' ' i wonder you do not order a _ fricassée _ of they tongue like that loathsome person in roman history ' ' i hope i shall never resemble any loathsome person why can you not stay ' ` why because it be not etiquette lady kirkbank say ' ` lady kirkbank eh _ la belle farce _ lady kirkbank stand out for etiquette ' ` do not laugh at my chaperon sir upon what rock can a poor girl lean if you undermine she faith in she chaperon sir ' ' i hope you will have a better guardian before you be a month older i mean to be a very strong rock lesbium you do not know how firmly i shall stand between you and all the peril of society you have be but poorly guard hitherto ' ` you talk as if you mean to be a abominable tyrant ' say lesbia ` if you do not take care i shall change my mind and recall my promise ' ` not on that account lesbium : every woman like a man who stand up for he own it be only you invertebrate husband whose wife drift into the divorce court i mean to keep and hold the prize i have win when be it to be dearest -- we wedding day ' ` not for age i hope -- some time next summer at the earliest ' ` you would not be so cruel as to keep I wait a year ' ` why not ' ` you would not ask that if you love I ' ` you be ask too much ' say lesbium with a flash of defiance ` there have be nothing say about love yet you ask I to be you wife and i say yes -- mean that at some remote period such a thing might be ' she know that the man be she slave -- slave to she beauty slave to she superior rank -- and she be determine not to lessen the weight of he chain by so much as a feather ` do not that promise imply something like love ' he ask earnestly ` perhaps it imply a little gratitude for you devotion which i have neither court nor encourage a little respect for you talent you perseverance -- a little admiration for you wonderful success in life perhaps love may follow these sentiment naturally easily if you be very patient but if you talk about we be marry before next year you will simply make I hate you ' ` then i will say very little except to remind you that there be no earthly reason why we should not be marry next month October and November be the best month for rome and i hear you say last night you be pine to see rome ' ` what then -- can not lady kirkbank take I to rome ' ` and introduce you to the rowdiest people in the city ' cry mr smithson ` lesbia i adore you it be the dream of my life to be you husband : but if you be go to spend a winter in italy with lady kirkbank i renounce my right i surrender my hope you will not be the wife of my dream after that ' ` do you assert a right to control my life during we engagement ' ` some little right above all the privilege of choose you friend and that be one reason why i most fervently desire we marriage should not be delay you would find it difficult impossible perhaps to get out of lady kirkbank 's claw while you be single but once my wife that amiable old person can be make to keep she distance ' ` lady kirkbank 's claw what a horrible way in which to speak of a friend i think you adore lady kirkbank ' ` so i do we all adore she but not as a guide for youth as a specimen of the elderly female of the latter half of the nineteenth century she be perfect such gush such juvenility such broad view such a utter absence of starch but as a lamp for the footstep of girlhood -- no _ there _ we must pause ' ` you be very ungrateful do you know that poor lady kirkbank have be most strenuous in you behalf ' ` oh yes i know that ' ` and you be not grateful ' ' i intend to be very grateful so grateful as to entirely satisfy lady kirkbank ' ` you be horribly cynical that remind I there be a poor girl whom lady kirkbank have under she wing one season -- a miss trinder to whom i be tell you behave shamefully ' ` there be a parson 's daughter who throw herself at my head in a most audacious way and who behave so badly egg on by lady kirkbank that i have to take refuge in flight do you suppose i be the kind of man to marry the first adventurous damsel who take a fancy to my town house and think it would be a happy hunting ground for a herd of brother and sister miss trinder be shocking bad style and she design be transparent from the very begin i let she flirt as much as she like and when she begin to be seriously sentimental i take wing for the east ' ` be she pretty ' ask lesbia not displeased at this contemptuous sum up of poor belle trinder 's story ` if you admire the flemish type as illustrate by ruben she be lovely a complexion of lily and rose -- cabbage rose _ bien entendu _ which be apt to deepen into peony after champagne and mayonaise at ascot or sandown -- a figure -- oh -- well -- a tremendous figure -- hair of a auburn that touch perilously on the confines of red -- large serviceable foot and a appetite -- the appetite of a ploughman 's daughter rear upon short common ' ` you be very cruel to a girl who evidently admire you ' ' a fig for she admiration she want to live in my house and spend my money ' ` there go the gong ' exclaimed lesbium ` pray let we go to breakfast you be hideously cynical and i be wofully tire of you ' and as they stroll back to the house by lavender walk and rise garden and across the dewy lawn lesbium question herself as to whether she be one whit better or more dignified than isabellum trinder she wear she rue with a difference that be all chapter xxxv ` all fancy pride and fickle maidenhood ' the return to arlington street mean a return to the ceaseless whirl of gaiety even at rood hall life have be as near a approach to perpetual motion as one could hope for in this world but the excitement and the hurry and scamper in berkshire have a rustic flavor there be moment that be almost repose a breathing space between the blue river and the blue sky in a world that seem make of green field and hang wood the plashing of water and the song of the lark but in london the very atmosphere be charge with hurry and agitation the freshness be go from the verdure of the park the glory of the rhododendron have fade the green park below lady kirkbank 's mansion be baked and rusty the tower of the house of parliament yonder be dimly see in a mist of heat london air taste of smoke and dust vibrate with the incessant roll of carriage and the trampling of multitudinous foot there be woman of rank who can take the london season quietly and live they own life in the midst of the whirl and the riot -- woman for whom that squirrel-like circulation round and round the fashionable wheel have no charm -- woman who only receive people they like only go into society that be congenial but lady kirkbank be not one of these the advance of age make she only more keen in the pursuit of pleasure she would have abandon herself to despair have the glass over the mantelpiece in she boudoir cease to be choke and litter with card -- have she book of engagement show a blank page happily there be plenty of people -- if not all of they the best people -- who want sir george and lady kirkbank at they party the gentleman be sport and harmless the lady be good-natured and just sufficiently eccentric to be amusing without degenerate into a bear and this year she be ask almost everywhere for the sake of the beauty who go under she wing lesbium have be as a pearl of price to she chaperon from a social point of view and now that she be engage to horace smithson she be likely to be even more valuable mr smithson have promise lady kirkbank sportively as it be and upon the impulse of the moment as he would have offer to wager a dozen of glove that be he so happy as to win she _ protégée 's _ hand he would find she a investment for say a thousand which would bring she in twenty per cent nay more he would also find the thousand which would have be the initial difficulty on poor georgie 's part but this little matter be in georgie 's mind a detail compare with the advantage to accrue to she indirectly from lesbium 's union with one of the richest man in london lady kirkbank have bring about many good match and have be too often reward with base ingratitude upon the part of she _ protégées _ after marriage but there be a touch of arcady in the good soul 's nature and she be always trustful she tell herself that lesbium would not be ungrateful would not basely kick down the ladder by which she have mount to height empyrean would not cruelly shelve the friend who have pioneer she to high fortune she count upon make the house in park lane as she own house upon be the prime mover of all lesbium 's hospitality the supervisor of she visit list the shadow behind the throne there be ball and party nightly dinner luncheon garden-party and yet there be a sense of wane in the glory of the world -- everybody feel that the fag-end of the season be approach all the really great entertainment be over -- the cabinet dinner the reception at the foreign office the last of the state ball and concert some of the best people have already leave town and senator be begin to complain that they see no prospect of early deliverance there be goodwood still to look forward to and after goodwood the deluge -- or rather cowe regatta about which lady kirkbank 's set be already talk lady lesbium be to be at cowe for the regatta week that be a settle thing mr smithson 's schooner-yacht the cayman be to be she hotel it be to be lady kirkbank and lady lesbium 's yacht for the nonce and mr smithson be to live on shore at he villa and at that aristocratic club to which by maulevrier 's influence and on the score of he approach marriage with a earl 's daughter he have be just select he would be only lady kirkbank 's visitor on board the cayman the severe etiquette of the situation would therefore not be infringe and yet mr smithson would have the happiness of see he betrothed sole and sovereign mistress of he yacht and of spend the long summer day at she foot even to lady lesbium this idea of the yacht be not without its charm she have never be on board such a yacht as the cayman she be a good sailor as testify by many a excursion in hire sailing boat at tynemouth and st bee and she know that she would be the queen of the hour she accept mr smithson 's invitation for the cowe week more graciously than she be wont to receive he attention and be please to say that the whole thing would be rather enjoyable ` it will be simple enchantment ' exclaim the more enthusiastic georgie kirkbank ` there be nothing so rapturous as life on board a yacht there be a flavor of adventure a _ sansgêne _ a -- in short everything in the world that i like i shall wear my cotton frock and give myself up to enjoyment lie on the deck and look up at the blue sky too deliciously idle even to read the last horrid thing of zolum 's ' but the cowe regatta be nearly three week ahead and in the meantime there be goodwood and the ravelled thread of the london season have to be wind up and by this time it be know everywhere that the affair between mr smithson and maulevrier 's sister be really on ` it be as settle a business as the entry and bet for next year 's derby ' say one lounger to another in the smoking-room of the haute gomme ` play or pay do not you know ' lady kirkbank and lesbium have both write to lady maulevrier lesbium write somewhat coldly very briefly and in a half defiant tone to the effect that she have accept mr smithson 's offer and that she hope she grandmother would be please with a match which everybody suppose to be extremely advantageous she be go to grasmere immediately after the cowe week to see she dear grandmother and to be assure of

which rise at interval group of silver-gilt dolphin support shallow golden dish pile with peach grape and all the costliest produce of covent garden conversation be not particularly brilliant nor have the guest a elated air the thermometer be near eighty and at this period of the season everybody be tire of this kind of dinner and would gladly have foregone the greatest achievement of culinary art in favor of a chicken and a salad eat under green leaf in a garden at wargrave or henley within sound of the ripple river on lesbium 's right hand there be a portly personage of jewish type dark to swarthiness and somewhat oily whose every word suggest bullion he and mr smithson be evidently acquaintance of long standing and mr smithson present he to lesbium whereupon he join in they

entree offer to she to be observe on such occasion as if the thing offer be particularly nasty she wonder how long the two man be go to prose about mine and share in those subdue half-mysterious voice tell each other occult fact in half-expressed phrase utterly dark to the outside world but while she be languidly wonder a change in she lover 's manner startle she into keenest curiosity ` montesma be in pari ' say mr sampayo the dark gentleman ' i dine last week with he at the continental ' mr smithson 's complexion fade curiously and a leaden darkness come over he countenance as of a man whose

about it but he would hardly go back to the tropics without have a look round on both side of the channel he be always fond of society pretty woman dancing and amusement of all kind i have no doubt we shall see he here before the end of the season ' mr smithson pursue the subject no further he turn to lesbium who have be curiously interested in this little bit of conversation -- interested first because smithson have seem agitate by the mention of the spaniard 's name secondly because of the description of the man which have a romantic sound the very word tropic suggest a romance and lesbium whose mind be jade by the monotony of a london season the threadbare fabric of society conversation kindle at any image which appeal to she fancy clever as satan handsome as apollo scion of a old castilian family fresh from the tropics she imagination dwelt upon the idea which these word have conjure up three day after this she be at the opera with she chaperon she lover in attendance as usual the opera be faust with nillson as marguerite after the performance they be to drive down to twickenham on mr smithson 's drag and to dance and sup at the orlean the last ball of the season be on this evening and lesbium have be persuade that it be to be a particular _ recherché _ ball and that only the very nicest people be to be present at any rate the drive under the light of a July moon would be delicious and if they do not like the people they find there they could eat they supper and come away immediately after as lady kirkbank remark philosophically the opera be nearly over -- that grand scene of valentine 's death be on -- and lesbium be listen breathlessly to every note watch every look of the actor when there come a modest little knock at the door of she box she dart a angry glance round and shrug she shoulder vexatiously what goth have dare to knock during that thrilling scene mr smithson rise and creep to the door and quietly open it a dark handsome man who be a total stranger to lesbium glide in shake hand with smithson as he enter till this moment lesbium 's whole be have be absorb in the scene -- that bitter anathema of the brother the sister 's cry of anguish and shame where else be there tragedy so human so enthralling -- grief that so wring the spectator 's heart it need a goethe and a gounod to produce this masterpiece in a instant in a flash lesbium 's interest in the stage be go she first glance at the stranger tell she who he be the olive tint the eye of deepest black the grand form of the head and perfect chiselling of the feature could belong only to that scion of a old castilian race whom she have hear describe the other evening -- ` clever as satan handsome as apollo ' yes this must be the man don gomez de montesma there be nothing in mr smithson 's manner to indicate that the spaniard be a unwelcome guest on the contrary smithson receive he with a cordiality which in a man of naturally reserve manner seem almost rapture the curtain fall and he present don gomez to lady kirkbank and lady lesbium whereupon dear georgie begin to gush after she wont and to ask a good many question in a manner that be too girlish to seem impertinent ` how perfectly you speak english ' she exclaim ` you must have live in england a good deal ' ` on the contrary it be my misfortune to have live here very little but i have know a good many english and american in cuba and in pari ' ` in cuba do you really come from cuba i have always fancy that cuba must be a altogether charming place to live in -- like biarritz or pau do not you know only further away do please tell I where it be and what kind of a place ' geographically lady kirkbank 's mind be a blank it be quite a revelation to she to find that cuba be a island ` it must be a lovely spot ' exclaim the fervid creature ` let I see now what do we get from cuba -- cigar -- and -- and tobacco i suppose in cuba everybody smoke ' ` man woman and child ' ` how delicious would that i be a cuban and the native be they nice ' ` there be no aborigine the indian whom columbus find soon perish off the face of the island european civilisation generally have that effect but one of we most benevolent captain-general provide we with a import population of nigger ' ` how delightful i have always long to live among a slave population dear submissive black thing dress in coral necklace and feather instead of the horrid over-fed wretch we have to wait upon we and if the aborigine be not want it be just as well for they to die out do not you know ' prattle lady kirkbank ` it be very accommodate of they no doubt yet we could employ half a million of they if we have they in drain we swamp agriculture suffer by the loss of indian labor ' ' i suppose they be like the creature in pizarro poor dear yellow thing with brass bracelet ' say lady kirkbank ' i remember see macready as rollum when i be quite a little thing ' and now the curtain rise for the last act ` do you care about stay for the end ' ask mr smithson of lesbium ` it will make we rather late at the orlean ' ` never mind how late we be ' say lesbium imperiously ' i have always be cheat out of this last act for some stupid party imagine lose gounod and nillson for the sake of struggle through the mob on a stifle staircase and be elbow by inane young man with gardenia in they coat ' lady lesbium have a pretty little way of always oppose any suggestion of she sweetheart she be resolve to treat he as badly as a future husband could be treat in consent to marry he she have do he a favor which be a great deal more than such a person have any right to expect she lean forward to watch and listen with she elbow rest on the velvet cushion -- she head upon she hand and she seem absorb in the scene but this be mere outward seem all the enchantment of music and act be over she only hear and see vaguely as if it be a shadowy scene enact ever so far away every now and then she eye glance involuntarily toward don gomez who stand lean against the back of the box pale languid graceful poetic a altogether different type of manhood from that with which she have of late be satiate those deep dark eye of he have a dreamy look they gaze across the dazzling house into space above lady lesbium 's head they seem to see nothing and they certainly be not look at she don gomez be the first man she ever remember to have be present to she who do not favor she with a good deal of hard stare more or less discreetly manage during the first ten minute of they acquaintance on he she beauty fall flat he evidently fail to recognize she supreme loveliness it might be that she be the wrong type for cuba every nation have its own venus and that far away spot beyond the torrid zone might have a somewhat barbarous idea of beauty at any rate don gomez be apparently unimpressed and yet lesbium flattered herself that she be look she best to-night and that she costume be a success she wear a white satin gown short in the skirt for the luxury of freedom in waltz and make with quaker-like simplicity the bodice high to the throat fitting she like a sheath she only ornament be a garland of scarlet poppy wreathe from throat to shoulder and a large diamond heart which mr smithson have lately give she ' a bullock 's heart ' as lady kirkbank call it when the curtain fall and not till then she rise and allow herself to be clothe in a brown velvet newmarket which completely cover she short satin gown she have a little brown velvet toque to match the newmarket and thus attire she would be able to take she seat on the drag which be wait on the quietest side of covent garden ` why should not you go with we don gomez ' exclaimed lady kirkbank in a gush of hospitality ` the drive will be charming -- not equal to you tropical cuba -- but intensely nice and the garden will be something too sweet on such a night as this i know they when the dear duc d'aumale be there ay de mi such a man ' lady kirkbank sigh with the air of have know he altésse royale intimately ' i should be charm ' say don gomez ` if i think my friend smithson want I would you really like to have I smithson ' ' i should be enchant ' ` and there be room on the drag ' ` room enough for half-a-dozen i be only take sir george kirkbank and colonel delville -- whom we be to pick up at the haute gomme -- and mr and mr mostyn who be in the stall ' ' a nice snug little party ' exclaim that charming optimist lady kirkbank ' i hate a crowd on a drag the way some of the member of the four-in-hand club load they coach on parade remind I of a beanfeast ' they find lady kirkbank 's footman and one of mr smithson 's groom wait in the hall of the opera house the groom to conduct they to the spot where the drag be wait the footman to carry wrap and take he mistress 's final order there be a bohemian flavor in the little walk to the great fruit garden which be odorous of bruised peach and stale salad as they pass it waggon-load of cabbage and other garden stuff be stand about by the old church the roadway be litter with the refuse of the market and the air be faint and heavy with the scent of herb and flower lesbium mount lightly to she place of honor on the box-seat and lady kirkbank be hoist up after she mr and mr mostyn follow and then don gomez take he seat by lady kirkbank 's side and behind lesbium a vantage point from which he could talk to she as much as he like mr smithson seat himself a minute afterwards and drive off by king street and leicester square and on to piccadilly steering cleverly through the traffic of cab and carriage which be at its apogee just now when all the theater be disgorge they crowd piccadilly be quieter yet there be plenty of carriage late people go to party and early people go home horse slip and slide on stone or wood half the roadway up and luminous with lantern they stop in front of the haute gomme where they pick up sir george kirkbank and colonel delville a big man with a patriarchal head suppose to be one of the finest whist player in london and to make a handsome income by he play he have ride in the balaclava charge be a favorite everywhere and albeit no genius be much cleverer than he friend and school-fellow george kirkbank they have be at eton together have both make love to the lively georgie and have be inseparable for the last thirty year ` could not get on without delville ' say sir george ` dooced smart fellow sir know the rope and do all the think for both of we ' and now they be fairly start and the team fall into a rattle pace with the road pretty clear before they hyde park be one umbrageous darkness edge by long line of golden light coolness and silence enfold all thing in the summer midnight and lesbium not prone to romance sink into a dreamy state of mind as she lean back in she seat and watch the shadowy tree glide by the long vista of lamp and verdure in front of she she be glad that no one talk to she for talk of any kind must have break the spell don gomez sit like a statue in he place behind she from lady kirkbank the loquacious come a gentle sound of snore a subdue ladylike snore breathe softly at interval like a sigh mr smithson have he team and he own thought too for occupation -- thought which to-night be not altogether pleasant at the back of the coach mr mostyn be descant on the evolution of the nautilus and the relationship of protoplasm and humanity to colonel delville who sit smile placidly behind a immense cigar and accept the most stupendous fact and the most appalling theory with a friendly little nod of he handsome head mr mostyn frankly sleep as it be he custom to do upon all convenient occasion he call it recuperate ` frank ought to be delightfully fresh for he recuperate all the way down ' say he wife when they alight in the dewy garden at twickenham in front of the lamp-lit portico ' i would not have mind he recuperate if he have not snore so abominably ' remark colonel delville it be nearly one o'clock and the ball have thin a little which make it all the better for those who remain mr smithson 's order have be give two day ago and the very best of the waiter have be tell off for he especial service the lady go upstairs to take off they wrapping and muffling and lesbium emerge dazzling from she brown velvet newmarket while lady kirkbank bend closely over the looking-glass like a witch over a caldron repair she complexion with cotton wool they go through the conservatory to the octagon dining-room where the supper be ready a special supper on a table by a window a table laden with exotic and brilliant with glass and silver the supper be of course perfect in its way mr smithson 's _ chef _ have be down to see about it and mr smithson 's own particular champagne and the claret grow in he own particular _ clo _ in the gironde have be send down for the feast no common cuisine no common wine could be good enough and yet there be a day when the cheapest gargote in belleville or montmartre be good enough for mr smithson there have be day on which he do not dine at all and when the fume of a _ gibelotte _ steam from a workman 's restaurant make he mouth water the supper be all life and gaiety everyone be hungry and thirsty and freshion by the drive except lesbium she be singularly silent eat hardly anything but drink three or four glass of champagne don gomez be not a great talker he have the air of a prince of the blood royal who expect other people to talk and to keep he amuse but the little he say be to the point he have a fine baritone very low and subdue and have a languor which be almost insolent but not without its charm there be a air of originality about the manner and the man he be the typical _ rastaquouère _ a man of finish manners and unknown antecedent a foreigner apparently rich obviously accomplish but with that indefinable air which bespeak the adventurer and which give society as fair a warning as if the man wear a placard on he shoulder with the word _ cave _ but to lesbia this spaniard be the first really interesting man she have meet since she see john hammond and she interest in he be much more vivid than she interest in hammond have be at the beginning of they acquaintance that pale face with its tint of old ivory those thin finely-cut lip indicative of diabolical craft could she but read aright those unfathomable eye touch she fancy as it have never yet be touch awake within she that latent vein of romance self-abnegation supreme foolishness which lurk in the nature of every woman be she chaste as ice and pure as snow the supper be long it be past two o'clock and the ballroom be thinly occupy when mr smithson 's party go there ` you will not dance to-night i suppose ' say smithson as lesbium and he go slowly down the room arm in arm it be in a pause between two waltz the wide window at the end be open to the summer night and the room be delightfully cool ` you must be horribly tired ' ' i be not in the least tired and i mean to waltz if anyone will ask I ' reply lesbium decisively ' i ought to have ask you to dance and then it would have be the other way ' say smithson with a touch of acrimony ` surely you have dance enough in town and you might be oblige for once in a way and come and sit with I in the garden and listen to the nightingale ' ` there be no nightingale after June there be the manolum ' as the band strike up ` my very favorite waltz ' don gomez be at she elbow at this moment ` may i have the honor of this waltz with you lady lesbium ' he ask and then with a serio-comic glance at he stoutish friend ' i do not think smithson waltz ' ' i have be tell that nobody can waltz who have be bear on this side of the pyrenee ' answer lesbium withdraw she arm from she lover 's and slip it through the spaniard 's with the air of a slave who obey a master smithson look dagger and retire to a corner of the room glowering be a man twenty-two time millionaire like the parisian rothschild he could not find armor against the poison arrow of jealousy don gomez possess many of those accomplishment which make man dangerous but as a dancer he be _ hors ligne _ and horace smithson know that there be no surer road to a girl 's fancy than the magic circle of a waltz those two be float round the room in the old slow legato step which recall to smithson the picture of a still more spacious room in a island under the southern cross -- the blue water of the bay shine yonder under the starlight of the tropics fire-fly gleam and flash in the foliage beyond the open window fire-fly flash amidst the gauzy drapery of the dancer and this same gomez revolve with the same slow languid grace he arm encircle the _ svelte _ figure of a woman whose southern beauty outshone lesbium 's blonde english loveliness as the tropical star outshine the lamp that light we colder sky yes every detail of the scene flash back into he mind as if a curtain have be suddenly pluck back from a long-hidden picture the cuban 's tall slim figure the head gently bent towards he partner 's head as at this moment and those dark eye look up at he intoxicate with that nameless indefinable fascination which it be the lot of some man to exercise ` he rob I of _ she _ ' think smithson gloomily ` will he rob I of this one too surely not havana be havana -- and this one be not a creole if i can not trust that lovely piece of marble there be no woman on earth to be trust ' he turn he back upon the dancer and go out into the garden he soul be wring with jealousy yet he could watch no longer there be too much pain -- there be too many bitter memory of shame and loss and ignominy evoke by that infernal picture if he have be free he would have assert he authority as lesbium 's future husband he would have take she away from the orlean he would have tell she plainly and frankly that don gomez be no fit person for she to know and he would have so plan that they two should never meet again but horace smithson be not free he be bind hand and foot by those fetter which the chain of past event have forge -- stern fact which the man himself may forget or try to forget but which other people never forget there be generally some dark spot in the history of such man as smithson -- man who climb the giddiest height of this world with that desperate rapidity which imply many a perilous leap from crag to crag many a moraine skim over and many a awful gulf span by a hair-breadth bridge mr smithson 's history be not without such spot and the darkest of all have relation to he career in cuba the story have be know by very few -- perhaps completely know only by one man and that man be gomez de montesma for the last fifteen year the most fervent desire of horace smithson 's heart have be the hope that tropical nature in any one of she various disagreeable form would be oblige enough to make a end of gomez but the force of nature have not work on mr smithson 's side no loathsome leprosy have eat he enemy 's flesh neither cayman nor crocodile neither juba snake nor poisonous spider have mark he for its prey the tropical sun have leave he unsmitten he have live and he have prosper and he be here like a guilty conscience incarnate to spoil horace smithson 's peace ' i must be diplomatic ' smithson say to himself as he walk up and down a avenue of irish yew in a solitary part of the grounds smoke he cigarette and hear the music swell and sink in the distance ' i will give she a hint as to that man 's character and i will keep they apart as much as i can but if he force himself upon I there be no help for it i can not afford to be uncivil to he ' ` can not afford ' in this instance mean ` dare not ' and horace smithson 's thought as he pace the yew-tree walk be full of gloom during that long meditation he make up he mind on one point namely that let he suffer what pang he might he must not betray he jealousy to do that would be to lower himself in lesbium 's eye and to play into he rival 's hand for a jealous man be almost always contemptible in the sight of he mistress he would carry himself as if he be sure of she fidelity and this very confidence with a woman of honor a girl rear as lesbium have be rear would render it impossible for she to betray he he would show himself high-minded confident generous chivalrous even and he would trust to chance for the issue chance be mr smithson 's only idea of divinity and chance have hitherto be kind to he there have be dark hour in he life but the darkness have not last long and the lucky accident of he career have be of a nature to beguile he into the belief that among the favorite of destiny he stand first and foremost while mr smithson muse thus alone and in the darkness montesma and lady lesbium be wander arm in arm in another and lovelier part of the grounds where golden light be scatter like cuban fire-fly among the foliage of seringa and magnolia arbutus and rhododendron while at interval a sudden flush of rosier light be shed over garden and river as if by enchantment surprising a couple here and there in the midst of a flirtation which have begin in darkness the grounds be lovely in the balmy atmosphere of a July night the river glide with mysterious motion under the star great mass of gloom darken the stream with a almost awful look where the wood of petersham and ham house cast they dense shadow on the water don gomez and he companion wander by the river side to a spot where a group of magnolia sheltered they from the open lawn and where there be some rustic chair close to the balustrade which protect the parapet in this spot which be a kind of island divide from the rest of the grounds by the intervene road they find themselves quite alone and in the midst of a summer stillness which be break only by the low lazy ripple of the tide run seaward the light of richmond look far away and the little town with its variety of level have a italian air in the distance from the ballroom faint and fitful come the music of a waltz ` i be afraid i have bring you too far ' say don gomez ` on the contrary it be a relief to get away from the light and the people how delicious this river be i be bring up on the shore of a lake but after all a lake be horribly tame its limit be always stare one in the face there be no room for one 's imagination to wander now a river like this suggest a infinity of possibility drift on and on and on into undiscovered region by ever-varying shore i feel to-night as if i should like to step into that little boat yonder ' point to a light skiff bob gently up and down with the tide at the bottom of a flight of step ` and let the stream take I wherever it choose ' ` if i could but go with you ' say gomez in that deep and musical tone which make the commonest word seem melody ' i would ask for neither compass nor rudder what could it matter whither the boat take I there be no place under the star which would not be a paradise -- with you ' ` please do not make a dreamy aspiration the occasion for a compliment ' exclaimed lesbium lightly ` what i say be so silly that i do not wonder you think it right to say something just a little sillier but moonlight and run water have a curious effect upon I and i who be the most prosaic among woman become ridiculously sentimental ' ' i can not believe that you be prosaic ' ' i assure you it be perfectly true i be of the earth earthy a woman of the world in my first season ambitious fond of pleasure vain proud exact all those thing which i be tell a woman ought not to be ' ` you pain I when you so slander yourself and i shall make it the business of my life to find out how much truth there be in that self-slander for my own part i do not believe a word of it but as it be rude to contradict a lady i will only say that i reserve my opinion ' ` be you to stay long in england ' ask lesbia she be lean against the stone balustrade in a careless attitude as of one who be weary she elbow on the stone slab and she head throw hack against she arm the white satin gown mould to she figure have a statuesque air and she look like a marble statue in the dim light every line of the graceful form expressive of repose ` that will depend i be not particularly fond of london a very little of you english babylon satisfy I in a general way but there be condition which might make england enchant where do you go at the end of the season ' ` first to goodwood and then to cowe mr smithson be so kind as to place he yacht at lady kirkbank 's disposal and i be to be she guest on board the cayman just as i be in arlington street ' ` the cayman that name be a reminiscence of mr smithson 's south american travels ' ` no doubt be he long in south america ' ` three or four year ' ` but not in cuba all that time i suppose ' ` he have business relation with cuba all that time and oscillate between we island and the main he be rather fortunate in he little adventure with we -- make almost as much money as general tacon of bless memory but i dare say smithson have tell you all he adventure in that part of the world ' ` no he very rarely talk about he travels : and i be not particularly interested in commercial speculation there be always so much to think of and talk about in the business of the moment be you fond of cuba ' ` not passionately i always feel as if i be a exile there and yet one of my ancestor be with columbus when be discover the island and my race be among the earliest settler my family have give three captain-general to cuba : but i can not forget that i belong to a older world and have forfeit that which ought to have be a brilliant place in europe for the luxurious obscurity of a colony ' ` but you must be attach to a place in which you family have live for so many generation ' ' i like the star and the sea the mountain and savanna the tropical vegetation and the dreamy half-oriental life but at best it be a kind of stagnation and after a residence of a few month in the island of my birth i generally spread my wing for the wider world of the old continent or the new ' ` you must have travel so much ' say lesbium with a sigh ' i have be nowhere and see nothing i feel like a child who have be shut up in a nursery all its life and know of no world beyond four wall ' ` not to travel be not to live ' say don gomez ' i be to be in italy next November i believe ' say lesbia not care to own that this italian trip be to be she honeymoon ` italy ' exclaim the spaniard contemptuously ` once the finish school of the english nobility now the happy hunting-ground of the cockney tourist and the prosperous yankee all the poetry of italy have be dry up and the whole country vulgarise if you want romance in the old world go to spain in the new try peru or brazil mexico or californium ' ' i be afraid i be not adventurous enough to go so far ' ` no : woman cling to beat track ' ` we obey we master ' answer lesbium meekly ` ah i forget you be to have a master -- and soon i hear as much before i see you to-night ' lesbium half rise as if to leave this cool retreat above the ripple tide ` yes it be all settle ' she say ` and now i think i must go back lady kirkbank will be wonder what have become of I ' ` let she wonder a little longer ' say don gomez ` why should we hurry away from this delightful spot why break the spell of -- the river life have so few moment of perfect contentment if this be one with you -- as it be with I -- let we make the most of it lady lesbium do you see those weed yonder drift with the tide drift side by side touch as they drift they have meet heaven know how and will part heaven know where on they way to the sea but they let themselves go with the tide we have meet like those poor weed do not let we part till the tide part we ' lesbium give a little sigh and submit she have talk of woman obey they master and the implication be that she mean to obey mr smithson but there be a fate in these thing and the man who be to be she master whose lightest breath be to sway she whose lightest look be to rule she be here at she side in the silence of the summer night they talk long but of indifferent subject and they talk might have be hear by every member of the orlean club and no harm do yet word and phrase count for very little in such a case it be the tone it be the melody of a voice it be the magic of the hour that tell the tide come in the person of mr smithson and part these two weed that be drift towards the great mysterious ocean of fate ' i have be hunting for you everywhere ' he say cheerfully ` if you want another waltz lady lesbia you have better take the next i believe it be to be the last at any rate we party be clamour to be drive home i find poor lady kirkbank fast asleep in a corner of the drawing-room ' ` will you give I that last waltz ' ask don gomez lady lesbium feel that the long-suffering smithson have endure enough womanly instinct constrain she to refuse that final waltz : but it seem to she as if she be make a tremendous sacrifice in so do and yet she have waltz to she heart 's content during the season that be wane and know all the waltz play by all the fashionable band she give a little sigh as she say -- ` no i must not indulge myself i must go and take care of lady kirkbank ' mr smithson offer he arm and she take it and go away with he leave don gomez to follow at he leisure there would be some delay no doubt before the drag start the lamp have go out among the foliage and the star be wane a little and there be a faint cold light creep over the garden which mean the advent of morning don gomez stroll towards the light house smoking a cigarette ` she be very lovely and she be -- well -- not quite spoil by she _ entourage _ and they tell I she be a heiress -- sure to inherit a fine fortune from some ancient grandmother bury alive in westmoreland ' he muse

grandmother who must be sadly lonely but it be so sweet to be quite alone with you ' they leave the lodore hotel in a open carriage after luncheon next day and post to fellside where they arrive just in time to assist at lady maulevrier 's afternoon tea she receive they both with warm affection and make hartfield sit close beside she sofa and every now and then in the pause of they talk she lay she waste and too delicate finger upon the young man 's strong brown hand with a caress gesture ` you can never know how sweet it be to I to be able to love you ' she say tenderly ` you can never know how my heart yearn to you from the very first and how hard it be to keep myself in check and not be too kind to you oh hartfield you should have tell I the truth you should not have come here under

make I so happy to have win a little of you regard ' she murmur ` and to know that i have marry a man whom you can love ' ` of course you have hear of lesbium 's engagement ' lady maulevrier say presently when they be take they tea ` maulevrier write to we about it ' ` to we ' how nice it sound think mary as if they be a firm and a letter write to one be write to both ` and do you know this mr smithson ' ` not intimately i have meet he at the carlton ' ' i be tell that he be very much esteem by you party and that he be very likely to get a peerage when this ministry go out of office ' ` that be not improbable peerage be to be have if a man be rich enough and smithson be suppose to be inordinately rich ' ' i hope he have character as well as money ' say lady maulevrier gravely ` but do you think a man can become inordinately rich in a short time with unblemished honor ' ` we be tell that nothing be impossible ' answer hartfield ` faith can remove a mountain only one do not often see it do however i believe mr smithson 's character be fairly good as millionaire go we do not inquire too closely into these thing nowadays ' lady maulevrier sigh and hold she peace she remember the day when she have protest vehemently passionately against lesbium 's marriage with a poor man and now she have a unhappy feeling about mr smithson 's wealth a doubt a dread that all might not be well with those million that some portion of that golden tide might flow from impure source she have live remote from the world but she have read the papers diligently and she know how often the splendor of commercial wealth have be suddenly obscure behind a black cloud of obloquy she could not rejoice heartily at the idea of lesbium 's engagement ' i be to see the man early in August ' she say as if she be talk of a butler ' i hope i may like he lady kirkbank tell I it be a brilliant marriage and i must take she word what can _ i _ do for my granddaughter -- a useless log -- a prisoner in two room ' ` it be very hard ' murmured mary tenderly ` but i do not see any reason why lesbium should not be happy she like a brilliant life and mr smithson can give she as much gaiety and variety as she can possibly desire and after all yacht and horse and villa and diamond _ be _ nice thing ' ` they be the thing for which half the world be ready to cheat or murder the other half ' say lady maulevrier bitterly she have tell herself long ago that wealth be power and she have sacrifice many thing she own peace she own conscience among they in order that she child and grandchild should be rich and know this she feel it ill become she to be scrupulous and to inquire too closely as to the source of mr smithson 's wealth he be rich and the world have no fault to find with he he have attend the last _ levée _ he go into reputable society and he could give lesbium all those thing which the world call good fräulein müller have pack she heavy old german trunk and have go back to the _ heimath _ laden with present of all kind from lady maulevrier so mary and she husband feel as if fellside be really they own they dine with she ladyship and leave she for the night a hour after dinner and then they go down to the garden and roam about in the twilight and talk and talk and talk as only true lover can talk be they strephon and daphne in life 's glad morning or grey-haired darby and joan and lastly they go down to the hike and row about in the moonlight and talk of king arthur 's death and of that mystic sword excalibur ` work by the lonely maiden of the lake ' they spend three happy day in wander about the neighborhood revisit in the delicious freedom of they wed life those spot which they have see together when mary be still in bondage and the eye of propriety as represent by miss müller be always upon she now they be free to go where they please -- to linger where they like -- they belong to each other and be under no other dominion the dogcart jame steadman 's dogcart which he have rarely use during the last six month be put in requisition and lord hartfield drive he wife about the country they go to the langdale pike and to dungeon ghyll and standing beside the waterfall mary tell she husband how miserable she have feel on that very spot a little less than a year ago when she believe that he think she plain and altogether horrid whereupon he have to console she with many kiss and sweet word for the bygone pain on she part the neglect of he ' i be a wretch ' he say ` blind besotted imbecile ' ` no no no lesbium be very lovely -- and i could not expect you would care for I till she be go away how glad i be that she go ' add mary naïvely the sky which have be cloudless all day begin to darken as lord hartfield drive back to fellside and mary draw a little closer to the driver 's elbow as if for shelter from a impending tempest ` you have no waterproof of course ' he say look down at she as the first big drop of a thunder shower dash upon the splash-board ` no young woman in the lake country would think of be without a waterproof ' mary be duly provide and with the help of the groom put herself into a snug little tartan inverness while hartfield send the cart spin along twelve mile a hour they be at fellside before the storm develop its full power but the sky be leaden the landscape dull and blot the atmosphere heavy and stifle the thunder grumble hoarsely far away yonder in the wild gorge of borrowdale and mary and she husband make up they mind that the tempest would come before midnight lady maulevrier be suffer from the condition of the atmosphere she have go to bed prostrate with a neuralgic headache and have give order that no one but she maid should go near she so lord hartfield and he wife dine by themselves in the room where mary have eat so many uninteresting dinner _ tête-à-tête _ with fräulein and in spite of the storm which howl pelted and lighten every now and then mary feel as if she be in paradise there be no chance of go out after dinner the lake look like a pool of ink the mountain be monster of dark and threatening aspect the rain rattle against the window and run from the verandah in miniature water-spout there be nothing to do but stay in door in the sultry dusky house ` let we go to my boudoir ' say mary ` let I enjoy the full privilege of have a boudoir -- my very own room be not it too good of grandmother to have it make so smart for I ' ` nothing can be too good for my mary ' answer she husband still in the doting stage ` but it be very nice of she ladyship -- and the room be charming ' delightful as the new boudoir might be they dawdle in the picture gallery that long corridor on which all the upper room open and at one end of which be the door of lady maulevrier 's bedroom at right angle with that red-cloth door which be never open except to give egress or ingress to jame steadman who keep the key of it as if the old part of fellside house have be a enchanted castle lord hartfield have not forget that summer midnight last year when he meditation be disturb by a woman 's piercing cry he think of it this evening as mary and he lower they voice on draw near lady maulevrier 's door she be asleep within there now perhaps that strange old woman and at any moment a awful shriek as of a soul in mortal agony might startle they in the midst of they bliss the lamp be light below but this upper part of the house be wrap in the dull gray twilight of a stormy evening a single lamp burn dimly at the further end of the corridor and all the rest be shadow mary and she husband walk up and down talk in subdue tone he be explain the necessity of he be in london next week and promise to come back to fellside directly he business at the house be over ` it will be delightful to read you speech ' say mary ` but i be silly and selfish enough to wish you be a country squire with no business in london and yet i do not wish that either for i be intensely proud of you ' ` and some day before we be much older you will sit in you robe in the peeress 's gallery ' ` oh i could not ' cry mary ' i should make a fool of myself somehow i should look like a housemaid in borrow plume remember i have no _ anstand _ -- i have be tell so all my life ' ` you will be one of the prettiest peeress who ever sit in that gallery and the purest and truest and dearest ' protest she lover-husband ` oh if i be good enough for you i be satisfied i married _ you _ and not the house of lord but i be afraid you friend will all say hartfield why in heaven 's name do you marry that uncultivated person look ' she stop suddenly with she hand on she husband 's arm it be grow momentarily darker in the corridor they be at the end near the lamp and that other end by lady maulevrier 's door be in deeper darkness yet not too dark for lord hartfield to see what it be to which mary point the red-cloth door be open and a faint glimmer of light show within a man be stand in the corridor a small shrunken figure bent and old ` it be steadman 's uncle ' say mary ` do let I go and speak to he poor poor old man ' ` the madman ' exclaimed hartfield ` no mary go to you room at once i 'll get he back to he own den ' ` but he be not mad -- at any rate he be quite harmless let I just say a few word to he surely i be safe with you ' lord hartfield be not incline to dispute that argument indeed he feel himself strong enough to protect he wife from all the lunatic in bedlam he go towards the end of the corridor keep mary well behind he but mary do not mean to lose the opportunity of renew she acquaintance with steadman 's uncle ' i hope you be better poor old soul ' she murmur gently lovingly almost nestle at she husband 's side ` what be it you ' cry the old man tremulous with joy ` oh i have be look for you -- look -- look -- wait wait for you i have be hope for you every hour and every minute why do not you come to I cruel girl ' ' i try with all my might ' say mary ` but people block up the door in the stable and they would not let I go to you and i have be rather busy for the last fortnight ' add mary blushing in the darkness ` i -- i -- be marry to this gentleman ' ` married ah that be a good thing he will take care of you if he be a honest man ' ' i think he be a honest man but he have turn out to be a earl ' answer mary proudly ` my husband be lord hartfield ' ` hartfield -- hartfield ' the old man repeat feebly ` surely i have hear that name before ' there be no violence in he manner nothing but imbecility : so lord hartfield make up he mind that mary be right and that the old man be quite harmless worthy of all compassion and kindly treatment this be the same old man whom he have meet on the fell in the bleak march morning there be no doubt in he mind about that although he could hardly see the man 's face in the shadowy corridor ` come ' say the man ` come with I my dear you forget I but i have not forget you i mean to leave you my fortune come with I and i 'll show you you legacy it be all for you -- every rupee -- every jewel ' this word rupee startle lord hartfield it have a strange sound from the lip of a westmoreland peasant ` come child come ' say the man impatiently ` come and see what i have leave you in my will i make a new will every day but i leave everything to you -- every will be in you favor but if you be marry you have better have you legacy at once you husband be strong enough to take care of you and you fortune ' ` poor old man ' whisper mary ` pray let we humor he ' it be the usual madman 's fancy no doubt boundless wealth exalted rank sanctity power -- these thing all belong to the lunatic he be the lord of creation and feed by such fancy he enjoy flash of wild happiness in the midst of he woe ` come come both of you ' say the old man eagerly breathless with impatience he lead the way across the sacred threshold look back beckon to they with he waste old hand and mary for the first time in she life enter that house which have seem to she from she very childhood as a temple of silence and mystery the passage be dimly light by a little lamp on a bracket the old man creep along stealthily look back with a face full of cunning till he come to a broad landing from which a old staircase with massive oak banister lead down to the square hall below the ceiling be low the passage be narrow all thing in the house be curiously different from that spacious mansion which lady maulevrier have build for herself a door on the landing stand ajar the old man push it open and go in follow by mary and she husband they both expect to see a room humble almost to poverty -- a iron bedstead perhaps and such furniture as the under servant in a nobleman 's household be privileged to enjoy both be alike surprise at the luxury of the apartment they enter and which be evidently reserve exclusively for steadman 's uncle it be a sitting-room the furniture be old-fashioned but almost as handsome as any in lady maulevrier 's apartment there be a large sofa of most comfortable shape cover with dark red velvet and furnish with pillow and foot rug which would have satisfy a sybarite of the first water beside the sofa stand a hookah with all appliance in the oriental fashion and half a dozen long cherry-wood pipe neatly arrange above the mantelpiece show that mr steadman 's uncle be a smoker of a luxurious type in the center of the room stand a large write table with a case of pigeon-hole at the back a table which would not have disgrace a prime minister 's study a pair of wax candle in tall silver candlestick light this table which be litter with papers in a wild confusion that too plainly indicate the condition of the owner 's mind the oak floor be cover with persian prayer rug old and fade but of the richest quality the window curtain be dark red velvet and through a open doorway mary and she husband see a corresponding luxury in the arrangement of the adjoining bedroom the whole thing seem wild and strange as a fairy tale the weird and wizened old man grin and nod he head at they the handsome room rich with dark subdue color in the dim light of four wax candle two on the table two on the mantelpiece the perfume of stephanoti and tea-rose blended faintly with the all-pervading odour of latakium and turkish attar all be alike strange bearing in mind that this old man be a recipient of lady maulevrier 's charity a hanger-on upon a confidential servant who might be suppose to be generously treat if he have the run of he tooth and the shelter of a decent garret verily there be something regal in such hospitality as this accord to a pauper lunatic where be steadman the alert the watchful all this time mary wonder they have meet no one the house be as mute as if it be under the spell of a magician it be like that awful chamber in the arabian story where the young man find the magic horse and start on he fatal journey mary feel as if here too there must be peril here too fate be work the old man go to the write table push aside the papers and then stoop down and turn a mysterious handle or winch under the knee-hole and the writing-desk move slowly on one side while the pigeon-hole sink and a deep well full of secret drawer be lay open from one of these secret drawer the old man take a bunch of key nod chuckle mutter to himself as he grope for they with tremulous hand ` steadman be uncommonly clever -- think he know everything -- but he do not know the trick of this table i could hide a regiment of sepoy in this table my dear well well perhaps not sepoy -- too big too big -- but i could hide all the state papers of the presidency there be drawer enough for that ' hartfield watch he intently with thoughtful brow there be a mystery here a mystery of the deepest dye and it be for he -- it must need be he task welcome or unwelcome to unravel it this be the maulevrier skeleton ` now come with I ' say the old man clutch mary 's wrist and draw she towards the half-open door lead into the bedroom she have a feeling of shrink for there be something uncanny about the old man something that might be life or death might belong to this world or the next but she have no fear in the first place she be courageous by nature and in the second she husband be with she a tower of strength and she could know no fear while he be at she side the strange old man lead the way across he bedroom to a inner chamber oak pannell with very little furniture but hold much treasure in the shape of trunk portmanteau -- all very old and dusty -- and two large wooden case band with iron before one of these case the man kneel down and apply a key to the padlock which fasten it he give the candle to lord hartfield to hold and then open the box it seem to be full of book which he begin to remove heap they on the floor beside he and it be not till he have clear away a layer of dingy volume that he come to a large metal strong box so heavy that he could not lift it out of the chest slowly tremulously and with quicken breathing he unlock the box where it be and raise the lid ` look ' he say eagerly ` this be she legacy -- this be my little girl 's legacy ' lord hartfield bent down and look at the old man 's treasure by the waver light of the candle mary look over he shoulder breathless with wonder the strong box be divide into compartment one and the largest be fill with rouleaux of coin pack as closely as possible the other contain jewel set and unset -- diamond emerald ruby sapphire -- which flash back the flicker flame of the candle with glinting of rainbow light ` these be all for she -- all -- all ' exclaim the old man ` they be worth a prince 's ransom those rouleaux be all gold those gem be priceless they be the dowry of a princess but they be hers now -- yes my dear they be yours -- because you speak sweetly and smile prettily and be very good to a lonely old man -- and because you have my mother 's face dear a smile that recall the day of my youth lift out the box and take it away with you if you be strong enough -- you you ' he say touching lord hartfield ` hide it somewhere -- keep it from _ she _ let no one know -- no one except you wife and you must be in the secret ' ` my dear sir it be out of the question -- impossible that my wife or i should accept one of

bond street upholsterer to refit the saloon and lady lesbium 's cabin the dark velvet and morocco which suit a masculine occupant would not have harmonise with girlhood and beauty and mr smithson 's saloon as originally design have something of the air of a _ tabagie _ the bond street man strip away all the velvet and morocco pluck up the turkey carpet drape the scuttle-port with pale yellow

smithson be immensely kind ' she exclaim ` smithson be always kind ' answer lady kirkbank ` and you do not half enough appreciate he he have give I he very own cabin -- such a dear little den there be he cigar box and everything lovely on the shelf and he own particular dressing-case put open for I to use -- all the back of all the brush _ repoussé _ silver and all the scent-bottle fill expressly for I if the yacht would only stand quite still i should think it more delicious than the best house i ever stay in : only i do not altogether enjoy that little way it have of gurgle up and down perpetually ' mr smithson 's chief butler a german swiss and a treasure of intelligence have come down to take the domestic arrangement of the yacht into he control the park lane _ chef _ be also on board mr smithson 's steward act as he subordinate this great man grumble sorely at the smallness of he surroundings for the most luxurious yacht be a poor substitute for the spacious kitchen and storeroom and stillroom of the london mansion there be a cabin for lady kirkbank 's rilboche and lady lesbium 's kibble where the two might squabble at they leisure in a word everything have be do that forethought could do to make the yacht as perfect a place of sojourn as any float habitation from noah 's ark to the orient steamer have ever be make it be between four and five upon a delicious July afternoon that lady kirkbank and she charge come on board the maid and the luggage have be send a day in advance so that everything might be in its place and the empty box all stow away before the lady arrive they have nothing to do but walk on board and fling themselves into the low luxurious chair ready for they on the deck a little wearied by the heat and dust of a railway journey and with that delicious sense of languid indifference to all the care of life which seem to be in the very atmosphere of a perfect summer afternoon a striped awning cover the deck and great basket of rose -- pink and red and yellow -- be place about here and there tea be ready on a low table a swing brass kettle hiss merrily with a air of supreme homeliness mr smithson have accompany he _ fiancée _ from town and now sit read the _ globe _ and meekly wait for he tea while lesbium take a languid survey of the shore and the flotilla of boat little and big and while lady kirkbank rhapsodise about the yacht praise everything and call everything by a wrong name he be to be they guest all day and every day they be to have enough of he as lesbium have observe to she chaperon with a spice of discontent not quite so delighted with the arrangement as she faithful swain to he the idea be rapture ` you have contrived somehow to keep I very much at a distance hitherto ' he tell lesbium ` and i feel sometimes as if we be almost stranger but a yacht be the best place in the world to bring two people together and a week at cowe will make we nearer to each other and more to each other than three month in london ' and lesbium have say nothing inwardly revolt at the idea of become any nearer and dearer to this man whom she have pledge herself to marry she be to be he wife -- yes some day -- and it be he desire the some day should be soon : but in the interval she dearest privilege be the power to keep he at a distance and yet she could not make up she mind to break with he to say honestly ' i never like you much and now we be engage i find myself like you less and less every day save I from the irrevocable wickedness of a loveless marriage forgive I and let I go ' no this she could not bring herself to say she do not like mr smithson but she value the position he be able to give she she want to be mistress of that infinite wealth -- she could not renounce that right to which she fancy she have be bear she right to be one of the queen of society : and the only man who have offer to crown she as queen to find she a palace and a court be horace smithson without mr smithson she first season would have result in dire failure she might perhaps have endure that failure and be content to abide the chance of a second season have it not be for mary 's triumph but for mary to be a countess and for lesbium to remain lesbium haselden a nobody dependent upon the caprice of a grandmother whose means might after all be but limit -- no such a concatenation as that be not to be endure lesbium tell herself that she could not go back to fellside to remain there indefinitely a spinster and a dependent she have learn the true value of money she have find out what the world be like and it seem to she that some such person as mr smithson be essential to she existence just as a butler be a necessity in a house one may not like the man but the post must be fill again if she be to throw over mr smithson and speculate upon she chance of next year what hope have she of do better in she second season than in she first the horizon be blank there be no great _ partus _ likely to offer himself for competition she have see all that the market could produce wealthy bachelor high-born lover could not drop from the moon lesbium school by lady kirkbank know she peerage by heart and she know that have miss lord hartfield there be really no one in the blue book worth wait for thus care only for those thing which wealth can buy she have make up she mind that she could not do without horace smithson 's money and she must therefore need resign herself to the disagreeable necessity of take smithson and he money together the great auctioneer fate would not divide the lot she tell herself that for she a loveless marriage be after all no prodigious sacrifice she have find out that heart make but a small figure in the sum of she life she could do without love a year ago she have fancy herself in love with john hammond in she seclusion at st bee in the long dull August day saunter up and down by the edge of the sea in the melancholy sunset hour she think that she heart be break that life be worthless without the man she love she have think and feel all this but not strongly enough to urge she to any great effort not keenly enough to make she burst she chain she have prefer to suffer this loss than to sacrifice she chance of future aggrandisement and now she look back and remember those sunset walk by the sea and all she thought and feeling in those silent summer hour and she smile at herself half in scorn half in pity for she own weakness how easily she have learn to do without he who at that hour seem the better part of she existence a good deal of gaiety and praise a little mild flirtation at kirkbank castle and lo the image of she first lover begin to grow dim and blur like a fade photograph a season at canne and she be cure a week in london and that first love be a thing of the past a dream from which the dreamer awaketh forget the thing that he have dream remember all this she tell herself that she have no heart that love or no love be a question of very little moment and that the personal quality of the man whom she choose for a husband matter nothing to she provide that he land and house and social status come up to she standard of merit she have see mr smithson 's house and land and she be distinctly assure that he would in due course be raise to the peerage she have therefore every reason to be satisfied have thus reason out the circumstance of she new life she accept she fate with a languid grace which harmonise with she delicate and patrician beauty nobody could have for a moment suppose from she manner that she love horace smithson but nobody have the right to think that she detest he she accept all he attention as a thing of course the flower which he strew beneath she footstep the pearl which he melt in she wine -- metaphorically speak -- be just ` good enough ' and no more this afternoon when mr smithson ask she how she like the arrangement of the saloon and cabin she say she think they would do very nicely ` they would do ' nothing more ` it be dreadfully small of course ' she say ` when one be accustom to room : but it be rather amusing to be in a sort of doll 's house and on deck it be really very nice ' this be the most mr smithson have for he pain and he seem to be content therewith if a man will marry the prettiest girl of the year he must be satisfy with such scant civility as conscious perfection may give he we know that aphrodite be not altogether the most comfortable wife and that helen be a cause of trouble mr smithson sit in a bamboo chair beside he mistress and look ineffably happy when she hand he a cup of tea sky and sea be one exquisite azure -- the color of the boat glance in the sunshine as if they have be jewel here a emerald rudder there a gunwale paint with liquid ruby white sail white frock white duck make vivid patch of light against the blue the landscape yonder shone and sparkle as if it have be incandescent all the world of land and sky and sea be steep in sunshine a day on which to do nothing read nothing think nothing only to exist while they sit bask in the balmy atmosphere look lazily at that bright almost insupportable picture of blue sea under blue sky there come the dip of oar make music and a sound of coolness with every plash of water ` how good it be of somebody to row about just to give we that nice soothing sound ' murmured lesbium lady kirkbank with she dear old head throw back upon the cushion of she luxurious chair and she dear little cornflower hat just a think on one side be sleep the sleep of the just and unconsciously reveal the little golden arrangement which give variety to she front tooth the soothing sound come nearer and nearer close under the _ cayman 's _ quarter and then a brown hand clasp the man-rope and a light slim figure swing itself upon deck while the boat bob and splash below it be montesma who have not be expect till the racing which be not to begin for two day a faint faint rise bloom flush lady lesbium 's cheek at sight of he and mr smithson give a little look of vexation just one rapid contraction of the eyebrow which resume they conventional placidity the next instant ` so good of you ' he murmur ' i really do not expect you till the beginning of the week ' ` london be simply insupportable in this weather -- most of all for a man bear in the havana my soul thirst for blue water so i say to myself this good smithson be at cowe he will give I the run of he yacht and a room at he villa why not go to cowe at once ' ` the room be at you service i have only two or three of my people at formosa but just enough to look after a bachelor friend ' ' i want very little service my dear fellow ' answer montesma pleasantly ' a man who have cross the cordillera and camp in the primeval forest on the shore of the amazon learn to help himself so this be the _ cayman _ _ muy deleitoso mi amigo _ a float paradise in little if the ark have be like this i do not think any of the passenger would have want the flood to dry up ' he shake hand with lady lesbium as he speak and with lady kirkbank who look at he as if he be part of she dream and then he sink into the chair on lesbium 's left hand with the air of be establish for the rest of the day ' i have leave my portmanteau at the end of the pier ' he say lazily ' i dare say one of you fellow will be good enough to take they to formosa for I ' mr smithson give the necessary order all the beauty have go out of the sea and the sky for he all the contentment from he mind and yet he be in no position to rebel against fate -- in no position to say directly or indirectly ` don gomez de montesma i do not want you here and i must request you to transfer yourself elsewhither ' lesbium 's feeling be curiously different the very sight of that nervous brown hand upon the rope just now have send a strange thrill through she vein she who believe herself heartless could scarce trust herself to speak for the vehement throbbing of she heart a sense of joy too deep for word possess she as she recline in she low chair with droop eyelid yet feel the fire of those dark southern eye upon she face scorch she like a actual flame ` lady lesbium may i have a cup of tea ' he ask not because he want the tea but only for the cruel delight of see if she be able to give it to he calmly she hand shake flutter wander helplessly as she pour out that cup of tea and hand it to montesma a feminine office which she have perform placidly enough for mr smithson the spaniard take the cup from she with a quiet smile a subtle look which seem to explore the inmost depth of she consciousness yes this man be verily she master she know it and he know it as that look of he tell she vain to play she part of languid indifference -- vain to struggle against she bondage in heart and spirit she be at he foot a odalisque recognize and bow down to she sultan happily for the general peace mr smithson have be look away seaward with a somewhat troubled brow while that little cap and saucer episode be be enact and in the next minute lesbium have recover she self-command and resume that graceful languor which be one of she charm she be weak but she be not altogether foolish and she have no idea of succumb to this new influence -- of yield herself up to this conqueror who seem to take she life into he hand as if it be a bit of thistledown she agitation of those first few minute be due to the suddenness of he appearance -- the reaction from dulness to delight she have be tell that he be not to be at cowe till Monday and lo he be here at she side just as she be think how empty and dreary life be without he he drop into he place so naturally and easily make himself so thoroughly at home and so agreeable to every one that it be almost impossible for horace smithson to resent he audacity mr smithson 's vitals might be devour by the gnawing of the green-eyed monster but however fierce that gnawing be he do not want to seem jealous montesma be there as the very incarnation of some experience in mr smithson 's past career and he dare not object to the man 's presence and so the summer day wear on they have the yacht all to themselves that evening for the racing yacht be fulfil engagement in other water and the gay company of pleasure-seeker have not yet fully assemble they be drop in one by one all the evening and cowe road grow fuller of life with every hour of the summer night mr smithson and he guest dine in the saloon a snug little party of four and sit long over dessert deep into the dusk and they talk of all thing under heaven thing frivolous thing grave but most of all about that fair strange world in far-off southern water the sunny island of the caribbean sea and the dreamy luxurious life of that tropical clime half spanish half oriental wholly independent of european conventionality lesbium listen enchant by the picture what be park lane palace and berkshire manor the petty splendor of the architect and the upholsterer weigh against a world in which all nature be on a grander scale mr smithson might give she fine house and costly upholstery but only the tropic of cancer could give she larger and brighter star a world of richer color a land of perpetual summer night luminous with fire-flies garden in which the fern and the cactus be as forest tree and where humming-birds flash among the foliage like live flower nay where the flower themselves take the form of the animal world and seem instinct with life and motion ` yes ' say mr smithson with he gentlemanlike drawl ` spanish america and the west indy be delightful place to talk about there be so many thing one leave out of the picture -- thief nigger jigger snake mosquito yellow jack creep crawl creature of all kind i always feel very glad i have be to south america ' ` why ' ` in order that i may never go there again ' reply mr smithson ' i be begin to hope you would take I there some day ' say lesbia ` never again no not even for you sake no man should ever leave europe after he be five-and-thirty indeed i doubt if after that age he should venture beyond the mediterranean that be the sea of civilisation anything outside it mean barbarism ' ' i hope we be go to travel by-and-by ' say lesbium ' i have be mew up in grasmere half my life and if you be go to confine I to the shore of the mediterranean which be after all only a larger lake for the other half of my life my existence will be a dull piece of work after all i agree with what don gomez say the other night : not to travel be not to live ' they go on deck presently and sit in the summer darkness light only by the star and by the light of the yacht and the faintly gleaming window of the light town sit long and late in a state of ineffable repose lady kirkbank fortify by the produce of mr smithson 's particular _ clo _ and by a couple of glass of green chartreuse sleep profoundly she have not enjoy herself so much for the last three month she have be stretch on society 's rack and she have be ground in society 's mill and neither mind nor body have be she own to do what she like withal she have toil early and late and have spare herself in no wise and now the trouble be over for a space here be rest and respite she have do she duty as a chaperon have provide she charge with the very best thing the matrimonial market offer she have pay she creditor something on account all round and have leave they appease and trustful if not content sir george have go oft alone to drink the water at spa and to fortify himself for scotland and the grouse season she be she own mistress and she could fold she hand and take she rest eat and drink and sleep and be merry all at mr smithson 's expense the yacht come flock in next day like a flight of white-winged sea bird and mr smithson have enough to do receive visitor upon the _ cayman _ he be fully occupy but montesma have nothing to do except to amuse lady lesbium and she chaperon and in this onerous task he succeed admirably lesbium find that it be too warm to be on the deck when there be perspire people whose breath must be ninety by the thermometer perpetually come on board so she and lady kirkbank sit in the saloon and have the more distinguished guest bring down to they as to a court and the shrewder of the guest be quick to divine that no company beyond that of don gomez de montesma be really want in that rose-scented saloon the spaniard teach lady kirkbank _ monte _ which delight she and which she vow she would introduce at she supper party in the half season of November when she should be in london for a week or two as a bird of passage flitting southwards he begin to teach lesbium spanish a language for which she have take a sudden fancy and it be curious what tender accent what hide meaning even a grammar can take from such a teacher spanish come easily enough to a learner who have be thoroughly drill in french and italian and who have be teach the rudiment of latin so by the end of a lesson which go on at interval all day the pupil be able to lisp a passage of don quixote in the sweetest castilian very sweet to the ear of don gomez -- a kind of baby language precious as the first half-formed syllable of infancy to mother montesma have nothing to do but to amuse himself and he companion all day in the saloon amidst odour of rose and peach in a shadowy coolness make by striped silken blind but mr smithson be not so much he own master that innumerable company of friend which be the portion of the rich man give to hospitality would not let the owner of the _ cayman _ go scot-free at a place like cowe on the eve of the regatta week the freelance of society expect to find entertainment and mr smithson have to maintain he character for princely hospitality at the sacrifice of he feeling as a lover every ripple of lesbium 's silvery laughter every deep tone of montesma 's voice from the cabin below send a pang to he jealous soul and yet he have to smile and to order more champagne cup and to be lavish of he best cigar albeit insist that he friend should smoke they cigar in the bow well to leeward so that no foul breathing of tobacco should pollute he cleopatra galley cleopatra be very happy meanwhile sublimely indifferent even to the odour of tobacco she have she antony at she foot look up at she as she recite she lesson with darkly luminous eye obviously worship she obviously intent on win she without count the cost when have a montesma ever count the cost to himself or other -- the cost in gold in honor in human life the record of cuba in the palmy day of the slave trade would tell how lightly they hold the last and for honor well the private hell of island and main could tell they tale of specially print play card in which the sword or star on the back of each card have a secret language of they own and be as finger-post for the initiate player mr smithson have business on shore and be fain to leave the yacht for a hour or two before dinner he invite don gomez to go with he but the offer be graciously decline ` amigo i do not care even to look at land in such weather it be so detestably dry ' he plead ` it be only the sound of the sea gurgle against the hull that reconcile one to existence go and be happy at you club and send off those occult telegram of yours dearest i shall not leave the _ cayman _ till bed-time ' he look as fresh and cool as if utterly unaffected by the heat which to a cuban must have be a merely lukewarm condition of the atmosphere but he affect to be prostrate and smithson could not insist he have he card to play in a game which require extremest caution and there be no friendly indicator on the back of he king and ace he be feel he way in the dark and do not know how much mischief montesma be prepare to do when the owner of the yacht be go don gomez propose a adjournment to the deck for afternoon tea and the trio sit under the awn tea-drinking and gossip for the next hour lady kirkbank tell the steward to say not at home to everybody just as if she have a street door ` there be a good deal of the _ dolce far niente _ about this ' say montesma presently ` but do not you think we have be anchor in sight of that shabby little town quite long enough and that it would be rather nice to spread we wing and sail round the island before the racing begin ' ` it would be exquisite ' say lesbium ' i be very tired of inaction though i dearly love learn spanish ' she add with a lovely smile and a look that be half submissive half mutinous ` but i have really be begin to wonder whether this boat can move ' ` you will see that she can and at a smart pace too if i sail she shall we circumnavigate the island we can set sail after dinner ' ` will mr smithson consent do you think ' ` why do smithson exist except to obey you ' ' i do not know if lady kirkbank would quite like it ' say lesbium look at she chaperon who be wave a big japanese fan slowly unsteadily and with a somewhat drunken air the while she slide into dreamland ` quite like what ' she murmur drowsily ' a little sail ' ' i should dearly love it if it do not make I sea-sick ' ` sea-sick on a glassy lake like this impossible ' say montesma ' i consider the thing settle we set sail after dinner ' mr smithson come back to the yacht just in time to dress for dinner don gomez excuse himself from put on he dress suit he be go to sail the yacht himself and he be dress for he work picturesquely in white duck trousers white silk shirt and black velvet shooting jacket he dine with the permission of the lady in this costume in which he look so much handsomer than in the livery of polite life he have a red scarf tie round he waist and when at he work by-and-by he wear a little red silk cap just stick lightly on he dark hair the dinner to-day be all animation and even excitement very different from the languorous calm of yesterday lesbium seem a new creature she talk and laugh and flash and sparkle as she have never yet do within mr smithson 's experience he contemplate the transformation with wonder not unmixed with suspicion never for he have she be so brilliant -- never in response to he glance have she violet eye thus kindle have she smile be so entrancingly sweet he watch montesma but in he he could find no fault even jealousy could hardly take objection to the spaniard 's manner to lady lesbium there be not a look not a word that hint at a private understanding between they or which seem to convey deeper meaning than the common language of society no there be no ground for fault-finding and yet smithson be miserable he know this man of old and know he influence over woman mr smithson hand over the management of the yacht without a murmer albeit he pretend to be able to sail she himself and be in the habit of take the command for a couple of hour on a sunny afternoon much to the amusement of skipper and crew but montesma be a sailor bear and breed -- the salt keen breath of the sea have be the first breath in he nostril -- he have manage he light felucca before he be twelve year old have sail every inch of the caribbean sea and northward to the furthermost of the bahama before he be fifteen he have live more on the water than on the land in that wild boyhood of he a boyhood in which book and professor have play but small part montesma 's school have be the world and beautiful woman he only professor he have learn arithmetic from the transaction of bubble company modern language from the lip of the woman who love he he be a crack shoot a perfect swordsman a reckless horseman and a dancer in whom dance almost rise to genius beyond these limit he be as ignorant as dirt but he have a cleverness which serve as a substitute for book learning and he seldom fail in impress the people he meet with the idea that he gomez de montesma be no ordinary man directly after dinner the preparation for a immediate start begin very much to the disgust of skipper and crew who be not in the habit of work after dinner but montesma care nothing for the short answer of the captain or the black look of the man lesbium want to learn all about everything -- the name of every sail of every rope she stand near the helmsman a slim graceful figure in a white gown of some soft material with never a jewel or a flower to relieve that statuesque simplicity she wear no hat and the rich chesnut hair be roll in a loose knot at the back of the small greek-looking head montesma come to she every now and then to explain what be be do and by-and-by when the canvas be all up and the yacht be skim over the water like a giant swan bear by the current of some vast strong river he come and stay by she side and they two sit make little baby sentence in spanish he as teacher and she as pupil with no one near they but the sailor the owner of the _ cayman _ have disappear mysteriously a quarter of a hour after the sail be unfurled and lady kirkbank have totter down to the saloon ' i be not go -- cabin ' she falter when lesbium remonstrate with she ` only -- go -- saloon -- sofa -- lie down -- little -- smithson take care -- you ' not perceive that smithson have vanish ` shall be -- quite close ' so lesbium and don gomez be alone under the summer star murmur little bit of spanish ` it be the only true way of learn a language ' he say ` grammar be a delusion ' it be a very delightful and easy way of learn at any rate lesbium recline in she bamboo chair and fan herself indolently and watch the shadowy shore of the island cliff and hill down and wood crest flit past she like dream-picture and she lip slowly shape the word of that soft lisping language -- so simple so musical -- a language make for lover and for song one would think it be wonderful what rapid progress lesbium make she hear a church clock on the island striking and ask don gomez the hour ` ten ' he say ` ten surely it must be later it be past eight before we begin dinner and we have be sail for ever so long captain kindly tell I the time ' she call to the skipper who be loll over the gunwale near the foremast smoking a meditative pipe ` twelve o'clock my lady ' ` heaven can i possibly have be sit here so long i should like to stay on deck all night and watch the sailing but i must really go and take care of poor lady kirkbank i be afraid she be not very well ' ` she have a somewhat distract air when she go below but i daresay she will sleep off she trouble if i be you i should leave she to herself ' ` impossible what can have become of mr smithson ' ' i have a shrewd suspicion that it be with smithson as with poor lady kirkbank ' ` do you mean that he be ill ' ` precisely ' ` what on a calm summer night sailing over a sea of glass the owner of a yacht ' ` rather ignominious for poor smithson be not it but man who own yacht be only mortal and be sometimes wretched sailor smithson be feeble on that point as i know of old ' ` then be not it rather cruel of we to sail he yacht ' ` yacht be mean for sailing and again sea-sickness be suppose to be a wholesome exercise ' ` good-night ' ` good-night ' both good night in spanish and with a touch of tenderness which the word could hardly have express in english ` must you really go ' plead montesma hold she hand just a think longer than he have ever hold it before ` ah the little more and how much it be ' say the poet ` really and truly ' ' i be so sorry i wish you could have stay on deck all night ' ` so do i with all my heart this calm sea under the starlit sky be like a dream of heaven ' ` it be very nice but if you stay i think i could promise you considerable variety we shall have a tempest before morning ' ` of all thing in the world i should love to see a thunderstorm at sea ' ` be on the alert then and captain parke and i will try to oblige you ' ` at any rate you have make it impossible for I to sleep i shall stay with lady kirkbank in the saloon good-night again ' ` good-night ' chapter xxxix in storm and darkness lesbium find lady kirkbank prostrate on a low divan in the saloon sleepless and very cross the atmosphere reek with red lavender sal-volatile eau de cologne and brandy which latter remedy poor georgie have take freely in she agony kibble the faithful grasmere girl sit by the divan fan the sufferer with a large japanese fan rilboche have naturally as a frenchwoman succumb utterly to she own feeling and be moan in she berth wail out every now and then that she would never have take service with miladus have she suspect she to be capable of such cruelty as to take she to live for week upon the sea if this be the state of affair now while the ocean be only gently stir what would it be by-and-by if the tempest should really come ` what can you be think of stay on deck all night with those man ' exclaimed lady kirkbank peevishly ` it be hardly respectable ' she would have be still more inclined to object have she know that lesbium 's companion have be ` that man ' rather than ` those man ' ` what do you mean by all night ' lesbium retort contemptuously ` it be only just twelve ' ` only twelve i think we be close upon daylight i have suffer a eternity of agony ' ' i be very sorry you should be ill but really the sea have be so deliciously calm ' ' i believe i should have suffer less if it have be diabolically rough oh that monotonous flip-flap of the water that slow heaving of the boat nothing could be worse ' ' i be glad to hear you say that for don gomez say we be likely to have a tempest ' ' a tempest ' shriek georgie ` then let he stop the boat this instant and put I on shore tell he to land I anywhere -- on the needle even i could stop at the lighthouse till morning a storm at sea will be simply my death ' ` dear lady kirkbank i be only joke ' say lesbium who do not want to be worry by she chaperon 's nervous apprehension : ` so far the night be lovely ' ` give I a spoonful more brandy my good creature ' -- to kibble ` lesbia you ought never to have bring I into this miserable state i consent to stay on board the yacht but i never consent to sailing on she ' ` you will soon be well dear lady kirkbank and you will have such a appetite for breakfast to-morrow morning ' ` where shall we be at breakfast time ' ` off st catherine 's point i believe -- just half way round the island ' ` if we be not at the bottom of the sea ' groan georgie they be now in the open channel and the boat dip and rise to larger billow than have encounter she course before lady kirkbank lay in a state of collapse in which life seem only sustainable by occasional teaspoonful of cognac gently tilted down she throat by the patient kibble lesbium go to she cabin but with no intention of remain there she be firmly convince that the storm would come and she mean to be on deck while it be rage what harm could thunder or lightning hail or rain do to she while he be by to protect she he would be busy sail the boat perhaps but still he would have a moment now and then in which to think of she and care for she yes the storm be come there be a livid look upon the water and the atmosphere be heavy with heat the sky to windward black as a funeral pall lesbium be almost fearless yet she feel a thrill of awe as she look into that dense blackness to leeward the star be still visible but that gigantic mass of cloud come creep slowly solemnly over the sky while the shadow flit fast across the water swallow up that ghastly electric glare lesbium wrap herself in a white cashmere _ sortie de bal _ and steal up the companion montesma be work at the rope with he own hand call direction to the sailor to shorten and take in the canvas urge they to increase effort by work at the rope with he own hand spring up the rigging and on deck flash backwards and forwards amidst the rig like a being of supernatural power he have take off he jacket and be clothe from top to toe in white save for that streak of scarlet which tightly girdle he waist he tall flexible form perfect in line as a greek statue of herme stand out against the background of black night he voice with its tone of brief imperious command the proud carriage of he head the easy grace of he rapid movement all proclaim the man bear to rule over he fellow-men and it be these master spirit these bear ruler whom woman instinctively recognize as they sovereign lord and for whom woman count no sacrifice too costly in the midst of he activity montesma suddenly see that white-robed figure standing at the top of the companion and fly to she side the boat be pitch heavily dip into the trough of the sea at a angle of forty-five degree as it seem to lesbia ` you ought not to be here ' say montesma ` it be much rougher than i expect ' ' i be not afraid ' she answer ` but i will go back to my cabin if i be in you way ' ` in my way ' -lrb- with deepest tenderness -rrb- : ` yes you be in my way for i shall think of nothing else now you be here but i believe we have do all that need be do to the yacht and i can take care of you till the storm be over ' he put he arm round she as the stem dip and lead she towards the stern guide she footstep support she as she light figure sway against he with the motion of the boat a vivid flash of lightning show he she face as they stand for a instant lean against each other he arm encircle she ah what deep feeling in that countenance once so passionless what a new light in those eye it be like the awakening of a long dormant soul he take the helm from the captain and stand steer the vessel and call out he order with lesbium close beside he hold she with he disengaged arm draw she near he as the vessel pitch violently draw she nearer still when they ship a sea and a great fountain of spray enfold they both in a dense cloud of salt water the thunder roar and rattle as if it begin and end close beside they fork lightning zigzag amidst the rig sheet lightning enwrap those two in a luminous atmosphere reveal face that be pale with passion lip that tremble with emotion there be but scant opportunity for speech and neither of these two feel the need of word to be together bind nearer to each other than they have ever be yet than they might ever be again in the midst of thunder and lightning and dense cloud of spray this be enough once when the _ cayman _ pitch with exceptional fury when the thunder crash and roar loudest lesbium find she head lie on montesma 's breast and he arm round she he lip upon she face she do not wrench herself from that forbid embrace she let those lip kiss hers as never mortal man have kiss she before but a instant later when montesma 's attention be distract by he duty as steersman and he let she go she slip away in the darkness and melt from he sight and touch like a modern undine he dare not leave the helm and follow she then he send one of the sailor below a little later to make sure that she be safe in she cabin but he see she no more that night the storm abate soon after daybreak and the morning be lovely but don gomez and lady lesbium do not meet again till the church bell on the island be ring for morning service and then the lady be safe under the wing of she chaperon with she affianced husband in attendance upon she at the breakfast table in the saloon she receive montesma with the faintest inclination of the head and she carefully avoid all occasion of speech with he during the leisurely long spun-out meal she be as white as she muslin gown and she eye tell of a sleepless night she talk a little very little to lady kirkbank and mr smithson to the spaniard not at all and yet montesma be in no manner dash by this appearance of deep offence so might francesca have look the morning after that little scene over the book yet she sacrifice she salvation for she lover all the same it be a familiar stage upon the journey which montesma know by heart here the inclination of the road be so many degree more or less for this hill you be command to put on a extra horse at this stage it be forbid to go more than eight mile a hour and so on and so on montesma know every inch of the ground he put on a melancholy look and talk very little he have be on deck all night and so there be a excuse for he be quiet lady kirkbank related she impression of the storm and talk enough for four she have suffer the pang of purgatory but she natural cheeriness assert itself and she make no moan about past agony which have exercise a really delightful influence on she appetite mr smithson also be cheerful he have pay he annual tribute to neptune and might hope to go scot-free for the rest of the season ` if i have stay on deck i must have have my finger in the pie so i think it better to go below and get a good night 's rest in the steward 's cabin ' he say not care to confess he suffering as frankly as lady kirkbank admit hers after breakfast which be prolonged till noon montesma ask smithson to smoke a cigarette on deck with he ' i want to talk to you on a rather serious matter ' he say lesbium hear the word and look up with a frightened glance could he mean to attempt anything desperate be he go to confess the fatal truth to horace smithson to tell she affianced lover that she be untrue to she bond that she love he montesma as fondly as he love she that they two soul have mingle like two flame fan by the same current and thence have rise to a conflagration which must end in ruin if she be not set free to follow where she heart have go free to belong to that man whom she spirit choose for lord and master she heart leap at the hope that montesma be go to do this that he be strong enough to break she bond for she powerful and rich enough to secure she a brilliant future yet this last consideration which hitherto have be paramount seem now of but little moment to be with _ he _ to belong to _ he _ would be enough for bliss albeit that in such a choice she forfeit all that she have ever possess or hope for of earthly prosperity adventurer beggar whatever he might be she choose he and love he with all the strength of a weak soul newly awaken to passionate feeling unhappily for lesbium haselden montesma be not at all the kind of man to take so direct and open a course as that which she imagine possible he business with mr smithson be of quite a different kind ` smithson do you know that you have a utterly incompetent crew ' he say gravely when they two be stand aft light they cigarette ` indeed i do not the man be all experienced sailor and the captain rank high among yachtsman ' ` english yachtsman be not particularly good judge of sailor i tell you you skipper be no sailor and he man be fool if it have not be for I the _ cayman _ would have go to piece on the rock last night and if you be to cross to st malo as you talk of do for the regatta there you have better sack these man and let I get you a south american crew i know of a fellow who be in london just now -- the captain of a rio steamer who 'll send you a crew of pick man if you give I authority to telegraph to he ' ' i do not like foreign sailor ' say smithson look perplexed and worried ` and i have perfect confidence in wilkinson ' ` which be as much as to say that you consider I a liar go to the bottom you own way _ mon amus : ce n'est pas mon affaire _ ' say montesma turn on he heel and leave he friend to he own device have he press the point smithson would have suspect he of some evil motive and would have be resolute in he resistance but as he say no more about it smithson begin to feel uncomfortable he be no sailor himself know absolutely nothing about the navigation of he yacht though he sometimes pretend to sail she and he have no power to judge of he skipper 's capacity or he man 's seamanship he have engage the captain wholly on the strength of the man 's reputation guarantee by certain certificate which seem to mean a great deal but after all such certificate might mean very little -- such a reputation might be no real guarantee the sailor have be engage by the captain and they ruddy face and thoroughly british appearence the exquisite cleanliness which they maintain in every detail of the yacht have seem to mr smithson the perfection of seamanship but it be not the less true that the cleanest of yacht with deck of spotless whiteness sail of unsullied purity brass shine and sparkling like gold fresh from the goldsmith 's might be spike upon a rock or might founder on a sand-bank or heel over under too much canvas mr smithson be incline to suspect any proposition of montesma 's yet he be not the less disturbed in mind by the assertion the day wear on and the yacht sail merrily over a summer sea mr smithson fidget about the deck uneasily watch every movement of the sailor no boat could be sail better as it seem to he but in such weather and over such water any boat must need go easily it be in the blackness of night amidst the fury of the storm that montesma 's opinion have be form smithson begin to think that he friend be right the sailor have honest countenance but they look horribly stupid could man with such vacuous grin such a air of imbecile good-nature be capable of act wisely in any terrible crisis -- could they have nerve and readiness quickness decision all those grand qualite which be need by the seaman who have to contend with the fury of the element mr smithson and he guest have breakfast too late for the possibility of luncheon they be in cowe road by one o'clock a fleet of yacht have arrive during they absence and the scene be full of life and gaiety lady lesbium hold a _ levée _ at the afternoon tea and have a crowd of she old admirer around she -- adorer whose presence in no wise disturbed horace smithson 's peace he would have be content that he wife should go through life with a herd of such worshipper follow in she footstep he know the aimless innocence the almost infantine simplicity of the typical johnnie chappie _ muscadin petit creve gommeux _ -- call he by what name you will from these he fear no evil but in that one follower who give no outward token of he worship he dread peril it be montesma he watch while dragoon with close-cropped hair and imbecile youth with head rigid in four-inch collar be hang about lady lesbium 's low bamboo chair and administer obsequiously to the small necessity of the tea-table it be while this tea-table business be go on that mr smithson take the opportunity of set he mind at rest be it possible as to the merit of captain wilkinson among he visitor this afternoon there be the owner of three or four racing yacht -- a man renown for he victory at home and abroad ' i think you know something of my captain wilkinson before i engage he ' say smithson with assume carelessness ' i know every skipper on board every boat in the squadron ' answer he friend ' a good fellow wilkinson -- thoroughly honest fellow ' ` honest oh yes i know all about that but how about he seamanship he certificate be wonderfully good but they be not everything ` everything my dear fellow ' cry the other ` they be next to nothing but i believe wilkinson be a tolerable sailor ' this be not encouraging ` he have never be unlucky i believe ' ` my dear smithson you be a great authority in the city but you be not very well up in the record of the yachting world or you would know that you captain wilkinson be skipper on the _ orinoco _ when she run aground on the chesil bank come home from cherbourg regatta fifteen live lose and the yacht in less than half a hour ground to powder that be rather a bad case i remember for though it be a tempestuous night the accident would never have happen if wilkinson have not mistake the light so you see he trinity house papers do not prevent he go wrong ' good heaven this be the strongest confirmation of montesma 's charge the man be a stupid man a incapable man a man to whose intelligence and care human life should never be trust a fig for he honesty what would honesty be worth in a hurricane off the chesil beach what would honesty serve a ship spit on the jailor off jersey montesma be right if the _ cayman _ be to make a trip to st malo she must be navigate by competent man horace smithson hate foreign sailor copper-faced ruffian with flash black eye which seem to threaten murder do you but say a rough word to they sleek raven-haired scoundrel with bowie-knife in they girdle ready for mutiny but after all life be worth too much to be risk for a prejudice a sentiment perhaps that st malo business might be avoid and then there need be no change in captain or crew the yacht must be safe enough lie at anchor in the roadstead by-and-by when the visitor have depart and mr smithson be reposefully enjoy he tea by lady lesbium 's side he approach the subject ` do you really care about cross to st malo after this -- really prefer the idea to ryde ' ` infinitely ' exclaim lesbium quickly ` ryde would only be cowe ever again -- a lesser cowe and i think when you first propose it that the plan be rather stupid though i do not want to be uncivil and say so but i be delighted with don gomez de montesma 's amendment substitute st malo for ryde in the first place the trip across will be delicious ' -- lady kirkbank give a faint groan -- ` and in the second place i be die to see brittany ' ' i doubt if you will highly appreciate st malo it be a town of many and various smell ' ` but i want to smell those foreign smell of which one hear much at least it be a experience we need not be on shore any longer than we like and i want to see that fine rocky coast and chateaubriand 's tomb on the what be - its-name so nice to be bury in that way ' ` then you have set you heart on go to st malo and would not like any change in we plan ' ` any change will be simply detestable ' answer lesbium all the more decidedly since she suspect a desire for change on the part of mr smithson she be in no amiable humor this afternoon all she nerve seem strain to they utmost tension she be irritated tremulous with nervous excitement incline to hate everybody horace smithson most of all in she cabin a little later on when she be change she gown for dinner and kibble be somewhat slow and clumsy in the lacing of the bodice she wrench herself from the girl 's hand fling herself into a chair and burst into a flood of passionate tear ' o god that i be on one of those island in the caribbean sea -- a island where european never come -- where i might lie down among the poisonous tropical flower and sleep the rest of my day away i be sick to death of my life here of the yacht the people -- everything ' ` this air be too relaxing lady lesbium ' the girl murmur soothingly ` and you do not have you natural rest last night shall i get you a nice strong cup of tea ' ` tea no i have be live upon tea for the last twenty-four hour i have eat nothing my mouth be parch and burn oh kibble ' fling she head upon the girl 's buxom arm and let it rest there ` what a happy creature you be -- not a care -- not a care ' ` i be sure you can not have any care lady lesbium ' say kibble with a incredulous smile try to smooth the disorder hair anxious to make haste with the unfinished toilet for it be within a few minute of eight ' i be full of care i be in debt -- horribly in debt -- get deeper and deeper every day -- and i be go to sell myself to the only man who can pay my debt and give I fine house and finery like this ' pluck at the _ crépe de chine _ gown with its flossy fringe its delicate lace a marvel of artistic expenditure a garment which look simplicity itself and yet be so cleverly contrived as to cost five-and-thirty guinea the greatest effect in it require to be study with a microscope ` but surely dear lady lesbium you will not marry mr smithson if you do not love he ' ` do you suppose love have anything to do with marriage in society ' ` oh lady lesbia it would be so unkind to he so cruel to yourself ' ` cruel to myself yes i be cruel to myself i have the chance of happiness a year ago and i lose it i have the chance of happiness now -- yes of consummate bliss -- and have not the courage to snatch at it take off this horrid gown kibble my head be splitting : i sha not go to dinner ' ` oh lady lesbium you be tread on the pearl embroidery ' remonstrate poor kibble as lesbium kick the new gown from under she foot ` what do it matter ' she exclaim with a bitter little laugh ` it have not be pay for -- perhaps it never will be ' the dinner be silent and gloomy it be as if a star have be suddenly blot out of the sky smithson ordinarily so hospitable have be too much disturb in mind to ask any of he friend to stay to dinner so there be only lady kirkbank who be too tired to be lively and montesma who be incline to be thoughtful lesbium 's absence and the idea that she be ill give the feast almost a funereal air after dinner smithson and montesma sit on deck smoking they cigar and lazily watch the light on sea and the light on shore these brilliant in the foreground those dim in the distance ` you can telegraph to you rio janeiro friend to-morrow morning if you like ' say smithson presently ` and tell he to send a first-rate skipper and crew lady lesbium have make up she mind to see st malo regatta and with such a sacred charge i can not be too careful ' ` i 'll wire before eight o'clock to-morrow ' answer montesma ` you have decide wisely you respectable english wilkinson be a excellent man -- but nothing would surprise I less than he reduce you _ cayman _ to matchwood in the next gale ' chapter xl a note of alarm that strange scene in the old house at fellside make a profound impression upon lord hartfield he try to disguise he trouble and do all in he power to seem gay and at perfect ease in he wife 's company but he mind be full of anxiety and mary love he too well to be for a moment in doubt as to he feeling ` there be something wrong jack ' she say while they be breakfast at a table in the verandah with the lake and the bill in front of they and the sweet morning air around they ` you try to talk and to be lively but there be a little perpendicular wrinkle in you forehead which i know as well as the letter of the alphabet and that little line mean worry i use to see it in the old day when you be break you heart for lesbium why can not you be frank and confide in I it be you duty sir as my husband ' ` be it my duty to halve my burden as well as my joy how do i know if those girlish shoulder be strong enough to bear the weight of they ' ' i can bear anything you can bear and i will not be cheat out of my share in you worry if you be oblige to have a tooth out i would have one out too for company ' ' i hope the dentist would be too conscientious to allow that ' ` tell I you trouble hartfield ' she say earnestly lean across the table bring she grave intelligent face near to he they be quite alone he and she the servant have do they minister behind they there be the empty dining-room in front of they the sunlit panorama of lake and hill there could not be a safer place for tell secret ` tell I what it be that worry you ' mary plead again ' i will dear after all perfect trust be the best nay it be you due for you be brave enough and true enough to be trust with secret that mean life and death in a word then mary the cause of my trouble be that old man we see the other night ' ` steadman 's uncle ' ` do you really believe that he be steadman 's uncle ' ` my grandmother tell I so ' answer mary redden to the root of she hair to this girl who be the soul of truth there be deepest shame in the idea that she kinswoman the woman whom of all the world she most owe reverence and honor could be deem capable of falsehood ` do you think my grandmother would tell I a untruth ' ' i do not believe that man be a poor dependent a old servant 's kinsman sheltered and care for in this house for charity 's sake forgive I mary if i doubt the word of one you love but there be position in life in which a man must judge for himself would mr steadman 's kinsman be lodge as that old man be lodge would he talk as that old man talk and last and greatest perplexity of all would he possess a treasure of gold and jewel which must be worth many thousand ' ` but you can not know for certain that those thing be valuable they may be rubbish that this poor old man have scrape together and hoard for year glass jewel buy at country fair those rouleaux may contain lead or copper ' ' i do not think so mary the stone have all the brilliancy of valuable gem and then there be other in the finest filagree setting -- goldsmith 's work which bear the stamp of a eastern world take my word for it that treasure come from indium and it must have be bring to england by lord maulevrier it may have exist all these year without you grandmother 's knowledge that be quite possible but it seem to I impossible that such wealth should be within the knowledge and the power of a pauper lunatic ' ` but if that unhappy old man be not a relation of steadman 's support here by my grandmother 's benevolence who can he be and why be he here ' ask mary ` oh molly dear these be two question which i can not answer and which yet ought to be answer somehow since that night i have feel as if there be a dark cloud lower over this house -- a cloud almost as terrible in its menace of danger as the forshadowing of fate in a greek legend for you sake for the honor of you race for my own self-respect as you husband i feel that this mystery ought to be solve and all dark thing make light before you grandmother 's death when she be go the master-key to the past will be lose ' ` but she will be spare for many year i hope spare to sympathise with my happiness and with lesbium 's ' my dearest girl we can not hope that the thread of she life be worn very thin it may snap at any moment you can not look seriously in you grandmother 's face and yet delude yourself with the hope that she have year of life before she ' ` it will be very hard to part just as she have begin to care for I ' say mary with she eye full of tear ` all such parting be hard and you grandmother 's life have be so lonely and joyless that the memory of it must always have a touch of pain one can not say of she as we can of the happy she have live she life -- all thing have be give to she and she fall asleep at the close of a long and glorious day for some reason which i can not understand lady maulevrier 's life have be a prolonged sacrifice ' ` she have always give we to understand that she be fond of fellside and that this secluded life suit she ' say mary meditatively ' i can not help doubt she sincerity on that point lady maulevrier be too clever a woman and forgive I dear if i add too worldly a woman to be content to live out of the world the bird must have chafe its breast against the bar of the cage many and many a time when you think that all be peace be sure mary that you grandmother have a powerful motive for spend all she day in this place and i can but think that the old man we see the other night have some part in that motive do you remember tell I of she ladyship 's vehement anger when she hear you have make the acquaintance of she pensioner ' ` yes she be very angry ' mary answer with a troubled look ' i never see she so angry -- she be almost beside herself -- say the harshest thing to I -- talk as if i have do some dreadful mischief ' ` would she have be so move do you think unless there be some fatal secret involve in that man 's presence here ' ' i hardly know what to think tell I everything what be it that you fear -- what be it that you suspect ' ` to tell you my fear and suspicion be to tell you a family secret that have be keep from you out of kindness all the year of you life -- and i hardly think i could bring myself to that if i do not know what the world be and how many good-natured friend lady hartfield will meet in society by-and-by ready to tell she by hint and inuendo that she grandfather the governor of madras come back to england under a cloud of disgrace ' ` my poor grandfather how dreadful ' exclaimed mary pale with pity and shame ` do he deserve he disgrace poor unhappy creature -- or be he the victim of false accusation ' ' i can hardly tell you that mary any more than i can tell whether warren hasting deserve the abuse that be wreak upon he at one time or

lord hartfield ' i be here to ask you to help I to find out the antecedent of a man who hail from that island ' ' i ought to know something about he whoever he be ' reply mr fitzpatrick briskly ' i

have be thoroughly sift i can vouch for they ' he look at the index find the page and hand the book to lord hartfield ` read for yourself ' he say quietly lord hartfield read three or four page of plain statement as to various adventure by sea and land in which gomez de montesma have figure and the reputation which he bear in cuba and on the main ` you can vouch for this ' he say at last after a long silence ` for every syllable ' ` the story of he marriage ' ` gospel truth : i know the lady ' ` and the rest ' ` all true ' ' a thousand thanks i know now upon what ground i stand i have to save a innocent high-bred girl from the clutch of a consummate scoundrel ' ` shoot he and shoot she too if there be no better way of save she it will be a act of mercy ' say mr fitzpatrick without hesitation chapter xlii ` shall it be ' while lord hartfield sit in he friend 's office in great george street read the life story of gomez de montesma tell with the cruel precision and the unvarnished language of a criminal indictment the hero of that history be glide round the spacious ballroom of the cowe club with lady lesbium haselden 's dark-brown head almost recline on he shoulder she violet eye look up at he every now and then shyly entrancingly as he bent he head to talk to she the squadron ball be in full swing between midnight and the first hour of morning the flower have not lose they freshness the odour of dust and feverish human breath have not yet polluted the atmosphere the window be open to the purple night the purple sea the star seem to be close outside the verandah shine on purpose for the dancer and these two -- the man tall pale dark with flash eye and short sleek raven hair small head noble bear the girl divinely lovely in she marble purity of complexion she classical grace of form -- these two be as every one avowed and acknowledge the handsomest couple in the room ` we be none of we in it compare with they ' say a young naval commander to he partner whereupon the young lady look somewhat sourly and reply that lady lesbium 's feature be undeniably regular and she complexion good but that she be want in soul ` be she ' ask the sailor incredulously ` look at she now what do you call that if it be not soul ' ' i call it simply disgraceful ' answer he partner sharply turn away she head lesbium be look up at the spaniard she lip faintly part all she face listen eagerly as she catch some whisper word breathe among the soft ripple of she hair from lip that almost touch she brow people can not go on waltz for ten minute in a dead silence like automatic dancer there must be conversation only it be better that the lip should do most of the talk when the eye have so much to say society be apt to be censorious mr smithson be smoke a cigarette on the lawn with a sport peer a man to whom tobacco be a necessity can not be always on guard but it be quite possible that in the present state of lady lesbium 's feeling smithson would have have no restrain influence have he be ever so watchful to what act in the passion drama have she love come to-night as she float round the room with she head inclined towards she lover 's breast the strong pulsation of he heart sound in she ear like the rhythmical beat of the bass yonder in waldteufel 's last waltz be there still the uncertainty as to the _ denouement _ which mark the third act of a good play or be there the dread forebode the sense of impend doom which should stir the spectator with pity and terror as the fourth act hurry to its passionate close who could tell she have be full of life and energy to-day on board the yacht during the racing in which she seem to take a ardent interest the _ cayman _ have follow the racer for three hour through a freshen sea much to lady kirkbank 's disgust and lesbium have be the soul of the party the same yesterday the yacht have only get back to cowe in time for the ball and all have be hurry and excitement while the lady dress and cross to the club the spray dashing over they opera mantle poor lady kirkbank 's complexion yellow with _ mal de mer _ in spite of a double coating of _ blanc de fedora _ the last fashionable cosmetic to-night lesbium be curiously silent depressed even as it seem to those who be interested in observe she and all the world be interested in a famous beauty she be very pale even she lip be colourless and the large violet eye and firmly pencil brow alone give color to she face she look like a marble statue the eye and eyebrow accentuate with touch of color those lovely eye have a heavy look as of trouble weariness nay absolute distress never have she look less brilliant than to-night never have she look more beautiful it be the loveliness of a newly-awakened soul the wonderful pandora-casket of life with its infinite evil its little good have give up its secret she know what passionate love really mean she know what such love mostly mean -- self-sacrifice surrender of the world 's wealth severance from friend the breaking of all old tie to love as she love mean the cross of a river more fatal than the rubicon the casting of a die more desperate than that which caesar fling upon the board when he take up arm against the republic the river be not yet cross but she foot be on the margin wet with the ripple of the stream the fatal die be not yet cast but the dice-box be in she hand ready for the throw lesbium and montesma dance together -- not too often three waltz out of sixteen -- but when they be so waltz they be the cynosure of the room that bet of which maulevrier have hear be rife to-night and the odds upon the cuban have go up it be nine to four now that those two would be over the border before the week be out mr smithson be not neglectful of he affianced he take she into the supper-room where she drink some moselle cup but eat nothing he sit out three or four waltz with she on the lawn listen to the murmer of the sea and talk very little ` you be look wretchedly ill to-night lesbium ' he say after a dismal silence ' i be sorry that i should put you to shame by my bad look ' she answer with that keen acidity of tone which indicate irritated nerve ` you know that i do not mean anything of the kind you be always lovely always the loveliest everywhere but i do not like to see you so ghastly pale ' ' i suppose i be over-fatigued : that i have do too much in london and here life in westmoreland be very different ' she add with a sigh and a touch of wonder that the lesbium haselden whose methodical life have never be stir by a ruffle of passion could have be the same flesh and blood -- yes verily the same woman whose heart throb so vehemently to-night whose brain seem on fire ` be you sure there be nothing the matter ' he ask with a faint quiver in he voice ` what should there be the matter ' ` who can say god know that i know no cause for evil i be honest enough and faithful enough lesbium but you face to-night be like a presage of calamity like the dull livid sky that go before a thunderstorm ' ' i hope there be no thunderbolt come ' she answer lightly ` what very tall talk about a headache for really that be all that ail I hark they have begin my queen i be engage for this waltz ' ' i be sorry for that ' ` so be i i would ever so much rather have stay out here ' two hour later in the steely morning light when sea and land and sky have a metallic look as if light by electricity lady lesbium stand with she chaperon and she affianced husband on the landing stage belong to the club ready to step into the boat in which six swarthy seaman in red shirt and cap be to row they back to the yacht mr smithson draw the warm _ sortie de bal _ with its gold-coloured satin lining and white fox border closer round lesbium 's slender form ` you be shiver ' he say ` you ought to have warmer wrap ` this be warm enough for st petersburg i be only tired -- very tired ' ` the _ cayman _ will rock you to sleep ' don gomez be stand close by wait for he host the two man be to walk up the hill to formosa a village with a classic portico delightfully situate above the town ` what time be we to come to breakfast ask mr smithson ` not too early in mercy 's name two o'clock in the afternoon three four -- why not make it five -- combine breakfast with afternoon tea ' exclaimed lady kirkbank with a tremendous yawn ' i never be so thoroughly fag i feel as if i have be beat with stick bastus -- what be its name ' she be lean all she weight upon mr smithson as he hand she down the step and into the boat she normal weight be not a trifle and this morning she be heavy with champagne and sleep carefully as smithson support she she give a lurch at the bottom of the step and plunge ponderously into the boat which dip and careen under she whereat she shriek and implore mr smithson to save she all this occupy some minute and give lesbium and the cuban just time for a few word that have to be say somehow ` good-night ' say montesma as they clasp hand ` good-night ' and then in a lower voice he say ` well have you decide at last shall it be ' she look at he for a moment or so pale in the starlight and then murmur a almost inaudible syllable ` yes ' he bent quickly and press he lip upon she gloved hand and when mr smithson look round they two be stand apart montesma in a listless attitude as if tire of wait for he host it be smithson who hand lesbium into the boat and arrange she wrap and hang over she tenderly as he perform those small office ` now really ' he ask just before the boat put off ` when be we to be with you to-morrow ' ` lady kirkbank say not till afternoon tea but i think you may come a few hour earlier i be not at all sleepy ' ` you look as if you need sleep badly ' answer smithson ` i be afraid you be not half careful enough of yourself good-night ' the boat be glide off the oar dip as he speak how swiftly it shoot from he ken flash in and out among the yacht where the lamp be burn dimly in that clear radiance of new-born day montesma give a tremendous yawn as he take out he cigar-case and he and mr smithson do not say twenty word between they during the walk to formosa where servant be sit up lamp burn a great silver tray with brandy soda liqueur coffee in readiness chapter xliii ` alas for sorrow be all the end of this ' lady kirkbank retire to she cabin directly she get on board the _ cayman _ ` good-night child i be more than half asleep ' she say ` and i think if there be to be a earthquake a hour hence i should hardly hear it go to you berth directly lesbia you look positively awful i have see girl look bad after ball before now but i never see such a spectre as you look this morning ' poor georgie 's own complexion leave something to be desire the _ blanc de fedora _ have be a brilliant success for the first two hour : after that the warm room begin to tell upon it and there come a greasiness then a streakiness and now all that be leave of a alabaster skin be a livid patch of purplish paint here and there upon a crow 's - foot ground the eyebrow too have give in and narrow line of vandyke brown meander down lady kirkbank 's cheek the frizzy hair have go altogether wrong and have a wild look suggestive of the witch in macbeth and the scraggy neck and poor old shoulder show every year of they age in the ghastly morning light lesbium wait in the saloon till lady kirkbank have bolt herself into she cabin and then she go up to the deck wrap in she satin-lined fur-bordered cloak and coil herself in a bamboo arm-chair and nestle she bare head into a turkish pillow and try to sleep there with the cool morning breeze blow upon she burning forehead and the plish-plash of seawater soothing she ear there be only three or four sailor on deck weird almost diabolical-looking creature lesbia think in striped shirt with bare arm of a shine bronze complexion flash black eye sleek raven hair a sinister look what species of man they be -- mestizo coolie yucateke -- she know not but she feel that they be something wild and strange and they presence fill she with a vague fear _ he _ whose influence now rule she life have tell she that these man be bear mariner and that she be twenty time safer with they than when the yacht have be under the control of those honest grin red-whiskered english jack tar but she like the english sailor best all the same and she shrink from the faintest contact with these tawny-visaged stranger pluck away the train of she gown as they pass she chair lest they should brush against she drapery on deck this morning with only those dark face near she have a sense of loneliness of helplessness of abandonment even unbidden the image of she home at grasmere flash into she mind -- all thing so calm so perfectly order such a sense of safety of home -- no peril no temptation no fever -- only peace : and she have grow sick to death of peace she have pray for tempest : and the tempest have come there be a heavenly quiet in the air in the early summer morning only the creaking of a spar the scream of a seagull now and then how pale the lamp be grow on board the yacht paler still yellow and dim and blur yonder in the town the eastward face window be golden with the rise sun yes this be morning the yacht be move away yonder majestical swan-like white sail shine against the blue she close she eye and try to sleep but sleep would not come she be always listen -- listen for the dip of oar listen for a snatch of melody from a mellow baritone whose every accent she know so well it come at last the sound she soul long for she lay among she cushion with closed eye listen drinking in those rich ripe note as they come nearer and nearer to the measure of dip oar _ ` la donna e mobile -- ' _ nearer and nearer until the little boat ground against the hull she lift she heavy eyelid as montesma leap over the gunwale almost into she arm he be at she side kneel by she low chair kiss the little hand chill with the freshness of morning ` my own my very own ' he murmur passionately he care no more for those copper-faced helot yonder than if they have be make of wood he have fate in he own hand now as it seem to he he go to the skipper and give he some order in spanish and then the sail be unfurl the _ cayman _ spread she broad white wing and move off among those other yacht which be glide glide glide out to sea melting from cowe road like a vision that fadeth with the broad light of morning when the sail be up and the yacht be run merrily through the water montesma go back to lady lesbium and they two sit side by side gilded and glorified in the vivid light of sunrise talk as they have never talk before she head upon he shoulder a smile of ineffable peace upon she lip as of a weary child that have find rest they be sail for havre and at havre they be to be marry by the english chaplain and from havre they be to sail for the havana and to live there ever afterwards in a fairy-tale dream of bliss break only by a annual visit to pari just to buy gown and bonnet surrender be all lesbium 's ambitious hope -- forget -- go she desire to reign princess paramount in the kingdom of fashion -- she thirst to be wealthiest among the wealthy -- go -- forget she dream now be of the _ dolce far niente _ of a tropical climate a boudoir give on the caribbean sea cigarette coffee night spend in a foreign opera house the languid reposeful existence of a spanish dama -- with he with he it be for he sake that she have modify all she idea of life to be with he she would have be content to dwell in the tent of the patagonian on the wild and snow-clad pampas a love which be strong enough to make she sacrifice duty the world she fair fame as a well-bred woman be a love that reck but little of the path along which she lover 's hand be to lead for he to be with he she renounce the world the rest do not count the summer hour glide past they the _ cayman _ be far out at sea all the other yacht have vanish and they be alone amidst the blue with only a solitary three-master yonder on the edge of the horizon more than once lesbium have talk of go below to change she ball gown for the attire of everyday life but each time she lover have detain she a little longer have plead for a few more word lady kirkbank would be astir presently and there would be no more solitude for they till they be marry and could shake she off altogether so lesbia stay and those two drink the cup of bliss hush by the monotonous sing-song of the sea the rhythm of the swing sail but now it be broad morning the hour when society however late it may keep its revel overnight be apt to awaken be it only to call for a cup of strong tea and to turn again on the pillow of lassitude after that refreshment like the sluggard of holy writ at ten o'clock the sun send he golden arrow across the silken coverlet of she berth and awaken lady kirkbank who open she eye and look about languidly the little cabin be heave itself up and down in a curious way mr smithson 's cigar-case be slope as if they be go to fall upon lady kirkbank 's couch and the looking-glass with all its dainty appliance be make a angle of forty-five degree there be more swirl and wash of water against the hull than ever georgie kirkbank have hear in cowe road ` mercy on I this horrid thing must be move ' she exclaim to the empty air ` it must have break loose in the night ' she have no confidence in those savage-looking sailor and she have a vision of the yacht drift at the mercy of wind and wave drift for day week and month drift to the german ocean drift to the north pole mr smithson and montesma on shore -- no one on board to exercise authority over those fearful man perhaps they have mutiny and be carry off the yacht as they booty with lesbium and she chaperon and all they gown ' i be almost glad that harpy seraphine have my diamond ' thought poor georgie ` or i should have have they with I on board this hateful boat ' and then she rap vehemently against the panel of the cabin and scream for rilboche whose den be adjacent rilboche who detest the sea make she appearance after some delay look even greener than she mistress who in rise from she berth already begin to suffer the agony of sea-sickness ` what do this mean ' exclaimed lady kirkbank ` and where be we go ' ` that be what i should like to know my lady but i daresay lady lesbium and mr montesma can tell you they be both on deck ' ` montesma why we leave he on shore ' ` yes my lady but he come on board at five o'clock this morning i look at my watch when i hear he land and he and lady lesbium have be sit on deck ever since ' ` and now it be ten five hour on deck -- impossible ' ` time do not seem long when one be happy my lady ' murmured rilboche in she own language ` help I to dress this instant ' scream she mistress : ` that dreadful spaniard be elope with we ' despite the hideous depression of that malady which strike down kaiser and beggar with the same rough hand lady kirkbank contrived to get herself dress decently and to stagger up the companion to that part of the deck where the persian carpet be spread and the bamboo chair and table be set out under the striped awning lesbium and she lover be sit together he give she a first lesson in the art of smoking a cigarette he have tell she playfully that every man woman and child in cuba be a smoker and she have besought he to let she begin and now with infinite coquetry be take she first lesson ` you shameless minx ' exclaim georgie pale with anger ` where be smithson -- my poor good smithson ' ` fast asleep in he bed at formosa i hope dear lady kirkbank ' the cuban answer with perfect _ sing froid _ ` smithson be out of it as you idiomatic english say i hope lady kirkbank you will be as kind to I as you have be to smithson and depend upon it i shall make lady lesbium as good a husband as ever smithson could have do ' ` you

it that montesma 's wife will know none of the pang of poverty ' ` if you be a beggar i would not care ' say lesbium draw nearer to he they have both rise at lady kirkbank 's approach and be stand side by side confront she lesbium have shrink from the idea of poverty with john hammond yet for this man 's sake she be ready to face penury ruin disgrace anything ` do you mean to tell I that lord maulevrier 's sister a young lady under my charge answerable to I for she conduct be capable of jilt the man to whom she have solemnly bind herself in order to marry you ' demand lady kirkbank turn to montesma ` yes that be what i be go to do ' answer lesbium boldly ` it would be a greater sin to keep my promise than to break it i never like that man and you know it you badger I into accept he

it be not enough for he to cheat at card to float bubble company bogus lottery he profligate extravagance he love of sybarite luxury require a larger resource than the petty scheme which enrich smaller man a slave ship which could earn nearly twenty thousand pound on every voyage and which could make two run in a year -- that be the trade for don gomez de montesma and he carry it on merrily for six or seven year till the british cruiser get too keen for he and the good old game be play out you see that scar upon the hilalgo 's forehead lesbium -- a token of knightly prowess you think perhaps no my girl that be the mark of a english cutlass in a scuffle on board a slaver a merry trade lesbium -- the live cargo stow close under hatch have rather a bad time of it now and then -- short ration of food and water yellow jack they die like rotten sheep sometimes -- bad then for the dealer but if he can land the bulk of he human wares safe and sound the profit be enormous the

have come love but it leave I not the less you true lover ' she look at he with wild despair eye and then with a hoarse strange cry rush from the cabin and up the companion with a desperate swiftness which seem like the flight of a bird montesma hartfield maulevrier all follow she heedless of everything except the dire necessity of arrest she flight each in he own mind have divine she purpose they be not too late it be hartfield 's strong arm that catch she hold she as in a vice drag she away from the edge of the deck just where there be a space open to the wave another instant and she would have fling herself overboard she fall back into lord hartfield 's arm with a wild choke cry : ` let I go let I go ' another moment and a flood of crimson stain he shirt-front as she lay upon he breast with closed eyelid and blood-bedabbled lip in bless unconsciousness they carry she on to the steam-yacht and down to the cabin where there be ample accommodation and some luxury although not the elegance of bond street upholstery rilboche lady kirkbank kibble luggage of all kind be transfer from one yacht to the other even to the vellum bind keat which lay face downward on the deck just where lesbium have fling it when the _ cayman _ be board the crew of the steam-yacht _ philomel _ help in the transfer : there be plenty of hand and the work be do quickly while the meztizo yucateke carib or whatever they be look on and grin and while montesma stand lean against the mast with fold arm and sombre brow a cigarette between he lip when the woman and all they belongings be on board the _ philomel _ lord hartfield address himself to montesma ` if you consider yourself entitle to call I to account for this evening 's work you know where to find I ' he say montesma shrug he shoulder and throw away he cigarette with a contemptuous gesture _ ` ce n'est pas la peine ' _ he say ' i be a dead shot and should be pretty sure to send a bullet through you if you give I the chance but i should not be any nearer win she if i kill you : and it be she and she only that i want you may think I a adventurer -- swindler -- gambler -- slave-dealer -- what you will -- but i love she as i never think to love a woman and i should have be true as steel if she have be plucky enough to trust I but as i tell she a hour ago woman have not lion heart they can talk tall while the sky be clear and the sun shine but at the first crack of thunder -- _ va te promener _ ' ` if you have kill she -- ' begin hartfield ` kill she no some small bloodvessel burst in the agitation of that terrible scene she will be well in a week and she will forget I but i shall not forget she she be the one flower that have spring on the barren plain of my life she be my picciolum ' he turn he back on lord hartfield and walk to the other end of the deck something in he face in the vibration of he deep voice convinced hartfield of he truth a bad man undoubtedly -- steep to the lip in evil -- and yet so far true that he have passionately deeply devotedly love this one woman it be the dead of night when lesbium recover consciousness and even then she lay silent take no heed of those around she in a state of utter prostration kibble nurse she carefully tenderly all through the night maulevrier hardly leave the cabin and lady kirkbank always more or less a victim to the agony of sea-sickness still find time to utter lamentation and wailing over the ruin of she protégée 's fortune ` never have a girl such a chance ' she moan ` quite the best match in society the house in park lane alone cost a fortune she diamond would have be the finest in london ' ` they would have be stain with the blood of the nigger he trade in out yonder ' answer maulevrier ` do you think i would have let my sister marry a slave-dealer ' ' i do not believe a syllable of it ' protest lady kirkbank dab she brow with a handkerchief steep in eau de cologne ' a vile fabrication of montesma 's who want to blacken poor smithson 's character in order to extenuate he own crime ' ` well we will not go into that question ' say maulevrier wearily ` the smithson match be off anyhow and it matter very little to we whether he make most money out of nigger or bubble company or lottery or gaming hell ' ' i be convince that smithson make he fortune in a thoroughly gentlemanlike manner ' argue lady kirkbank ` look at the people who visit he and the house he go to and i do not see why the match need be off i be sure if lesbium play she card properly he will look over this -- this -- little escapade ' maulevrier contemplate the worldly old face with infinite scorn ` do she look like a girl who will play she card in you fashion ' he ask point to he sister whose white face upon the pillow seem like a mask cut out of marble ` upon my soul lady kirkbank i consider my sister 's elopement with this spanish adventurer with whom she be over head and ear in love a far more respectable act than she engagement to smithson for whom she care not a straw ' ` well i hope if you so approve of she conduct you will help she to pay she dressmaker and the rest of they ' retort lady kirkbank ` she have be plunge rather deeply i believe under the impression that smithson would pay all she bill when she be marry you grandmother may not quite like the budget ' ' i will do all i can for she ' answer maulevrier ' i would do a great deal to save she from the degradation to which you teaching have bring she ' lady kirkbank look at he for a moment or so with reproachful eye and then shrug she shoulder contemptuously ` if i ever expect gratitude from people i might feel the injustice -- the insolence -- of you last remark ' she say ` but as i never do expect gratitude i be not disappoint in this case and now i think if there be a cabin which i can have to myself i should like to retire to it ' she add ` my care be throw away here ' there be a cabin at lady kirkbank 's disposal it have be already appropriate by rilboche and smell of cognac but rilboche resign she berth to she mistress and lay herself meekly on the floor for the rest of the voyage they be in cowe road at eight o'clock next morning and lord hartfield go on shore for a doctor whom he bring back before nine and who pronounce lady lesbium to be in a very weak and prostrate condition and forbid she be move within the next two day happily lord hartfield have borrow the _ philomel _ and she crew from a friend who have give he _ carte blanche _ as to the use he make of she and who freely leave she at he disposal so long as he and he party should need the accommodation lesbium could nowhere be better off than on the yacht where she be away from the gossip and tittle-tattle of the town the roadstead be quiet enough now all the racing yacht have melt away like a dream and most of the pleasure yacht be off to ryde lady lesbium lay in she curtained cabin with kibble keep watch beside she bed while maulevrier come in every half-hour to see how she be -- sit by she a little now and then and talk of indifferent thing in a low kind voice which be full of comfort she seem grateful for he kindness and smile at he once in a way with a piteous little smile but she have the air of one in whom the mainspring of life be break the pallid face and heavy violet eye the semi-transparent hand which lay so listlessly upon the crimson coverlet convey a impression of supreme despair hartfield look down at she for the last time when he come to say good-bye before leave for london be remind of the story of one whose life have be thus rudely break who have love as foolishly and even more fondly and for whom the world hold nothing when that tie be sever ` she look on many a face with vacant eye on many a token without know what she see they watch she without ask why and reck not who around she pillow sit ' but lesbia haselden belong to a wider and more sophisticated world than that of the daughter of the grecian isle and for she existence offer wider horizon it might be prophesy that for she the dark ending of a girlish dream would not be a life-long despair the passionate love have be at fever point the passionate grief must have its fever too and burn itself out ` do all you can to cheer she ' say lord hartfield to maulevrier ` and bring she to fellside as soon as ever she be strong enough to bear the journey you and kibble with you own man will be able to do all that be necessary ' ` quite able ' ` that be right i must be in the house for the expect division to-night and i shall go back to grasmere to-morrow morning poor mary be horribly lonely ' lord hartfield go off in the boat to catch the southampton steamer and maulevrier be now sole custodian of the yacht and of he sister he and the doctor have agree to keep she on board in the fresh sea air till she be equal to the fatigue of the journey to grasmere there be nothing to be gain by take she on to the island or by carry she to london the yacht be well find provide with all thing needful for comfort and lesbium could be nowhere better off until she be safe in she old home : -- that home she have leave so gaily in the freshness of she youthful inexperience nearly a year ago and to which she would return so battered and break so deeply degrade by the knowledge of evil lady kirkbank have start for london on the previous day ' i be evidently not want _ here _ ' she say with a offended air ` and i must have everything at kirkbank ready for a house full of people before the twelfth of August so the sooner i get to scotland the better i shall make a _ détour _ in order to go and see lady maulevrier on my way down it be due to myself that i should let she know that _ i _ be entirely blameless in this most uncomfortable business ' ` you can tell she ladyship what you please ' answer maulevrier bluntly ' i shall not gainsay you so long as you do not slander my sister but as long as i live i shall regret that i know something of london society do not interfere to prevent lesbium be give over to you keep ' ` if i have know the kind of girl she be i would have have nothing to do with she ' retort lady kirkbank with exasperation and so they part the _ philomel _ have be lie off cowe three day before mr smithson appear upon the scene he have get wind somehow from a sailor who have talk with one of the foreign crew of the destination of the _ cayman _ and he have cross from southampton to havre on the steamer _ wolf _ during that night in which lesbium have be carry back to cowe on the _ philomel _ he be at havre when the _ cayman _ arrive with montesma and he tawny-visaged crew on board no one else ` you may examine every corner of you ship ' montesma cry scornfully when smithson come on board and swear that lesbium must be hide somewhere in the vessel ` the bird have fly : she will shelter in neither you nest nor in mine smithson you have lose she -- and so have i we may as well be friend in misfortune ' he be haggard livid with grief and anger he look ten year older than he have look the other night at the ball when he dash and swagger and handsome spanish head have be the admiration of the room smithson be very angry but he be not a fight man he have enjoy various opportunity for distinguish himself in that line in the island of cuba but he have always avoid such opportunity so now after a good deal of bluster and violent language which montesma take as lightly as if it have be the whistling of the wind in the shroud poor smithson calm down and allow gomez de montesma to leave the yacht with he portmanteau unharmed he mean to take the first steamer for the spanish main he tell smithson he have have quite enough of europe ' i daresay it will end in you marry she ' he say at the last moment ` if you do be kind to she ' he voice falter choke by a sob at those last word after all it be possible for a man without principle without morality to begin to make love to a woman in a mere spirit of adventure in sheer devilry and to be rather hard hit at the last horace smithson sail he yacht back to cowe without loss of time and send he card to lord maulevrier on board the _ philomel _ he lordship reply that he would wait upon mr smithson that afternoon at four o'clock and at that hour maulevrier again board the _ cayman _ but this time very quietly as a expect guest the interview that follow be very painful mr smithson be willing that this unhappy episode in the life of he betrothed this folly into which she have be beguile by a man of infinite treachery a man of all other man fatal to woman should be forget should be as if it have never be ` it be she very innocence which make she a victim to that scoundrel ' say smithson ` she girlish simplicity and lady kirkbank 's folly but i love you sister too well to sacrifice she lightly lord maulevrier and if she can forget this midsummer madness why so can i ' ` she can not forget mr smithson ' answer maulevrier gravely ` she have do you a great wrong by listen to you false friend 's address but she do you a still greater wrong when she accept you as she husband without one spark of love for you she and you be both happy in have escape the degradation the deep misery of a loveless union i be glad -- yes glad even of this shameful escapade with montesma -- though it have drag she good name through the gutter -- glad of the catastrophe that have save she from such a marriage you be very generous in you willingness to forget my sister 's folly let you forgetfulness go a step further and forget that you ever meet she ' ` that can not be lord maulevrier she have ruin my life ' ` not at all a affair of a season ' answer maulevrier lightly ` next year i shall hear of you as the accept husband of some new beauty a man of mr smithson 's wealth -- and good nature -- need not languish in single blessedness ' with this civil speech lord maulevrier go back to the _ philomel 's _ gig and this be he last meeting with mr smithson until they meet a year later in the beaten track of society chapter xlv ` that fall arrest without all bail ' it be the beginning of August before lesbium be pronounced equal to the fatigue of a long journey and even then it be but the shadow of she former self which return to fellside the pale spectre of joy depart of trust deceive maulevrier have be very good to she patient unselfish as a woman in he minister to the broken-hearted girl that broken heart would be whole again no doubt in the future as many other broken heart have be but the grief the despair the sense of hopelessness and aimlessness in life be very real in the present if the picturesque seclusion of fellside have seem dull and joyless to lesbia in day go by it be much duller to she now she be shock at the change in she grandmother and she show a good deal of feeling and affection in she intercourse with the invalid but once out of she presence lady maulevrier be

deep of a passionate nature slave-dealer gambler adventurer liar -- he name blacken by the suspicion of a still darker crime she shudder at the thought of the villain from whose snare she have be

every other thought everybody be good to she that pale and joyless face that look of patient hopeless suffering which she try to disguise every now and then with a faint forced smile and silvery little ripple of society laughter seem unconsciously to implore pity and pardon lady maulevrier utter no word of reproach ` my dearest fate have not be kind to you ' she say gently after tell lesbium of lady kirkbank 's visit ` the handsomest woman be seldom the happiest destiny seem to have a grudge against they and if thing have go amiss it be i who be most to blame i ought never to have entrust

without care as to they surroundings which be full of trouble first there be lesbium 's sorrow grant that it be a grief which would inevitably wear itself out as other such grief have do from time immemorial but still the sorrow be there at they door next there be the state of lady maulevrier 's health which give she old medical adviser the gravest fear at lord hartfield 's earnest desire a famous doctor be summon from london but the great man could only confirm mr horton 's verdict the thread of life be wear thinner every day it might snap at any hour in the meantime the only regime be repose of body and mind a all-pervading calm the avoidance of all exciting topic one moment of violent agitation might prove fatal know this how could lord hartfield call she ladyship to account for the presence of that mysterious old man under steadman 's charge -- how venture to touch upon a topic which by mary 's showing have exercise a most disturbing influence upon she ladyship 's mind on that solitary occasion when the girl venture to approach the subject he feel that any attempt at a explanation be impossible it be not for he to precipitate lady maulevrier 's end by prying into she

death and lord and lady hartfield have the house to themselves since lesbium hardly count she seldom leave she own room except to sit with she grandmother for a hour she lay on she sofa -- or sit in a low arm-chair by the window reading keat or shelley -- or only dream -- dream over the brief golden time of she life with its fond delusion its false brightness mr horton go to see she every day -- feel the feeble little pulse which seem hardly to have force enough to beat -- urge she to struggle against apathy and inertia to walk a little to go for a long drive every day to live in the open air -- to which instruction she pay not the slightest attention the desire for life be go disappointed in she ambition betray in she love humiliate dupe degrade -- a social failure what have she to live for she feel as if it would have be a good thing quite the best thing that could happen if she could turn she face to the wall and die all that past season its triumph its pleasure its variety be like a garish dream a horror to look back upon hateful to remember in vain do mary and hartfield urge lesbium to join in they simple pleasure they walk and ride and drive and boat excursion she always refuse ` you know i never care much for roam about these everlasting hill ' she tell mary ' i never have you passion for lakeland it be very good of you to wish to have I but it be quite impossible i have hardly strength enough for a little walk in the garden ' ` you would have more strength if you go out more ' plead mary almost with tear ` mr horton say sun and wind be the best doctor for you lesbia you frighten I sometimes you be just let yourself fade away ' ` if you know how i hate the world and the sky mary you would not urge I to go out of door ' lesbium answer moodily ` indoors i can read and get away from my own thought somehow for a little while but out yonder face to face with the hill and the lake -- the scene i have know all my life -- i feel a heart-sickness that be worse than death it madden I to see that old old picture of mountain and water the same for ever and ever no matter what heart be break ' mary creep close beside she sister 's couch put she arm round she neck lay she cheek -- rich in the ruddy bloom of health -- against lesbium 's pallid and sunken cheek and comfort she as much as she could with tender murmur and loving kiss other comfort she could give none all the wisdom in the world will not cure a girl 's heart-sickness when she have fling away the treasure of she love upon a worthless object and so the day go by peacefully but sadly for the shadow of doom hang heavily over the house upon the fell nobody who look upon lady maulevrier could doubt that she day be number that the oil be wax low in the lamp of life the end the awful mysterious end be draw near and she who be call be make no such preparation as the christian make to answer the dread summons as she have live she mean to die -- a avowed unbeliever more than once mary have take courage and have talk to she grandmother of the world beyond the bless hope of re-union with the friend we have lose in a new and brighter life only to be meet by the sceptic 's cynical smile the materialist 's barren creed ` my dearest we know nothing except the immutable law of material life all the rest be a dream -- a beautiful dream if you like -- a consolation to that kind of temperament which can take comfort from dream but for anyone who have read much and think much and keep as far as possible on a level with the scientific intellect of the age -- for such a one mary these old fable be too idle i shall die as i have live the victim of a inscrutable destiny work blindly evil to some good to other ah love life have begin very fairly for you may the fate be kind always to my gentle and loving girl ' there be more talk between they on this dark mystery of life and death mary bring out she poor little argument glorified by the light of perfect faith but they be of no avail against opinion which have be the gradual growth of a long and joyless life time have attuned lady maulevrier 's mind to the gospel of schopenhauer and the pessimist and she be contented to see the mystery of life as they have see it she have no fear but she have some anxiety as to the thing that be to happen after she be go she have take upon herself a heavy burden and she have not yet come to the end of the road where she burden might be lay quietly down she task accomplish if she fall by the wayside under she load the consequence for the survivor might be full of trouble she

mistress 's room every morning receive she order answer she question but lady maulevrier feel that he go through the old duty in a mechanical way and that he dull brain but half understand they importance one evening at dusk just as hartfield and mary be leave lady maulevrier 's room after dinner a appalling shriek run through the house -- a cry almost as terrible as that which lord

we have not have a happy life though there be many who have envy we she ladyship 's favor ' she say in the midst of she lamentation ` no one know where the shoe pinch but those who have to wear it

less worry ' say the wife bend she face to kiss the cold dead brow ` he day be full of care we should have be happier in the poorest cottage in grasmere than we ever be in this big grand house ' thus in broken fragment of speech mr steadman lament over she dead while the heavy pendulum of the eight-day clock in the hall sound the slowly-passing moment until the come of the doctor break upon the quiet of the house with the noise of open door and approach footstep jame steadman be dead medicine could do nothing for that lifeless clay lie on the hearth by which he have sit on so many winter night for so many year of faithful unquestioning service there be nothing to be do for that stiffen form save the last office for the dead and lord hartfield leave mr horton to arrange with the weep woman as to the do of these he be anxious to go to lady maulevrier to break to she as gently as might be the news of she servant 's death and what of that strange old man in the upper room who be to

a calamity of dire import for he mistress maulevrier have be tell nothing of that scene with the strange old man -- the hidden treasure -- the anglo-indian phrase -- which have fill lord hartfield 's mind with the darkest doubt if that half-lunatic old man describe by lady maulevrier as a kinsman of steadman 's be verily the person lord hartfield believe he presence under that roof unguarded by a trust-worthy attendant be fraught with danger it would be for lady maulevrier helpless a prisoner to she sofa at death 's door to face that danger the very think of it might kill she and yet it be

door opposite she couch the handle turn slowly hesitatingly as if move by feeble finger and then the door be push slowly open and a old man come with shuffling footstep towards the one light spot in the middle of the room it be the old man lord hartfield have last see gloat over he treasury of gold and jewel -- the man whom maulevrier have never see -- whose existence for forty year have be hide from every creature in that house except lady maulevrier and the steadman until mary find she way into the old garden he come close up to the little table in front of lady maulevrier 's couch and look
