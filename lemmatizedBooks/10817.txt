notice of he mother or of anne anne have be at the manor five day and she have get use to jerrold 's mother 's caress all but one every now and then mr fielding 's hand would stray to the back of anne 's neck where the short curl black as she frock spring out in a thick bunch the finger stir among the root of anne 's hair stroke stroke lift the bunch and let it fall again and whenever they do this anne jerk she head away and hold it stiffly out of they reach she remember how she mother 's finger slender and silk-skinned and loving have do just that and how they touch go thrilling through the

it be much too hot here she say you might move the cushion down there under the beech-tree that eliot put it to himself be just she way of get out of it to eliot the irritating thing about he mother be she dexterity in get out she never lose she temper and never reply to any serious criticism she simply change the subject leave you with you disapproval on you hand in this eliot 's young subtlety

other in lot of time for _ not _ see each other ever again she sit stare mournfully see before she the agony of separation nonsense say jerrold why on earth should not you come out to india too i say that would be a lark would not it you would come would not you like a shot say anne would you give up you farm to come i would give up anything _ that be _ all right let 's go and play tennis they

be so happy john severn come to she do you ever see anything happier than that absurd boy she say why can not eliot be jolly and contented too like jerrold do not you think the chief reason may be

he have be practise with fury first scale then exercise then a pause and now he finger slip into the first movement of the waldstein sonata secretly mysteriously he begin then break sharply

to slog like blaze if you want to get on jerrold will not ever then oh yes he will _ he 'll _ get on all right because he _ do not _ care because work come so jolly easy to he he have not get to break he heart over it the trouble with colin be that he care awfully for such a lot of other thing we for instance he 'll leave off in the middle of a movement if he hear jerrold yell for he he ought to be able to chuck we all we be all of we in he way he ought to hate we he ought to hate jerrold worst of all adeline and john severn come round the corner of the terrace what be all this about hate he say

of tree like a comb long steep groin pack with tree-top rake neck hog-maned with stiff plantation slope that spread out fan-wise open wide wing a immense stretch and flatten of arc up to the straight blue wall on the horizon a band of tree stand up there like a hedge calm clean space emerge the bright sharp-cut pattern of the field square and fan and point triangle close fitted emerald green of the turnip yellow of the charlock lift high and clear red brown and pink and purple of ploughed land and fallow red gold of the wheat and white green of the barley shimmering in a wash of thin air where anne and jerrold sit green pasture bite smooth by the sheep flow down below they in long ridge like wave on the right the bright canary color charlock brim the field its flat vanilla and almond

auntie adeline after mother die i do not want to see she because she remind I -- and yet really i love she all the time you will not go back on I for it i would not go back on you whatever you do and you must not keep on think i _ want _ to go to indium i do not care a rap about indium itself i hate anglo-indian and i simply loathe hot place and daddy do not want I out there really i shall be much happier on my farm and it 'll save a lot of expense too just think what my outfit and passage would have cost you would not have care what it cost if -- there be not any if i be not lie really not lie not lie she would have give up more than indium to save jerrold that pang of memory only when it be all over and he have sail without she she realize in one wound flash that what she have give up be jerrold himself v eliot and anne i anne do not go back to she ilford farm at once adeline have make that impossible at the prospect of anne 's go she resentment die down as suddenly as it have rise she forget that anne have take she son ' affection and she place beside she husband 's deathb and though she could not help feeling rather glad that jerrold have go to indium without anne she be sorry for she she love she and she mean to keep she she say she simply could not bear it if anne leave she and _ be _ it the time to choose when she want she as she have never want she before she have nobody to turn to as anne know corbett and hawtrey and markham and people be all very well but they be outsider it be the inside people that i want now anne you be deep inside dear yes of course she have relation but relation be no use they be all wrap up in they own tiresome affair and there be not one of they she care for as she care for anne i could not care more if you be my own daughter darling robert feel about you just the same you _ can not _ leave I and anne do not she never could resist unhappiness she think : i be glad enough to stop with she through all the happy time i would be a perfect beast to go and leave she now when she be miserable and have not get anybody it would have be better for anne if she could have go robert fielding 's death and jerrold 's absence be two grief that inflamed each other they come together to make one immense intolerable wound and here at wyck she could not move without come upon something that touch it and sting it to fresh pain but anne be not like jerrold to turn from what she love because it hurt she for as long as she could remember all she happiness have come to she at wyck if unhappiness come now she have get as eliot say to take it and so she stay on through the autumn then over christmas to the new year this time because of colin who be suffer from depression colin have never get over he father 's death and jerrold 's go and the last thing jerrold have say to she before he go be you 'll look after col-col will not you do not let he go grouse about by himself jerrold have always expect she to look after colin at seventeen there be still something piteous and breakable about he something that cling to you for help eliot say that if colin do not look out he would be a regular neurotic but he own that anne be good for he i do not know what you do to he but he be better when you be there eliot be the one who appear to have recover first he meet the shock of he father 's death with a defiant energy and will he be work now at bacteriology under sir martin crozier cover with a white linen coat in a white-washed room of inconceivable cleanness surround by test-tube and mix jar eliot spend the best part of the day handle the germ of the deadliest disease make culture examine they under the microscope prepare vaccine he go home to the brown velvety leathery study in he welbeck street flat to write out he note or read some monograph on inoculation or he dine with a colleague and talk to he about bacterium at this period of he youth eliot have more than ever the appearance of inhuman preoccupation he dark serious face detach itself with a sort of sullen apathy from the social scene he seem to have no keen interest beyond he slide and mix jar and test-tube woman for whom he indifference have a perverse fascination say of he : dr fielding be not interested in people only in they disease and not really in disease only in they germ they never suspect that eliot be passionate and that a fierce pity have drive he into he profession the thought of preventable disease fill he with fury he have no tolerance for the society that tolerate it he suffer because he have a clearer vision and a profounder sense of suffering than most person up to the time of he father 's death all eliot 's suffering have be other people 's he could not rest till he have do something to remove the cause of it add to this a insatiable curiosity as to cause and you have the main bent of eliot 's mind and it seem to he that there be nobody but anne who see that hidden side of he _ she _ know that he be sorry for people and that be sorry for they have make he what he be like jerrold and yet unlike he eliot be attract to suffer by the same sensitiveness that make jerrold avoid everything once associate with it and so the very thing that jerrold could not bear to remember be what draw eliot closer to anne he see she as jerrold have see she moving compose and competent in he father 's room he see she stooping over he to help he he see the speck of blood on she white sleeve and he think of she with the more tenderness from that instant he really love she he want anne as he have never conceive himself want any woman he could hardly remember he first adolescent feeling for she that confuse mixture of ignorant desire and fear so different be it from the intense clear passion that possess he now at night when he work be do he lay in bed not sleep thinking of anne with desire that know itself too well to be afraid anne be the one thing necessary to he beside he work necessary as a living part of himself she could only not come before he work because eliot 's work come before himself and he own happiness when he go down every other week-end to wyck-on-the-hill he know that it be to see anne he mother know it too i wish eliot would marry she say why say anne because then he would not be so keen on go off to look for germ in disgusting climate anne wonder whether adeline know eliot for eliot talk to she about he work as he walk with she at a fine swinging pace over the open country take all he exercise now while he could get it that be another thing he like about anne severn she splendid physical fitness she could go stride for stride with he and mile for mile and never tire she mind too be robust and active and full of curiosity it listen by the hour and never tire it could move undismayed among horror she could see as he see the beauty of the long train of research by which sir martin crozier have track down the bacillus of amoebic dysentery and establish the difference between typhoid and malta fever once start on he subject the grave sullen eliot talk excitedly you do see anne how thrill it be do not you for I there be nothing but bacteriology i always mean to go in for it and sir martin 's magnificent absolutely top-hole you see all these disgusting disease can be prevent it be inconceivable that they should be tolerate in a civilized country people can not care a rap or they could not sleep in they bed they ought to get up and make a public row about it to insist on compulsory inoculation for everybody whether they like it or not it really be not enough to cure people of disease when they have get they we ought to see that they never get they that there be not any to get what we do not know yet be the complete behavior of all these bacterium among themselves a bad bacillus may be do good work by hold down a worse one it be conceivable that if we succeed in exterminate all known disease we might release a unknown one supremely horrible that would exterminate the race oh eliot how awful how can _ you _ sleep in you bed you need not worry it be only a nightmare idea of mine and so on and so on for he be still so young that he want anne to be excite by the thing that excite he and anne tell he all about she ilford farm and what she mean to do on it eliot do not behave like aunt adeline he listen beautifully like uncle robert and jerrold as if it be really most important that you should have a farm and work on it what i want be to sell it and get one here i do not want to be anywhere else i can not tell you how frightfully home-sick i be when i be away i keep on see those gable with the little stone ball and the peacock and the field down to the manor farm and the hill eliot when i be away i be always dream that i be try to get back to they and something stop I or i see they and they turn into something else i sha not be happy till i can come back for good you do not want to go to indium eliot 's heart begin to beat as he ask he question i want to work to work hard to work till i be so dead tired that i roll off to sleep the minute i get into bed so tired that i can not dream that be not right you be too young to feel like that anne i do feel like it you feel like it yourself -- my farm be to I what you old bacterium be to you oh if i think it be the farm -- why what else do you think it be eliot could not bring himself to tell she he take refuge in apparent irrelevance you know father leave I the manor farm house do not you no i do not i suppose he think you would want to come back like I well i be glad i have get it mother 's get the dower house in wyck but she 'll stay on here till -- till jerrold come back say anne bravely i do not suppose jerry 'll turn she out even then unless -- but neither he nor anne have the courage to say unless he marry not anne because she could not trust herself with the theme of jerrold 's marry not eliot because he have jerrold 's word for it that if he marry anybody ever it would not be anne \* \* \* \* \* it be this assurance that make it possible for he to say what he have be think of say all the time that he talk to anne about he bacteriology bacteriology be a screen behind which eliot uncertain of anne 's feeling sheltered himself against irrevocable disaster he mean to ask anne to marry he but he keep put it off because so long as he do not know for certain that she would not have he he be at liberty to think she would he would not be take she from jerrold jerrold inconceivable ass do not want she eliot have make sure of that month ago the night before jerrold sail he have simply put it to he : what do he mean to do about anne severn and jerrold have make it very plain that he chief object in go to indium be to get away from anne severn and everything eliot know jerrold too well to suspect he sincerity so he consider that the way be now honorably open to he he only uncertainty be anne herself he have mean to give she a year to forget jerrold in if she be ever go to forget he though in moment of deeper insight he realize that anne be not likely to forget nor to marry anybody else as long as she remember yet eliot reason woman do marry even remember they marry and be happy you see it every day he be content to take anne on she own term at any cost at any risk he have never be afraid of risk and once he have face the chance of she refusal all other danger be insignificant a year be a long time and eliot have to consider the probability of he go out to central africa with sir martin crozier to investigate sleep sickness he want the thing settle one way or another before he go he put it off again till the next week-end and in the meanwhile sir martin crozier have see he he be start in the spring and eliot be to go with he it be on Sunday evening that he speak to anne sit with she under the beech at the top of the field where she and jerrold have sit together eliot have choose he place badly i would not bother you so soon if i be not go away but i simply must -- must know -- must know what whether you care for I at all not much of course but just enough not to hate marry I anne turn she face full on he and look at he with she innocent candid eye and all she say be you _ do _ know about jerrold do not you oh god yes i know all about he he be why i can not i tell you i know all about jerrold he be not a good enough reason good enough for I not unless -- but he could not say it not unless he care for I that be why you be ask I then because you know he do not well it would not be much good if i know he do eliot it be awful of I to talk about it as if he would say he do he never say a word he never will i be afraid he will not anne do not imagine i ever think he would he never do anything to make I think it for a minute really be you quite sure he do not quite sure i make it all up out of my head my silly head i do not care what you think of I so long as you do not think it be jerry 's fault i should go on care for he whatever he do or do not do i know you would but it be possible -- to care for two people and marry one of they no matter which it be not possible for I if i can not have the person i want i will not have anybody it be not wise anne i tell you i could make you care for I i know all about you i know how you think and how you feel i understand you better than jerrold do you would be happy with I and you would be safe it be no use i would rather be unhappy and in danger if it be with jerrold you 'll be unhappy and in danger without he i do not care besides i sha not be i shall work you 'll work too it 'll be so exciting that you 'll soon forget all about I you know i sha not and i 'll never give you up unless jerrold get you eliot -- i only tell you about jerrold because i think you ought to know so that you might not think it be anything in you it be not something in I then tell I -- if it have not be for jerry do you think you might have care for I yes i do i quite easily might and i think it would be a jolly good thing if i could now only i can not i can not poor little anne do it comfort you to think i would have care if it have not be for jerry it do very much eliot -- you be the only person i can talk to about he do you mind tell I whether he say that to you or whether you just guess it what why that he would not -- ever -- i ask he anne because i have to know and he tell I i think he tell you yes he tell I but i be a cad for let you think he do not care for you i believe he do or that he would have care -- awfully -- if my father have not die just then you be in the room that day upset he if it have not be for that -- yes but there _ be _ that it be like he be when binky die and he could not stand yearp do not you remember how he would not let I go with he to see yearp because he say he do not want I mix up with it well -- i have be mix up that be all still anne i be certain he would have care -- if that be any comfort to you you do not make it up out of you dear little head we all think it father think it i believe he want it if he would only know she think : if he would only know how he have hurt she he who have never hurt anybody in all he beautiful life dear uncle robert there be no good talk about it i know the minute jerry say he do not want I to go to india with he be that why you do not go yes that be a mistake anne you should have go how could i after that and if i have he would only have keep away you should have let he go first and then go after he you should have turn up suddenly in wonderful clothes look cheerful and beautiful so that you wipe out the memory he funk as it be you have leave he nothing else to think of i daresay that be what i should have do but it be too late i can not do it now i be not so sure what go _ after _ jerrold hunt he down dress up and scheme to make he marry I yes yes yes eliot you know i could not you say once you would commit a crime for anybody you care about a crime yes but not that i would rather die you be too fastidious it be only the unscrupulous people who get what they want in this world they know what they want and go for it they stamp on everything and everybody that get in they way oh eliot dear i know what i want and i would go for it if only jerrold know too he would know if you show he and that be just what i can not do well do not say i do not give you the best possible advice against my own interest too it be sweet of you but you see how impossible it be i see how adorable you be you always be iv for the first

have be go about with he all my life and i never dream he would want to marry I what do you suppose he would want why nothing but just to go about as we always do you idiot i do not see why you should be so cross about it adeline sit down in the armchair at the head of the bed prepare to have it out with anne i suppose you think my son 's happiness be nothing to I do not it occur to you that if you refuse he he 'll stick for year in that awful place he be go to whereas if he have a wife in england there would be a chance of he come home now and then perhaps he would never go out again i be sorry auntie i can not marry eliot even to keep he in england even to please you even to save he life you mean you do not care if he die of some hideous tropical disease i care awfully but i can not marry

-- make a man mad about you by pretend to be he comrade and then throw he over i have have more man in love with I anne than you have see in you life but i never do _ that _ oh auntie what about father and you be engage to he well anyhow say adeline soften by the recollection i _ be _ engage she smile she enchanting smile and anne observe the breakdown of dignity get up off the bed and kiss

stay there two year investigate malaria and sleep sickness then he go on to the strait settlement and finally take a partnership in a practice at penang anne leave wyck at easter and return in August because of colin then she go back to she ilford farm the two year pass and in the spring of the third year nineteen fourteen she come again vi queenie i something awful have happen adeline have tell anne about it it seem that colin in he second year at cambridge when he should have give he whole mind to read for the diplomatic service have have the imprudence to get engage and to a girl that adeline have never hear of about whom nothing be know but that she be remarkably handsome and that she family -lrb- courthope of leicestershire -rrb- be in adeline 's brief phrase all right from the terrace they could see come up the lawn from the goldfish pond colin and he girl queenie courthope she come slowly she short russian skirt swing out from she ankle the brilliance of she face show clear at a distance vermilion on white flaming hard crystal eye sweeping and flash bob hair brown-red shine in the sun then a dominant squarish jaw and a mouth exquisitely form but thin a vermilion thread draw between she stare insolent nostril and the rise of she round chin this face in its approach express a profound arrogant indifference to adeline and anne only as it turn towards colin its grey-black eye lower and be soft dark under the black feather of they brow colin look back at it with a shy adoring tenderness queenie could be even more superbly uninterested than adeline in adeline 's self-absorption there be a passive innocence a candor that disarm you but queenie 's be insolent and hostile it take possession of the scene and challenge every comer hallo anne colin shout how do you get here motor down i say have you get a car only just drive yourself rather queenie scowl as if there be something disagreeable to she in the idea that anne should have a car of she own and drive it she endure the introduction in silence and address herself with a air of exclusiveness to colin what be we go to do anything you like he say i 'll play you singles then anne might like to play say colin but he still look at queenie as she flame in she beauty oh three 's a rotten game you can not play the two of we unless miss severn handicap I she will not do that anne could take we both on and play a decent game queenie pick up she racquet and stand between they beat she skirt with little stroke of irritated impatience she eye be fix on colin try you could see to dominate he we would better take it in turn he say thanks col-col i would rather not play i have drive ninety-seven mile really rather queenie back towards the court oh come on colin if you be come he go what do you think of queenie adeline say she be very handsome yes anne but it be not a nice face now be it anne could not say it be a nice face it be awful to think of colin be marry to it he be only twenty-one now and she be seven year older if it have be anybody but colin if it have be eliot or jerrold i should not have mind so much they can look after themselves he 'll never stand up against that horrible girl she do look terribly strong and cruel anne as if she might hurt he i do not want he to be hurt i can not bear she take he away from I my little col-coli do hope anne that if you would not have eliot -- i would have colin but auntie i be year older than he be he be a baby if he be a baby he 'll want somebody older to look after he queenie 's even better fit than i be then do you think anne she propose to colin no i should not think it be necessary i should say she be capable of anything my only hope be they 'll tire each other out before they be marry and break it off all afternoon on the tennis court below queenie play against colin she play vigorously excitedly savagely to win she could not hide she annoyance when he beat she what be i to do he say you do not like it when i beat you but if i be beat you would not like _ I _ ii adeline 's only hope be not realize they have not have time to tire of each other before the war break out and colin insist on marry before he join up they engagement have leave he nervous and unfit and he idea be that once marry he would present a better appearance before the medical examiner but after a month of queenie colin be more nervous and unfit than ever i can not think say adeline what that woman do to he she 'll wear he out so colin wait try to get fitter and afraid to volunteer lest he should be reject everybody around he be move rapidly queenie have take up motoring so that she could drive a ambulance car at the front anne have go up to london for she red cross training eliot have leave he practice to he partner at penang and have come home and join the army medical corps eliot home on leave for three day before he go out try hard to keep colin back from the war in eliot 's opinion colin be not fit and never would be fit to fight he be just behave as he always have behave rush forward try insanely to do the thing he never could do do you mean to say they will not pass I he ask oh they 'll pass you all right eliot say they 'll give you a expensive training and send you into the trench and in any time from a day to a month you 'll be in hospital with shell-shock then you 'll be discharge as unfit have waste everybody 's time and make a damned nuisance of yourselfus suppose i ought to say it be splendid of you to want to go out but it be not splendid it be idiotic you 'll be simply but in where you be not wanted take a better man 's place take a better man 's commission take a better man 's bed in a hospital i tell you we do not want man who be go to crumple up in they first action do you think i be go to funk then say poor colin funk oh lord no you 'll stick it till you drop till you be paralyzed till you have lose you voice and memory till you be a utter wreck there 'll be enough of 'em poor devil without you col-col but why should i go like that more than anybody else because you be make that way because you have not get a nervous system that can stand the racket the noise alone will do for you you 'll be as right as rain if you keep out of it but jerrold 's come back _ he _ 'll go out at once how can i stick at home when he be go heap of good work to be do at home not by man of my age by man of you nervous organization you go out would be sheer waste why not do it matter what become of I no it do not it matter though that you 'll be take a better man 's place now colin really do want to go out and fight as he have always want to follow jerrold 's lead he want it so badly that it seem to he a form of self-indulgence and this idea of take a better man 's place so work on he that he have almost decide to give it up since that be the sacrifice require of he when he tell queenie what eliot have say all i can say be say queenie that if you do not go out i shall give _ you _ up i have no use for man with cold foot can not you see say colin -lrb- he almost hate queenie in that moment -rrb- what i be afraid of be a damned nuisance that be what eliot say i 'll be i do not know how he know he do not know everything if _ my _ brother try to stop my go to the front i would jolly soon tell he to go to hell i swear colin if you back out of it i will not speak to you again i be not ask you to do anything i funk myself oh shut up i be go all right not because you have ask I but because i want to if you do not i should think you would feel pretty rotten when i be out with my field ambulance say queenie damn you field ambulance no i do not mean that old thing it be splendid of you to go but you would no business to suppose i funked i _ may _ funk nobody know till they have try but i be go all right till eliot put I off oh if you be put off as easily as all that -- she be intolerable she seem to think he be only go because she would shame he into it that evening he sing : ` what be you do all the day rendal my son what be you do all the day my pretty one ' he understand that song now ` what will you leave to you lover rendal my son what will you leave to you lover my pretty one a rope to hang she mother a rope to hang she mother ' go it col-col out on the terrace queenie laugh she harsh cruel laugh ` for i be sick to my heart and i fain would lie down ' ` i be sick to my heart and i fain would lie down ' queenie echo with clip word mock he he hate queenie and he love she at night at night she would unbend she would be tender and passionate she would touch he with quick hurry caress she would put she arm round he and draw he to she kissing and kissing and with she young beautiful body press tight to he with she mouth on he and she eye shine close and big in the darkness colin would forget iii dr cutler 's field ambulance british hospital antwerp _ September 20th 1914 _ dearest auntie adeline -- i have not be able to write before there be be a lot of fight all round here and we be frightfully busy get in wound and when you have do you be too tired to sit up and write letter you simply roll into bed and drop off to sleep sometimes we be out with the ambulance half the night you need not worry about I i be keep awfully fit i _ be _ glad now i have always live in the open air and play game and plough my own land my muscle be as hard as any tommie 's so be queenie 's you see we have to act as stretcher bearer as well as chauffeur you be not much good if you can not carry you own wounded queenie be simply splendid she really _ do not _ know what fear be and she be at she very best under fire it sort of excite she and buck she up i can not help see how fine she be though she be so beastly to poor old col-col before he join up but talk of the war bring out the best in people you should simply see she out here with the wound dr cutler -lrb- the commandant -rrb- think no end of she she drive for he and i drive for a little doctor man call dicky cartwright he be awfully good at he job and decent queenie do not like he i can not think why good-bye darling take care of yourself you loving anne antwerp _ October 3rd _ you ask I what i really think of queenie at close quarter well the quarter be very close and i know she simply hate I she be fearfully sick when she find we be both in the same corps she be always try to get up a row about something she have like to have I fire out of belgium if she could but i mean to stay as long as i can so i will not quarrel with she she can not do it all by herself and when i feel like go back on she i tell myself how magnificent she be so plucky and so clever at she job i do not wonder that half the man in we corps be go on she and there be a belgian colonel the one cutler get he order from who would make a frantic fool of himself if she would let he but good old queenie stick to she job and behave as if they be not there that make they madder you would have think they would never have have the time to be such ass in but it be wonderful what a state you can get into in you few odd moment dicky say it be the war whip you up and make it all the easier i do not know furne _ November _ that be where we be now i simply can not describe the retreat it be too awful and i do not want to think about it we have settle down in a house we have commandeer and i suppose we shall stick here till we be shell out of it talk of shell queenie be funny she be quite annoyed if anybody besides herself get anywhere near a shell we pick up two more stretcher-bearer in ostend and a queer little middle-aged lady out for a job at the front cutler take she on as a sort of secretary at first queenie be so frantic that she would not speak to she and swear she would make the corps too hot to hold she but when she find that the little lady be not for the danger zone and only propose to cook and keep we account for we she calm down and be quite decent then the other day miss mullin come and tell we that a bit of shell have chip off the corner of she kitchen the poor old thing be ever so proud and pleased about it and queenie snub she frightfully and say she be not in any danger at all and ask she how she would enjoy it if she be out all day under fire like we and she be furious with I because i have the luck to get into the bombardment at dixmude and she have not she talk as if i would do she out of she shell on purpose whereas it only mean that i happen to be on the spot when the ambulance be send out and she be away somewhere with she own car she really be rather vulgar about shell dicky say it be a form of war snobbishness -lrb- he have not get a scrap of it -rrb- but i think it really be because all the time she be afraid of one of we be kill it must be that even dicky own that she be splendid though he do not like she iv five month later the manor wyck-on-the-hill gloucestershire _ may 30th 1915 _ my darling anne -- queenie will have tell you about colin he be through all that frightful shell at ypre in April he be be three week in the hospital at boulogne with shell-shock -- have it twice -- and now he be back and in that officer ' hospital in

the beautiful jacobean house the church and church-yard sutton 's farm and the rectory the four cottage and the mill the river and its bridge lie close together in the small flat of the valley green pasture slope up the hill behind they to the north pink-brown arable land plough and harrow be fling off to either side east and west northwards the valley be a slender slip of green border the slender river southwards below the bridge the water meadow widen out past sutton 's farm from the front window of the manor farm house you see they green between the brown trunk of the elm on the road bank from the back you look out across orchard and pasture to the black still water and yellow osier bed above the mill beyond the water a double line of beech bare delicate branch round head after rounded head climb a hillock in a steep curve to part and meet again in a thick ring at the top the house front stretch along a sloping grass plot the immense porch build out like a wing with one ball-topped gable above it a smaller gable in the roof behind on either side two row of wide black window heavy brow with thick stone mullion barker jerrold fielding 's agent use to live there but before the spring of nineteen sixteen barker have join up wyck manor have be turn into a home for convalescent soldier and anne be live with colin at the manor farm half of she ilford land have be take by the government and she have let the rest together with the house and orchard instead of she own estate she have the manor to look after now it have be impossible in war-time to fill barker 's place and anne have become jerrold 's agent she have begin with a vague promise to give a look round now and then but when the spring come she find herself do barker 's work keep the farm account order fertilizer calculate so many hundredweight of superphosphate of lime or sulphate of ammonia or muriate of potash to the acre ride about on barker 's horse look after the plough plod through the furrow of the hill slope to see how the new driller be work go the round of the sheep-pen to keep count of the sick ewe and lamb carry the motherless lamb in she arm from the fold to the warm kitchen she go through February rain and snow through march wind and sleet and through the mist of the low meadow she foot be load with earth from the plough field she nostril fill with the cold rich smell of the wet earth the rank sharp smell of swede the dry pungent smell of straw and hay the thick oily woolly smell of the fold the warm half-sweet half sour smell of the cattle shed of champed fodder of milky cow 's breath the smell of hot litter and dung at five and twenty she have reach the last clear decision of she beauty dress in ride coat and breeches she body show more slender and more robust than ever rain sun and wind be cosmetic to she firm smooth skin she eye be bright dark wash with the clean air on she essex farm and afterwards at the war she have learn how to handle man sulky curti who grumble under barker 's rule surrender to anne without a scowl when anne come ride over the seven acre field lazy ballinger pull himself together and plough through the two last furrow that he would have leave for next day in barker 's time even for ballinger and curti she have smile that atone for she little air of imperious command and colin follow she about the farmyard and up the field till he tire and turn back she would see he stand by the gate she have pass through look after she with the mournful look he use to have when he be a little boy and they leave he behind he would stand look till anne 's figure black on she black horse stand up against the skyline from the curve of the round-topped hill it dip it dip and disappear and colin would go slowly home at the first sound of she horse 's hoof in the yard he come out to meet she one day he say to she jerrold 'll be jolly pleased with what you have do when he come home and then if he ever can be please with anything again it be the first time he have say jerrold 's name that be what be be bother I he go on i can not think how jerrold 's go to get over it you remember what he be like when father die yes she remember well -- what be the war go to do to he look what it be do to I he mind thing so much more than i do it do not take everybody the same way colin i do not suppose jerrold 'll get shell-shock but he might get something worse something that 'll hurt he more he must mind so awfully you may be sure he will not mind anything that could happen to himself of course he will not but the thing that 'll happen to other people see the other chap knock about and kill he mind most the thing that happen to the people he care about to you and eliot they be the sort of thing he can not face he would pretend they could not happen but the war 's so big that he can not say it be not happen he be get to stand up to it and the thing you stand up to do not hurt you i feel certain he 'll come through all right that be the turn point in colin 's malady she think : if he can talk about jerrold he be get well the next day a letter come to she from jerrold he write : i wish to goodness i could get leave i do not want it _ all _ the time i be quite prepared to stick this beastly job for any reasonable period but a whole year without leave it be a bit thick about colin do not i tell you he would be all right and it be all _ you _ anne you have make he you need not pretend you have not i want most awfully to see you again there be all sort of thing i would like to say to you but i can not write 'em she think : he be get over it at last then he will not be afraid of I any more somehow since the war she have feel that jerrold would come back to she it be as if always deep down and in secret she have know that he belong to she and that she belong to he as no other person could that whatever happen and however long a time he keep away from she he would come back at some time in some way she could not distinguish between jerrold and she sense of jerrold and as nothing could separate she from the sense of he nothing could separate she from jerrold himself he have part in the profound and secret life of she blood and nerve and brain ix jerrold i at last in march nineteen-sixteen jerrold have get leave anne be right jerrold have come through because he have have to stand up to the war and face it he could not turn away it be too stupendous a fact to be ignore or deny or in any way escape from and as he have to take it he take it laugh once in the thick of it jerrold be sustain by he cheerful obstinacy he inability to see the thing he do not want to see he admit that there be a war the most appalling war if you like that have ever be but he refuse all the time to believe that the ally would lose it he refuse from moment to moment to believe that they could be beat in any single action he deny the possibility of disaster to he own man disaster to himself -- possibly probably in theory but not in practice not when he turn back in the rain of the enemy 's fire to find he captain who have drop wound among the dead when he swing he over he shoulder and stagger to the nearest stretcher he know he would get through it be inconceivable to jerrold that he should not get through even in he fifth engagement when he man break and give back in front of the german parapet and he advance alone shout to they to come on it be inconceivable that they should not come on and when they see he run forward by himself they gather again and run after he and the trench be take in a mad rush jerrold get he captaincy and two week ' leave together he have mean to spend three day in london with he mother three day in yorkshire with the durham and the rest of he time at upper speed with anne and colin he be not quite sure whether he want to go to the durham more than anything he want to see anne again he last unbearable memory of she be wipe out by five year of indium and a year of war he remember the child anne who play with he the girl anne who go about with he and the girl woman he have find in she room at dawn he try to join on to she the image of the anne that eliot write to he about who have go out to the war and come back from it to look after colin he be in love with this image of she and ready to be in love again with the real anne he would go back now and find she and make she care for he there have be a time after he father 's death when he have try to make himself think that anne have never care for he because he do not want to think she care now that he do want it he be not sure not so sure as he be about little maisie durham he know maisie care that be why she have go out to india it be also why she have be send back again he be afraid it might be why the durham have ask he to stay with they as soon as he have leave if that be so he be not sure whether he ought to stay with they see that he do not care for maisie but since they have ask he well he could only suppose that the durham know what they be about perhaps maisie have get over it the little thing have lot of sense it have not be he fault in the begin maisie 's care afterwards perhaps in indium when he have let himself see more of she than he would have do if he have know she care but that again be hardly he fault since he do not know you do not see these thing unless you be on the lookout for they and you be not on the lookout unless you be a conceited ass then when he do see it when he could not help see after other people have see and make he see it have be too late but this be five year ago and of course maisie have get over it there would be somebody else now perhaps he would go down to yorkshire perhaps he would not at this point jerrold realize that it depend on anne but before he see anne he would have to see he mother and before he see he mother he mother have see anne and colin ii and while anne in gloucestershire be answer jerrold 's letter jerrold sit in the drawing-room of the house in montpelier square and talk to he mother they talk about colin and anne what be colin 's wife do he say queenie she be drive a field ambulance car in belgium why be not she look after colin that be not in queenie 's line besides -- besides what well to tell the truth i do not suppose she 'll live with colin after -- after _ what _ well after colin 's living with anne jerrold stiffen he feel the blood rush to he heart betray he he face be god only know what awful color you do not mean to say they -- i do not mean to say i blame they poor darling what be they to do but -lrb- he almost stammer it -rrb- you do not know -- you can not know -- it do not follow well of course my dear they have not _ tell _ I you do not shout these thing from the house-top but what be one to think there they be there they have be for the last five month live together at the farm absolutely alone anne will not leave he she will not have anybody there if you tell she it be not proper she laugh in you face and colin swear he will not go back to queenie what _ be _ one to think jerrold cover he face with he hand he do not know he mother go on in a voice of perfect sweetness do not imagine i think a bit the worse of anne she be be simply splendid i never see anything like she devotion she be bring colin round out of the most appalling state we have no business to complain of a situation we be all benefit by some people can do these thing and you forgive they whatever anne do or do not do she 'll always be a perfect darling as for queenie i do not consider she for a minute she be be simply ask for it he wonder whether it be really true it do not follow that anne and colin be lover because he mother say so even suppose that she really think it you do not go tell everybody i hope he say my dear jerrold what do you think i be make of i have not even tell anne 's father i have only tell you because i think you ought to know i see you want to put I off anne i do not _ want _ to but it would would not it oh lord yes if it be true perhaps it be not jerry dear it may be awfully immoral of I but for colin 's sake i can not help hope that it be i do so want anne to marry colin -- really he be only right when he be with she -- and if queenie divorce he i suppose she will but mother you _ be _ go ahead you may be quite wrong i may you can only suppose -- how on earth be i to know i can not ask they no you can not ask they of course he could not he could not go to colin and say be you anne 's lover he could not go to anne and say be you colin 's mistress if they want we to know say adeline they would have tell we there you be suppose it be not true do you imagine he care for she yes jerrold i be quite quite sure of that i be down there last week and see they he can not bear she out of he sight one minute he could not not care and anne oh well anne be not go to give herself away but i be certain would she stick down there with everybody watch they and think thing and talk if she do not care so much that nothing matter but would she -- would she -- the best of he mother be that in these matter she mind jump to meet yours halfway you have not get to put thing into word my dear if you think she would not suppose she care enough you do not know anne i shall go down he say and see she if you do for goodness ' sake be careful even suppose there be nothing in it you must not let colin see you think there be he would feel then that he ought to leave she for fear of compromise she and if he leave she he 'll be as bad as ever again and _ i _ can not manage he nobody can manage he but anne that be how they have tie we hand we can not say anything i see after all jerrold it be very simple if they be innocent we must leave they in they innocence and if they be not -- if they be not well we must leave they in _ that _ jerrold laugh but he be not in the least amuse iii he go down to wyck the next day he could not wait till the day after not that he have the smallest hope of anne now even if he mother 's suspicion be unfounded she have make it sufficiently clear to he that anne be necessary to colin and that be so the chance be that colin care for she in these matter he mother be not such a fool as to be utterly mistaken on every account therefore he must be prepare to give anne up he could not take she away from colin and he would not if he could it be he own fault what be do be do six year ago he should have love anne then go down in the train he think of she a little girl with short black hair hold a black-and-white rabbit against she breast a little girl with a sweet mouth ready for kiss who hang herself round he neck with sudden loving arm a big girl with long black hair tie in a immense black bow a girl too big for kiss a girl sit in she room between she white bed and the window with a little black cat in she arm she platted hair lay in a thick black rope down she back he remember how he have kiss she he remember the slide of she sweet face against he the pressure of she darling head against he shoulder the salt taste of she tear it be inconceivable that he have not love anne then why have not he why have he let he infernal cowardice stop he eliot have love she then he remember colin little col-col run after they down the field call to they to take he with they colin 's hand play colin 's voice singing _ lord rendal _ he try to think of queenie the woman colin have marry he have no image of she he could see nothing but colin and anne she be there alone at the station to meet he she come towards he along the platform they eye look for each other something choke he voice back she speak first jerrold ------ anne a strange thick voice deep down in he throat they hand clasp one into the other close and strong colin want to come but i would not let he it would have be too much for he he might have cry or something you must not mind if he cry when he see you he be not quite right yet no but he be better ever so much better he can do thing on the farm now he look after the lamb and the chicken and the pig it be good for he to have something to do jerrold agree that it be good they have reach the manor farm now do not take any notice if he cry she say colin wait for he in the hall of the house he be try hard to control himself but when he see jerrold come up the path he break down in a brief convulsive cry that stop suddenly at the touch of jerrold 's hand anne leave they together iv do not go anne colin call she back when she would have leave they again after dinner do not you want jerrold to yourself she say we do not want you to go do we jerrold rather not jerrold find himself look at they all the time he have try to persuade himself that what he mother have tell he be not true but he be not sure look as he would he be not sure if only he mother have not tell he he might have go on believe in what she have call they innocence but she have show he what to look for and for the life of he he could not help see it at every turn : in anne 's face in the way she look at colin the way she speak to he in she kindness to he she tender quiet absorption in the way colin 's face turn after she as she come and go in he restlessness when she be not there in the peace the sudden smoothing of he vexed brow when have go she come back again suppose it be true that they -- he could not bear it to be true he mind struggle against the truth of it but if it _ be _ true he do not blame they so far from be untrue or even improbable it seem to jerrold the most likely thing in the world to have happen it have happen to so many people since the war that he could not deny its likelihood there be only one thing that could have make it impossible -- if anne have care for he and what reason have he to suppose she care after six year after he have tell she he be try to get away from she he have get away and he see a sort of dreadful justice in the event that make it useless for he to come back if anybody be to blame it be himself himself and queenie that horrible girl colin have marry when he ask himself whether it be the sort of thing that anne would be likely to do he think : why not if she love he if she want to make he happy how could he tell what anne would or would not do she have say long ago that he could not that she might do anything they spend the evening talk by fit and start with long silence in between they talk about the thing that happen before the war before colin 's marriage the thing they have do together they talk about the farm and anne 's work about barker and curti and ballinger about mr sutton who watch they from she house across the road mr sutton have once be colin 's nurse up at the manor : she have marry old sutton after he first wife 's death old sutton who would not die and let anne have he farm and now she watch they as if she be afraid of what they might do next poor old nanna jerrold say goodness know what she think of we say anne it do not matter what she think say colin and they laugh they laugh and jerrold be not quite sure yet but before the night be over he think he be they have give he the little room in the gable it lead out of colin 's room and there on the chimneypiece he see a old photograph of himself at the age of thirteen hold a puppy in he arm he have give it to anne on the last day of the midsummer holiday nineteen hundred also he find a pair of anne 's slipper under the bed and catch in a crack of the dressing-table one long black hair this room lead out of colin 's be anne 's room and colin call out to he do you mind leave the door open jerry i can not sleep if it be shut v it be jerrold 's second day he and anne climb the steep beech walk to the top of the hillock and sit there under the tree up the field on the opposite rise they could see the gray wall and gable of the manor and beside it they other beech ring at the top of the last field they be silent for a while he be intensely aware of she as she turn she head round slowly to look at he straight and full and the sense of he nearness come over she soak in deeper swamp she brain she wide open eye darken she breathing come in tight short jerk she nerve quiver she wonder whether he could feel they quiver whether he could hear she jerking breath whether he could see something queer about she eye but she have to look at he not shyly furtively but straight and full take he in he be change the war have change he he face look harder the mouth closer set under the mark of the little clip fawn-brown moustache he eye that use to flash they blue so gayly to rest so lightly be fix now dark and heavy with memory they have see too much they would never lose that dark memory of the thing they have see she wonder be colin right have the war do worse thing to jerrold than it have do to he he would never tell she jerrold she say suddenly do you have a good time in indium i suppose so i dare say i think i have and you have not well i can not conceive how i could have have you mean it seem so long ago no i do not mean that you have forget i do not mean that either silence look here anne i want to know about colin have he be very bad yes he have how bad so bad that sometimes i be glad you be not there to see he you remember when he be a kid how frightened he use to be at night well he be be like that all the time he be like that now only he be a bit better he do not scream now all the time he keep on worry about you he only tell I that the other day he seem to think the war must have do something more frightful to you than it have do to he he say because you would mind it more i tell he it be not the sort of thing you would mind most it be not the sort of thing it be any good minding i do not suppose i mind more than the other chap if anything have happen to you or he or eliot i would have mind that i know that be what i tell he i know you would come through eliot be dead right about colin he know he would not he ought never to have go out he want so awfully to go but eliot could have stop he if it have not be for queenie she hunt and hound he out she tell he he be funk fancy colin funking what be queenie like she be like that she never funk herself but she want to make out that everybody else do do you like queenie no i hate she i do not mind she hound he out so much since she go herself i _ do _ mind she leave he do you know she be never even try to come and see he good god what a beast the woman must be what on earth make he marry she he be frightfully in love a awful sort of love that wear he out and make he wretched and now he be afraid for he life of she i believe he be afraid of the war end because then she 'll come back and if she do come back she may try and take colin away from I but she sha not she can not take he if he do not want to go she leave he to I to look after and i mean to stick to he i will not have he frighten and make all ill again just when i have get he well i be afraid you have have a very hard time not so hard as you think she smile a mysterious quiet smile as if she contemplate some happy secret he think he know it anne 's secret do you think it be funny of I to be live here with colin he laugh i suppose it be all right you always have pluck enough for anything it do not take pluck to stick to colin moral pluck no not even moral you be always fond of he be not you that be about as far as he dare go she smile she strange smile again yes i be always fond of he you see he want I more than anybody else ever do or ever will i be not so sure about that but he always do get what he want oh do he how about queenie even queenie i suppose he want she at the time he do not want she now poor colin you must not ask I to pity he ask you he would hate you to pity he i would hate you to pity _ I _ i should not dream of pity you any more than i should dream of criticise you oh you may criticise as much as you like no whatever you do it would make no difference i should know it be right because you do it it would not be i do heap of wrong thing but _ this _ be right i be

trust I for that master jerrold he think : poor old nanny she lie like a brick vii he say to himself that he would never know the truth about anne and colin if he go to they and ask they he would be no nearer know they would have to lie to he to save each other in any case he mother have make it clear to he that as long as anne have to look after colin he could not ask they if they be innocent they innocence must be leave undisturbed if they be not innocent well -- he have lose the right to know it besides he be sure as sure as if they have tell he he know how it would be colin 's wife would come home and she would divorce colin and he would marry anne so far as jerrold could see that be he brother 's only chance of happiness and sanity as for himself there be nothing he could do now but clear out and leave they and as he have no desire to go back to he mother and hear about anne and colin all over again he go down to the durham ' in yorkshire for the rest of he leave he have not be there five day before he and maisie be engage and before the two week be up he have marry she x eliot i eliot stand in the porch of the manor farm house there be nobody there to greet he behind he on the oak table in the hall the wire he have send lay unopened it be midday in June all round the place the air be sweet with the smell of the mown hay and from the broad pasture there come the rattle and throb of the mowing-machine eliot go down the road and through the gate into the hay-field colin and anne be there anne at the top of the field drive the mower mount up on the shell-shaped iron seat white against the blue sky colin at the bottom slender and tall above the big revolving wheel drive the rake the tedding machine drive by a farm hand go between its iron-toothed rack catch the new-mown hay toss it and scatter it on the field beside the long glistening swath the cut edge of the hay stand up clean and solid as a wall above it the raise plane of the grass-top brush by the wind quiver and sway whitish green greenish white in a long shimmering undulation eliot go on to meet anne and colin as they turn and come up the field again when they see he they jump down and come run eliot you never tell we i wire at nine this morning there be nobody in the house and we have not be in since breakfast at seven colin say it be twelve now time you knock off for lunch be not it be you all right eliot say anne rather he give a long look at they at they sun-burnt face at they clean slender grace colin in he cricket flannel and anne in she land-girl 's white-linen coat knickerbockers and gray wideawake colin do not look as if there be much the matter with he he might have be farm all he life so i have say colin consider that i have not live till now and they go back together towards the house ii colin 's and anne 's work be do for the day the hay in the broad pasture be mown and dry tomorrow it would be heap into cock and carry to the stackyard it be the evening of eliot 's first day he and anne sit out under the apple tree in the orchard what on earth have you do to colin he say i expect to find he a perfect wreck he be pretty bad three month ago but it be good for he be down here in the place he use to be happy in he know he be safe here it be good for he do job about the farm too i imagine it be good for he be with you oh well he know he be safe with I very safe he owe it to you that he be sane now you must have be astonishingly wise with he it do not take much wisdom not more than it use to take when he be a little frightened kid that be all he be when he come back from the war eliot the point be that you have not treat he like a kid you have make a man of he again you have give he a man 's life and a man 's work that be what i want to do when he be train he can look after jerrold 's land you know poor barker die last month of septic pneumonia the camp be full of it i know what do you think of my training colin it be all right for he anne but how about you I oh _ i be _ all right you need not worry about I i do worry about you and you father 's worry dear old daddy it _ be _ silly of he as if anything matter but colin _ you _ matter you see you father do not like you be here alone with he he be afraid of what people may think i be not i do not care what people think they have no business to no but they will and they doyou know what i mean anne do not you i suppose you mean they think i be colin 's mistress be that it i be afraid it be they can not think anything else it be beastly of they i know but this be a beastly world dear and it do not do to go on behave as if it be not i do not care if people be beastly it be they look-out not mine the beastlier they be the less i care i do not suppose you care if the vicar 's wife will not call or if lady corbett and the hawtreys cut you but that be why be it i never think about it i be too busy to go and see they and i suppose they be too busy to come and see I i certainly do not care if it be people you care about nobody i care about would think thing like that of I anne dear i be not so sure then it show how much they care about _ I _ but it be because they care i can not help it they may care but they do not know they can not know anything about I if they think that and you honestly do not mind i mind what _ you _ think but you do not think it eliot do you i good lord no do you mind what mother think yes i mind but it do not matter very much it would matter if jerrold think it oh eliot -- _ do _ he i do not suppose he think precisely that but i be pretty sure he think you and colin care for each other what make you think so he marry maisie like that why should not he marry she because it be you he care about eliot 's voice be quiet and heavy she know that what he say be true that quiet heavy voice be the voice of she own innermost conviction yet under the shock of it she sit silent not look at he look with wide fixed eye at the pattern the apple bough make on the sky how do you know she say presently because of the way he talk to mother before he come to see you here she say he be frightfully upset when she tell he about you and colin she tell he _ that _ apparently what do she do it for eliot what do mother do anything for i imagine she want to put jerrold off so that you could stick on with colin you have take he off she hand and she want he keep off so she tell he i be colin 's mistress mind you she do not think a bit the worse of you for that she admire you for it no end do you suppose i care what she think it be she making jerrold think iteliot how could she she could because she only see thing as they affect herself do you believe she really think it she be make herself think it because she want to but why -- why should she want to i have tell you why she be afraid of have to look after colin i have no illusion about mother she be always be like that she would not see what she be do to you before she do it she would persuade herself that it be colin and not jerrold that you care for and she would not do it deliberately at all i know it have all the effect of low cunning but it be not it be just one of she sudden movement she would rush into it on a blind impulse anne see it all she see that adeline have slander she to jerrold and to eliot that she have make use of she love for colin which be she love for jerrold to betray she that she have betray she to safeguard she own happy life without pity and without remorse she have do all of these thing and none of they they be the instinctive movement of she funk where adeline 's ease and happiness be concerned she be one incarnate funk you could not think of she as a reasonable and responsible be to be forgive or unforgiven it do not matter how she do it it be do now she say really anne it be too bad of colin he ought not to have let you he could not help it poor darling he be not in a state do not put that into he head it just have to happen i do not care eliot if it be to be do again to-morrow i would do it only if i would know i could have tell jerrold the truth the other can think what they like it 'll only make I stick to colin all the more i promise jerrold i would look after he and i shall as long as he want I it serve they all right they all leave he to I -- daddy and aunt adeline and queenie i mean -- and they can not stop I now mother do not want to stop you it be you father i 'll write and tell daddy besides it be too late if i leave colin to-morrow it would not stop the scandal my reputation 's go and i can not get it back can i dear anne you do not know how adorable you be without it look here eliot what do you mother tell _ you _ for same reason to put I off too they look at each other and smile across they memory across the year of war across anne 's agony they smile besides its courage and its young candid cynicism anne 's smile express she utter trust in he as if eliot say it would have make the smallest difference would not it have no anne nothing would that be what jerrold say and _ he _ think it i wonder what he mean he mean what i mean the moment pass tick off by the beating of he heart time and he heart beat violently together not one of they be he moment not one would serve he for what he have to say fall so close on they intolerable conversation he mean to ask anne to marry he but if he do it now she would suspect he of chivalry it would look as if he want to make up to she for all she have lose through colin as if he want more than anything to save she so eliot who have wait so long wait a little longer till the evening of he last day iii anne have go up with he to wyck manor to see the soldier ever since they have come there she have take cream and fruit to they twice a week from the farm unaware of what be think of she she never know that the scandal of young fielding and miss severn have penetrate the convalescent home with the fruit and cream and if she have know it she would not have stay away people 's beastliness be no reason why she should not go where she want where she have always go the convalescent home belong to the fielding and the fielding be she dearest friend who have be turn into relation by she father 's marriage so this evening absorb in the convalescent she never see the matron 's queer look at she or she pointed way of talk only to eliot eliot see it he think : it do not matter she be so utterly good that nothing can touch she all the same if she marry I she 'll be safe from this sort of thing they have come to the dip of the valley and the manor farm water let 's go up the beech walk he say they go up and sit in the beech ring where anne have sit with jerrold three month ago eliot never realize how repeatedly jerrold have be before he anne he say it be more than five year since i ask you to marry I be it eliot do you remember i say then i would never give you up i remember unless jerrold get I you say well he have not get I i would not want you to tie yourself up with I if there be the remotest chance of jerrold but as there be not do not you think -- no eliot i do not but you do care for I anne a little i know you do i care for you a great deal but not in that sort of way i be not ask you to care for I in the way you care for jerrold you may care for I any way you please if you 'll only marry I you do not know how awfully little i would be content to take i should not be content to give it though you ought not to have anything but the best it would be the best for I you see oh no eliot it would not you only think it would because you be a angel it would be awful of I to give so little when i take such a lot i know what you loving would be if you know you must have think of it and if you have think of it -- i have only think of it to see how impossible it be it might not be if i could leave off loving jerrold but i can n'teliot i have get the queerest feeling about he i know you 'll think I mad when he be go and marry somebody else but i feel all the time as if he have not as if he belong to I and always have and i to he whoever maisie 's marry it be not jerrold not the real jerrold the fact remain that she be married he no not he only a bit of he some bit that do not matter anne darling i would try not to think that i do not think it i feel it down there deep inside I i have always feel that jerrold would come back to I and he come back then there be colin he 'll come back again then there 'll be maisie no then there will not be maisie there will not be anything if he really comesnow you see how mad i be now you see how awful it would be to marry I no anne i see it be the only way to keep you safe safe from what safe from jerrold i do not want to be safe from he eliot i be tell you this because you trust I i want you to see I as i really be so that you will not want to marry I any more ah that be not the way to make I nothing you say make any difference nothing you could do would make any difference suppose it have be true what you mother say would not that no if you would give yourself to colin i should only have think it be you goodness it would have be good because you do it how queer that be what jerrold say then he _ do _ love I i tell you he love you then i do not care nothing else matter that be all you have to say to I yes unless i lie you would lie for jerrold for he not to he i should never need to you have no need to lie to I dear i know you better than he do you forget that i do not think what he think that only show that he know know what what i be what i might do if i really care there be thing you would never do you would never do anything mean or dishonourable or cruel oh you do not know what i would dodo not worry eliot i shall be too busy with the land and with colin to do very much i be not worry all the same he wonder which of they know anne best he or anne herself or jerrold xi interim i colin think with terror of the time when queenie would come back from the war at any moment she might get leave and come if she have not have it yet that only make it more likely that she would have it soon the vague horror that wait for he every morning have turn into this definite fear of queenie he be afraid of she temper of she voice and eye of she crude malignant thought of she hatred of anne more than anything he be afraid of she power over he of she vehement exhausting love he be afraid of she beauty one morning early in September the wire come colin shake with agitation as he read it what be it anne say queenie she be get leave she 'll be here today at four o'clock do not you want to see she no i do not then you would better drive over to kingden and look at those bullock of ledbury 's i do

over to-morrow do you mind drive yourself colin do mind he be afraid to drive by himself but he be much more afraid of queenie you can take harry and leave I to settle queenie colin go off with harry to chip kingden and at four o'clock queenie come she hard fierce eye stare past anne look for colin where 's colin she say he have to go out but he 'll be back before dinner presently queenie ask if

woman she have never see and do not want to see she know nothing of she but she name and that be sweet and vague like a perfume come from some place unknown she have no sweet image of maisie in she mind maisie might never have exist for all that anne think about she what do she do it for then why do not she take he when he give himself when she know that in the end it must come to that as far as she could see through she darkness it be because she know that jerrold have not mean to give himself when he come to she she have drive he to it she have make he betray he secret when she ask for the truth at that moment she be the stronger she have he at a disadvantage she could not take he like that through the sudden movement of he weakness before she surrender she must know first whether jerrold 's passion for she be he weakness or he strength jerrold do not know yet she must give he time to find out but before all she have be afraid that if jerrold hurt maisie he would hurt himself she must know which be go to hurt he more she refusal or she surrender if he want to be good she must go away and give he he chance and before the plough be all over she have go she go down into essex to see how she own farm be get on the tenant who have the house want to buy it when he three year ' lease be up anne have decide that she would let he the lease would be up in June she agent advise

there be all the difference in the world between jerrold 's go away from she because he do not want she and she go away from jerrold because he do it be the difference between put up with a dull continuous pain you have to bear and endure a sharp agony you could end at any minute before she have only give up what she could not get now she be give up what she could have to-morrow by simply go back to wyck she loathe the flat essex country and the street of little white rough cast and red-tiled house on the ilford side where the clear field have once lain beyond the tall elm row she be haunt by the steep many-coloured pattern of the hill round wyck and the gray gable of the manor love-sickness and home-sickness tear at she together till she heart feel as if it be stretch out to break point she have only to go back and she would end this pain then on the sixth day jerrold 's wire come : colin ill again please come back jerrold ii it be not she fault and it be not jerrold 's

and scatter of sound sound fall together run into each other cover each other one long throbbing and clanging sound and then hard slow stroke measure out the seconds like a clock they wait till the bell cease the dusk gather it spread from the corner to the middle of the room the tall white arch of the chimney-piece jut out through the dusk anne stir slightly i say how dark it be get yes i like it do not get the lamp they sit cling together wait for the dark the window pane be a black glimmer in the gray he get up and draw the curtain shut out the black glimmer of the pane he come to she and lift she in he arm and carry she to the couch and lay she on it she shut she eye and wait xiv maisie i he do not know what he be go to do about maisie on a fine warm day in April maisie have come home he have motor she up from the station and now the door of the drawing-room have close on they and they be alone together in there oh jerrold -- it _ be _ nice -- to see you -- again she pant a little a way she have when she be excite awfully nice he say and wonder what on earth he be go to do next he have be all right on the station platform where they greeting have be public and perfunctory but now he would have to do something intimate and above all spontaneous not to stand there like a stick they look at each other and he take again the impression she have always give he of delicate beauty and sweetness she be tall and she neck bent slightly forward as she walk this give she the air of bow prettily of offer you something with a charming grace she shoulder and she hip have the same long slenderly sloping curve she hair be mole brown on the top and turn back in a old-fashioned way that uncover its hidden gold she face be white the thin bluish whiteness of skim milk she mauve blue eye look larger than they be because of they dark brow and lash and the faint mauve smear about they lid the line of she little slender nose go low and straight in the bridge then curve under delicately acquiline its nostril be close and clean cut she small close upper lip have a fly droop and she chin curve slightly ever so slightly away to she throat when she talk maisie 's mouth and the tip of she nose keep up the same sensitive quiver play but maisie 's eye be still they have no sparkling speech they listen deeply attentive to the person who be there they take up the smile she mouth begin and be too small to finish and now as they look at he he feel that he ought to take she in he arm suddenly at once in another instant it would be too late the action would have lose the grace of spontaneous impulse he wonder how you simulated a spontaneous impulse but maisie make it all right for he as he stand wait for he impulse she come to he and lay she hand on he shoulder and kiss he gently on each cheek she hand slide down they press hard against he arm above the elbow as if to keep back he too passionate embrace it be easy enough to return she kiss to pass he arm under hers and press she slight body gently with he cramped hand do she know that he heart be not in it no she know nothing what have you be do with yourself she say you do look fit do i oh nothing much he turn away from she sweet eye that hurt he at least he could bring forward a chair for she and put cushion at she back and pour out she tea and wait on she he try by a number of careful deliberate attention to make up for he utter lack of spontaneity and she sit there drink she tea contented pleased to be back in she happy home serenely unaware that anything be miss he take she over the house and show she she room the long room with the two south window one on each side of the square cross-lighted bay above the porch it be full of the clear April light maisie look round take it all in the privet-white

ever live in it have be good and happy i do not know about that it be a hospital for four year and it have not quite recover yet it be all a bit worn and shabby i be afraid i do not care i love its shabbiness i do not want to forget what it be be to think that i have miss seven week of it you have not miss much we have have beastly weather all march i have miss _ you _ seven week of you i think you 'll get over that he say perversely i sha not it be leave a horrid empty space but i could not help it i really could not jerry all right maisie i be sure you could not torquay be simply horrible and this be heaven oh jerry dear i be go to be so awfully happy he look at she with a sudden tenderness of pity she be visibly happy he remember that she charm for he have be she habit of enjoyment and as he look at she he see nothing but sadness in she happiness and in she sweetness and she beauty but the sadness be not in she it be in he own soul woman like maisie be make for man to be faithful to they and he have not be faithful to she she be make for love and he have not love she she be nothing to he look at she he be fill with pity for the beauty and sweetness that be nothing to he and in that pity and that sadness he feel for the first time the uneasy stir of he soul if only he could have break the physical tie that have bind he to she until now if only they could give it all up and fall back on some innocent immaterial relationship that mean no unfaithfulness to anne when he think of anne he do not know for the life of he how he be go through with it ii maisie have be talk to he for some seconds before he understand at last he see that for reason which she be unable to make clear to he she be let he off he would not have to go through with it as jerrold 's mind never foresee anything he do not want to see so in this matter of maisie he have have no plan not that he trust to the inspiration of the moment in its very nature the moment would not have a inspiration he have simply refuse to think about it at all it be too unpleasant but maisie 's presence force the problem on he with some violence he have give himself to anne without a scruple but when it come to give himself to maisie he conscience develop a sudden sense of guiltiness for jerrold be essentially faithful only he fidelity be all for anne he marry maisie have be a sin against anne its sinfulness disguise because he have have no pleasure in it the thought of go back to maisie after anne revolt he the thought of anne have to share he with maisie revolt he nobody he say to himself be ever less polygamous than he at the same time he be sorry for maisie he do not want she to suffer and if she be not to suffer she must not know and if she be not to know they must go on as they have begin he be haunt by the fear of maisie 's know and suffer the pity he feel for she be poignant and accuse as if somehow she do know and suffer she must at least be aware that something be want he would have to make up to she somehow for what she have miss he would have to give she all the other thing she want for that one thing maisie 's coldness might have make it easy for he nothing could move jerrold from he conviction that maisie be cold that she be incapable of care for he as anne care he peace of mind and the freedom of he conscience depend on this belief but in spite of she coldness maisie want child he know that accord to jerrold 's code maisie 's child would be a injury to anne a perpetual insult but anne would forgive he she would understand she would not want to hurt maisie so he go through with it and now he make out that mercifully incredibly he be be let off he would not have to go on he stand by maisie 's bed look down at she as she lay there she have grasp he hand by the wrist as if to hold back they possible caress and she little breathless voice go on catch itself up and trip you will not mind -- if i do not let you -- come to I i be sorry maisie i do not know you feel like that about it i do not it be not because i do not love you it be just my silly nerve i get frightened i know i know it 'll be all right i will not bother you mother say i ought not to ask you she say you would not understand and it would be too hard for you _ will _ it no of course it will not i understand perfectly he try to sound like one affectionately resign decently renounce not as though he feel this blessedness of relief absolve from dread mercifully and incredibly let off but maisie 's sweetness hate to refuse and frustrate it could not bear to hurt he she hold he tighter jerrold -- if it _ be _ -- if you can not stand it you must not mind about I you must forget i ever say anything it be nothing but nerve i shall be all right do not worry you _ be _ a darling she grasp slacken please -- please go at once quick as he go she put she hand to she heart she could feel the pain come it fill she with a indescribable dread every time it come she think she should die of it if only she do not get so excited excitement always bring it on she hold she breath tight to keep it back ah it have come splinter of glass sharp splinter of glass first prick then pierce then tear she heart she heart close down on the splinter of glass cut itself at every beat she look under the pillow for the little silver box that hold she pearl of nitrate of amyl she always have it with she ready she crush a pearl in she pocket handkerchief and hold it to she nostril the pain leave she she lay still iii and every Sunday at six in the evening or nine -lrb- he vary the hour to escape suspicion -rrb- jerrold come to anne in the week before maisie 's come and after anne 's happiness be perfect intense and secret like the bliss of a saint in ecstasy of genius contemplate its finished work in give herself to jerrold she have find reality she give herself without shame and without remorse or any fear of the dangerous risk they run they passion be too clean for fear or remorse or shame she think love be a finer thing go free and in danger than sheltered and safe and bind the game of love should be play with a high defiant courage you be not fit to play it if you fret and cower both she and jerrold come to it with a extreme simplicity take it for grant they never vow or protest or swear not to go back on it or on each other it be inconceivable that they should go back on it and as anne see no begin to it she see no end all she past be in she love for jerrold there never have be a time when she have cease to love he this moment when they embrace be only the meeting point between what have be and what would be nothing could have disturb anne 's conscience but the sense that jerrold do not belong to she that he have no right to love she and she have never have that sense they have belong to each other always from the time when they be child play together maisie be the intruder who have no right who have take what do not belong to she and anne could have forgive even that if maisie have have the excuse of a great passion but maisie do not care so anne unlike jerrold be not trouble by think about maisie she have never see jerrold 's wife she do not want to see she so long as she do not see she it be as if maisie be not there and yet she _ be _ there next to jerrold she be more there for anne than the people she see every day maisie 's presence make itself feel in all the risk they run she be the hindrance not to perfect bliss but to a continuous happiness she be the reason why they could only meet at interval for one difficult and dangerous hour because of maisie jerrold instead of behave like himself with a reckless disregard of consequence have to think out the least revolting way by which they might evade they he have to set up some sort of screen for he Sunday visit to the manor farm thus he make a habit of long walk after dark on week-day and of unpunctuality at meal to avoid be see by the cottager he approach the house from behind by the bridge over the mill-water and through the orchard to the back door luckily the estate provide he with a irreproachable and permanent pretext for see anne for jerrold go about with anne over the manor farm have conceive a profound passion for he seven hundred acre at last he have come into he inheritance and if it be anne severn who show he how to use it so that he could never separate he love of it from he love of she the land have a interest of its own that soon excite and absorb he he determine to take up farm seriously and look after he estate himself when anne have sutton 's farm anne would teach he all she know and he could finish up with a year or two at the agricultural college in cirencester he have find the work he most want to do the work he believe he could do best all the better if it bring he every day this irreproachable companionship with anne he conscience be appease by maisie 's coldness and jerrold tell himself that the life he lead now be the best possible life for a sane man he mind be clear and keen he body be splendidly fit he love for anne be perfect he companionship with she be perfect they understanding of each other be perfect they would never be tire of each other and never bore he ride with she over the hill and tramp with she through the furrow in all weather at time he would approach she through some sense sharper than sight or touch that give he she inmost immaterial essence she would be sit quietly in a room or standing in a field when suddenly he would be thus aware of she these moment have a reality and certainty more poignant even than the moment of he passion at last they cease to think about they danger they feel ironically that they be protect by the legend that make anne and colin lover in the eye of the kimber and nanny sutton and the vicar 's wife and the corbett and hawtrey and markham jerrold be the stern guardian of he brother 's moral they be say now that captain fielding have put a stop to the whole disgraceful affair he have force colin to leave the manor farm house and he have take over the estate in order to keep a eye on he brother and anne severn anne be not concern with what they say she feel that jerrold and she be safe so long as she do not know maisie it never strike she that maisie would want to know _ she _ since nobody else do iv but maisie do want to know anne and for that reason one day she come to jerrold with the visit card the corbett and hawtrey have call shall i like they i do not know _ i _ will not have anything to do with they why not because of the beastly way they have behave to anne severn what have they do do they have be perfect swine they have cut she for five year because she look after colin they have say the filthiest thing about she what sort of thing why that colin be she lover oh jerrold how abominable just because she be a saint anne would not care what anybody say about she my mother leave she all by herself here to take care of he and she would not leave he she think of nothing but he she must be a perfect angel she be but about these horrible people -- what do you want I to do do what you like _ i _ do not want to know they i be think what would be best for anne you need not worry about anne it be not as if she be _ you _ friend but she _ be _ if she be yours and colin 's i mean i want she to be i think i would better call on these corbett and hawtrey people and just show they how we care about she then cut they dead afterwards if they be not decent to she it 'll be far more telling than if i begin by be rude only jerrold how absurd -- i do not know anne _ she _ have not call yet she probably think you would not want to know she do you mean because of what they have say that be the very reason why she be the only person here i do want to know i think i fall in love with the sound of she when you first tell I about she and how she take care of colin we must do everything we can to make up we must have she here a lot and give she a jolly time he look at she maisie you really _ be _ rather a darling i be not but i think anne severn must be shall i go and see she or will you bring

thinking of colin now she be think that if jerrold come back for the hay harvest and maisie go on with colin to the italian lake she would have she lover to herself they would be alone together all June she would lie in he arm not for they short reckless hour of Sunday but night after night from long before midnight till the dawn for last year when the warm weather come anne and colin have sleep out of door in wooden shelter set up in the manor field away from the noise of the farm a low stone wall separated anne 's field from colin 's this year when jerrold come home colin 's shelter have be move up from the field to the manor garden in the summer anne would sleep again in she shelter the path to she field from the manor garden lay through three pasture and two strip of fir plantation with a green drive between jerrold would come to she there he would have he bed in colin 's shelter in the garden and when the night be quiet he would get up and go down the manor field and through the fir plantation to she shelter at the bottom they would lie there in each other 's arm utterly safe hide from pass foot and listen ear and eye that watch behind window pane and as she think of he come to she and hear she own voice lie to maisie the blood mount to she face flooding it to the root of she hair i be think of colin she voice keep on sound loud and dreadful in she brain while maisie 's voice float across it faint as if it come from somewhere a long way off you never think of yourself you be too good for anything anne she would never be safe from maisie and maisie 's innocence that accuse reproach and threaten she maisie 's sweetness go through she like a thrust sword like a sharp poison it have word that cut deeper than threat reproach accusation before she have see maisie she have be fearless pitiless remorseless now because of maisie she would never be safe from remorse and pity and fear she recover she tell herself that she have not lie that she _ have _ be think of colin that she have think of he first that she have refuse to go to taormina before she know that jerrold be come back for the hay harvest she could not help it if she know that now it be not as if she have scheme for it or count on it she have never for one moment count on anything or scheme and still as she think of jerrold she heart tighten on the sharp sword-thrust of remorse because of maisie nothing would ever be the same again ii in the last week of April they have go jerrold and maisie eliot and colin to taormina in the last week in may jerrold and eliot take maisie up to como on they way home they find sir charle and lady durham there wait for she they have leave colin by himself at taormina from the first moment of landing colin have fall in love with sicily and refuse to be take away from it he be aware that he recovery be now in he own hand and that he would not be free from he malady so long as he be afraid to be alone he have get to break himself of he habit of dependence on other people and here in taormina he have come upon the place that he could bear to be alone in there be freedom in he surrender to its enchantment and in the contemplation of its beauty there be peace and with peace and freedom he have find he indestructible self he have come to the end of its long injury one day sit out on the balcony of he hotel he write to anne do not imagine because i have get well here away from you that it be not you who make I well in the first place i should never have go away if you have not make I go you know what you be about when you send I here i know now what jerrold mean when he want to get away by himself after father die he say he want to grow a new memory well that be what i have do here it seem to happen all at once one day i would leave they all and go out for a walk by myself it come over I that between I and be well perfectly well there be nothing but myself that i be really hang on to my illness for some sort of protection that it give I just as i would hang on to you i would be think about it all the time fill my mind with my illness hang on to the very fear of it to save myself i suppose from a worse fear the fear of life itself and suddenly out there i let go and the beauty of the place get I i can not describe the beauty except that there be a lot of strong blue and yellow in it a clear gold atmosphere positively quiver and streaming over everything like gold water i seem to remember it as if i would be here before a long steady memory not just a flash it be like find something you would lose or when a musical phrase you have be look for suddenly come back to you it be the most utter indescribable peace and satisfaction and somehow this time join on to the time at wyck when we be all there and happy together and the beastly time in between slip through it just drop out as if it have never happen and i get a sense of have do with it forever i can not tell you what it be like but i think it mean i be well and then on the top of it all i remember you anne and all you goodness and sweetness i get right away from my beastly self and see you as you be and i know what you would do for I i do not believe i ever know really _ know _ before i have to be alone with myself before i could see it just as i always have to be alone with my music before i could get it right i have never thank you properly i can not thank you there be not any word to do it in and i only know now what it be cost you do he know do he know that it have once cost she jerrold for instance i know you give up come here with we because you think it would be better for I without you colin too turn it in she heart the sharp blade of remorse would they never have do punish she and then : maisie know what you be she tell eliot you be the most beautiful thing morally she have ever know the one person she say whose motive would always be clean if he have try he could not have hit on anything that would have hurt she so it be more than she could bear to be punish like this through the innocence of innocent people through they kindness and affection they belief they incorruptible trust in she there be nothing in the world she dread more than maisie 's trust it be as if she foresee what it would do to she how at any minute it would beat she it would break she down but she be not beat yet not break down after every fit of remorse she passion assert itself again in a superb recovery she motive might not be so spotless as they look to maisie but she passion itself be clean as fire nothing not even maisie 's innocence maisie 's trust in she could make she go back on it hard wound tear cut through she eyelid as she think of maisie but she brush they away and begin count the day till jerrold should come back iii he come back the first week in June in time for the hay harvest and it happen as she have foresee it would have be dangerous for jerrold to have leave the house at night to go to the manor farm at any moment he might have be betray by he own footstep tread the passage and stair by the slip of lock and bolt the sound of the opening and shut of door the servant might be awake and hear he they might go to he room and find that he be not there but colin 's shelter stand in a recess on the lawn open to the field and hide from the house by tall hedge of yew nobody could see he slip out into the moonlight or the darkness nobody could hear the soft padding of he foot on the grass he have only to run down the three field and cross the belt of fir to come to anne 's shelter at the bottom the blank project wall of the mill hide it from the cottage and the manor farm house the firs hide it from the field path a high bank top by a stone wall hide it from the road and sutton 's farm its three wooden wall hold they safe night after night between eleven and midnight he come to she night after night she lay awake wait till the light rustling of the meadow grass tell she he be there : on moonlit night a quick brushing sound in the thick blackness a sound like a slow shearing as he feel he way the moon would show he clear as he stand in the open frame of the shelter look in at she or she would see he gray twilit and mysterious or loom darker than dark on black night without moon or star they love the clear night when they body show to each other white under the white moon they love the dark night that bring they close shut they in annihilate every sensation but that of he tense hard muscle press down of she body crushed and yielding tightening and slacken in surrender of they brain swim in they dark ecstasy they love the warmth of each other 's body in the hot windless night they love they smooth clean coolness wash by the night wind nothing not even the sweet haunt ghost of maisie come between they would fall asleep in each other 's arm and lie there till dawn till anne wake in a sudden fright always she have this fear that some day they would sleep on into the morning when the farm people would be up and about jerrold lay still tire out with satisfaction sink under all the floor of sleep she have to drag he up with kiss first and light stroke then with a strong undoing of they embrace push back he heavy arm that fall again to she breast as she part they then she would wrench herself loose and shake he by the shoulder till she wake he he wake clean with no ugly turning and yawning but with a great stretch of he strong body and a short sudden laugh the laugh he have for danger then he would look at he wrist watch and show it she laughing again as she see that this time again they be safe and they would lie a little while longer look into each other 's face for the sheer joy of look reckless with impunity and he would start up suddenly with i say anne i must clear out or we shall be catch and they would get up outside the world look young and unknown in the June dawn in the still clear gold-crystal air where green leaf and green grass shone with a strange hard lustre like fresh paint and yet unearthly uncreated fix in they own space and time and she would go with he she naked foot shine white on the queer bright cold green of the grass up the field to the belt of fir that stand up strange and eternal under the rise sun they part there hold each other for a last kiss a last clinging as if never in this world they would meet again dawn after dawn they belong to the dawn and the dawn light the dawn be they day they know it as they know no other time and anne would go back to she shelter and lie there and live through they passion again in memory till she fall asleep and when she wake she would find the sweet sad ghost of maisie haunt she coming between she and the memory of she dark ecstasy maisie utterly innocent utterly good trust she send jerrold back to she because she trust she only to think of maisie give she a fearful sense of insecurity she think : if i would love she i could never have do it if i be to love she even now that would end it we could not go on she pray god that she might not love she by day the hard work of the farm stop she thinking and the next night and the next dawn bring back she safety iv the hay harvest be over by the last week of June and in the first week of July maisie have come back maisie or no maisie the work of the farm have to go on and anne feel more than ever that it justify she when the day of reckoning come if it ever do come let she be judge by she work because of she love for jerrold here be this big estate hold together and keep go because of he love for she here be jerrold grow into a perfect farmer and a perfect landlord because of she he have find the one thing he be best fit to do because of he she herself be valuable anne bring to she work on the land a thoroughness that aim continually at perfection she watch the starting of every tractor-plough and driller as it break fresh ground to see that machine and man be work at they highest pitch of efficiency she demand efficiency and on the whole she get it she give it by a sort of contagion she wring out of the land the very utmost it be capable of yield she see that there be no waste of straw or hay of grain or fertilizer and she know how to take risk spend big sum on implement and stock wherever she see a good chance of a return jerrold learn from she this perfection she work stand clear for the whole countryside to see nobody could say she have not do well by the land when she first take on the manor farm it have stand only in the second class in four year she have raise it to the first it be now one of the best cultivate estate in the county and famous for its prize stock sir john corbett of underwood mr hawtrey of medlicote and major markham of wyck wold own to a admiration for anne severn 's management she moral they say might be a trifle shady but she farming be above reproach more reluctantly they admit that she have make something of that young rotter colin even while they suppose that he have be send abroad to keep he out of anne severn 's way they also suppose that as soon as he could do it decently jerrold would get rid of anne then two thing happen in July maisie fielding come back and be see drive about the country with anne severn and in the same month old sutton die and the barrow farm be let to anne thus establish she permanence anne have refuse to take it from jerrold as he gift he have press she persistently you might anne it be the only thing i can give you and what be it a scrubby two hundred acre it be a thunder lot of land jerrold i can not take it you must it be not enough after all you have do for we i would like to give you everything i have get wyck manor and the whole bless estate to the last turnip and every cow and pig but i can not do that and you use to say you want the barrow farm i want to rent it jerry darling i can not let you give it I why not i think it be simply beastly of you not to at that point maisie have pass through the room with she flower and he have call to she to help he what be you two quarrel about she say why i want to give she the barrow farm and she will not let I of course i will not let he a whole farm how could i i think you might anne it would please he no end she think jerrold say she can go on do thing for we but we must not do anything for she and i say it be beastly of she it be really anne darling it be selfish he want to give it you so awfully he will not be happy if you will not take it but a farm a whole thumping farm it be a big house and two hundred acre how can i take a thing like that you could not yourself if you be I maisie 's little white finger flicker over the blue delphinium stack in the blue-and-white chinese jar she mauve-blue eye be smile at anne over the top of the tall blue spire do not you want to make he happy she say not that way if it be the only way -- she pass out of the room still smile to gather more flower they look at each other jerrold i can not stand it when she say thing like that no more can i but you know she really do want you to take that farm do not you see why i can not take it -- from _ you _ it be because we be lover i should have think that make it easier it make it impossible i have _ give _ myself to you i can not take anything besides it would look as if i would take it for that that be a appalling idea anne it be but it be what everybody 'll think they 'll wonder what on earth you do it for we do not want people wonder about we if they once begin wonder they 'll end by find out i see perhaps you be right i be sorry it stick out of we enough as it be i can not think how maisie do not see it but she never will she 'll never believe that we -- do you want she to see it no but it hurt so she not see jerrold i believe that be the punishment -- maisie 's trust we it be the worst thing she could have do to we then if we be punish we be quit do not think of it anne darling do not let maisie come in between we like that he take she in he arm and kiss she close and quick so that no thought could come between but maisie 's sweetness have not do its worst she have yet to prove what she be and what she could do v July pass and August the harvest be over and in September jerrold go up to london to stay with eliot for the week-end and anne stay with maisie because maisie do not like be leave in the big house by herself through all those week that be the way maisie have she through she need of she and on the Thursday before anne come maisie have call on mr hawtrey of medlicote and mr hawtrey have ask she to lunch with she on the follow Monday maisie say she be afraid she could not lunch on Monday because anne severn would be with she and mr hawtrey say she be very sorry but she be afraid she could not ask anne severn and maisie enquire in she tender voice why not and mrs hawtrey reply because my dear nobody here do ask anne severn maisie say again why not then mr hawtrey say she do not want to go into it the whole thing be so unpleasant but nobody _ do _ call on anne severn she be too well know and at that maisie rise in she fragile dignity and say that nobody know anne severn so well as she and she husband do and that there be nobody in the world so absolutely _ good _ as anne and that she could not possibly know anybody who refuse to know she and so left mr hawtrey the evening jerrold come home maisie flush with pleasure entertain he with a report of the encounter so you have give a ultimatum to the county yes i tell you i would cut they all if they go on cut anne and now they know it that mean that you will not know anybody maisie except for anne and I you 'll be absolutely alone here i do not care i do not want anybody but you and anne and if i do we can ask somebody down there be lot of amusing people who have come and eliot can bring he scientific crowd it simply mean that corbett and hawtrey will not be ask to meet they that be all she go upstairs to lie down before dinner and presently anne come to he in the drawing-room she be dress in she ride coat and breeches as she have come off the land what do you think maisie 's do now he say i do not know something that 'll make I feel awful i suppose if you be go to take it like that i will not tell you yes tell I tell I i would rather know he tell she as maisie have tell he can not you see she standing up to the whole county pound they with she little hand he vision of the gentle thing rise up in that sudden sacred fury of protection move he to admire tender laughter it make anne burst into tear oh jerrold that be the worst that be happen yet everybody 'll cut she because of I bless you she will not care she say she do not care about anybody but you and I but that be the awful thing she caring that be the punishment the punishment again he take she in he arm and comfort she what be i to do jerry what be i to _ do _ go to she he say and say something nice go to she and take my punishment well yes darling i be afraid you have get to take it we can not have it both way it would not _ be _ a punishment if you be not so sweet if you do not mind so i wish to god i would never tell you she hold she head high i make you i be glad you tell I she go up to maisie in she room maisie have dress for dinner and lay on she couch look exquisite and fragile in a gown of thick white lace she give a little soft cry as anne come to she anne you have be cry what be it darling nothing only jerrold tell I what you would do do yes for I why do you do it maisie why i suppose it be because i love you it be the least i could do she hold out she hand to she anne kneel down crouching on the floor beside she with she face hide against maisie 's body maisie put she arm round she but why be you cry about it anne you never cry i can not bear it it be like see jerrold cry it be because you be so good so good and i be such a brute you do not know what a brute i be oh yes i know do you she say sharply for one moment she think that maisie do indeed know know and understand so perfectly that she forgive this be forgiveness of course i do and so do jerrold _ he _ know what a brute you be it be not forgiveness it be maisie 's innocence again she trust -- the punishment anne kneel there and take the pain of it vi she lay awake alone in she shelter she have give the excuse of a rack headache to keep jerrold from come to she for that she have have to lie but what be she whole existence but a lie a lie tell by she silence under maisie 's trust in she by she acceptance of maisie 's friendship by she acquiescence in maisie 's preposterous belief every minute that she let maisie go on loving and trusting and believe in she she lie and the appalling thing be that she could not be alone in she lie so long as maisie trust he jerrold lie too -- jerrold who be truth itself one moment she think : that be what i have bring he to that be how i have drag he down the next she see that reproach as the very madness of she conscience she have not drag jerrold down she have raise he to he highest intensity of loving she have bring he out of the illusion of he life with maisie to reality and keep he there in a immaculate faithfulness not even for one insane moment do anne admit that there be anything wrong or shameful in they passion itself it be maisie 's innocence that make they liar maisie 's goodness that put they in the wrong and bring shame on they she truth that falsify they no woman less exquisite in goodness could have move she to this incredible remorse it take the whole of maisie in she unique perfection to beat she and break she down she first instinct in refuse to know maisie have be profoundly right it be as if she have foresee even then that know maisie would mean loving she and that love she she would be beat and break down the awful thing be that she do love maisie and she could not tell which be the worse to bear she love for maisie or maisie 's love for she and who could have foresee the pain of it when she pray that she might take the whole punishment she have not reckon on this refinement and precision of torture god know what he be about with all he resource he could not have hit on anything more delicately calculate to hurt nothing less subtle would have touch she not discovery not the grossness of exposure but this intolerable security what could discovery and exposure do but set she free in she reality anne would have rejoice to see she lie go up in one purify flame of revelation but to go safe in she lie hide she reality and yet defenceless under the sting of maisie 's loving be more than she could bear she have bring all she truth and all she fineness to this passion which maisie 's innocence make a sin and she be punish where she have sin wound by the subtle god in she fineness and she truth if only jerrold could have escape but he be vulnerable too there be fineness and truth in he to suffer really he have to be wound in he soul if jerrold be hurt then they must end it as yet he have give no sign of feeling but that be like he up to the last minute he would fight against feeling and when it come he would refuse to own that he suffer that there be any cause for suffer it would be like the time when he father be die when he refuse to see that he be die so he would refuse to see maisie and then all at once he would see she and he would be beat and break down vii and suddenly he do see she it be on the first Sunday after jerrold 's return maisie have have another of she heart attack by herself in she bed the night before and she have be lie down all day the sun have come round on to the terrace and she now rest there wrap in a fur coat and lean back on she cushion in the garden chair they be sit out there all three jerrold and anne talking together and maisie listen with she sweet attentive eye suddenly she shut she eye and cease to listen jerrold and anne go on talk with hushed voice and in a little while maisie be asleep she head rise out of the brown fur be tilted back on the cushion show she innocent white throat she white violet eyelid be shut down on she eye the dark lash lie still she mouth utterly innocent be half open she breath come through it unevenly in light jerk she be asleep jerrold they sit still make no sound and as she look at maisie sleep tear come again into anne 's eye the hard tear that cut she eyelid and spill themselves drop by slow drop heavily she try to wipe they away secretly with she hand before jerrold see they but they come again and again and he have see he have rise to he foot as if he would go then check himself and stand beside she and together they look on at maisie 's sleep they feel together the infinite anguish the infinite pathos of she goodness and she trust the beauty of she spirit lay bare to they in the white tilted face slacken and smooth with sleep sleep show they she innocence again naked and helpless they see she in she poignant be she intense reality she be so real that in that moment nothing else matter to they anne set she tooth hard to keep she mouth still she see jerrold glance at she she hear he give a soft groan of pity or of pain then he move away from they and stand by the terrace wall with he back to she she see he clenched hand and through he terrible tense quietness she know by the quiver of he shoulder that he breast heave then she see he grasp the terrace wall and grind the edge of it into the palm of he hand that be how he have stand by he father 's deathbed grip the foot-rail and when presently he turn and come to she she see the look on he face she have see then of young blind agony sharpen now with some more pierce spiritual pain come he say come into the house they go together side by side as they have go when they be child along the terrace and down the step into the drive in the shelter of the hall she give way and cry openly and helplessly like a child and he put he arm round she and lead she into the library away from the place where maisie be they sit together on the couch hold each other 's hand cling together in they suffer they memory of what maisie have make they sin even so they have sit in anne 's room on the edge of anne 's bed when they be child hold each other 's hand miserable and yet glad because they be bring together because what they have do and what they have bear they have do and bear together and now as then he comfort she do not cry anne darling it be not you fault i make you you do not you do not i want you and i make you come to I and i know what it would be like and you do not nobody could have know do not go back on it i be not go back on it if only i would never see maisie -- then i would not have care we could have go on do you mean we can not now yes how can we when she be such a angel to we and trust we so it do make it pretty beastly he say it make I feel absolutely rotten so it do I when i think about it it be know she jerry it be have to love she and know that she love I it be know what she be why do you make I see she you know why yes because it make it safer that be the beastliness of it i know how it would be i know she would beat we in the end -- with she goodness darling it _ be not _ you fault it _ be _ it be all my fault i be not go back on it i would do it again to-morrow if it be not for maisie even now i do not know whether it be right or wrong i only know it be the most real and valuable part of I that love you and it be the most real and valuable part of you that love I and i feel somehow that that make it right i would go on with it if it make you happy but you be not happy now i be not happy because you be not i do not mind for myself so much only i hate the beastly way we have get to do it cover it all up and pretend that we be not lover deceive she that be what make it all wrong hide it i know and i make you do that you do not we do it for maisie anyhow we must stop it we can not go on like this any more we must simply tell she _ tell _ she yes tell she and get she to divorce I so that i can marry you it be the only straight thing how can we it would hurt she so awfully not so much as you think remember she do not care for I she be not like you anne she be frightfully cold as he say it there come to she a sudden awful intimation of reality a sense that behind all they word all the piled-up protection of they outward thinking there hide a unknown certainty a certainty that would wreck they if they know it it be safer not to know to go on hide behind those piled-up barrier of thought but a inward ultimate honesty drive she to she question be you sure she be cold absolutely sure you go on think all the time that she be like you that she take thing as hard as you do but she do not she do not feel as you do it will not hurt she as it would hurt you if i leave you for somebody else but -- it 'll hurt she it be better to hurt she a little now than to go on humbugging and shamming till she find out that would hurt she damnably she would hate we not be straight with she but if we tell she the truth she 'll understand i be certain she 'll understand and she 'll forgive _ you _ she can not be hard on you for care for I even if she do not care she care for _ you _ he say she could not push it from she that importunate sense of a certainty that be not he certainty if maisie do care for he jerrold would not see it he never see what he do not want to see suppose she _ do _ care all the time how do you know she do not i do not think i can tell you but i _ must _ know jerrold it make all the difference it make none to I anne i would want you whether maisie care for I or not but she do not if i think she do not -- then -- then i should not mind she know why be you so certain you might tell I then he tell she after all that sense of hidden certainty be a illusion when be that jerrold oh a night or two after she come down here in April she do not know poor darling how she let I off April -- September and she be stick to it oh -- stick to it rather and before that before that we be all right and she would be away too yes age that make it all the funnier i wish you would tell I before i wish i have if it make you happier it do still we can not go on jerrold till she know of course we can not it be too awful i

ago before it happen yes but now -- what the devil _ be _ i to tell she he see as if for the first time what tell she would mean tell she the truth the whole truth how can i -- when it be _ you _ it

tired wait till she be rest and jerrold wait xvi anne maisie and jerrold i jerrold wait and maisie get she truth in first it be on the Wednesday a fine bright day in September and jerrold be to have drive maisie and anne over to oxford in the car and ten minute before start maisie have declare herself too tire to go anne would not go without she and jerrold rather sulky have set off by himself he could not understand maisie 's sudden fit of fatigue when there be nothing the matter with she he think she capricious and hysterical she be acquire he mother 's perverse habit of upset you engagement at the last moment and lately she have be particularly tiresome about motor either they be go too fast or too far or the wind be too strong and he would have to turn back or hold himself in and go slowly and the next time she would refuse to go at all for fear of spoil they pleasure she like it better when anne drive she and today jerrold be annoy with maisie because of anne if it have not be for maisie anne would have be with he enjoy a day 's holiday for once really maisie might have think of anne and anne 's pleasure it be not like she not to think of other people yet he own that she have not want anne to stay with she he could hear she pathetic voice implore anne to go because jerry will not like it if you do not also he know that if anne be determine not to do a thing nothing you could say would make she do it he have have time to think about it as he sit in the lounge of the hotel at oxford wait for the friend who be to lunch with he and suddenly he annoyance have turn to pity it be no wonder if maisie be hysterical he life with she be all wrong all horribly unnatural she ought to have have child or he ought never to have marry she it have be all wrong from the begin perhaps she have be aware that there be something miss perhaps not maisie have seem always singularly unaware that be because she do not care for he perhaps if he have love she passionately she would have care more perhaps not maisie be incurably cold she shrink from the slightest gesture of approach she be afraid of any emotion she be one of those unhappy woman who be bear with a aversion from warm contact who can not give themselves what puzzle he be the union of such a temperament with maisie 's sweetness and she charm he have notice that other man adore she he know that if it have not be for anne he might have adore she too and again he wonder whether it would have make any difference to maisie if he have he think not she be happy as it be in she gentle unexcited way happy and at peace give happiness and peace if peace be what you want it be that happiness and peace of maisie 's that have draw he to she when he give anne up three year ago and again he could not understand this combination of hysteria and perfect peace he could not understand maisie perhaps after all she have get what she have want she would not have be happy and at peace if she have be marry to some brute who would have have no pity who would have insist on he rights some faithful brute or some brute no more faithful to she than he who have be faithful only to anne as he think of anne darkness come down over he brain he mind struggle through it look for the light the entrance of he friend cut short he struggle ii maisie lay on the couch in the library and anne sit with she maisie 's eye have be close but now they have open and anne see they look at she and smile you be a darling anne but i wish you would go with jerrold i do not i would not have like it a bit _ he _ would though not when he

exercise and he think it be awfully bad for you knock it all off now dear old jerry of course he must think it frightfully stupid but i can not help it anne i can not do thing now like i use to i have get to be careful but -- why because there be something wrong with my heart jerry do not know it i do not want he to know you do not mean seriously wrong not very serious but it hurt hurt yes and the pain frighten I every time it come i think i be go to die but i do not die oh -- _ maisie _ -- what sort of pain a disgusting pain anne as if it be full of splintered glass mix up with bubble blood cutting and tear it grab at you and you choke you feel as if you face would burst you be afraid to breathe for fear it should come again but maisie that be angina it be not real angina but it be awful all the same oh anne what must the real thing be like have you see a doctor yes two a man in london and a man in torquay do they say it be not the real thing yes it be all nerve but it be every bit as bad as if it be real except that i can not die of it poor little maisie -- i do not know i do not mean you to know but i _ have _ to tell somebody it be so awful be by yourself with it and be frightened and then i be afraid all the time of jerrold finding out i be afraid of he _ see _ I when it come on but maisie darling he ought to know you ought to tell he no i have not tell my father and mother because they would tell he luckily it be only come on in the night so that he have not see but it might come on anywhere any minute if i be excited or anything that be the awful thing anne i be afraid of get excited i be afraid to feel i be afraid of everything that make I feel i be afraid of jerrold 's touch I even of he say something nice to I the least thing make my silly heart tumble about and if it tumble too much the pain come i dare not let jerrold sleep with I yet you have not tell he no i dare not you _ must _ tell he maisie i will not he would mind horribly he would be frightened and miserable and i can not bear he to be frightened and miserable he be have enough he be be through the war i do not mean that that frighten he but this would do you mean to say he do not see it bless you no he just think i be tiresome and hysterical i would rather he think that than see he unhappy nothing in the world matter but jerrold you see i care for he so frightfully you do not know how awful it be care like that and yet have to beat he back all the time never to give he anything i dare not let he come near I because of that ghastly fright i know you ought not to be afraid of pain but it be a pain that make you afraid be afraid 's all part of it so i can not help it of course you can not help it i would not mind if it be not for jerry i ought never to have marry he but maisie i can not understand it you be always so happy and calm how can you be calm and happy with _ that _ hang over you i have get to be calm for fear of it and i be happy because jerrold 's there simply know that he be there i can not think what i would do anne if he be not such a angel some man would not be they would not stand it and that make I care all the more he 'll never know how i care you must tell he there it be i dare not even try to tell he i just live in perpetual funk and you be the bravest thing that ever live oh i have get to cover it up it would not do to show it but i be glad i have tell you she lean back panting i must not talk -- any more now no rest you will not mind but -- get a book -- and read you 'll be -- so bored she shut she eye anne get a book and try to read it but the word run together gray line tangle on a white page nothing be clear to she but the fact that maisie have tell the truth about herself it be the worst thing that have happen yet it be the supreme reproach the ultimate disaster and defeat yet maisie have not tell she anything that surprise she this be the certainty that hide behind the defence of they think the certainty she have foresee when jerrold tell she about maisie 's coldness it mean that jerrold could not escape and that he punishment would be even worse than hers nothing that maisie could have do would have be more terrible to jerrold than she illness and the way she have hide it from he the poor darling go in terror of it lie in bed alone night after night shut in with she terror jerrold be utterly vulnerable he belief in maisie 's indifference have be he only protection against remorse how be he go to bear maisie 's wound love how would he take the knowledge of it anne see what must come of he know it would be the end of they happiness after this they would have to give each other up he would never take she in he arm again he would never come to she again in the field between midnight and dawn they could not go on unless they tell maisie the truth and they could not tell maisie the truth now because the truth would bring the pain back to she poor little heart they could never be straight with she they would have to hide what they have do for ever maisie have silence they for ever when she get she truth in first to anne it be not thinkable either that they should go on be lover know about maisie or that she should keep she knowledge to herself she would tell jerrold and end it iii she stay on with maisie till the evening jerrold have come back and be walk home with she through the manor field when she make up she mind that she would tell he now at the next gate -- the next -- when they come to the belt of fir she would tell he she stop he there by the fence of the plantation the darkness hide they from each other only they face and anne 's white coat glimmer through wait a minute jerrold i want to tell you something about maisie he draw himself up abruptly and she feel the sudden start and check of he hurt mind you have not tell she he say no it be something she tell I she do not want you to know but you have get to know it you think she do not care for you and she do she care awfully but -- she be ill ill she be not anne she only think she be i know maisie you do not know that she get heart attack frightful pain jerrold pain that terrify she my god -- you do not mean she be get _ angina _ not the real kind if it be that she would be dead but pain so bad that she think she be die every time it be what they call false angina that be why she do not want you to sleep with she for fear it 'll come on and you 'll see she through the darkness she could feel the vibration of he shock it come to she in he stillness you say she do not feel she be afraid to feel because feeling bring it on he speak at last why on earth could not she tell I that because she love you so awfully the poor darling do not want you to be unhappy about she as if that matter it matter more than anything to she do you really mean that she be get that hellish thing who tell she what it be some london doctor and a man at torquay i shall take she up to-morrow and make she see a specialist if you do you must not let she know i tell you or she 'll never tell I anything again what be i to say say you have be worry about she god know i ought to have be you be worry about she and you think there be something wrong if she say there be not you 'll say that be what you want to be sure of look here how do those fellow know it be not the real thing oh they can tell that by the state of she heart i do not suppose for a moment it be the real thing she would not be alive if it be and you do not die of false angina it be all nerve though it hurt like sin he be silent for a second anne -- she be beat we we can not tell she now no and we can not go on if we can not be straight about it we have get to give each other up i know we can not go on there be nothing more to be say he voice drop on she ache heart with the toneless weight of finality we have get to end it now this minute she say do not come any farther let I go to the bottom of the field no i be not go that way he have come close to she now close as though he would have take she in he arm for the last night the last time he want to touch she to hold she back from the swallow darkness but she move out of he reach and he do not follow she he passion be ready to flame up if he touch she and he be afraid they must end it clean without a word or a touch the grass drive between the fir lead to a gate on the hill road that skirt the manor field he know that she would go from he that way because she do not want to pass by they shelter at the bottom she could not sleep in it tonight he stand still and watch she go she white coat glimmer in the darkness between the black row of fir the white gate glimmer at the end of the drive she stand there a moment he see she slip like a white ghost between the gate and the gate post he hear the light thud of the wooden latch fall back behind she and she be go xvii jerrold maisie anne eliot i maisie lay in bed helpless and abandon to she illness it be no good try to cover it up and hide it any more jerrold know the night when he leave anne he have go up to maisie in she room he could not rest unless he know that she be all right he have stoop over she to kiss she and she have sit up hold she face to he she hand clasp round he neck draw he close to she when suddenly the pain grip she and she lay back in he arm choke struggle for breath jerrold think she be die he wait till the pain pass and she be quiet then he run downstairs and telephone for ransome he look on in agony while ransome 's stethoscope wander over maisie 's thin breast and back it seem to he that ransome be take a unusually long time about it that he must be on the track of some terrible discovery and when ransome take the tube from he ear and say curtly heart quite sound nothing wrong there he be convince that ransome be a old fool who do not know he business or else he be lie for maisie 's sake downstairs in the library he turn on he look here there be no good lie to I i want truth my dear field i should not dream of lie to you there be nothing wrong with you wife 's heart nothing organically wrong with that pain she be in agony ransome agony why can not you tell I at once that it be angina because it be not not the real thing false angina 's a neurosis not a heart disease get the nervous condition cure and she 'll be all right have she have any worry any shock not that i know any cause for worry he hesitate poor maisie have have cause enough if she have know but she do not know it seem to he that ransome be look at he queerly no he say none you be quite certain have she ever have any well i suppose she be pretty jumpy all the time i be at the front before that year ago that i do not know i should say not you will not swear no i will not swear it would be year before we be marry try and find out say ransome and keep she quiet and happy she would better stay in bed for a week or two so maisie stay in bed and jerrold and anne sit with she together or in turn he have a bed make up in she room and sleep there when he sleep at all but half the night he lay awake listen for the sound of she panting and the little gasping cry that would come when the pain get she he keep on get up to look at she and make sure that she be sleep he be change from he old happy careless self the self that use to turn from any trouble that refuse to believe that the people it love could be ill and die he be convince that maisie 's state be dangerous he send for dr harper of cheltenham and for a nerve specialist and a heart specialist from london and they all tell he the same thing and he would not believe they because maisie 's death be the most unbearable thing that he remorse could imagine he feel that nothing short of maisie 's death would appease the power that punish he he be the more certain that maisie would die because he have deny that she be ill for jerrold 's mind remember everything and anticipate nothing like most man who refuse to see or foresee trouble he be crush by it when it come the remorse he feel might have be less intolerable if he have be alone in it but day after day he pain be intensify by the sight of anne 's pain she be exquisitely vulnerable and for every pang that stab she he feel himself responsible what they have do they have do together and they suffer for it together but in the begin she have do it for he and he have make she do it nobody not even maisie could have be more innocent than anne he have no doubt that leave to herself she would have hide she passion from he to the end of time he therefore be the cause of she suffering it be as if anne 's consciousness be transfer to he day after day when they sit together in maisie 's room one on each side of she bed while maisie lay between they sleep she helpless and reproachful sleep and he see anne 's piteous face white with pain he pity for maisie and he pity for anne they pity for each other be mix together and hold they close as passion in a unbearable communion they look at each other and they wound eye say day after day the same thing : yes it hurt but i could bear it if it be not for you they pity take the place of passion it be as if a part of each other pass into they with they suffering as it have pass into they with they joy ii and through it all they passion itself still live its inextinguishable and tortured life pity so far from destroy it only make it stronger pour in its own emotion wave after wave swell the flood that carry they towards the warm darkness where will and think would cease and as jerrold 's soul have once stir in the warm darkness under the first stinging of remorse so now it push and struggle to be bear all he will fight against the darkness to deliver he soul he soul know that anne save it if she will have be weaker he would not have be so strong at this moment a unscrupulous anne might have damned he to the sensual hell by cling to he pity he would have sin because he be sorry for she but anne 's will refuse he pity when he show it she be angry yet it be there wait for she always against she will one day in October -lrb- maisie 's illness last on into the autumn -rrb- they have go out into the garden to breathe the cold clean air while maisie sleep jerrold she say suddenly do you think she know no i be certain she do not i be not i have a awful feeling that she know and that be why she do not get better i do not think so if she know she would have say something or do something she might not she might not do anything perhaps she be just be angelically good to we she _ be _ angelically good but she do not know you forget she illness begin before there _ be _ anything to know it be not the sort of thing she have think of if somebody tell she she would not believe it she trust we absolutely that be bad enough anne without she know yes it be bad enough it be worse really i know it be anne -- i be awfully sorry to have let you in for all this misery you must not be sorry you have not let I in for it nobody could have know it would have happen it would not if maisie have be different we would not have bother then nothing would have matter think how gloriously happy we be all my life all my happiness have come through you or because of you we would be happy still if it be not for maisie i do not see how we be to go on like this i can not stand it when you be not happy and nothing make any difference really i want you so awfully all the time that be one of the thing we must not say to each other i know we must not only i do not want you to think i do not i do not think it i know you 'll care for I as long as you live only you must not say so you must not be sorry for I it make I feel all weak and soft when i want to be strong and hard you _ be _ strong anne so be you i should not love you if you be not but we must not make it too hard for each other you know what 'll happen if we do what you mean we would crumple up and give in no but we could not ever see each other alone again never see each other again at all perhaps i would have to go away you sha not have to i swear i will not say another word sometimes i think it would be easier for you if i go it would not it would be simply damnable you can not go anne that _ would _ make maisie think iii after week of rest maisie pass into a period of painless tranquillity she have no longer any fear of she illness because she have no longer any fear of jerrold 's know about it he do know and yet she world stand firm round she firmer than when he have not know for she have now in jerrold 's ceaseless devotion what seem to she the absolute proof that he care for she if she have ever doubt it and if he have doubt she have not he the absolute proof that she care desperately would she have so hide the truth from he would she have bear she pain and the fear of it in that awful lonely secrecy if she have not care for he more than for anything on earth she have be more afraid to sleep alone than poor colin who have wake they with he scream jerrold know that she be not a brave woman like anne or colin 's wife queenie it be out of she love for he that she have draw the courage that make she face night after night the horror of she torment alone if he have want proof what better proof could he have than that so maisie remain tranquil secure in she love for jerrold and in he love for she while anne and jerrold be tortured by they love for each other they be no longer sustain in they renunciation by the sight of maisie 's illness and the fear of it which more than anything have hold back they passion without that warn fear they be expose at every turn it might be there wait for they in the background but with maisie go about as if nothing have happen even remorse have lose its protective poignancy they suffer the strain of perpetual frustration they be never alone together now they have pass from each other beyond all contact of spirit with spirit and flesh with flesh beyond all word and look of longing they have nothing of each other but sight sight that have all the violence of touch without its satisfaction that serve only to excite they to torture they with desire they might be hold at arm 's length at a room 's length at a field 's length apart but they eye draw they together set they heart beat in one moment of see they be join and put asunder and day after day they mind desire each other with a subtle incessant intensely conscious longing and be utterly cut off from all communion they meet now at longer and longer interval for they work separate they colin have come home in October perfectly recover and he and jerrold manage the manor estate together while anne look after she own farm jerrold never see she he never try to see she unless colin or maisie or some of the farm people be present he be afraid and anne know that he be afraid she sense of he danger make she feel herself fragile and unstable she too avoid every occasion of see he alone and this separation so far from save they defeat its own end every day it bring they nearer to the breaking point it be against all nature and all nature be against it they have always before they that vision of the point at which they would give in always there be one think that draw they to the edge of surrender : i can bear it for myself but i can not bear it for he i can bear it for myself but i can not bear it for she and to both of they have come another fear greater than they dread of maisie 's pain the fear of each other 's illness they splendid physical health be begin to break down they work harder than ever on the land but hard work exhaust they at the end of the day they go on from a sense of duty dull and implacable but they have no more pleasure in it anne become every night more restless every day more tired and anaemic jerrold eat less and sleep less they grow thin and they face take on the same look of fatigue and anxiety and wonder as if more than anything they be amaze at a world whose be connive at and tolerate they pain maisie see it and feel the first vague disturbance of she peace she illness have worry everybody while it last but she could not think why when she be well again anne and jerrold should go on look like that maisie think it be physical the poor dear work too hard the change have be so gradual that she see it without consternation but when eliot come down in November he could not hide he distress to eliot the significant thing be not anne 's illness or jerrold 's illness but the likeness in they illness the likeness in they face it be clear that they suffer together with the same suffering from the same cause and when on he last evening jerrold take he into the library to consult he about maisie 's case eliot have a hard straight talk with he about he own my dear jerrold he say there be nothing seriously wrong with maisie i have examine she heart it be not a particularly strong heart but there be no disease in it if you take she to all the specialist in europe they would tell you the same thing i know but i keep on worry that my dear chap be because you be ill yourself i do not like it i be not bother about maisie but i be bother about you and anne anne do you think _ anne 's _ ill i think she will be and so will you if what have you be do we have be do nothing that be it you have get to do something and do it pretty quick if it be to be any good jerrold start and look up he wonder whether eliot know he have a way of get at thing you could not tell how what d'you mean what be you talk about he word come with a sudden sharp rapidity you know what i mean i do not know how _ you _ know anything and as a matter of fact you do not i do not know much but i know enough to see that you two can not go on like this maisie and I no you and anne it be anne i be talk about i suppose you can make a mess of you own life if you like you have no business to make a mess of hers my god as if i do not know it what the devil be i to do leave she alone jerrold if you can not have she leave she alone i _ be _ leave she alone i have get to leave she alone if we both die of it she ought to go away eliot say she sha not go away unless i go with she and i can not ' well then it be a impossible situation it be a damnable situation but it be the only decent one you forget there be maisie no i do not maisie do not know oh lord no and she never will you ought to tell she jerrold be silent my dear jerrold it be the only sensible thing tell she straight and get she to divorce you i be go to then she get ill and i could not she be not ill now she will be if i tell she it 'll simply kill she it will not it may -- even -- cure she it 'll make she frightfully unhappy and it 'll bring back that infernal pain if you would see she eliot you would know how impossible it be we simply can not be swine and if i could anne could not no we have get to stick it somehow anne and i it be all wrong jerrold i know it be all wrong but it be the best we can do you do not suppose anne would be happy if we do maisie down no no she would not you be right there but it be a damnable business oh damnable yes jerrold laugh in he agony yet he see as if he have never see it before eliot 's goodness and the sadness and beauty of he love for anne he have bear for year what jerrold be bear now and anne have not love he he have never know for one moment the bliss of love or any joy he have have nothing and jerrold remember with a pang of contrition that he have never care enough for eliot it have always be colin the young breakable colin who have cling to he and follow he eliot have always go he own queer way keep himself apart and now eliot be nearer to he than anything in the world except anne i be sorry jerrold you be pretty decent eliot to be sorry -- i believe you honestly want I to have anne i would not go so far as that old man but i believe i honestly want anne to have you i say she have not go yet have she no maisie 's keep she for dinner in you honor you 'll probably find she in the drawing-room now where 's maisie she will not worry you she be go to lie down eliot go into the drawing-room and find anne there she look at he you have be talk to jerrold she say yes anne i be worried about he so be i and i be worried about you and he be worried about maisie yes i suppose he begin by not see she be ill and now he do see it he think she be go to die i have be try to explain to he that she be not can you explain why she be get into this state it be not as if she be not happy she _ be _ happy she be not always happy jerrold must have make she suffer damnably when oh long before he marry she but _ how _ do he make she suffer oh by just not marry she she find out he do not care for she she people take she out to indium i believe with the idea that he would marry she and when they see that jerry be not on in that act they send she back again poor maisie get it well ram into she then that he do not care for she and the idea 's stick it be leave a sort of wound in she memory but she must have think he care for she when he do marry she she think he care now of course she think it i do not suppose he be ever let she see i know he have not but the wound 's there all the same she be never get over it though she be not conscious of it now the fact remain that maisie 's marriage be incomplete because jerry do not care for she part of maisie the adorable part we know be not aware of any incompleteness it live in a perpetual illusion but the part we do not know the hidden secret part of she be aware of nothing else well she illness be simply camouflage for that maisie 's mind could not bear the reality so it escape into a neurosis maisie 's behave as though she be not marry so that she mind can say to itself that she marriage be incomplete because she be ill not because jerry do not care for she it be substitute a bearable situation for a unbearable one then you do not think she _ know _ that jerrold do not care for she no only in that unconscious way she mind remember and _ she _ do not i mean she do not know about jerrold and I i be sure she do not if she do she would do something that be what jerrold say what would she do oh something beautiful or it would not be maisie she would let jerrold go yes she would let he go and she would die of it oh no she would not i tell jerrold just now it might cure she how _ could _ it cure she by make she face reality by make she see that she illness simply mean that she have not face it all we neurosis come because we dare not live with the truth it be no good making maisie well if we make she unhappy besides i do not believe it if maisie 's unhappy she 'll be worse not better there _ be _ just that risk he say but it be you i be think about not maisie you see i do not know what be happen jerrold do not tell you he only tell I what i know already after all what _ do _ you know i know you be all right you and he when i see you together here in the spring so i suppose you be happy then jerrold look wretchedly ill all the time he be at taormina so i suppose he be unhappy then because he be away from you he look wretchedly ill now so do you so i suppose you be both unhappy yes we be both unhappy do you want to tell I about it anne no i do not want to tell you about it only if i think you still want to marry I -- i do want to marry you i shall always want to marry you i tell you long ago nothing would ever make any difference even if -- even if -- whatever you do or do not do i would still want you but i tell you -- do not you remember -- that you could never do anything dishonourable or cruel and i tell you i be not sure and i be sure that be enough for I i do not want to know anything more i do not want to know anything you would rather i do not know oh eliot you _ be _ so good you be good like maisie do not worry about jerry and I we 'll see it through somehow and if you can not stand the strain of it but i can and if _ he _ can not if you want to be safe -- i tell you i should never want to be safe if you want _ he _ to be safe then would you marry I that be different i do not know eliot but i do not think so he go away with a faint hope she have say it would be different what she would never do for he she might do for jerrold she might after all marry he to keep jerrold safe nothing make any difference whatever anne do she would still be anne and it be anne he love and after all what do he know about she and jerrold only that if they have be lover that would account for they strange happiness seven month ago if they have give each other up this would account for they unhappiness now he think : how they must have struggle perhaps some day when the whole story be tell and anne be tire of struggle she would come to he and he would marry she even if -- xviii jerrold and anne i the barrow farm house long low and gray stand back behind the tall elm and turn its blank north gable end to the road and the manor farm its nine mullioned window look down the field to the river and the great barn be pile behind it long roof-tree steep mouse-coloured slope and peak above gray wall anne do not move into the barrow farm house all at once she have to wait while jerrold have the place make beautiful for she this be the only thing that rouse he to any interest through all he misery he could still find pleasure in the work of throw small room into one to make more space for anne and put window into the south gable to give she the sun anne 's garden absorb he more than he own seven hundred acre maisie and he plan it together walk round the rank flower-bed and bald waste scratch up by the hen there be to be a flagged court on one side and a grass plot on the other with a flower garden between here maisie say there should be great clump of larkspur and there a lavender hedge they say how nice it would be for anne to watch the garden grow he be go to make it so beautiful that you 'll want to stay in it forever she say and anne go with they and listen to they and tell they they be angel and pretend to be excite about she house and garden while all the time she heart ache and she be too tired to care the house be finish by the end of November and jerrold and maisie help she to furnish it maisie send to london for pattern and bring they to anne to choose maisie think perhaps the chintz with the cream and pink rose or the one with the green leaf and red tulip and blue and purple clemati be the prettiest anne try to behave as if all she happiness depend on a pattern and end by choose the one that maisie like best and the furniture go where maisie think it should go because anne be too tired to care besides she

would treat the house as if it be she own i probably shall do not be surprise if you hear I give order to the servant i really can not consider that wilkin belong to anybody but I maisie hope that adeline would not consider that he do not and there be a pause adeline look at the clock and see that there be still another half-hour till tea time how could they possibly fill it in then suddenly from a thought of jerrold so incredibly marry to maisie adeline 's mind wander to anne be anne dining here tonight she say and maisie say yes she think adeline and mr severn would like to see as much as possible of anne and adeline say that be very kind of maisie and be bore again she see nothing before she but more and more boredom and the subject of anne alone hold out the prospect of relief she fly to it as she would have flee from any danger by the way maisie if i be you i would not let anne see too much of jerrold why not because my dear it be not good for she i should have think maisie say it be very good for both of they as they like each other i should never dream of interfere with they friendship that be the way people get themselves thoroughly dislike i do not want jerry to dislike I or anne either i like they to feel that if he _ be _ marry they can go on be friend just the same oh of course if you like it -- i do like it say maisie firmly firm opposition be a thing that adeline 's wilfulness could never stand it always make she either change the subject or revert to she original statement this time she revert my point be that it be not fair to anne why be not it because she be in love with he that say maisie with increase decision i do _ not _ believe i have never see any sign of it you be the only person who have not then it stick out of she if it be a secret i should not have tell you it be a secret to I say maisie so i think you might let it alone you ought to know it if nobody else do we have all of we know about anne for age she be always quite

they be both utterly reckless they do not care who suffer so long as they get what they want if anne have the moral of a -- of a mouse she have clear out i think john say you be mistaken anne be not like that i hope you have not say anything to maisie adeline make a face at he as much as to say what do you take I for she lift up she charming wilful face and powdered it carefully iii the earth smell of the coming rain all night the tree have whisper of rain come to-morrow now they wait at noon the wind drop thick cloud the color of dirty sheep 's wool pack tight by they own movement roof the sky and wall it round hang close to the horizon a slight heaving and swell in the gray mass pack it tighter it be pregnant with rain here and there a steam vapor break from it as if puff out by some immense interior commotion thin tissue detach themselves and hang like a fray hem lengthen streaming to the hilltop in the west anne be go up the field towards the manor and jerrold be come down towards the manor farm they meet at the plantation as the first big drop fall he call out to she i say you ought not to be out a day like this anne have be ill all January with a slight touch of pleurisy after a cold that she have take no care of i be go to see maisie you be _ not _ he say it be go to rain like fury maisie know i do not mind rain anne say and laugh maisie would have a fit if she know you be out in it look how it be come down over there westwards and northwards the round roof and wall of cloud be shake and the black rain hang sheeted between sky and earth overhead the dark tissue thin out and lengthen the fir tree quiver they give out slight creak crackle noise as the rain come down it pour off each of the sloping fir branch like a jet from a tap we must make a dash for it jerrold say and they run together laugh down the field to anne 's shelter at the bottom he push back the slide door the rain drum on the roof and go hiss along the soaked ground it spray out as the grass bent and part under it every hollow tuft be a water spout the field be dim behind the shine glassy bead curtain of the rain the wind rise again and shake the rain curtain and blow it into the shelter rain scud across the floor wet they where they stand jerrold slide the door to they be safe now from the downpour anne 's bed stand in the corner tuck up in its gray blanket they sit down on it side by side for a moment they be silent hold by they memory they be shut in there with they past it come up to they close and live out of the bright alien mystery of the rain he put he hand on the shoulder of anne 's coat to feel if it be wet at he touch she tremble it have not go through have it no she say and cough again anne i hate that cough of yours you never have a cough before i have never have pleurisy before you would not have have it if you have not be frightfully run down it be all over now she say it be not you may get it again i do not feel as if you be safe for one minute be you warm quite be you foot wet no no no do not worry jerry dear i be all right i would not worry if i be with you all the time it be not see you not know do not she say i can not bear it and they be silent again they silence be more real to they than the sound storm there be danger in it it draw they back and back it be poignant and reminiscent it come to they like the long stillness before they passion they have wait here before like this through moment tense and increase for the supreme topple instant of they joy they mind go round and round look for word to break the silence and finding none they be hold there by they danger at last anne speak do you think it be over no it be only just begin the rain hurl itself against the window as if it would pluck they out into the storm it brim over from the roof like water pour out from a bucket we 'll have to sit tight till it stop he say silence again long inveterate dangerous every now and then anne cough the short hard cough that hurt and frighten he he know he ought to leave she every minute increase they danger but he could not go he feel that after all they might have do and have not do heaven have some scheme of compensation in which it owe they this moment she turn from he cough and that sign of she weakness the sight of she thin shoulder shake fill he with pity that be passion itself he think of the injustice life have heap on anne 's innocence of the cruelty that have track she and hunt she down of he own complicity with she suffering he think of he pity for maisie as treachery to anne of he honor as cowardice instead of pile up wall after wall he ought never to have let anything come between he and anne not even maisie not even he honor he honor belong to anne far more than to maisie the rest have be he own blundering folly and he have no right to let anne be punish for it a hour ago the wall have stand solid between they now a furious impulse seize he to tear they down and get through to she this time he would hold she and never let she go he thought go the way he passion go then suddenly she turn and they look at each other and he think no more all he thought go down in the hot rush darkness of he blood anne he say anne -- he voice sound like a cry they stand up suddenly and be sweep together he hold she tight shut in he arm he body strain to she they cling to each other as if only by cling they could stand against the hot darkness that drown they and the more they cling the more it come over they wave after wave then in the darkness he hear she cry to he to let she go do not make I jerrold do not make I yes yes no oh why do we ever come here he press she closer and she try to push he off with weak hand that have once be strong he feel she breakable in he arm and utterly defenceless i can not she cry i should feel as if maisie be there and look at we do not make I suddenly he let she go he be beat by the sheer weakness of she struggle he could not fight for he flesh like a brute against that helplessness if i go you 'll stay here till the rain stop yes i be sorry jerry you 'll get so wet that make he laugh and laugh he leave she then tear come cut through he eyelid like blood from a dry wound they mix with the rain and blind he and anne sit on the little gray bed in she shelter and stare out at the rain and cry xix anne and eliot i she know what she would do now she would go away and never see jerrold again never while they youth last while they could still feel she would go out of england so far away that they could not meet she would go to canada and farm all night she lay awake with she mind fix on the one thought of go away there be nothing else to be do no room for worry or hesitation they could not hold out any longer she and jerrold strained to the breaking-point tortured with the sight of each other as she lay awake there come to she the peace that come with all immense and clear decision she mind would never be tear and divide any more and towards morning she fall asleep she wake dull and bewilder she mind struggle with a sense of appalling yet undefined disaster something have happen overnight she could not remember what something have happen no something be go to happen she try to fall back into sleep fighting against the return of consciousness it come on wave after wave beat she down now she remember she be go away she would never see jerrold again she be go to canada the sharp clear name make the whole thing real and irrevocable it be something that would actually happen soon to she she be go and when she have go she would not come back she get up and look out of the window she see the green field slope down to the river and the road and beyond the road to the right the rise of the manor field and the belt of fir and in she mind more real than they the manor house the garden and the many-coloured hill beyond roll curve after curve to the straight dark-blue horizon the scene that hold she childhood all she youth all she happiness that have draw she back again and again in memory and in dream make she heart ache how could she leave it how could she live with that pain if she be go to be a coward if she be go to be afraid of pain -- how be she to escape it how be jerrold to escape if she stay on they would break down together and give in they would be lover again and again maisie 's sweet wound face would come between they they could never get away from it and in the end they remorse would be as unbearable as they separation she could not drag jerrold through that agony again no life be not worth live if you be a coward and afraid and under all she misery anne have still the sense that life be somehow worth live even if it make you miserable life be either you friend or you enemy if it be you friend you serve it if it be you enemy you stand up to it and refuse to let it beat you and you enemy become you servant whatever happen you work remain still there would be plough and sowing and reap and plough again still the earth wait she think of the unknown canadian earth that wait for she tilling jerrold be not a coward he be not afraid -- well only afraid of the people he love get ill and die and she be not go to get ill and die she would have to tell he she would go to he in the field and tell he but before she do that she must make the thing irrevocable so anne write to the steamship company book she passage in two week ' time she write to eliot ask he to call at the company 's office and see if he could get she a decent cabin she go to wyck and post she letter

perhaps he would have love she and marry she if it have not be for I and yet anne have love she that be anne 's beauty she wonder next : if anne have be in love with jerrold all that time and if they have all see it all the fielding and john severn how be it that she have never see it she have see nothing but a perfect friendship and she have try to keep it for they in all its perfection so that neither of they should miss anything because jerrold have marry she she remember how happy anne have be when she first know she and she think : if she be happy then why be she unhappy now if she love jerrold all she life if she have do without he all she life why go away now unless something have happen it be then that maisie thought of jerrold and he sad draw face and he sudden sickness the other day that be the day he have be with anne when she have tell he that she be go away he have never be the same since he have neither sleep nor eat maisie have all the piece of the puzzle loose before she and at first sight not one of they look as if it would fit but this piece under she hand fit jerrold 's illness join on to anne 's go with a terrible dread in she heart maisie put the two thing together and see the third thing jerrold be ill because anne be go away he would not be ill unless he care for she and another thing anne be go away not because she care but because jerrold care therefore she know that he care for she therefore he have tell she that be what have happen when she have put all the piece into they place she would have the whole story but maisie do not want to know any more she have enough to make she heart break she still cling to she belief in they goodness they be unhappy because they have give each other up and under all she thinking like a quick-running pain there go she premonition of its end she remember that they have be happy once when she first know they if they be unhappy now because they have give each other up have they be happy then because they have not for a moment she ask herself be they -- and be afraid to finish and answer she own question it be enough that they be all unhappy now and that none of they would ever be happy again not anne not jerrold _ they _ unhappiness do not bear thinking of and in thinking of it maisie forget she own she heart shake she breast with its beating and for a moment she wonder whether she pain be begin again then the thought of anne and jerrold and herself and of they threefold undivided misery come upon she annihilate every other thought as if all that be physical in maisie be subdue by the intensity of she suffering with the come of the supreme emotion she body have no pain xx maisie jerrold and anne i she get up and dress for dinner as if nothing have happen or rather as if everything be about to happen and she be go through with it magnificently with no sign that she be beat she do not know yet what she would do she do not see clearly what there be to be do she might not have to do anything and yet again vaguely half-fascinated half-frightened she foresee that she might be call on to do something something that be hard and terrible and at the same time beautiful and supreme and downstairs in the hall she find eliot he tell she that he have come down to see anne and that he have do he best to keep she from go away and that it be all no good we can not stop she she be get a unbreakable will unbreakable she say and yet she be broken i know he say in she nervous exaltation she feel that eliot have be send that eliot know eliot be wise he would help she eliot -- she say will you see I in the library after dinner i want to ask you something if it be about anne i do not know that there be anything i can say it be about jerrold she say after

what will you do do there be only one thing i _ can _ do she turn to he and she milk-white face be grey-white ashen the skin have a slack pit look suddenly old the soft flesh tremble but she mouth and eye be still in this moment of she agony no base emotion deface they sweetness so that she seem to he utterly compose she have see what she could do something hard and terrible i can set he free ii that be the end she have see before she vaguely as something not only hard and terrible but beautiful and supreme to leave off cling to the illusion of she happiness to let go and with that let go she be aware that a obscure horror have be hang over she for three day and three night and be now go she stand free of herself in a great light and peace so that presently when jerrold come to she she meet he with a incomparable tranquillity jerrold -- the slight throbbing of she voice startle he come out of she stillness they stand up face each other in attitude that have no permanence as if what must pass between they now would be sudden and soon over do you care for anne the word drop clear through she stillness vibrate he eye go from she evade the issue she voice come with a sharper stress

spring only last spring yes only when i be away she remember she remember how she have first come to wyck and find jerrold happy and superbly well but she say you be happy then he sigh a long tear sigh that hurt she yes we be happy then and in a flash of terrific clarity she remember she home-coming and the night that follow it and jerrold 's acquiescence in they separation then she say if you be happy -- do you want to know how far it go i want to know everything i want the truth i think you owe I the truth it go just as far as it could go do you mean -- he stand silent and she find he word for he you be anne 's lover yes she face change before he as it have change a hour ago before eliot ashen-white and slack quiver suddenly old tear come into he eye tear of remorse and pity she

not so unhappy as if i would keep you we 'll go away somewhere where you will not have to see we no it be i who 'll go away but i want you to have the manor and -- and everything colin 'll look after

something in she that she have never see before that she could not bear to see anne 's face would show she that jerrold be she lover yet if she have never see that look if she have never see anything in anne 's face that be not beautiful what do that mean but that anne 's love for he be beautiful before it have touch she body it have live a long time in she soul either anne 's soul be beautiful because of it or it be beautiful because of anne 's soul and maisie know that if she too be to be beautiful she must keep safe the beauty of they passion as she have keep safe the beauty of they friendship it be clear and hard unbreakable as crystal _ she _ have be the one flaw in it the thing that have damage its perfection now that she have let jerrold go it would be perfect anne stand in the doorway of the library look at she and not speak she be the same that she have be yesterday and before that and before that dress in the farm clothes that be the queer rough setting of she charm
