22nd January 1871 in the morning large group of people assemble from mere curiosity appear on the place of the hôtel de ville which however wear a peaceful aspect at about half-past two in the afternoon a detachment of a hundred and fifty armed national guard issue from the rue du temple and station themselves before the hôtel de ville cry down with trochu long live the commune a short colloquy be then hold between several of the national guard and some officer of the mobile who speak with perfect calmness suddenly a shot be fire and at the same moment as in the grand scene of a melodrama the window and the great door be fling open and two line of mobile guard be see the front rank kneel the second standing and all level they musket and prepare to fire then come a volley which spread terror amidst the crowd of people in the place who precipitate themselves in all direction utter cry and shriek in another moment the place be clear ah those famous chassepot can work miracle the insurgent during this mad flight of man woman and child have answer the attack some aim from the shelter of angle and post other discharge they rifle from the window of neighbouring house then the order to cease firing be hear and a train of litterbearer wave they handkerchief as flag approach from the avenue victorium at the hôtel de ville one officer only be wound but on the place

on the other side of the champ elysées regiment of cavalry infantry and mobile be draw out the agitator have disappear calm be restore within the city be it understand for all this do not interrupt the animated interchange of shell between the french and prussian battery and a great number of parisian who have twice help to disperse the insurgent of October and January think involuntarily of the commune of the 10th of August 1793 which head the revolution and say to themselves that there be perhaps some amongst the present insurgent who like the former would rise up to deliver they from the prussian for these agitator have some appearance of truth on they side : you be weak and timorous they cry to those in power you seem await a defeat rather than expect a victory give place to the energetic obscure though they may be for the man of the great commune of we first glorious revolution they also be for the greater part unknown we have confidence in the army of pari and we will break the iron circle of invasion though the communist have since then show bravery and sometimes heroism in they struggle against the versaille troops we be very doubtful now that we have see they chief in action whether the effort they talk of would have be crown with success they object be power and have nothing to risk and all to gain they would have forthwith dispose of public property in order to procure themselves enjoyment and honor the few right-minded man who at first commit themselves prove this by the fact of they give in they resignation a few day after the commune have establish itself tranquillity have return in the morning of the 25th guard patrol the place de la bastille the place du château d'eau the boulevard magenta and the outer boulevard pari start as if she have be arouse from some fearful dream and the wake thought of the enemy at she gate stir up all she energy once more the communist have be defeat for the second time but they be soon to take a terrible revenge the vow make by the governor of pari have be repeat by the majority of the parisian and all party seem to have rally round he under the same device : vanquish or die after the fort the barricade and as a last resource the burning of the city who know perhaps the fanatic of resistance have already make out the plan of destruction which serve later for the commune it have be prove that nothing in this work of ruin be impromptu the news of the convention of the 28th of January the preliminary of the capitulation of pari be thus very badly receive and m gambetta by exhort the people in he celebrated circular of the 31st of January to resist to the death sow the seed of civil war : -- citizen -- the enemy have just inflict upon france the most cruel insult that she have yet have to endure in this accursed war the too-heavy punishment of the error and weakness of a great people pari the impregnable vanquish by famine be no longer able to hold in respect the german horde on the 28th of January the capital succumb she fort surrender to the enemy the city still remain intact wrest as it be by she own power and moral grandeur a last homage from barbarity but in fall pari leave we the glorious legacy of she heroic sacrifice during five month of privation and suffer she have give to france the time to collect herself to call she child together to find arm to compose army young as yet but valiant and determine and to whom be want only that solidity which can be obtain but by experience thanks to pari we hold in we hand if we be but resolute and patriotic all that be need to revenge and set ourselves free once more but as though evil fortune have resolve to overwhelm we something even more terrible and more fraught with anguish than the fall of pari be await we without we knowledge without either warn we or consult we a armistice the culpable weakness of which be know to we too late have be sign which deliver into the hand of the prussian the department occupy by we soldier and which oblige we to wait for three week in the midst of the disastrous circumstance in which the country be plunge before a national assembly can be assemble we send to pari for some explanation and then await in silence the promise arrival of a member of the government to whom we be determine to resign we office as delegate of government we desire to obey and thereby prove to all friend and dissident by set a example of moderation and respect of duty that democracy be not only the greatest of all political principle but also the most scrupulous of government however no one have arrive from pari and it be necessary to act come what may the perfidious machination of the enemy of france must be frustrated prussium rely upon the armistice to enervate and dissolve we army she hope that the assembly meeting after so long a succession of disaster and under the impression of the terrible fall of paris wilt be timid and weak and ready to submit to a shameful peace it be for we to upset these calculation and to turn the very instrument which be prepare to crush the spirit of resistance into spur that shall arouse and excite it let we make this same armistice into a code of instruction for we young troops let we employ the three come week in push on the organization of the defense and of the war more ardently than ever instead of the meeting of cowardly reactionist that we enemy expect let we form a assembly that shall be veritably national and republican desirous of peace if peace can ensure the honor the rank and the integrity of we country but capable of vote for war rather than aid in the assassination of france frenchman remember that we father leave we france whole and indivisible let we not be traitor to we history let we not deliver up we traditional domain into the hand of barbarian who then will sign the armistice not you legitimist who fight so valiantly under the flag of the republic in the defense of the ancient kingdom of france nor you son of the bourgeois of 1789 whose work be to unite the old province in a pact of indissoluble union nor you workman of the town whose intelligence and generous patriotism represent france in all she strength and grandeur the leader of modern nation nor you tiller of the soil who never have spare you blood in the defense of the revolution which give you the ownership of you land and you title of citizen no not one frenchman will be find to sign this infamous act the enemy 's attempt to mutilate france will be frustrate for animated with the same love of the mother country and bear we reverse with fortitude we shall become strong once more and drive out the foreign legion to the attainment of this noble end we must devote we heart we will we life and a still greater sacrifice perhaps put aside we preference we must close we rank about the republic show presence of mind and strength of purpose and without passion or weakness swear like free man to defend france and the republic against all and everyone to arm the government by obtain from m de bismarck a condition that the national guard should retain they arm hope to win public favor again as one offer a rattle to a fractious child to keep he quiet and it publish the news on the 3rd of February : after the most strenuous effort on we part we have obtain for the national guard the condition ratify by the convention of the 28th January three day after on the 6th of February gambetta write : he conscience would not permit he to remain a member of a government with which he no longer agree in principle the candidate elect in

the party of reaction the member of which have be so well-known since under the name of _ rural _ loud murmur arise in the rank of the national guard when the decree of the 18th and 19th of February concern they pay be publish and later when a order from headquarters require the march company to send in to the state depôt all they campaigning paraphernalia on the 18th of February m thier be name chief of the executive power by a vote of the assembly on Sunday the 26th of February the place de la bastille in which manifestation have be hold for the last two day in celebration of the revolution of February '48 become as a shrine to which whole battalion of the national guard march to the sound of music they flag adorn with cap of liberty and cockade the column of July be hang with banner and decorate with wreath of immortelle violent harangue the theme of which be the uphold of the republic to the death be utter at its foot one man of the name of budaille pretend that he hold proof of the treachery of the government for the national defense and promise that he would produce they at the proper time and place up to this moment the demonstration seem to have but one result -- that of impede circulation but they soon give rise to scene of tumult and disorder towards one o'clock when perhaps twenty or thirty thousand person be on the above place a individual accuse of be a spy be drag by a infuriate mob to the river and flung bind hand and foot into the look by the ile saint loui amidst the wild cry and imprecation of the madman whose prey he have become the night of the 26th be very agitate drum beat to arm and on the morning of the 27th the commander-in-chief of the national guard issue a proclamation in which he appeal to the good citizen of pari and confide the care of the city to the national guard this have no effect however on the aspect of the place de la bastille the crowd continue to applaud frantically the incendiary speech of the socialist party who have swear to raise paris at any cost -lrb- illustration : column of July place de la bastille -rrb- on the same day the 27th of February the government inform the people of pari of the result of the negociation with prussium in the follow proclamation : the government appeal to you patriotism and you wisdom you hold in you hand the future of pari and of france herself it be for you to save or to ruin both after a heroic resistance famine force you to open you gate to the victorious enemy the army that should have come to you aid be drive over the loire these incontestable fact have compel the government for the national defense to open negotiation of peace for six day you negotiator have dispute the ground foot by foot they do all that be humanly possible to obtain less rigorous condition they have sign the preliminary of peace which be about to be submit to the national assembly during the time necessary for the examination and discussion of these preliminary hostility would have recommence and blood would have flow afresh and uselessly without a prolongation of the armistice this prolongation could only be obtain on the condition of a partial and very temporary occupation of a portion of paris : absolutely to be limit to the quarter of the champ elysées not more than thirty thousand man be to enter the city and they be to retire as soon as the preliminary of peace have be ratify which act can only occupy a few day if this convention be not to be respect the armistice would be at a end : the enemy already master of the fort would occupy the whole of pari by force you property you work of art you monument now guarantee by the convention would cease to exist the misfortune would reach the whole of france the frightful ravages of the war which have not heretofore pass the loire would extend to the pyrenee it be then absolutely true to say that the salvation of france be at stake do not imitate the error of those who would not listen to we when eight month ago we abjure they not to undertake a war which must be fatal the french army which defend pari with so much courage will occupy the left of the seine to ensure the loyal execution of the new armistice it be for the national guard to lend its aid by keep order in the rest of the city let all good citizen who earn honor as its chief and show themselves so brave before the enemy reassume they authority and the cruel situation of the moment will be terminate by peace and the return of public prosperity this clause of the occupation of pari by the prussian be regard by some people as a mere satisfaction of national vanity but the greater number consider it as a apple of discord throw by m de bismarck who have every reason to desire that civil war should break out thus make himself a accomplice of the socialist and the member of the international confine ourselves simply to the analysis of fact and to those consideration which may enlighten public opinion respect the cause of event we shall not allow ourselves to be carry over the vast field of hypothesis but preserve the modest character of narrator on the night of the 27th of February the admiral command the third section of the fortification have notice the hostile attitude of the national guard cause the troops which have be disarm in accordance with the condition of the armistice to withdraw into the interior of the city the man of belleville profit by the circumstance to pillage the powder magazine which have be entrust to they charge and on the follow day they go precede by drum and trumpet to the barracks of the rue de la pépinière to invite the sailor lodge there to join they in a patriotic manifestation on that night believe that the object be to prevent the prussian enter paris a certain number of these brave fellow who have behave so admirably during the siege set out towards the place de la bastille but have be meet on they way by some of they officer they soon separate themselves from the rioter thirty of they have be invite to a open-air banquet in the place de la bastille but see the probability of some disorder they nearly all retire and on the follow morning only eight of they be miss at the roll-call not one of the six thousand marine lodge in the barracks of the ecole militaire absent himself on the same day the 28th a secret society which we learn later to know and to fear issue its first circular under the name of the central committee of the national guard the part since play by this body have be too important for we to omit to insert this proclamation here : its decision become official act which overthrow all constitute authority central committee of the national guard citizen -- the general feeling of the population appear to be to offer no opposition to the entry of the prussian into pari the central committee which have emit contrary advice declare its intention of adhering to the follow resolution : -- ` all around the quarter occupy by the enemy barricade shall be raise so as to isolate completely that part of the town the inhabitant of the circumscribed portion should be require to quit it immediately ` the national guard in conjunction with the army shall form a unbroken line along the whole circuit and take care that the enemy thus isolate upon ground which be no longer of we city shall communicate in no manner with any of the other part of paris ` the central committee engage the national guard to lend its aid for the execution of the necessary measure to bring about this result and to avoid any aggressive act which would have the immediate effect of overthrow the republic ' but here be a little treacherous placard manuscript and anonymous which take a much fairer tone : -- a convention have permit the prussian to occupy the champ elysées from the seine to the faubourg st honoré and as far as the place de la concorde be it so the greater the injury the more terrible the revenge but if some panderer dare to pass the circle of we shame let he be instantly declare traitor let he become a target for we ball a object for we petroleum a mark for we orsinus bomb -lrb- 2 -rrb- a aim for we dagger let this be tell to all by decision of the horatius -lrb- sign -rrb- populus the effervescence in the mind of the people be so great that the entry of the prussian be delay for forty-eight hour but on the first of march at ten in the morning they have come into the city and the smoke of they bivouac fire be see in the champ elysées on the evening of the same day a telegram from bordeaux

same material conceal the face of the statue -lrb- 3 -rrb- on the place de la concorde all these demonstration have however a pacific character and the presence of the enemy in paris give rise to no serious incident nevertheless the agitation of the public mind be not allay some attribute this to a plot the socialist have form and which have arrive at maturity other believe that the prussian have leave emissary creator of disorder behind they in revenge for they reception on the place de la concorde in truth they entry be anything but triumphal they national air be receive with hiss they officer be hoot as they promenade in the tuilery and those who attempt to visit the louvre be compel to retreat without have satisfy they curiosity on the evening of the 3rd of march a note emanate from the ministry of the interior point out in the follow term the danger to be fear from the central committee : -- incident of the most regrettable nature have occur during the last few day and menace seriously the peace of the capital certain national guard in arm follow the order not of they legitimate chief but of a anonymous central committee which could not give they any instruction without commit a crime severely punishable by the law take possession of a considerable quantity of arm and ammunition of war under the pretext of save they from the enemy whose invasion they pretend to fear such act should at any rate have cease after the departure of the prussian army but such be not the case for this evening the guard-house at the gobelin be invade and a number of cartridge steal those who provoke these disorder draw upon themselves a most terrible responsibility it be at the very moment that the city of pari relieve from contact with the foreigner desire to reassume its habit of serenity and industry that these man be sowing trouble and prepare civil war the government appeal to all good citizen to aid in stifle in the germ these culpable manifestation -lrb- illustration : the hill of montmartre -- with the gun of the national guard park there view take from the place st pierre -rrb- let all who have at heart the honor and the peace of the city arise let the national guard repulse all perfidious instigation rally round its officer and prevent evil of which the consequence will be incalculable the government and the commander-in-chief -lrb- general d'aurelle de paladine nominate on the same day by m thier to the chief command of the national guard -rrb- be determine to do they duty energetically they will cause the law to be execute they count on the patriotism and the devotion of all the inhabitant of pari it be indeed time to put a stop to the exist state of affair for already twenty-six gun be in the possession of the insurgent who have form a regular park of artillery in the place d'italie and this be the aspect of the butte montmartre on the sixth of march as describe by a eye-witness : -- the height have become a veritable camp three or four hundred national guard belong partly to the 61st and 168th battalion mount guard there day and night and relieve each other regularly like old campaigner they have two drummer and four trumpeter who beat the rappel or ring out the charge whenever the freak take they without any one know why or wherefore the officer with broad red belt high boot and they long sword drag after they parade the place with pipe or cigar in they month they glance disdainfully at the passer-by and seem almost overpower with the importance of the high mission they imagine themselves call upon to fulfil this be of what they mission consist : at the moment of the entry of the prussian into pari the national guard of montmartre fear that the artillery would be take from they to be deliver to the enemy assemble and drag they piece about twenty in number up to the plateau which form the summit of montmartre and then place they in charge of a special guard now that the prussian have leave they still keep they stronghold think to use it in the defense of the republic against the attack of the reactionist the gun be pointed towards pari and guard be keep without a moment 's relaxation there be four principal post the most important be at the foot of the hill on the place saint pierre the guard bivouac in the open air they musket pile ready at hand sentinel be place at the corner of each street most of they lad of sixteen or seventeen but they be thoroughly in earnest and treat the passer-by roughly enough -lrb- illustration : sentinel at montmartre -rrb- all the street which debouche on the place saint-pierre be close by barricade of paving-stone the most important be form of a overturn cart fill with huge stone and with a red flag rear upon the summit a death-like silence reign around there be but few passer-by none but national guard with they gun on they shoulder the appearance of the boulevard de clichy and boulevard rochechouart be completely different the cafés be overflow with people the concert-room open man and woman pass tranquilly to and fro without disturbing themselves about the cannon that be pointed towards they the government before come to active measure appeal to the good sense of the people in a proclamation date the 8th of march say that this substitution of legal authority by a secret power would retard the evacuation of the enemy and perhaps expose we to disaster still more complete and terrible let we look we position calmly in the face we have be conquer nearly half of we territory have be in the power of a million of german who have impose upon we a fine of five milliard we only mean of discharge this weighty debt be by the strictest economy the most exemplary conduct and care we must not lose a moment before put we hand to work which be we one and solitary hope and at this awful moment shall we miserable folly lead we into a civil strife if while they be meet to treat with the enemy we negotiator have sedition to fear they will break down as they do on the 31st of October when the event of the hôtel de ville authorise the enemy to refuse we a armistice which might have save we this form of reasoning be not illogical but those who be work in secret for the furtherance of they own ambition oar little to be convinced and they myrmidon obey they blindly and gloat over the wild bombastic language of the demagogic press which though they do not understand it impress they no less with its inflated phrase the government perceive that it would be perhaps necessary to use rigorous measure give order to hasten the arrival of the rest of the army of the north some few day after the 18th of march they resolve to deal a decide blow to the democratic party in suppress at once the _ vengeur _ the _ mot d'ordre _ the _ crus du peuple _ the _ caricature _ the _ père duchesne _ and the _ bouche de fer _ the national guard have a perfect mania for collect cannon after have place in battery the mitrailleus and piece of seven the produce of patriotic subscription they also seize upon other belong to the state and carry they off to the butte montmartre where they have about a hundred piece the retake of this artillery be the matter in question while they at versaille be occupy with the solution of the problem the national guard continue they manifestation at the place de la bastille drag these piece of artillery in triumph from the champ de mar to the luxembourg from the park of montrouge to notre dame from the place des vosges to the place d'italie and from the butte montmartre to the butte chaumont before make use of force the government desire to make a last effort at conciliation and on the 17th of march the follow proclamation be post on the wall : -- inhabitant of pari once more we address ourselves to you to you reason and you patriotism and we hope that you will listen to we you grand city which can not live except with order be profoundly trouble in some of its quarter and this trouble without spread to other part be sufficient nevertheless to prevent the return of industry and comfort for some time a number of ill-advised man under the pretext of resist the prussian who be no longer within we wall have constitute themselves master of a part of the city throw up entrenchment mount guard there and force you to do the same all by order of a secret committee which take upon itself to command a portion of the national guard thus set aside the authority of general d'aurelle de paladine so worthy to be at you head and would form a government in opposition to that which exist legally the offspring of universal suffrage these man who have already cause you so much harm whom you yourselve disperse on the 31st of October be placard they intention to protect

wife and yourselve in fact compromise the very republic they pretend to defend for if it be firmly establish in the opinion of france that the republic be the necessary companion of disorder the republic will be lose do not place any trust in they but listen to the truth which we tell you in all sincerity the government institute by the whole nation could have retake before this these steal gun which at present only menace you safety seize these ridiculous entrenchment which hinder nothing but business and have place in the hand of justice the criminal who do not hesitate to create civil war immediately after that with the foreigner but it desire to give those who be mislead the time to separate themselves from those who deceive they however the time allow for honorable man to separate themselves from the other and which be deduct from you tranquillity you welfare and the welfare of france can not be indefinitely prolong while such a state of thing last commerce be arrest you shop be desert order which would come from all part be suspend you arm be idle credit can not be recreate the capital which the government require to rid the territory of the presence of the enemy come to hand but slowly in you own interest in that of you city as well as in that of france the government be resolve to act the culprit who pretend to institute a government of they own must be deliver up to justice the gun steal from the state must be replace in the arsenal and in order to carry out this act of justice and reason the government count upon you assistance let all good citizen separate themselves from the bad let they aid instead of oppose the public force they will thus hasten the return of comfort to the city and render service to the republic itself which disorder be ruin in the opinion of france parisian we use this language to you because we esteem you good sense you wisdom you patriotism but this warning be give you will approve of we have resort to force at all cost and without a day 's delay that order the only condition of you welfare be re-establish entirely immediately and unalterably as soon as the party of disorder see the intention of the government of versaille thus set forth a chorus of recrimination burst forth : -- they want to put a end to the republic -- they be about to fire on we brother -- they wish to set up a king & c the same strain for ever in order to prevent as far as possible the mischievous effect of this insurrectionary propaganda the government issue the follow proclamation which bear date the 18th of march : -- national guard of paris -- absurd rumor be spread abroad that the government contemplate a _ coup d'état _ the government of the republic have not and can not have any other object but the welfare of the republic the measure which have be take be indispensable to the maintenance of order it be and be still determine to put a end to a insurrectionary committee the member of which nearly all unknown to the population of pari preach nothing but communist doctrine will deliver up pari to pillage and bring france into she grave unless the national guard and the army do not rise with one accord in the defense of the country and of the republic the government have many parley with the insurrectionary national guard at montmartre at one moment there be a rumor that the gun have be give up it appear that the guardian of this artillery have manifest some intention of restore it horse have even be send without any military force to create mistrust but the man declare that they would not deliver the gun except to the battalion to which they properly belong be there bad faith here or have those who make the promise undertake to deliver up the skin before they have kill the bear public opinion shape itself generally in somewhat the following form : -- if they be trick each other that be not very dangerous many a honest citizen go to bed on the seventeenth of march full of hope he see paris march with quick step towards the re-establishment of its business and the resumption of its usual aspect the emigrant and foreigner would arrive in crowd they pocket overflow with gold to make purchase and put the industry of pari under contribution the french and foreign banker will rival each other to pay the indemnity of five milliard the dream of good m prudhomme -lrb- 4 -rrb- be however somewhat clouded by the figure of the butte montmartre bristle with cannon but the number of guard have become so diminish and they seem so tired of the business that it appear as if they be about to quit for good the follow chapter will inform you what be the wake thought of the parisian on the morning of the eighteenth of march -lrb- illustration -rrb- -lrb- illustration : purification of the champ élysées after the departure of the prussian mar 1871 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : build a barricade march 18 1871 -rrb- footnote : -lrb- footnote 1 : memoir see appendix i -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the police have seize some time before in pari ten thousand orsinus bomb and hundred of other of a new construction charge with fulminate mercury -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : the eight gigantic female figure represent the principal town of france : strasbourg lille metz & c & c -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : joseph prudhomme be the typical representative of the parisian middle-class -lrb- _ bourgeois _ -rrb- the honest simple father of family peaceful but patriotic proud of he country and ready to die for it -rrb- i listen what do that mean be it a transient squall or the first gust of a tempest be it due to nature or to man 's agency be it a émeute or the advent of a revolution that be to overturn everything such be my reflection when awaken on the 18th of march 1871 at about four in the morning by a noise due to the tramp of many foot from my window in the gloomy white fog i could see detachment of soldier walk under the wall proceed slowly wrap in they gray capote a soft drizzling rain fall at the time half awake i descend to the street in time to interrogate two soldier pass in the rear where be you go ask i -- we do not know say one report say we be go to montmartre add the other -lrb- 5 -rrb- they be really go to montmartre at five o'clock in the morning the 88th regiment of the line occupy the top of the hill and the little street lead to it a place doubtless familiar to some of they who on sunday and fête day have clamber up the hill-side in company with apple-faced rustic from the outskirts and middle-class people of the quarter take part in the crowd on the place saint-pierre with its game and amusement and assist as they would say at shooting in a barrel admire the ability of some whilst revile the stupidity of other when they have a few sous in they pocket they would try they own skill at throw big ball into the mouth of fantastic monster paint upon a square board while they country friend nibble at spice-nut and think they delicious but on this 18th of march morning there be no woman nor spice-nut nor sport on the place saint-pierre : all be slush and dirt and the poor lines-man be oblige to stand at ease rest upon they arm not in the best of humor with the weather or the prospect before they ah and the gun of the national guard that frown from they embrasure on the top of the hill have they be make use of against the prussian no they have make no report during the siege and be only hear on the day on which they be christen and pay for elegant thing hardly to be blacken with powder that it be always hope would be pacific and never dangerous to the capital cruel irony those gun for which pari pay and those american mitrailleus make out of the savings of both rich and poor the farthing of the frugal housewife and the napoleon of the millionaire the contribution of the artist who design and the poet who pen would be ruin paris instead of protect it the brass mouth that eat the bread of humanity be turn upon the nation itself to devour it also but to return to the 88th regiment of line do they take the gun yes but they give they up again and to whom why to a crowd of woman and child and as to the chief no one seem to know what have become of they it be related however that general lecomte have be make a prisoner and lead to the château-rouge and that at nine o'clock some chasseur d'afrique charge pretty vigorously in the place pigalle a detachment of national guard who reply by a volley of bullet a officer of chasseur be shoot and he man run away the greater part it be say into the wine-shop where they fraternise with the patriot who offer they drink i be tell on the spot that general vinoy who be on horseback become encircle in a mob of woman have a stone and a cap -lrb- 6 -rrb- throw at he and think it prudent to escape leave the national guard and linesman to promenade in good fellowship three abreast disperse themselves about the outer boulevard and about pari indeed i have just see a drunken couple full of wine and friendship strongly remind one of a duel end in a jolly breakfast and who be to blame for this nobody know all agree that it be a bungle -- the fault of maladministration and want of tact certainly the national guard at montmartre have no right to hold the cannon belong to the national guard as a body or to menace the revive trade and tranquillity of pari by means of gun turn against its peaceful citizen and government official but be it necessary to use violence to obtain possession of the cannon should not all the means of conciliation be exhaust first and might we not hope that the citizen at montmartre would themselves end by abandon the piece of artillery -lrb- 7 -rrb- which they hardly protect in fact they be encumber by they own barricade and they might take upon themselves to repave they street and return to order monsieur thier and he minister be not of that opinion they prefer act and with vigor very well but when resolution be form one should be sure of fulfil they for in circumstance of such importance failure itself make the attempt a error -lrb- 8 -rrb- well say the government who could imagine that the line would throw up the butt end of they musket -lrb- 9 -rrb- or that the chasseur after the loss of a single officer would turn they back upon the national and that they only deed should be the imbibing of plentiful potation at the cost of the insurgent but how could it be otherwise not many day since the soldier be wander idly through the street with the national guard be billet upon the people eat they soup and chat with they wire and daughter unaccustomed to discipline and the rigor of military organization enervate by defeat have be maintain by they officer in the illusion of they invincibility annoy by they uniform of which they cease to be proud the humiliate soldier seek to escape into the citizen be the commanding officer ignorant of the prevail spirit of the troops must we admit that they be grossly deceive or that they deceive the government when the latter might and ought to have be in a position to foresee the result possibly the assembly have the right to coerce but they have no right to be ignorant of they power they must have know that 100000 arm -lrb- chassepot tabatières -lrb- 10 -rrb- and musket -rrb- be in the hand of disaffected man clank on the floor of the dealer in adulterated wine and spirit and low cabaret the fact be the government take a leap in the dark and wonder when they find the position difficult footnote : -lrb- footnote 5 : appendix note 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : a mark of insult -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : this useless artillery be much ridicule joker say that the notary of general trochu be work out faithfully the plan of he illustrious client in these tardy fortification -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : how be the government to act in the presence of these fact to await event or to strike a great blow some think that the resistance of the insurgent be strengthen by the measure take by government which ought to have be more diplomatic and skilful the agitation of these man of montmartre at the entry of the prussian have calm down in a few hour it be now the duty of government to allay the irritation which have cause the insurgent to form they montmartre stronghold and not to follow the advice of infuriate reactionary who make no allowance for event and circumstance neither analyze the element of that which they be combate nor weigh the measure they do not even know how to apply with tact the gun have not be re-taken but paris be very calm dissension have break out in the montmartre committee some of whose member wish the cannon to be return -lrb- the committee sit at no 8 of the rue des rosier with a court-martial on one hand and military head-quarter on the other -rrb- danger seem now to be avert and the authority have but one thing to do to allow all agitation to die out without listen to blind or treacherous counsellor who advocate a system of immediate repression it be say however that the greater number of the member of government be incline to temporise but the provisional appointment of general valentin to the direction of the prefecture of police seem to contradict this assertion during this time the leader who hold montmartre spur on by the ambitious around they and by those desirous of kindle civil war for the sake of the illicit gain to be obtain from it be get up a manifestation which be to claim for the national guard the right of elect its commander-in-chief and the post be to be offer to menotti garibaldus but though the man of montmartre declare that all who do not sign the manifesto be traitor yet the address remain almost entirely blank the insurrection have evidently few supporter accord to other the insurrection of 1871 be the result of a vast conspiracy plan and nurture under the influence of a six month ' siege no simple pari _ émeute _ but a grand social movement organise by the great and universal revolutionary power the société internationale garibaldiism mazziniism and fenianism have give each other rendezvous in pari

henry the duval and _ tutti quanti _ with the principle of the french school of democracy and socialism this strong and terrible band we be tell be under the command of a chief who remain hidden and mute while ostensibly it obey the pyat delescluze and rochefort politician who not be general never condescend to fight in the first day of march all be prepare for a come explosion and in spite of the departure of the prussian the socialist party determine that it should take place -lrb- _ guerre des communeux _ p 61 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : a sign that they refuse to fight -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : a smooth-bore musket arrange as breech-loader and call a snuff-box from the manner of open the breech to adjust the charge -rrb- ii at three o'clock in the afternoon there be a dense group of linesman and national in one of the street border on the elysée-montmartre the person who tell we this do not recollect the name of the street but man be eagerly harangue the crowd talking of general lecomte and he have twice order the troops to fire upon the citizen militia and what he do be right say a old gentleman who be listen word that be no sooner utter than they provoke a torrent of curse and imprecation from the by-stander but he continue observe that general lecomte have only act under the order of he superior be command to take the gun and to disperse the crowd he only duty be to obey these remark be receive in no friendly spirit hostility to the stranger increase when a vivandière approach and look the gentleman who have expose himself to the fury of the mob full in the face exclaim it be clément thoma and in truth it be general clément thoma he be not in uniform a torrent of abuse be pour forth by a hundred voice at once and the anger of the crowd seem about to extend itself to violence when a ruffian cry out : you defend the rascal lecomte well we 'll put you both together and a pretty pair you 'll be and this project be approve of the general be hurry not without have to submit to fresh insult to where general lecomte have be imprison since the morning from this moment the narrative i have collect differ but little from that circulate through pari at

manner they be escort to the top of the hill of montmartre where they stop before no 6 of the rue des rosier : it be a little house i have often see a peaceful and comfortable habitation with a garden in front what pass within it perhaps will never be know be it there that the central committee of the national guard hold they sitting in full conclave or be they represent by a few of its member many person think that the house be not occupy and that the national guard conduct they prisoner within its wall to make the crowd believe they be proceed to a trial or at least to give the appearance of legality to the execution of premeditated act of one thing there remain little doubt namely that soldier of the line stand round about at the time and that the trial if any take place be not long the condemn be conduct to a walled enclosure at the end of the street -lrb- illustration : hotel de ville as fortify by the national guard march 1871 the hôtel de ville of pari which witness so many

instead of strengthen the defender of the law therefore the peaceful citizen soldier regard not the call of the trumpet and the drum it be wise to stay at home when one know not where to go besides the line have not reply and bad example be contagious moreover be it fair to demand of father of family of merchant and tradesman in fact of soldier of necessity a effort before which professional soldier withdraw the fact be the government have flee perhaps a few minister still remain in pari but the main body have go to join the assembly at versaille i do not blame they somewhat precipitate departure -lrb- 13 -rrb- perhaps it be necessary nevertheless it seem to I that they presence would have put a end to irresolution on the part of timid people meanwhile from the madeleine to the gymnase the cafés overflow with swell and idler of both sex on the outer boulevard they get drunk and on the inner tipsy the only difference be in the quality of the liquor imbibe what a extraordinary

news -- news reply he no not that i know of ah i yes there be a rumor that something take place yesterday at montmartre this be tell I in the center of the city in the rue de la grange-batelière truly there be in pari person marvellously apathetic and ignorant i would wager not a little that by search in the retired quarter some might be find who believe they be still govern by napoleon iii and have never hear of the war with prussium except as a not improbable eventuality on the boulevard there be but little excitement the newspaper vendor be in plenty i do not like to depend upon these public sheet for information for however impartial or sincere a reporter may be he can not represent fact otherwise than accord to the impression they make upon he and to value fact by the impression they make upon other be next to impossible i direct my step to the rue drouot in search of placard and plentiful i find they and white too show that pari be not without a government for white be the official color even under a red republic -lrb- 14 -rrb- take out a pencil i copy hastily the proclamation of the new master and i think that i do well for we forget very quickly both proclamation and person where be they now the official bill of last year république française liberté egalité fraternité _ to the people _ citizen -- the people of pari have shake off the yoke endeavor to be impose upon they what yoke gentleman -- i beg pardon citizen of the committee i assure you as part of the people that i have never feel that any one have try to impose one upon I i recollect if my memory serve I that a few gun be speak of but nothing about yoke then the expression people of pari be a gross exaggeration the inhabitant of montmartre and they neighbor of that industrious suburb be certainly a part of the people and not the less respectable or worthy of we consideration because they live out of the center -lrb- indeed i have always prefer a coal man of the chaussée clignancourt to a coxcomb of the rue taitbout -rrb- but for all that they be not the whole population thus you sentence do not imply anything and moreover with all its superannuated metaphor the rhetoric be out of date i think it would have be better to say simply -- citizen -- the inhabitant of montmartre and of belleville have take they gun and intend to keep they but then it would not have the air of a proclamation extraordinary fact you may overturn a entire country but you must not touch the official style it be immutable one may triumph over empire but must respect red tape let we read on : tranquil calm in we force we have await without fear as without provocation the shameless madman who menace the republic the republic again a improper expression it be the cannon they want to take

horror will form one of the most frightful page in history there appear upon the wall a placard which make know to pari the name of its new master with the exception of one alone -lrb- assy -rrb- who

29th march 1871 -rrb- v pari remain inactive and watch event as one watch run water what do this indifference spring from surprise and the disappearance of the chief might yesterday have excuse the inaction of pari but twenty-four hour have pass over every man have interrogate he conscience and be able to listen to its answer there have be time to reconnoitre to concert together there would have be time to act why be nothing do why have nothing be do yet general clément thoma and lecomte have be assassinate this be as incontestable as it be odious do all pari wish to partake with the criminal in the responsibility of this crime the regular government have be expel do paris consent to this expulsion man invest with no rights or at least with insufficient rights have usurp the power do paris so far forget itself as to submit to this usurpation without resistance no most assuredly no pari abominate crime do not approve of the expulsion of the government and do not acknowledge the right of the member of the central committee to impose its wish upon we why then do paris remain passive and patient do it not fear that it will be say that silence imply consent how be it that i myself for example instead of write my pass impression on these page do not take my musket to punish the criminal and resist this despotism it be that we all feel the present situation to be a singularly complicate one the government which have withdraw to versaille commit so many fault that it would be difficult to side with it without reserve the weakness and inability the greater part of those who compose it show during the siege they obstinacy in remain deaf to the legitimate wish of the capital have ill disposed we for depend on a state of thing which it would have be impossible to approve of entirely in fine these unknown revolutionist guilty most certainly but perhaps sincere claim for pari rights that almost the whole of pari be incline to demand it be impossible not to acknowledge that the municipal franchise be wish for and become henceforth necessary it be for this reason that although aghast at the excess in perspective and those already commit by the dictator of the 18th march though revolt at the thought of all the blood spill and yet to be spill -- this be the reason that we side with no party the past misdeed of the legitimate government of versaille damp we enthusiasm for it while some few laudable idea put forth by the illegitimate government of the hôtel de ville diminish we horror of its crime and we apprehension at its misdoing then -- why not dare say it -- pari which be so impressionable so excitable so romantic in admiration before all that be bold have but a moderate sympathy for that which be prudent we may smile as i do just now at the emphatic proclamation of the central committee but that do not prevent we from recognize that its power be real and the ferocious element that it have so suddenly reveal be not without a certain grandeur it might have be spitefully remark that more than one patriot in he yesterday evening walk on the outer boulevard and in the environs of the hôtel de ville have take more _ petit vin _ than be reasonable in honor of the republic and of the commune but that have not prevent we feeling a surprise akin to admiration at the view of those battalion hasten from all quarter at some invisible signal and ready at any moment to give up they life to defend what they gun and these gun be in they eye the palpable symbol of they rights and liberty during this time the heroic assembly be pettifog at versaille and the government be go to join they pari do not follow those who fly vi the butte-montmartre be _ en fête _ the weather be charming and every one go to see the cannon and inspect the barricade man woman and child mount the hilly street and they all appear joyous for what they can not say themselves but who can resist the charm of sunshine if it rain the city would be in mourning now the citizen have close they shop and put on they best clothes and be go to dine at the restaurant these be the very enemy of disorder the small shopkeeper and the humble citizen strange contradiction but what would you have the sun be so bright the weather be so lovely yesterday no work be do because of the insurrection it be like a Sunday to-day therefore be the holiday-monday of the insurrection -lrb- illustration : behind a barricade : this morning meal -- thirty sous a day and nothing to do -rrb- vii in the midst of all these trouble in which every one be bear along without any knowledge of where he be drift -- with the central committee make proclamation on one side and the versaille government training troops on the other a few man have arise who have speak some word of reason these man may be certain from this moment that they be approve of by pari and will be obey by pari -- by the honest and intelligent pari -- by the pari which be ready to favor that side which can prove that it have the most justice in it the deputy and maire of pari have placard the follow proclamation : -- république française liberté égalité fraternité citizen -- impressed with the absolute necessity of save pari and the republic by the removal of every cause of collision and convinced that the best means of attain this grand object be to give satisfaction to the legitimate wish of the people we have

election of all the officer of the national guard without exception and the establishment of a municipal council elect by the whole of the citizen what we desire and what the public welfare require

legitimate chief we have elect they it be for they to lead we to they belong the duty of reconcile the assembly with the city and it appear to we that they have take the last means of bring about that conciliation by disengage all that be legitimate and practical in its claim from the exaggeration of the _ émeute _ let they therefore have all praise for this truly patriotic attempt let they hasten to obtain from the assembly a recognition of we rights in accede to the demand of the deputy and the _ maire _ the government will not be treat with insurrection on the contrary it will effect a radical triumph over it for it will take away from it every pretext of existence and will separate from it in a definite way all those man who have be blind to the illegal and violent manner in which this program be draw up by the justice of certain part of it if the assembly consent to this all that will remain of the 18th of march will be the recollection -- painful enough without doubt -- of one sanguinary day while out of a great evil will come a great benefit whatever may happen we be resolute we -- that be to say all those who without have follow the government of versaille and without have take a active part in the insurrection equally desire the re-establishment of legitimate power and the development of municipal liberty -- we be resolve to follow where we deputy and the _ maire _ may lead we they represent at this moment the only legal authority which seem to we to have fairly understand the difficulty of the situation and if in the case of all hope of conciliation be lose they should tell we to take up arm we will do so viii pari have this evening the 21st of march a air of extraordinary contentment it have belief in the deputy and the _ maire _ it have trust even in the national assembly people talk of the manifestation of the friend of order and approve of it a foreigner a russian monsieur a -- j -- who have inhabit paris for ten year and be consequently parisian have give I the follow information of which i take hasty note : -- at half-past one o'clock to-day a group of which i make one be form in the place of the new opera-house we number scarcely twenty person and we have a flag on which be inscribe ` meeting of the friend of order ' this flag be carry by a soldier of the line a employé it be say of the house of siraudin the great confectioner we march along the boulevard as far as the rue de richelieu window be open as we pass and the people cry ' _ vive l'ordre vive l'assemblée nationale a bas la commune _ ' few as we be at start we number soon grow to three hundred to five hundred to a thousand we troop follow the rue de richelieu increase as it go at the place de la bourse a captain at the head of he national guard try to stop we we continue we course the company salute we flag as we pass and the drum beat to arm after have traverse still increase in number the street which surround the bourse we return to the boulevard where the most lively enthusiasm burst out around we we halt opposite the rue drouot the _ mairie _ of the ninth arrondissement be occupy by a battalion attach to the central committee -- the 229th i believe although there be some danger of a collision we make we way into the street resolve to do we duty which be to protest against the interference with order and the disregard for established law but no resistance be oppose to we the national guard come out in front of the door of the _ mairie _ and present arm to we and we be about to continue we way when some one remark that we flag on which as i have already say be the wood ` meeting of the friend of order ' might expose we to the danger of be take for ' _ réactionnaires _ ' and that we ought to add the word ' _ vive la république _ ' those who head the manifestation come to a halt and a few of they go into a café and there write the word on the flag with chalk we then resume we march follow the widest and most frequented path and be receive with acclamation everywhere a quarter of a hour later we arrive at the rue de la paix and be march towards the place vendôme where the battalion of the committee be collect in mass and where as be well know the staff of the national guard have its head-quarter there as in the rue drouot the drum be beat and arm present to we more than that a officer come and inform the leader of the manifestation that a delegate of the central committee beg they to proceed to the staff quarter at this moment i be carry the flag we advance in silence when we arrive beneath the balcony surround by national guard whose attitude be generally peaceful there appear on the balcony a rather young man without uniform but wear a red scarf and surround by several superior officer he come forward and say -- ` citizen in the name of the central committee ' when he be interrupt by a storm of hiss and by cry of ' _ vive l'ordre vive l'assemblée nationale vive la république _ ' in spite of these daring interruption we be not subject to any violence nor even to any threat and without troubling ourselves any more about the delegate we march round the column and have regain the boulevard proceed towards the place de la concorde there some one propose that we should visit admiral saisset who live in the rue pauquet in the quarter of the champ elysées when a grave look man with gray hair say that admiral saisset be at versaille ` but ' he add ` there be several admiral amongst you ' he give he own name it be admiral de chaillé from that moment he head the manifestation which pass over the pont de la concorde to the faubourg st germain constantly receive with acclamation and increase in number we parade successively all the street of the quarter and each time that we pass before a guard-house the man present arm on the place st sulpice a battalion draw up to allow we to pass we afterwards go along the boulevard st michel and the boulevard de strasbourg during this part of we course we be join by a large group precede by a tricolor flag with the inscription ' _ vive l'assemblée nationale _ ' from this time the two flag float side by side at the head of the augmented procession as we be about to turn into the boulevard bonne-nouvelle a man dress in a paletot and wear a gray feel hat throw himself upon I as i be carry the standard of the friend of order but a negro dress in the uniform of the national guard who march beside I keep the man off who thereupon turn against the person that carry the other flag wrest it from he and with extraordinary strength break the staff which be a strong one over he knee this incident cause some confusion the man be seize and carry off and i fear he be rather maltreat we then make we way back to the boulevard at we appearance the enthusiasm of the passer-by be immense and certainly without exaggeration we number between three and four thousand person by the time we get back to the front of the new opera-house where we be to separate a zouave climb up a tree in front of the grand hôtel and fix we flag on the highest branch it be arrange that we should meet on the follow day in uniform but without arm at the same place this account differ a little from those give in the newspaper but i have the best reason to believe it absolutely true what will be the effect of this manifestation will those who desire order through liberty and in liberty succeed in meeting in sufficiently large number to bring to reason without have recourse to force the numerous partizan of the commune whatever may happen this manifestation prove that paris have no intention of be dispose of without she own consent in connection with the action of the deputy in the national assembly it can not have be ineffective in aid the come pacification many hopeful promise of concord and quiet circulate this evening amongst the less violent group ix what be this fusillade against whom be it direct against the prussian no against frenchman against passer-by against those who cry _ vive la république et vive l'ordre _ man be fall dead or wounded woman fly shop close amid the whistling of the bullet -- all pari terrify this be what i have just see or hear we be do for then at last we shall see the barricade throw up in we street we shall meet the horrid litter from which hang hand black with powder every woman will weep in the evening when she husband be late in return home and all mother will be seize with terror france alas france herself a weep mother will fall by the hand of she own child i have start in company with a friend from the passage choiseul on my way to the tuilery which have be occupy since yesterday by a battalion devote to the central committee on arm at the corner of the rue st roch and the rue neuve des petits champ we perceive a considerable crowd in the direction of the rue de la paix what be go on now say i to my friend i think say he that it be a unarmed manifestation go to the place vendôme it pass along the boulevard a short time since cry _ vive l'ordre _ as we talk we be approach the rue de la paix all at once a horrible noise be hear it be the report of musketry a white smoke rise along the wall cry issue from all part the crowd flee terrify and a hundred yard before we i see a woman fall be she wound or dead what be this massacre what fearful deed be pass in open day in this glorious sunshine we have scarcely time to escape into one of the cross-street follow by the frightened crowd when the shop be close hurriedly and the horrible news spread to all part of terrify pari report vary extremely in form spread with extraordinary rapidity some be grossly exaggerated other the reverse two hundred victim have fall say one there be no ball in the gun say another the opinion regard the cause of the conflict be strangely various perhaps we shall never know with absolute certainty what pass in the place vendôme and the rue de la paix for myself i be at once too far and too near the scene of action too near for i have narrowly miss be kill too far for i see nothing but the smoke and the flight of the terrify crowd one thing certain be that the friend of order who yesterday succeed in assemble a large number of citizen have to-day try to renew its attempt at pacification by unarmed number three or four thousand person enter the rue de la paix towards two o'clock in the afternoon cry _ l'ordre l'ordre vive l'ordre _ the central committee have doubtless issue severe order for the foremost sentinel of the place far from present arm to the friend of order as they have do the day before formally refuse to let they continue they way and then what happen two crowd be face to face one unarmed the other armed both under strong excitement one try to press forward the other determine to oppose its passage a pistol-shot be hear this be a signal down go the musket the armed crowd fire and the unarmed disperse in mad flight leave dead and wound on they path but who fire that first pistol-shot one of the citizen of the demonstration and moreover the sentinel have they musket tear from they affirm the partisan of the central committee and they bring forward among other proof the evidence of a eye-witness a foreign general who see it all from a window of the rue de la paix but these assertion be but little to be rely upon can it be seriously believe that a crowd to all appearance peaceful would commit such a act of aggression who would have be insane enough to expose a mass of unarmed people to such dire revenge by a challenge as criminal as it be useless the account accord to which the pistol be fire by a officer of the federal guard from the foot of the place vendôme thus give the signal to those under he order to fire upon the citizen improbable as appear such a excess of cold-blooded barbarity be much the more credible and now how many woman mourn they husband and son 's wound and perhaps dead how many victim have fall the number be not yet know monsieur barle a lieutenant of the national guard be shoot in the stomach monsieur gaston jollivet who some time ago commit the offence grave in we eye of publish a comic ode in which he allow himself to ridicule we illustrious and beloved master victor hugo but be certainly guilty of none in desire a return to order have he arm fracture it be say monsieur otto hottinger one

by the light of a street lamp as soon as night come on every measure of precaution be take we have no idea by whom we be command but it would appear that a serious defense be contemplate and be be execute with prudence be it admiral saisset who be at we head we hope so although we have be so often disappointed in we chief we have not yet lose the desire to place confidence in some one to-night we believe in the admiral ever and anon we superior officer retire to the _ mairy _ and receive strict order concern they duty we be quite a army in ourselves we center be in the place de la bourse we wing extend into the adjoining street line of national guard all the opening sentinel be post sixty foot in front to give the alarm within the enclosed space there be no one to be see but the house be inhabit as usual the door have be leave open by order and also all the window on the first floor each company divide under the command of sergeant have take possession of three or four house at the first signal of alarm the street-door be to be close the man to rush to the window and from there to fire on the assailant hold yourselve in readiness it be very possible you may be attack on the approach of the enemy the guard in the street be to fall back under fire towards the house and take shelter there those post at the window be to keep up a unceasing fire on the insurgent in the meantime the bulk of we force will come to we aid and clear the street with they mitrailleus so we wait resolve on obedience calm with a silent but fervent prayer that we might not be oblige to turn we arm against we fellow-townsmen the night be beautiful some of we man be talk in group on the threshold of the door other roll in they blanket be lie on the ground asleep in the upper storey of some of the house light be still twinkle through the muslin curtain lower down all be darkness scarcely a sound be to be hear only now and then the rumble of a heavy cart or perhaps a cannon in the distance and nearer to we the sudden noise of a musket that slip from its resting-place on to the pavement every hour the dull sound of many foot be hear it be the patrol of mobile make its round we question they as they pass -- anything fresh -- nothing be the invariable reply -- how far have you be -- as far as the rue de la paix they answer and pass on interrupted conversation be resume and the sleeper who have be awaken by the noise close they eye again we be watch and wait -- may we watch and wait in vain xiii never have i see the dawn break with greater pleasure almost everyone have some time in he life pass such sleepless night when it seem to he that the darkness will never disappear and the desire for light and day become a fearful longing never be dawn more grateful than after that wretched night and yet the fear of a disastrous collision do not disappear with the night it be even likely that the federal might have wait for the morning to begin they attack just when fatigue be greatest sleep most difficult to fight against and therefore discipline necessarily slacken anyhow the light seem to reassure we we could scarcely believe that the crime of civil war could be perpetrate in the day-time the night have be full of fear the morning find we bright and happy not all of we however i smile as i remember a incident which occur a little before daylight one of we comrade who have be lie near I get up go out into the street and pace up and down some time as if to shake off cramp or cold my eye follow he mechanically he be walk in front of the house the back of which look out upon the passage des panoramas and as he do so he cast furtive glance through the open doorway he go into one and come out with a disappointed expression on he face have repeat this strange maneuver several time he reach a _ porte-cochère _ that be down by the side of the restaurant catelain he remain a few minute then reappear with a beam countenance and make straight for where i be stand rub he hand gleefully monsieur say he in a low voice so as not to be overhear do you approve of this plan of action which consist in case of attack of shooting from the window on the assailant -- a necessity of street fighting say i let we hope we shall not have to try it -- oh of course but i should have prefer it if they have take other measure -- why i ask -- why you see when we be in the house the insurgent will try to force they way in -- i could not see what he be drive at so i say most probably -- but if they do get in he insist : -- i will trust to we be reinforce from the place de la bourse before they can effect a entrance -- doubtless doubtless he answer but i see he be anything but convinced -- but you know reinforcement often arrive too late and if the federal should get in we shall be shoot down like dog in those room overhead -- i acknowledge that this would be to say the least disagreeable but argue that in time of war one must take one 's chance -- do you think then monsieur he continue that if in the event of the insurgent enter we be to look out for a back door to escape by we should be act the part of coward -- of coward no but of excessively prudent individual yes : -- well monsieur i be prudent and there be a end of it exclaim my comrade with a air of triumph and i think i have find ------ the back door in question -- just go look down that passage in front of we at the end there be a door which lead -- where do you think -- into the passage des panoramas do it not -- yes monsieur and now you see what i mean -- i tell he i do not think i do -- why you see he explain when the enemy come we must rush into that passage shut the lower door and make for we post at the window where we will do we duty bravely to we last cartridge but suppose in the meantime that those devil succeed in break open the lower door with the butt end of they musket -- and it be not very strong -- what shall we do then -- why of course i say we must plant ourselves at the top of the staircase and receive they at the point of we bayonet -- by no means he expostulate -- but we must it be we duty -- oh i fancied we might have gain the door that lead into the passage he go on look rather shame-faced -- what run away -- no not exactly only find some place of safety -- well if it come to that i reply you may do just as you like only i warn you that the passage be occupy by a hundred of we man and that all the outlet be barricade -- no not all he say with conviction and that be why i appeal to you you be a journalist be you not -- sometimes -- yes but you be and you know actor and all those sort of people and you go behind the scene i dare say and know where the actor dress themselves and all that -- i look at my brave comrade in some surprise but he continue without notice I and you know all the in and out of the theater the corridor the trapdoor -- suppose i do what good can that do you -- all the good in the world monsieur it will be the saving of I why we shall only have to find the actor ' entrance of the _ variétés _ which be in the passage then ring at the bell the porter know you and will admit we you can guide we both up the staircase and behind the scene and we can easily hunt out some hole or corner in which to hide until the fight be over -- then say i feeling rather disgust with my companion we can bravely walk out of the front door on the boulevard and go and eat a comfortable breakfast while the other be busy carry away we dead comrade from the staircase we ought to have help to defend the poor man look at I aghast and then go off i see that i have hurt he feeling and i think perhaps i have be wrong in make he feel the cowardice of he proposition i have know he for some month he live in the same street as i do and i remember that he have a wife and child perhaps he be right in wish to protect he life at any price i think it over for a minute or two and then it go out of my mind altogether at four in the morning we have another alarm in a instant every one be on foot and rush to the window the house to which i be order be the very one that have inspire my ingenious friend with he novel plan of evasion i find he already install in the room from whence we be to fire into the street -- you do not know what i have do say he come up to I -- no -- well you know the door which open on to the passage you remember it -- of course i do -- i find there be a key so what do you think i do i double-locked the door and go and slip the key down the nearest drain ha ha the fellow who try to escape that way will be finely catch i seize he cordially by the hand and shake it many time he be beam and i be pleased also i could not help feeling that however low france may have fall one must never despair of a country in which coward even can be brave xiv on Friday the 24th of march at nine in the morning we be still in the quarter of the bourse some of the man have not sleep for forty-eight hour we be tired but still resolve we number be increase every hour i have just see three battalion with trumpeter and all complete come up and join we they will now be able to let the man who have be so long on duty get a little rest as to what be go on we be but very incompletely inform the federal be fortify themselves more strongly than ever at the place de l'hôtel de ville and the place vendôme they be very numerous and have lot of artillery why do they not act on the offensive or do they want as we do to avoid a conflict certainly we hand shall not be the first to spill french blood these hour of hesitation on both side calm man 's mind the deputy and mayor of pari be try to obtain from the national assembly the recognition of the municipal franchise if the government have the good sense to make these concession which be both legitimate and urgent rather than remain doggedly on the defensive with the conviction that it have right on its ride if in a word it remember the well-known maxim _ summum jus summa injurium _ the horror of civil war may be avert we be tell and i fancy correctly that the federal guard be not without fear concern the issue of the event into which they have hurry the chief must also be uneasy even those who have declare themselves irreconcileable in the hour of triumph would not perhaps be sorry now if a little condescension on the part of the assembly furnish they with a pretext of not continue the rebellion just now several guard of the 117th battalion a part of which have declare for the central committee who happen to be pass stop to chat with we outpost civil war to the knife do not at all appear to be they most ardent desire one of they say : we be call to arm what could we do but obey they give we we pay and so here we be be they sincere in this do they come with the hope of join we or to spy into what we be do other however either more frank or less clever at deception declare that they want the commune and would have it at any price this however be by far the smaller number the majority of the insurgent be of the opinion of these man who join in conversation with we it be quite possible to believe that some understanding might be bring about a fact have just be relate to I which confirm I in my opinion the comptoir d'escompte be occupy by a post of federal a company of government guard from the 9th arrondissement march up to take possession you have be here for two whole day go home and rest say the officer in command of the latter but the federal obstinately refuse to be send away the officer insist -- we be in we own quarter you be from belleville it be we place to guard the comptoir d'escompte -- it be all of no avail until the officer say : go away directly and we will give you a hundred franc -- they do not wait for the offer to be repeat but accept the money and march off now man who be willing to sell they conscience at two franc a head -- for there be fifty of they -- can not have any very formidable political opinion i forget to say that this post of federal be command by the italian tibaldus the same who have be arrest in one of the passage of the hôtel de ville during the riot of the 31st October xv the news be excellent in a few hour perhaps it will be better we rejoice beforehand at the almost certain prospect of pacification the sun shine the boulevard be crowd with people the face of the woman especially be beam what be the cause of all this joy a placard have just be post up on all the wall in the city i copy it with pleasure dear fellow citizen -- i hasten to announce to you that together with the deputy of the seine and the mayor of pari we have obtain from the government of the national assembly : 1st the complete recognition of you municipal franchise 2nd the right of elect all the officer of the national guard as well as the general-in-chief 3rd modification of the law on bill 4th a project for a law on rent favourable to tenant pay 1200 franc a year or less than that sum until you have confirm my nomination or until you name some one else in my stead i shall continue to remain at my post to watch over the execution of these conciliatory measure that we have succeed in obtain and to contribute to the well-being of the republic the vice-admiral and provisional commander saisset pari 23rd march well this be opportune and to the purpose the national assembly have understand that in a town like pari a revolution in which a third of the population be engage can not be alone actuate by motive of robbery and murder -lrb- 20 -rrb- and that if some of the demand of the people be illegitimate or premature there be at least other which it be but right should obtain justice pari be never entirely in the wrong certainly among the author and leader of the 18th march there be many who be very guilty the murderer of general lecomte and general clément thoma should be seek out and punish all honest man must demand and expect that a minute inquiry be institute concern the massacre in the place vendôme it must be acknowledge that all the federal officer and soldier be not devil or drunkard a few hundred man get drunk in the cabaret -- -lrb- i have perhaps be wrong to lay so much stress here upon the prevalence of this vice among the insurrectionist -rrb- -- a few tipsy brute ought not to be sufficient to authorise we to condemn a hundred thousand man among whom be certainly to be find some right-minded person who be convince of the justice of they cause these unknown and suddenly elevated chief whom the revolution have single out be they all unworthy of we esteem and devoid of capacity they possess perhaps a new and vital force that it would be right and perhaps necessary to utilise somehow the idea which they represent ought to be study and if they prove useful put into practice this be what the assembly have understand and what it have do by concession which enlarge rather than diminish its influence it put all right-minded man soldier and officer under the obligation of return to they allegiance those who have read the proclamation of admiral saisset still refuse to recognize the government be no longer man act for the sake of pari and the republic but rioter guilty of pursue the most criminal path for the gratification of they own bad passion thus the tare will be separate from the wheat and tear up without mercy yesterday and the day before at the place de la bourse at the place des victoire and the bank we be resolve on resistance -- resistance nothing more for none of we i be sure would have fire a shot without sufficient provocation -- and even this resolution cost we much pain and some hesitation we feel that in the event of we be attack we shot might strike many a innocent breast -- and perhaps at the last moment we heart would have fail we now no thought of that kind can hinder we in recognize we demand the assembly have get right entirely on its side we shall now consider all rebellion against the authority of which it make so able a use as a act entail immediate punishment until now fear to be abandon or misunderstand by the government we have determine to obey the mayor and deputy elect by the people but the assembly by its judicious conduct have show itself worthy confidence let they command we be ready to obey truly this change in the attitude of the government be at once strange and delightful no later than yesterday they language be quite different the manner in which the majority receive the mayor do not lead we to expect a termination so favourable to the wish of all concerned but this be all past let we not recriminate let we rather rejoice in we present good fortune and try and forget the danger which seem but now so imminent i hear from all side that the deputy of the seine and the mayor fully empower be busy conclude the last arrangement municipal election be talk of for the 2nd April thus every cause for discontent be about to disappear capital pari be satisfied shop re-open the promenade be crowd with people the place vendôme alone do not brighten with the rest but it soon will the weather be lovely people accost each other in the street with a smile one almost wonder they do not embrace be to-day Friday no it be Sunday bravo assembly footnote : -lrb- footnote 20 : at the same time that the proclamation of admiral saisset encourage the partizan of the assembly proof be not want of the poverty of the commune in money as well as man : a new loan obtain from the bank of france which have already advance half a million of franc and the military nomination which raise brunel eude and duval from absolute obscurity to the rank of general these be indication decidedly favourable to the party of order -rrb- xvi on the ground-floor of the house of my neighbor there be a upholsterer 's workshop the day before yesterday the master go out to fetch some work and this morning he have not yet return in a agony of apprehension he wife go everywhere in search of he he body have just be find at the morgue with a bullet through its head some say he be walk across the rue de la paix on he way home and be shoot by accident but the _ journal officiel _ announce that this poor man wahlin be a national guard assassinate by the revolver of the manifestation whom be we to believe anyhow the man be to be bury tomorrow and he poor wife be a widow xvii what be the meaning of all this be we deceive ourselves or be deceive we await in vain the consummation of admiral saisset 's promise in officially announce that the assembly have accede to the just demand of the mayor and deputy do he take upon himself to pass delusive hope as accomplished fact it seem pretty certain now that the government will make no concession that the proclamation be only waste paper and that the provisional commander of the national guard have be lead we into error -- with a laudable intention doubtless -- or else have himself be deceive likewise the unite effort of the deputy of the seine and the mayor of pari have be unequal to rouse the apathy of the assembly -lrb- 21 -rrb- in vain do loui blanc entreat the representative of france to approve the conciliatory conduct of the representative of pari may the responsibility of what may happen be on you own head cry m clémenceau he be right a little condescension might have save all such obstinacy be fatal deprive of the countenance of the assembly and leave to themselves the deputy and mayor of pari desirous above all of avoid civil war have be oblige to accede to the wish of the central committee and insist upon the municipal election be proceed with immediately they could not have act otherwise and yet it be humiliating for they to have to bow before superior force and they authority be compromise by so do what the assembly represent the whole of france could have do with no loss of dignity and even with honor to itself the former accomplish only at the risk of lose they influence what to the assembly would have be a honorable concession be to they dangerous although necessary submission the committee would have be annul if the government have consent to the municipal election but thanks to a tardy consent ring from the deputy and mayor of pari it triumph the result of the humiliation to which the representative of pari have be force to submit to prevent the effusion of blood will be the entire abdication of they authority which will remain vested in the central committee until the member of the commune be elect abandon by the government since the departure of the chief of the executive power and the minister we rally round the representative who unsustained by the government be oblige to submit to the revolutionist we must now choose between the commune and anarchy therefore to-day Sunday the 26th march the male population of pari be hurry to the poll it be in vain that the journal have beg the people not to vote the election be only announce yesterday and the elector have have no time to reconsider the choice they have to make and yet they insist on vote those who decline to obey the suggestion of the central committee will re-elect the late mayor or choose among the deputy but vote they will the present attitude of the regular government have do much towards further the revolution the mistake of the assembly have diminish in the eye of the public the crime of revolt everywhere the murder of general clément thoma and lecomte be openly regret but those who repeat that the central committee declare have have nothing to do with it be listen to with patience the rumor that they be shoot by soldier gain ground and seem less incredulously receive as to the massacre of the rue de la paix we be tell that this event be envelop in mystery that the evidence be most contradictory etc etc -lrb- 22 -rrb- there be evidently a decide reactionary movement in favor of the partizan of the commune without approve they act they activity be incontestable they have do much in a short time people exclaim there be man for you this state of thing be very alarming to all those who have remain faithful to the assembly which in spite of its error have not cease to be the legal representative of the country it be a cruel position for the parisian who be oblige to choose between a regular government which they would desire to obey but which by its fault render such obedience impossible and a illegitimate power that although guilty in its act and stain with crime still represent the opinion of the republican majority by to-night therefore the commune will have be call into existence a illegal existence it may be argue doubtless by the partizan of constitutional legality who would consider as null and void election carry on without the consent of the nation as represent by the assembly legal or not however the election have take place and the fact alone be of some importance in a few hour the executive power of the republic will have to treat whether it will or no with a force which have constitute itself with as much legality as it have in its power to assume under the circumstance footnote : -lrb- footnote 21 : the news of the check which the maire of pari have suffer in the assembly suddenly loosen the bond which for two day have unite the friend of order and profound discouragement seize upon the public mind it be at this moment that the deputy from the committee present themselves at the mairie of the first arrondissement precede by three piece of artillery a very warlike accompaniment to a deputation it be arrange that the communal election should be manage by the exist maire and that the battalion of each quarter of the city whether federal or not should occupy the voting place of they section but this do not prevent the committee on the follow morning occupy the mairie of saint-germain-l'auxerroi in spite of the arrangement by they most devoted battalion -rrb- -lrb- footnote 22 : the follow be the term in which the commune speak of the event of the 18th march and excuse the murder of the two general : citizen -- the day of the 18th of march which for interested reason have be travesty in the most odious manner will be call in history the day of the people 's justice the government now subvert -- always maladroit -- rush into a conflict without consider either its own unpopularity or the fraternal feeling that animate the army the entire army when order to commit fratricide reply with cry of vive la république vive la garde nationale two man alone who have render themselves unpopular by act which we now pronounce as iniquitous be strike down in a moment of popular indignation the committee of the federation of the national guard in order to render homage to truth declare it be a stranger to these two execution at the present moment the ministry be constitute the prefect of police have assume he duty the public office be again active and we invite all citizen to maintain the utmost calmness and order -rrb- xviii crowd in the street and promenade this evening all the theater will be re-open in the meantime the voting be go on the weather be delightful so i take a stroll along the promenade under the colonnade of the châtelet there be a long line of elector await they turn i fancy that in this quarter the candidate of the central committee will be surely elect woman in bright-coloured dress and fresh spring bonnet be walk to and fro i hear some one say that there be a great many cannon at the hôtel de ville two friend meet together in the square of the art et métiers -- be you alone madame say one lady to another -- yes madame i be wait for my husband who be go to vote a child who be skip cry out mama mama what be the commune the fiacre driver make the revolution a excuse for ask extravagant fare this do not prevent they have very decide political opinion one who drive one would scarcely have be approve of by the central committee -- _ cocher _ what be the fare i ask -- five franc monsieur -- all right take I to the mairie place saint-sulpice -- beg pardon monsieur but if you be go to vote it will be ten franc on the boulevard de strasbourg there be stream of people dress in holiday attire itinerant dealer in top pamphlet souvenir of the siege -- bit of black bread make on purpose and frame and glaze also bit of shell -- and scented soap and color picture crowd of beggar everywhere in this part of the town the revolution look very much like a fair at the mairie of the 6th arrondissement there be very few people i enter into conversation with one of the official there he tell I he have never see voting carry on with greater spirit i meet a friend who have just return from belleville and ask he the news of course -- the voting be progress in capital order he tell I the man go up to the poll as they would mount the breach they have no choice but to obey blindly -- the central committee i inquire -- yes but the committee itself only obey order -- whose -- why those of the international of course at a corner near the boulevard a compact little knot of people be station in front of a poster i fancy they be study the proclamation of one of the candidate but it turn out only to be a play-bill the crowd continue to thicken the cafés be cram gold chignon be plentiful enough at every table here and there a red garibaldus shirt be visible like poppy amongst the corn every now and then a horseman gallop wildly past with dispatch from one section to another the result of some of the election be creep out at montrouge bercy batignolle and the marai they tell we the member of the central committee be elect by a very large majority here the hoarse voice of a boy strike in -- buy the account of the grand conspiracy of citoyen thier against the republic then another chime in with wares of a less political and more vulgar nature the movement to and fro and the excitement be extraordinary while the populace bask in the sun the destiny of the city be be decide -- m desmarest be elect for the 9th arrondissement say some one close to I -- lesueur be capital in the ` partie de piquet ' say another oh people of paris xix it be over we have a municipal council accord to some a commune accord to other not quite legally elect but sufficiently so eighty councillor sixty of whom be quite unknown man who can have recommend they or rather impose they on the elector can there really be some occult power at work under cover of the ex-central committee be the commune only a pretext and be we at the début of a social and political revolution i overheard a partizan of the new doctrine say -- the proletariat be vindicate its rights which have be unjustly trample on by the aristocratic bourgeoisie this be the workman 's 1789 another person express the same thing in rather a different form this be the revolt of the _ canaille _ against all kind of supremacy the supremacy of fortune and the supremacy of intellect the equality of man before the law have be acknowledge now they want to proclaim the equality of intellect soon universal suffrage will give place to the drawing of lot there be a time in athen when the name of the archonte be take haphazard out of a bag like the number at loto however the revolution have not yet clearly define its tendency and in the meantime what be we to think of the unknown being who represent it a man in whom i have the greatest confidence and who have pass he life in study question of social science and who therefore have mix in nearly all the revolutionary circle and be personally acquaint with the chief say to I just now in speaking of the new municipal council -lrb- 23 -rrb- -- it will be a assemblage of a very motley character there will be much good and much bad in it we may safely divide it into three distinct part : firstly ten or twelve man belong to the international who have both thought and study and may be able to act mixed with these several foreigner secondly a number of young man ardent but inexperienced some of whom be imbue with jacobin principle thirdly and by far the largest portion unsuccessful plotter in former revolution journalist orator and conspirator -- noisy active and effervescent have no particular tie amongst themselves except the absence of any common bond of unity with the two former division and be confound now with one now with the other the member of the international alone have any real political value they be socialist the jacobin element be decidedly dangerous -- if in reality the communal assembly be thus compose how will it act let we wait and see in the meantime the city be calm never do so critical a moment wear so calm a exterior by

to the landlord they vexation be extreme even the tenant do not seem so satisfied as they ought to be not to have to pay any rent be very delightful certainly but they scarcely dare believe in such good fortune thus when orpheus try to rescue eurydice from the infernal region interrupt with he harmonious strain the torture of eternal punishment prometheus do not doubtless show as much delight as he ought to have do on discover that the beak of the vulture be no longer gnawing at he vitals scarcely daring to believe in such good fortune orpheus be the commune eurydice liberty the infernal region the government of the 4th September the harmonious strain the decree of the commune prometheus the tenant and the vulture the landlord in plain term however -- forgive I for joke on such a subject -- the decree which annul the payment of the rent for the quarter end October 1870 January 1871 and April 1871 do not appear to I at all extravagant and really i do not see what there be to object to in the follow line which accompany it : -- in consideration of the expense of the war have be chiefly sustain by the industrial commercial and work portion of the population it be but just that the proprietor of house and land should also bear they part of the burthen let we talk it over together mr landlord you have a house and i live in it it be true that the chimney smoke and that you most energetically refuse to have they repair however the house be yours and you possess most decidedly the right of make a profit by it understand once for all that i never contest you right as for I i depend upon my wit i do not possess much but i have a tool -- it may be either a pen or a pencil or a hammer -- which enable I in the ordinary course of thing to live and to pay with more or less regularity my quarter 's rent if i have not possess this tool you would have take good care not to let I inhabit you house or any part or portion thereof because you would have consider I in no position to pay you you rent now during the war my tool have unquestionably render I but poor service it have remain ignobly idle in the inkstand in the folio or on the bench not only have i be unable to use it but i have also in some sort lose the knack of handle it i must have some time to get myself into work order again while i be work but little and eat less what be you do oh i do not mean to say that you be as flourish as in the triumphant day of the empire but still i have not hear of any considerable number of landlord be find beg at the corner of the street and i do not fancy you make yourselve conspicuous by you assiduous attendance at the municipal cantine i have even hear that you or many of you brother-landlord take pretty good care not to be in pari during the prussian siege and that you contented yourselve with form the most ardent wish for the final triumph of french arm from beneath the wide-spreading oak of you châteaux in touraine and beauce or from the safe haven of a normandy fishing village while we accompany it be true by you most fervent prayer take we turn at mount guard on the fortification during the bitter cold night or knee-deep in the mud of the trench however i do not blame those who seek safety in flight each person be free to do as he please what i object to be you come back and say during seven or eight month you have do no work you have be oblige to pawn you furniture to buy bread for you wife and child i pity you from the bottom of my heart -- be so kind as to hand I over my three quarter ' rent no a thousand time no such a demand be absurd wicked ridiculous and i declare that if there be no possible compromise between the strict execution of the law and he decree of the commune i prefer without the least hesitation to abide by the latter i prefer to see a little poverty replace for a time the long course of prosperity that have be enjoy by this very small class of individual than to see the last article of furniture of five hundred thousand suffering wretch put up to auction and knock down for one-twentieth part of they value there must however be some way of conciliate the interest of both landlord and tenant would it be sufficient to accord delay to the latter and force the former to wait a certain time for they money i think not if i be allow three year to pay off my three quarter ' rent i should still be embarrass the tool of the artisan be not like the peasant 's plot of ground which be more productive after have lain fallow during the last few sad month when i have no work to do i be oblige to draw upon the future a future heavily mortgage when i shall perhaps scarcely be able to meet the expense of each day will there be any possibility of acquit the debt of the past you may sell my furniture if the law give you the right to do so but i shall not pay the only possible solution believe I be that in favor of the tenant only it ought not to be apply in so wholesale a fashion inquiry should be institute and to those tenant from whom the war have take away all possibility of payment a unconditional receipt should be deliver : to those who have suffer less a proportionate reduction should be allow but those whom the invasion have not ruin or seriously impoverished -- and the number be large among provision merchant café keeper and private resident -- let those pay directly in this way the landlord will lose lees than one may imagine because it will be the lowest rent that will be forfeit the decree of the commune be base on a right principle but too generally apply the new government

themselves upon it from this position one can perceive a motionless attentive crowd reach down the whole length of the avenue of the grande armée as far as the porte maillot from which a great cloud of white smoke spring up every moment follow by a violent explosion -- it be the cannon of the rampart firing on the rond point of courbevoie and beyond this the avenue de neuilly stretch far out in

any rate a great deal more of it imagination have better play when it be farther from the fact a hundred absurd story reach I what appear tolerably certain be that the federal have receive a check not very important in itself the versaille troops have make but little advance but at any rate a check which might have some influence on the resolution of the national guard they have be tell that the army would not fight that the soldier of the line would turn the butt-end of they gun into the air at neuilly as they have do at montmartre but now they begin to believe that the army will fight and those who cry the loudest that it be the _ sergent de ville _ and charette 's zouave who lead the attack alone seem as if they say it to give themselves courage and keep up they illusion but from which side do the first shot come on this point everyone have something to say and no one know what to believe official report be look for with the utmost impatience the wall generally so communicative be mute up to this hour the least improbable of the version circulate be the following : at break of day some shot be say to have be exchange between the federal advanced guard and the patrol of the versaille troops none dead or wound only powder waste happily a little later and a few minute after the arrival of general vinoy at mont valérien a messenger with a flag of truce precede

at they disposal when we remember the small advantage those general manage to derive from the heroism of the parisian population who during the second siege show that they know how to fight and how to die it be marvellous that many people have go so far as to regret that the émeute of the 31st of October be not successful believe that if the commune have triumph at that time pari would have be save all this seem very doubtful now and opinion have veer round considerably for it be not such man as duval cluseret la cécilia eude or bergeret who could have protect pari against the science of the prussian general -rrb- -lrb- illustration : general bergeret -rrb- xxvii to whom shall we listen whom believe it would take a hundred page and more to relate all the different rumor which have circulate to-day the 4th of April the second day of the horrible straggle let we hastily note down the most persistent of these assertion later i will put some order into this pell-mell of news all through the night the drum beat to arm in every quarter of the town company assemble rapidly and direct they way towards the place vendôme or the porte maillot shout _ a versaille _ since five this morning general bergeret have occupy the rond-point of courbevoie this position have be evacuate by the troops of the assembly how be this be the federal not beat yesterday -lrb- one thing go against general bergeret in the opinion of he troops : he drive to battle in a carriage -rrb- he have form he troops into column no less than sixty thousand man be under he order two battery of seven gun support the infantry omnibus follow fill with provision they march towards the mont valérien after have take the fort they will march on versaille by rueil and nanterre -lrb- 34 -rrb- after they have take the mont valérien there be not a moment 's doubt about the success of the enterprise we be assure say a federal general to I that the fort would open its door at the first sight of we but they count without general cholleton who command the fortress the advance-guard of the federal be receive by a formidable discharge of shot and shell panic cry of rage a regular rout to the word we be betray -lrb- 35 -rrb- the army of the commune be divide into two fragment : one -- scarcely three battalion strong -- fly in the direction of versaille the other regain pari with praiseworthy precipitation must the parisian combatant be accuse of cowardice for this flight no they be surprise have never expect such a reception from mont valérien have they be warn they would have hold out better after all there be more fright than harm do in the affair the huge fortress could have annihilate the communist and it be satisfy with disperse they but what have become of the three battalion that pass mont valérien bravely they go forward in the meantime another movement be be make upon versaille by meudon and clamart a small number of battalion have march out during the night and be mass under cover of the fort of issy and vanve they have manage to establish a battery of a few gun on a wooded eminence at the foot of the glaci of fort issy and they piece be firing upon the battery of the versaille troops at meudon which be answer they furiously it be a duel of artillery as in the time -- the good time alas -- of the prussian up to this moment the information be tolerably clear probable even and one be able to come to some idea of the respective position of the belligerent but towards two o'clock in the afternoon all the report get confuse and contradictory a estafette who have come from the porte maillot cry to a group form on the place of the new opera-house we be victorious flouren have enter versaille at the head of forty thousand man a hundred deputy have be take thier be a prisoner elsewhere it be say that in the rout of that morning at the foot of mont valérien flouren have disappear and where could he have find the forty thousand man to lead they to versaille at the same time a rumor spread that general bergeret have be grievously wound by a shell pure exaggeration some one answer the general have only have two horse kill under he before he rather since he drive to battle what appear most certain of all be that there be furious fight go on between sèvres and meudon i hear it say that the 118th of the line have turn the butt of they gun into the air and that the parisian have take twelve mitrailleus from the versaille troops there be fight too at châtillon the federal have win great advantage nevertheless a individual who go out that side to investigate announce that he see three battalion return with very little air of triumph and that other battalion form the reserve have refuse to march a shower of contradiction in which the news for the most part have no other source than the opinion and desire of the person who bring it it be by the result alone that we can appreciate what be pass at one moment i give up try to get information as a bad job but i begin question again in spite of myself the desire to know be even stronger than the very strong certainty that i shall be able to learn nothing i turn to the champ elysées the cannon be roar ambulance waggon descend the avenue and stop before the palais de l'industrie over the way punch be make he audience roar with laughter as usual oh the miserable time the horrible fratricidal struggle may those who be its cause be accurse for ever while some be kill and other die the member of the commune be render decree and the wall be white with official proclamation messieur thier favre picard dufaure simon and pothuan be impeach they property will be seize and sequestrate until they deliver themselves up to public justice this impeachment and sequestration will it bring back husband to the widow and father to the orphan the commune of pari adopt the family of citizen who have fall or may fall in oppose the criminal aggression of the royalist direct against pari and against the french republic infinitely better than adopt the orphan would be to save the father from death oh these absurd decree you separate the church from the state you suppress the budget of public worship you confiscate the property of the clergy a pretty time to think about such act what be necessary what be indispensable be to restore quiet to avoid massacre and to stifle hatred that you will not decree no no that which be now happen you have desire and you still desire it you have profit by the provocation you have receive to bring about the most frightful conflict which the history of unfortunate france record and you will persevere and in order to revive the fainting courage of those whom you have devote to inevitable defeat and death you bring into action all the hypocrisy with which you have charge you enemy bergeret and flouren have join they force they be march on versaille success be certain you cause this announcement to be placard in the street -- false news be it not but man can only be lead to they ruin by be deceive you add : the fire of the army of versaille have not occasion we any appreciable loss ah as to this let we ask the woman who await at the gate of the city the return of you soldier and crowd sob round the bloody litter footnote : -lrb- footnote 34 : the combined plan of the three general of the commune consist like the famous plan of general boum in proceeding by three different road : the first column under the order of bergeret second by flouren go by rueil the second command by duval march upon versaille by lower meudon chaville and viroflay cover by the fire of fort issy and the redoubt of moulineaux and lastly the third with general eude at its head take the clamart road protect by the fort of vanve -rrb- -lrb- footnote 35 : though no fort cover bergeret 's eight battalion with its fire yet bergeret be so sure that the artilleryman of mont valérien would do as the line do on the 18th of march ie refuse to fire that he advance boldly as far as the bridge of neuilly and have make a halt at the rond-point des bergères when a heavy cannonading from mont valérien separate a part of the column from its main body -rrb- xxviii every hour that fly by become more sinister than the last they fight at clamart as they fight at neuilly at meudon and at courbevoie everywhere rage the mitrailleus the cannon and the rifle the victory of the communalist be lyingly proclaim the truth of they pretended triumph will soon be know and unhappily victory will be as detestable as defeat general duval have be make prisoner and put to death if you have take I ask general vinoy would you not have shoot I -- without hesitation reply duval and vinoy give the word of command fire but this anecdote though widely spread be probably false it be scarcely likely that a commander-in-chief of the versaille troops would have consent to hold such a dialogue with a _ insurgent _ flouren also be kill where and how be not yet know with any certainty several version be give some speak of a ball in the head or the neck or the chest other spread the report that he skull be cut open by a sword flouren be think about and talk of by man of the most opposite opinion this singular man inspire no antipathy even amongst those who might hold he in the greatest detestation i shall one day try to account for the partiality of opinion in favor of this young and romantic insurgent duval shot flouren kill bergeret lie in the pang of death the enthusiasm of the federal might well be cool down not in the least the battalion that march along the boulevard have the same resolute air as they sing and shout _ vive la commune _ be they the dupe of they chief to that extent as to believe the pompous proclamation with they hourly announcement of attack repel of redoubt take of soldier of the line make prisoner it be not probable and besides the guard of the respective quarter must see the return of those who have be to the fight and whose anxious wife be wait on the step of the door must learn from they that the forward march have in reality be rout and that many dead and wound have be leave on the field when the commune report only declare loss of little importance whence come this ardor that the first rush and defeat can not check be it nourished by the report true or false of the cruelty of the versaillai which be spread by the hundred the murder of duval the assassination of flouren prisoner shoot _ vivandières _ violate all these culpable invention -- can they be invention or do civil war make such barbarian of we -- be indeed of a nature to excite the enthusiasm of hate and the man march to a probable defeat with the same air as they would march to certain victory ah whether lead astray or not whether guilty even or whatever the motive that impel they they be brave and when they pass thus they be grand yes in spite of the rag that serve the greater number of they for uniform in spite of the drunken gait of some as a whole they be superb and the reason of the coldest partisan of order at any price struggle in vain against the admiration which these man inspire as they march to they death it must be admit too that there be much less disorder in the command than might be expect the battalion all know whom they be to obey some go to the hôtel de ville other to the place vendôme many to the fort a few to the advanced post march and counter-march be manage without confusion and the combatant be in general well provide with ammunition and supply with provision far as one be from esteem the chief of the federal one be oblige to admit that there be something remarkable in this rapid organization of a whole army in the midst of one of the most complete political convulsion who then direct who command the member of the commune divide as they be in opinion do not appear capable on account of they number and lamentable inexperience of take the sole lead in military affair be there not some one either amongst they or in the background who know how to think direct and act be it bergeret be it cluseret the future perhaps will unravel the mystery in the meantime and in spite of the reverse to which the federal have have to submit during these last day the whole of pari unite in unanimous surprise at the extreme regularity with which the administrative system of the war seem to work the surprise be the greater that during the siege the legitimate chief with much more powerful means and have discipline troops at they command do not succeed in obtain the same striking result but would it not have be better far that that order have never exist better a thousand time that the command have be less precise than that those command should have be lead to a death without glory for the last few day neuilly so joyous in time go by with its busy shop its frequented _ restaurant _ and princely park neuilly with the versaille battery on one side and the pari gun on the other under a incessant rain of shell and _ mitraille _ from mont valérien neuilly with she bridge take and re-taken she barricade abandon and re-conquer have be for the last few day like a vast abyss into which the federal battalion seize with mortal giddiness be precipitated one after another each house be a fortress yesterday the _ gendarme _ have advance as far as the market of sablonville this morning they be drive back beyond the church upon this church a child the son of monsieur leullier plant a red flag amidst a shower of projectile that child will make a true man say cluseret the war delegate ah yes provide he be not a corpse ere then shot be fire from window to window a house be assault there be encounter on the stair it be a horrible struggle in which no quarter be give night and day through all hour the rage and fury on both side be terrific man that be friend a week ago have but one desire -- to assassinate each other a inhabitant of neuilly who succeed in escape related this to I : two enemy a soldier of the line and a federal have a encounter in the bathing establishment of the avenue de neuilly a little above the rue des huissier now pursue now fly from each other in they bayonet-fight they reach the roof of the house and there fling down they arm they close in a mad struggle on the sloping roof the tile of which crush beneath they at a hundred foot from the ground they struggle without mercy without respite until at last the soldier feel he strength give way and endeavor to escape from the gripe of he adversary then the federal -- the person from whom i learn this be at a opposite window and lose not a single one of they movement -- the federal draw a knife from he pocket and prepared himself to strike he half-prostrate antagonist who feel that all hope be lose throw himself flat on the roof seize he enemy by the leg and drag he with he by a sudden movement they roll over and fall on to the pavement below neither be kill but the soldier have he face crimson with blood and dust and the federal who have fall across he adversary despatch he by plunge he knife in he chest such be this infamous struggle such be this savage strife will it not cease until there be no more blood to shed in the meantime pari of the boulevard the elegant and fast-living pari lounge stroll and smile in spite of the numerous departure there be still enough blasé dandy and beauty of light lock and lighter reputation to bring the blush to a honest man 's cheek the theater be open _ la pièce du pape _ be be play do you know the pope 's money it be a suitable piece for divert the thought from the horror of civil war a year ago the pope be support by french bayonet but he light coinage would not pass in paris now papal zouave be kill the citizen of pari and we take light silver and lighter paper the piece be flimsy enough it be not its political significance that make it divert but the _ double-entendre _ therein one must laugh a little you understand man be die out yonder we might as well laugh a little here low whisper in the _ baignoire _ munch of sugared violet in the stage box -- everything 's for the best mademoiselle nénuphar -lrb- name so by antithesis -rrb- be say to have the most beautiful eye in the world i will wager that that handsome man behind she have already compare they to mitraille shot see the ravages they commit it would be impossible to be more complimentary -- more witty and to the point ah look you those who be fight at this moment who to-day by they cannon and chassepot be expose pari to a terrible revenge guilty as these man be i hold they higher than those who roar with laughter when the whole city be in despair who have not even the modesty to hide they joy from we distress and who amuse themselves openly with shameless woman while mother be weep for they child on the boulevard it be worse still there vice exhibit itself and triumph be it then true what a young fellow a poor student and bitter philosopher say to I just now : when all pari be destroy when its house its palace and its monument throw down and crushed strew its accursed soil and form but one vast ruin beneath the sky then from out of this shapeless mass will rise as from a huge sepulchre the phantom of a woman a skeleton dress in a brilliant dress with shoulder bare and a toquet on its head and this phantom run from ruin to ruin turn its head every now and then to see if some libertine be follow she through the waste -- this phantom be the leprous soul of pari when midnight approach the _ cafés _ be shut the delegate of the central committee at the ex-prefecture have the habit of send patrol of national guard to hasten and overlook the closing of all public place but this precaution like so many other be useless there be secret door which escape the closest investigation when the shutter be put up light filter through the interstice of the board go close up to they apply you eye to one of those light crevice listen to the cannon roar the mitrailleus horribly spit the musketry crack and then look into the interior of the closed room people be talk eating and smoking waiter go to and fro there be woman too the man be gay and silly champagne bottle be be uncork ah ah it be the fusillade lover and mistress be in common here this orgie have the most telling effect i tell you in the midst of the city load with malediction a few step from the battle-field where the bayonet be deal they death thrust and the shell be scatter blood and later after the laughter and the song and the drink they take a open carriage if the night be fine and go to the champ elysées and there mount upon the box by the coachman to try and see the fight -- if those people know how to die as well as they know how to laugh it would be better for they other _ bon viveur _ more discreet hide themselves on the first floor of some house and in some of the club but they be betray by the sparkle of the chandelier which pierce the heavy curtain if you walk along by the wall you will hear the conversation of the gamester and the joyous clink of the gold piece ah the cowardice of the merry one oh thrice pardonable anger of those who starve xxix at one o'clock this morning the 5th of April on my return from one of these nightly excursion through pari i be follow the rue du mont thabor so as to gain the boulevard when on cross the rue saint-honoré i perceive a small number of national guard range along the pavement the incident be a common one and i take no notice of it in the rue du mont thabor not a person be to be see all be in silence and solitude suddenly a door open a few step in front of I a man come out and hurry away in the direction opposite to that of the church this departure look like a flight i stop and lend my attention soon two national guard rush out by the same door run shout as they go after the fugitive who have have but a short start of they and overtake he without difficulty bring he back between they while the national guard that i have see in the rue saint-honoré run up at the noise the exclamation and insult of all kind that be vociferate lead I to ascertain that the man they have arrest be the abbé deguerry _ curé _ of the madeleine he be drag into the house the door be shut and all sink into silence again that morning i learn that monseigneur darboy the archbishop of pari be take at the same hour and in almost similar circumstance -lrb- illustration : abbé deguerry curé of the madeleine -rrb- the arrest of several other ecclesiastic be cite the _ curé _ of st séverin and the _ curé _ of st eustache have be make prisoner it be say the first in he own house the second at the moment when he be leave he church the _ curé _ of notre-dame-des-victoire be to have be arrest also but warn in time he be able to place himself in safety monseigneur darboy be conduct to the ex-prefecture -lrb- why the _ ex _ - prefecture it seem to I it work just as well as when it be purely and simply a prefecture -rrb- be cross-examine there by the citizen delegate rigault it must be say that monsieur rigault have begin to make himself talk about during these last few day he be evidently a man who have a natural vocation for the employment he have choose for he arrest and arrest and still arrest he be young cold and cynical but he cynicism do not exclude he from a certain gaiety as we shall see it be the citizen rigault then who examine the archbishop of pari i be not inordinately curious but i should very much like to know what the cynical member of the commune could ask of monseigneur darboy have commit apparently but one crime that of be a priest and have no inclination to disguise it it be difficult to know what the interrogatory could turn upon monsieur rigault 's imagination furnish he no doubt with ample material for the interview and he have probably as much vocation for the part of a magistrate as for that of a police officer but however it may be the journal of the commune record this fragment with ill-disguised admiration -lrb- illustration : raoul rigault -lrb- 36 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- illustration : monseigneur darboy archbishop of pari -rrb- my child -- the white-haired archbishop of pari be report to have say at one moment citizen interrupt the citizen rigault who be not yet thirty you be not before child but before magistrate that be smart and i can conceive the enthusiasm with which monsieur rigault inspire the member of the commune but this excellent citizen do not confine himself to this haughty repartee i be inform -lrb- and i have reason to believe with truth -rrb- that he add : moreover that be too old a tale you have be try it on these eighteen hundred year now everyone must admit that this be as remarkable for its wit as for its elegance and it be just what might be expect of the amiable delegate who the other day in a moment of exaggerated clemency permit a abbé to visit a prisoner in the conciergerie and furnish he with a _ laisser-passer _ that run thus : admit the bearer who style himself the servant of one of the name of god oh what graceful charming wit footnote : -lrb- footnote 36 : rigault become connect with rochefort in the year 1869 and with he be engage on the journal call the _ marseillaise _ and produce article which subject he more than once to fine and imprisonment in the month of September 1870 he be appoint by the government of the national defense commissaire of police but have take part in the insurrection of the 31st of October he be on the follow day dismiss from office shortly after this he make he appearance as a writer in blanquus 's paper the _ patrie en danger _ but presently he take a military turn and get himself elect to the command of a battalion of the national guard he seem to have be bear a informer or police spy for we be tell when at school he use to amuse himself by fill up list of proscription with the name of he fellow-pupil with such charming natural instinct it be not at all surprising that he be on the 18th of march appoint by the commune government prefect of police -rrb- xxx i be begin to feel decidedly uncomfortable this new decree of the commune seriously endanger the liberty of all those who be so unfortunate as to have incur the ill-will of they concierge or whose dealings with he next-door neighbor have not be of a strictly amicable nature let we copy the 1st article of this ferocious decree all person accuse of complicity with the government of versaille shall be immediately take and incarcerate -lrb- 37 -rrb- pest they do not mince matter why the first good-for-nothing rascal -- to whom perhaps i refuse to lend five franc seven year ago -- may go round to citizen rigault and tell he that i be in regular communication with versaille whereupon i be immediately incarcerate for i beg it may be observe it be not necessary that the complicity with the traitor should be prove the denunciation be quite sufficient for one to be send to contemplate the blue sky through the bar of the conciergerie -lrb- 38 -rrb- besides what do the word complicity with the government of versaille mean all depend upon the way one look at those thing i be not sure that i be innocent i remember distinctly have several time bow to a pleasant fellow -- i say pleasant fellow hope that these line will not fall under the observation of any one at the prefecture of police -- who at this very moment be quite capable the rogue of eat a comfortable dinner at the hôtel des réservoirs at versaille in company with one or more of the member of the national assembly you can understand now why i be begin to feel rather uncomfortable to know a man who know a deputy constitute i be fully persuade -- otherwise i be unworthy to live under the paternal government of the commune -- a most decide complicity with the man of versaille i really think it would be only commonly prudent to steal out of pari in a coal sack as a friend of mine do the other day or in some other agreeable fashion -lrb- 39 -rrb- see what may come of a bow footnote : -lrb- footnote 37 : decree concern the suspect commune of paris : consider that the government of versaille have wantonly trample on the rights of humanity and set at defiance the rights of war that it have perpetrate horror such as even the invader of we soil have shrink from commit consider that the representative of the commune of pari have a imperative duty devolve upon they -- that of defend the life and honor of two million of inhabitant who have commit they destiny to they charge and that it behove they at once to take measure equal to the gravity of the situation consider that the politician and magistrate of the city ought to reconcile the general weal with respect for public liberty decree : art 1 all person charge with complicity with the government of versaille will be immediately bring to justice and incarcerated art 2 a ` jury of accusation ' will be summon within the twenty-four hour to examine the charge bring before it art 3 the jury must pass sentence within the forty-eight hour art 4 all the accuse convict by the jury will be retain as hostage by the people of paris art 6 every execution of a prisoner of war or of a member of the regular government of the commune of

accusation ' who will decide whether they be immediately set at liberty or retain as hostage -rrb- xxxi flouren be dead : we hear that last night for certain a national guard have previously bring back the colonel 's horse from bougival but it be only a few hour ago that we hear any detail a attempt be make to take he prisoner at rueil a gendarme call out to he to surrender he reply by a pistol shoot another gendarme advance and wound he in the side a third cleft he skull with a sabre out some people do not believe in the pistol shot and talk of assassination how many such event be there the truth of which will never be clearly prove one thing certain be that flouren be dead he body be recognize at versaille by some one in the service of garnier frères he mother start this morning to fetch the corpse of she son it be strange that one be so painfully affect by the violent death of this man he have be mix up in all the revolutionary attempt of the last few year and ought to be particularly obnoxious to all peaceful and order-loving citizen but the truth be he be a sincerely ardent and enthusiastic spirit he be a thorough believer in the principle he maintain whatever may be the religion he profess the apostle inspire esteem and the martyr compassion this apostle this martyr be bear to affluence son of a illustrious savant he may be almost say to have be bear to hereditary distinction he be still quite young when he throw himself heart and soul into politics there be fight in crete and so off he go there he revolt against the revolt itself get imprison escape outwit the gendarme get retaken : he adventure sound like a legend or romance it be because he be so romantic that he be so interesting he return to france full of generous impulse he be as prodigal of he money as he have be of he blood in the bitter cold winter he feed and clothe the poor of belleville go from attic to attic with money and consolation you remember what victor hugo say of the sublime pauline roland the spirit of flouren much resemble hers the patriot could act the part of a sister of charity at other time a enthusiast in search of a social eldorado he would put himself at the service of the most forlorn cause never be anyone so imprudent he be of a most active and critical disposition : it be impossible for he to remain quiet when he be not seemingly employ he be agitate something in the shade he friendship for rochefort be great these two turbulent spirit one with he pen the other with he physical activity remind we each of the other both run to extreme rochefort in he literary invective flouren in he hairbreadth adventure although they be often ally these two they be sometimes oppose have you never see two young artist in a studio perform the old trick one make a speech while the other with he head and body hide in the fold of a cloak stretch forth he arm and execute the most extravagant gesture rochefort and flouren perform this farce in politics the former talk the latter gesticulate but on the day of the burial of victor noir they go different way on that day rochefort to do he justice save a large multitude of man from terrible danger flouren always the same wish the body to be carry to père lachaise on the road there must have be a collision that be what he desire but he be defeat the tongue prevail a hundred thousand cry of vengeance fill the air but they be only cry and no mischief be do except to a few grave in the neuilly cemetery flouren await a better occasion but by no means passively he be a man of barricade he do not seem to think that paving-stone be make to walk on he only care to see they heap up across a street for the protection of armed patriot although he always wear the dress of a gentleman he be not one of those black-coated individual who incite the man to rebellion and keep out of the way while the fight be go on he help to defend the barricade he have order to be throw up wherever there be a chance of be kill he be sure to be and in the midst of all this he never lose he placid expression nor the politeness of a gentleman nor the look of extreme youth which beam from he eye and must have be on he face even when he fall under the cruel blow of the gendarme now he be dead he be judge harshly he be condemn but he can not be hate he be a madman but he be a hero the conduct of flouren at the hôtel de ville in the night of the 31st October be hardly in keep with so favourable a view the french forgive and forget with facility -- let that pass -lrb- illustration : colonel flouren -lrb- 40 -rrb- -rrb- footnote : -lrb- footnote 38 : prison of detention -rrb- -lrb- footnote 39 : the follow be still more naïve : -- a man take a return-ticket for the environs and sometimes find a

mention a incident which break but one heart yes i think the sad episode be not without importance even in so vast a picture it be a child 's funeral the little wooden coffin scantily cover with a black pall be not larger as théophile gautier say than a violin case there be few mourner a woman the mother doubtless in a black stuff dress and white crimped cap holding by the hand a boy who have not yet reach the age of sorrowing tear and behind they a little knot of neighbor and friend the small procession creep along the wide street in the bright sunlight when it reach the church they find the door close and yet the money for the mass have be pay the night before and the hour for the ceremony fix one of the woman go forward towards the door of the vestry where she be meet by a national guard who tell she with a superfluity of oath that she must not go in that the -- curé the sacristan and all the d -- fellow of the church be lock up and that they would no longer have anything to do with patriot then the mother approach and say but who will bury my poor child if the curé be in prison and then she begin to weep bitterly at the thought that there would be no prayer put up for the good of the little spirit and that no holy water would be sprinkle on its coffin yes member of the commune she weep and she weep longer and more bitterly later at the cemetery when she see they lower the body of she child into the grave without a prayer or a recommendation to god 's mercy you must not scoff at she you see she be a poor weak woman with idea of the narrowest sort but there be other mother like she quite unworthy of course to bear the child of patriot who do not want they dear one to be bury like dog who can not understand that to pray be a crime and to kneel down before god a offence to humanity and who still be weak enough to wish to see a cross plant on the tomb of those they have love and lose not the cross of the nineteenth century -- a red flag -lrb- 41 -rrb- footnote

wherefore this fall after so much glory it be whisper about that assy have think it prudent to put aside a few roll of bank note find in the drawer of the late government what be that all how long have politician be so scrupulous member of the commune how very punctilious you have grow now if the citizen assy be accuse of have in 1843 be intimately acquaint with a lady whose son be now valet to m thier ' first cousin or if he have be see in a church and it be clearly prove that he be there with any other intention than that of delicately pick the pocket of the faithful then i could understand you indignation but the idea of arrest a man because he have appropriate the booty of the traitor be too absurd if you go on act in that way people will think you be grow conscientious as to citizen lullier -lrb- 43 -rrb- who be one of the first victim of fraternity he be imprison because he do not succeed in capture mont valérien i think with horror that if i have be in the place of citizen lullier i should most certainly have have to undergo the same punishment for how in the devil 's name i could have manage to transport that impregnable fortress on to the council-table at the hôtel de ville i have not the least conception it be as bad as if you be in switzerland and ask the first child you meet to go and fetch mont blanc of course the child would go and have a game of marble with he companion and come back without the smallest trace of mont blanc in he arm thereupon you would whip the youngster within a ace of he life however it appear that m lullier object to be whip or rather imprison and be as full of cunning as of valor he manage to slip out of he place of confinement without drum or trumpet dear rochefort he write to the editor of _ le mot d'ordre _ you know of what infamous machination i have be the victim i suppose m rochefort do but i be oblige to confess that i have not the least idea unless indeed m lullier means by machination the order that be give he to bring mont valérien in he waistcoat pocket imprison without motive he continue by order of the central committee i be throw -lrb- oh you should not have _ throw _ m lullier -rrb- into the prefecture of police -lrb- the ex-prefecture if you please -rrb- and put in solitary confinement at the very moment when pari be in want of man of action and military experience oh fie man of the commune you have at you disposal a man of action -- who do not know the noble action of citizen lullier a man of military experience -- who do not know what profound experience m lullier have acquire in he numerous campaign -- and yet you put he or rather throw he into the prefecture this be bad very bad the prefecture be transform into a state prison and the most rigorous discipline be maintain it appear then that the communal prison be anything but a fool 's paradise however in spite of everything i and my secretary manage to make we escape calmly -- the calm of the high-minded -- from a cell where i be strictly guard to pass two court-yard and a dozen or two of soldier to have three door open for I while the sentinel present arm as i pass what a wonderful escape : the adventure of baron munchausen be nothing to it what a fine chapter poor old duma might have make of it the door of the cell be pass under the very nose of the jailer who have doubtless be drug with some narcotic of which m lullier have learn the secret during he travels in the east indy the twelve guard in the court-yard be seize one after another by the throat throw on the ground bind with cord and prevent from give the alarm by twelve gag thrust into they twelve mouth the three door be open by three enormous false key the work of a member of the commune locksmith by trade who have remain faithful to the cause of m lullier and last but not least the sentinel plunge in ecstasy at the sight of the glorious fugitive present arm what a scene for a melodrama the most interesting figure however in my opinion be the secretary i have the greatest respect for that secretary who never dream one instant of abandon he master and i can see he while lullier be accomplish he miracle calmly write in the midst of the danger with a firm hand the faithful account of these immortal adventure i have now continue the ex-prisoner of the ex-prefecture two hundred determine man who serve I as a guard and three excellent revolver load in my pocket i have foolishly remain too long without arm and without friend now i be resolve to blow the brain out of the first man who try to arrest I i hear a bourgeois who have read this exclaim that he wish to heaven each member of the commune would come to arrest he in turn oh blood-thirsty bourgeois then lullier finish up by declare that he scorn to hide but continue to show himself freely and openly on the boulevard what a proud what a noble nature oh ye marionettes ye fantoccini yet let I not be unjust i will try and believe in you once more in spite of armed requisition in spite of arrest of robbery -- for there have be robbery in spite of you decree -- i will try and believe that you have not only take possession of the hôtel de ville for the purpose of set up a punch and judy show and play you sinister farce i want to believe that you have and still have honorable and avowable intention that it be only you natural inexperience join to the difficulty of the moment which be the cause of you fault and you folly i want to believe that there be among you even after the successive dismissal of so many of you member some honorable man who deplore the evil that have be do who wish to repair it and who will try to make we forget the crime and forfeit of the civil war by the benefit which revolution sometimes bring in its train yes i be naturally full of hope and will try and believe this but honestly what hope can you have of inspiring confidence in those who be not prejudice as i be in favor of innovator when they see you arrest each other in this fashion and know that you have among you such general as bergeret such honest citizen as assy and such escape lunatic as lullier footnote : -lrb- footnote 42 : assy who first become publicly know as the leader of the strike at messr schneider 's work at creuzot be a engineer he be bear in 1840 he become a member of the international society and be select in 1870 to organise the

see long line of white smoke arise in the distance every morning citizen cluseret -lrb- 44 -rrb- the war delegate announce that a assault of gendarme have be victoriously repulse by the garrison in the fort it be quite certain that if the versaillai do attack they be repulse as they make no progress whatever but do they attack that be the question i be rather incline to think that these attack and repuls be mere invention it seem evident to I that the general of the national assembly who be now busy establish battery and concentrate they force will not make a serious attempt until they be certain of victory in the meantime they be satisfied to complete the ruin of the fort which be already so much damage by the prussian between courbevoie and the porte maillot the fighting be continual ground be lose and gain such and such a house that be just now occupy by the versaillai be now in the hand of the federal and _ vice versâ _ neither side be wholly victorious but the fighting go on

all this dreadful misunderstanding cease footnote : -lrb- footnote 44 : the biography of this general of the commune be very imperfect down to the time when he be elect for the 1st arrondissement of

but be dismiss the army upon be convict of defalcation in connection with the purchase of horse and that soon after he dismissal from the french army he go to the united state where he serve in the

deserve but little credit after close he career as a shepherd he become a defender of the pope 's flock enlist in the brigade against which garibaldus take the field the next we hear of he be that he join the fenian and make a attempt to get possession of chester castle but that he fall under suspicion of be a traitor and be glad to escape to france where report say he find refuge with a religious

shear of she majesty but still a queen it be in vain that the press have sometimes degrade itself in the eye of honest man by stoop to applaud and approve of crime and excess that journalist have do what they can to lower it still the August offspring of the human mind the press have really lose neither its power nor its fascination misunderstand misapply it may have do some harm but no one can question the signal service which it have be able to render or the nobility of its mission if it have sometimes be the organ of false prophet its voice have also be often raise to instruct and encourage when last night you go secretly in a manner worthy of the act to seize on the printing press of the _ journal des débats _ the _ pari journal _ and the _ constitutionnel _ be you aware of what you be do you imagine perhaps this act would have no other result than that of suppress violently a private concern -- which be one kind of robbery -- and of reduce to a state of beggary -- which be a crime -- the numerous individual journalist printer compositor and other who be employ on the journal and who live by its means you have do worse than this you have stop as far as it be in you power the current of human progress you have suppress man 's noblest right -- the right of express he opinion to the world you be no better than the pickpocket who appropriate you handkerchief you have take we freedom of think by the throat and say it be in my way i will strangle it wherefore have you act thus to shut the mouth of those who contradict you be to admit that you be not so very sure of be in the right to suppress the journal be to confess you fear of they to avoid the light be to excite we suspicion concern the deed you be perpetrate in the darkness we shut we window when we do not desire to be see little confidence be inspire by closed door you council at the hôtel de ville be secret as the proceedings of certain legal case the detail of which might be hurtful to public morality again i say wherefore this mystery what strange project have you on foot do you discuss among you proposition of a nature which you modesty decline to make know to the world this fear of publicity of opposition you have prove afresh by the nocturnal visit of you national guard to the printing office wherein they force a entrance like housebreaker shall we be reduce to judge of you act and of the bloody incident of the civil war only by you own asseveration and those of you accomplice you must be very determine to act guiltily and to be oblige to tell lie as you take so much trouble to get rid of those who might pass sentence on you and who might convict you of falsehood therefore you have not only commit a crime in so do but make a great mistake as well no one can meddle with the liberty of the press with impunity the persecution of the press always bring with it its own punishment look back to the many year of the imperial government to the few month of the government of the 4th of September of all the crime perpetrate by the former of all the error commit by the latter those crime and error which most particularly hasten the end be those that be level against the freedom of the press the most valable excuse in favor of the revolt of the 18th of march be certainly the suppression of several journal by general vinoy with the consent of m thier how can you be so rash as to make the very same mistake which have be the destruction of former government and also so unmindful of you own honor as to commit the very crime which reduce you to the same level as you enemy ah i truly those who be ready to judge you with patience and impartiality those who at first be perhaps on the whole favourable to you because it seem to they that you represent some of the legitimate aspiration of pari even those see you act like thoughtless tyrant will feel it quite impossible to blind themselves any longer to you fault those who have wish to esteem you for the sake of liberty will for the sake of liberty be oblige to despise you xxxviii it can not be true i will not believe it it can not be possible that pari be to be again bombard : and by whom by frenchman in spite of the danger i be tell there be to be apprehend near neuilly i wish to see with my own eye what be go on so this morning the 8th April i go to the champ elysées until i reach the rond point there be nothing unusual only perhaps fewer people to be see about the omnibus do not go any farther than the corner of the avenue marigny a englishwoman whom the conductor have just help down come up to I and ask I the way she want to go to the rue galilée but do not like to walk up the wide avenue i point out to she a side-street and continue my way a little higher up a line of national guard stand about ten foot distant from each other have order to stop passenger from go any farther you can not pass -- but and i stop to think of some plausible motive to justify my curiosity however i be save the trouble although i have only utter a hesitate but the sentinel seem to consider that sufficient and reply oh very well you can pass the avenue seem more and more desert as i advance the shutter of all the house be close here and there a passenger slip along close to the wall of the house ready to take refuge within the street-door which have be leave open by order directly they hear the whizzing of a shell in front of the shop of a carriage-builder securely close be pile heap of rifle most of the national guard be stretch on the pavement fast asleep while some few be walk up and down smoke they pipe and other play at the plebeian game of bouchon -lrb- 46 -rrb- i be tell that a shell have burst a quarter of a hour before at the corner of the rue de morny a captain be seat there on the ground beside he wife who have just bring he he breakfast the poor fellow be literally cut in two and the woman have be carry away to a neighbouring chemist 's shop dangerously wound i be tell she be still there so i turn my step in that direction a small group of people be assemble before the door i manage to get near but see nothing as the poor thing have be carry into the surgery they tell I that she have be wound in the neck by a bit of the shell and that she be now under the care of one of the surgeon of the press ambulance i then continue my walk up the avenue the cannonading which have seem to cease for some little time now begin again with greater intensity than ever cloud of white smoke arise in the direction of the porte maillot while bomb from mont valérien burst over the arc de triomphe on the right and left of I be company of federal a little further on a battalion fully equip with blanket and saucepan strap to they knapsack and loaf of bread stick aloft on they bayonet move in the direction of porte maillot by the side of the captain in command of the first company march a woman in a strange costume the skirt of a vivandière and the jacket of a national guard a phrygian cap on she head a chassepot in she hand and a revolver stick in she belt from the distance at which i be stand she look both young and pretty i ask some federal who she be one tell I she be the wife of citizen eude -lrb- 47 -rrb- a member of the commune and another that she be a newspaper seller in the avenue des ternes whose child have be kill in the rue des acacias the night before by a fragment of a shell and that she have swear to revenge he it appear the battalion be on its way to support the combatant at neuilly who be in want of help from what i hear the gendarme and sergent de ville have fight they way as far as the rue des huissier now i have no doubt the versaille general have make use of the gendarme and sergent de ville who be most of they old and try soldier but if in very truth they be wherever the imagination of the federal persist in place they they must either have be as numerous as the grain of sand on the sea-shore or else they leader must have find out a way of make they serve in several place at once have follow the battalion i find myself a few yard in front of the arc de triomphe suddenly a hiss whiz sound be hear in the distance and rapidly approach we it sound very much like the noise of a sky-rocket a shell cry the sergeant and the whole battalion to a man throw itself on the ground with a load jingle of saucepan and bayonet indeed there be some danger the terrible projectile lower as it approach and then fall with a terrific noise a little way from we in front of the last house on the left-hand side of the avenue i have never see a shell burst so near I before a good idea of what it be like may be have from those sinister look painting that one see sometimes suspend round the neck of certain blind beggar suppose to represent a explosion in a mine i think no one be hurt and the mischief do seem to consist in a wide hole in the asphalte and a door reduce to splinter the national guard get up from the ground and several of they proceed to pick up fragment of the shell they have however not go many yard when another cry of alarm be give and again we hear the ominous whiz sound in a instant we be all on we face the second shell burst but we do not see it we only see at the top of the house that have already be strike a window open suddenly and break pane fall to the ground the shell have most likely go through the roof and burst in the attic be there anyone in those upper story however we be on we leg again and have double the arc de triomphe i have succeed in ingratiate myself with the man of the rear-guard and i hope to be able to go as far with they as i pleased strange enough and i confess it with _ naif _ delight i do not feel at all afraid although half a inch difference in the inclination of the cannon might have cost I my life still i feel inclined to proceed on my way i begin to think that it be not difficult to be brave when one be not naturally a coward beneath the great arch be assemble a hundred or so of person who seem to consider themselves in safety and who from time to time venture a few step forward for the purpose of examine the damage do to etex 's sculptured group by three successive shell but in the avenue de la grande armée only three federal be to be see and i think i be the only man in plain clothes they have allow to go so far i could distinctly perceive a small barricade erect in front of the porte maillot on this side of the rampart the bastion to the right be hard at work cannonade the height of courbevoie great column of smoke succeed by terrific explosion testify to the zeal of the communist artilleryman beyond the rampart the avenue de neuilly extend dusty and desert unfortunately the sun blind I and i could not distinguish well what be go on in the distance by this time the sound of musketry be hear distinctly i be tell they be fight principally at saint jame and in the park of neuilly i try to pass out of the gate with the battalion but a officer catch sight of I and in no measure tone order I back i ought not to complain however he render I good service for although the fire of the versaillai have somewhat diminish i do not think the place could have be much longer tenable to judge from the quantity of bit of shell that strew the road from the numerous litter that be be bear away with they bloody burthen from the railway-station in ruin and the condition of the neighbouring house which have nearly all of they great black hole in they front the federal do not seem at all impress by they critical position sound of laughter reach I from the interior of a casemate from the chimney of which smoke be arise and guard run hither and thither be whistle merrily the _ chant du départ _ with a look of complete satisfaction -lrb- illustration : the arc de triomphe east side -lrb- the finest -rrb- uninjured damage on the other side during the prussian siege it be defend from injury though no shell reach it uncover before the civil war -rrb- i manage to reach the rue du débarcadère which be situate close to the rampart a acquaintance of mine life there i know he be away but i think the porter would recognize and allow I to take up a position at one of the window next door the corner house i find a shell have go into a wine-merchant 's shop there who could very well have dispense with such a visitor and have behave in the most unruly fashion break the glass smash the table and counter but neither kill nor wound anybody the porter know I quite well and invite I to walk upstairs to the apartment of my friend situate on the third floor from the window i could not see the bastion which be hide by the station but to the leave in the distance beyond the bois de boulogne wherein i fancied i perceive troops move between the branch but whether versaillai or parisian i could not tell arise the tremendous mont valérien bath in sunlight the flash from the cannon which in daylight have a pale silver tint succeed each other rapidly the explosion be formidable and the fort be crown with a wreath of smoke they appear to be firing in the direction of levalloi rather than on the porte maillot the federal do not seem to attempt to reply turn myself towards the right i could scan nearly the whole length of the avenue de neuilly the bare piece of ground which constitute the military zone be completely desert several shell fall there that have be aim doubtless at the porte maillot or the bastion the position i have take up at the window be rather a perilous one i be just behind the bastion beyond the military zone most of the house seem uninhabited but i see distinctly the national guard in front of the restaurant gilet make they soup on the side-walk i be too far away to judge of the extent of the mischief do by the cannonading but i be tell that several roof have fall in and many wall have be throw down in that quarter all that i could see of the market-place be empty but the sound of musketry and the smoke which issue from the house on one side of it tell I that the federal be there in sufficient number a little further on i see the barrel of the rifle stick out of the window with little wreath of smoke curl out of they small knot of armed man every now and then march hurriedly across the avenue and disappear into the opposite house partly on account of the distance and partly on account of the blind sun and partly perhaps on account of the emotion i experience which make I desire and yet fear to see i could distinguish the bridge but indistinctly with the dark line of a barricade in front of it what surprise I most in the battle which i be busily observe be the extraordinarily small number of combatant that be visible when suddenly -- it be about two o'clock in the afternoon -- the versaille battery at courbevoie which have be silent for some time begin firing furiously the horrid screech of the mitrailleuse drown the hissing of the shell the whole breadth of the long avenue be cover by a kind of white mist the bastion in front of I reply energetically it seem to I as if the interior part of my ear be be rent asunder when suddenly i hear a dull heavy sound such as i have not hear before and i feel the house tremble beneath I loud cry arise from the national guard on the rampart i fancy that a rain of shot and shell have destroy the drawbridge of the porte maillot but it be not so in the distance i see that the cloud of smoke be roll nearer and nearer and that the roar of the musketry which have greatly increase sound close by i feel sure that a rush be be make from courbevoie -- that the versaillai be advance the shell be fly over we head in the direction of the champ elysées i begin to distinguish that a tumultuous mass of human being be march on in the smoke in the dust in the sun the gun on the bastion now thunder forth incessantly there be no mistaking by this time there be the versaillai i could see the red trowser of the man of the line the federal be shoot they down from the window then i see the advanced guard stop hesitate beneath the ball which seem to rain on they from the place du marché and presently retire whereupon a large number of federal pour forth from the house and walk close to the wall to be as much as possible out of the way of the projectile hurry after the retreat enemy but suddenly when they have arrive a little too far for I to distinguish anything very clearly they in they turn come to a standstill and then retrace they step and return to they position within the house the fire from the versaillai then sensibly diminish but that of the bastion continue its furious attack it be thus that i witness one of those _ chassé-croisés _ under fire which have become so frequent since this dreadful civil war be concentrate at neuilly -lrb- illustration : horse chasseur act as a communist artillery man attend by a gamin sponger -rrb- as it would have be most imprudent to follow the railway cut or to have go back by the avenue de la grande armée where the versaille shell be still fall i walk up the rue du débarcadère and then turn into the rue saint-ferdinand and soon find myself in the place des ternes in front of the church there be a most dismal aspect about the whole of this quarter situate close to the rampart it be very much expose and have suffer greatly nearly all the shop be shut some of the door however of those where wine or provision be sell be stand open while on the shutter of other be inscribe in chalk the entrance be beneath the gateway i be astonish to see that the church be open a rare sight in these day why be it possible that the commune have commit the unqualifiable imprudence of not arrest the curé of saint-ferdinand and that she be weak enough -- may she not have to regret it -- to permit the inhabitant of terne to be baptise married and bury accord to the deplorable rite and ceremony of catholicism which have happily fall into disuse in the other quarter of pari i can now understand why the shell fall so persistently in this poor arrondissement : the anger of the goddess of reason -lrb- shall we not soon have a goddess of reason -rrb- lie heavily on this quarter the shame of the capital where the inhabitant still try to look as if they believe in heaven in spite of everything however i enter the church there be a great many woman on they knee and several man too the prayer of the dead be be say over the coffin of a woman who i be tell be kill yesterday by a ball in the chest whilst cross the avenue des ternes just a little above the railway bridge a ball how strange yet i be assure such be the case it be pretty evident then that the versaillai be considerably nearer to pari on this side at least than the official despatch lead we to suppose on return to the street i direct my step in the direction of the place d'eylau two national guard pass I bear a litter between they -- oh you can look if you like say one so i draw back the check curtain on the mattress be stretch a woman decently dress with a child of two or three year lie on she breast they both look very pale one of the woman 's arm be hang down she sleeve be stain with blood the hand have be carry away -- where be they wound i ask -- wound they be dead it be the wife and child of the velocipede-maker in the avenue de wagram if you will go and break the news to he you will do we a good service it be therefore quite true certain incontestable the ball and shell of the versaillai be not content with kill the combatant and knock down the fort and rampart they be also kill woman and child ordinary passer-by not only those who be attract by a imprudent curiosity to go where they have no business but unfortunate who be necessarily oblige to venture into the neighbouring street for the purpose of buy bread not only do the shell of the national assembly reach the building situate close to the city wall but they often fall considerably farther in crush inoffensive house and break the sculpture on the public monument no one can deny this i have see it with my own eye anyhow the projectile fall nearer and nearer the center yesterday they fall in the avenue de la grande armée to-day they fly over the arc de triomphe and fall in the place d'eylau and the avenue d'uhrich who know but what to-morrow they will have reach the place de la concorde and the next day perhaps i may be kill by one on the boulevard montmartre pari bombard take care gentleman of the national assembly what the prussian do and what give rise to such a clamor of indignation on the part of the government of the 4th September it will be both infamous and imprudent for you to attempt you kill frenchman who be in arm against they countryman -- alas that be a horrible necessity in civil war -- but spare the life and the dwelling of those who be not array against you and who be perhaps you ally it be all very well to argue that gun be not endow with the gift of intelligence and mercy and that one can not make they do exactly what one likes but what have you do with those marvellous marksman who during the siege continually throw down the enemy 's battery and interrupt he work with such extraordinary precision and who pretend that at a distance of seven thousand metre they could hit the gilded spike of a prussian helmet wherefore have they become so clumsy since they change place with they adversary joke apart in a word you be do yourself the greatest injury in be so uselessly cruel every shell overleap the fortification be not only a crime but a great mistake remember that in this horrible duel which be go on victory will not really remain with that party which shall have triumph over the other by the force of arm -lrb- yours undoubtedly -rrb- but to the one who by he conduct shall have succeed in prove to the neutral population which observe and judge that right be on he side i do not say but what you cause be the best for although we may have to reproach you with a imprudent resistance unnecessary attack and a wilful obstinacy not to see what be legitimate and honorable in the wish of the parisian still we must consider that you represent legally the whole of france i do not say therefore but what you cause be the best frankly though can you hope to bring over to you side that large body of citizen whose confidence you have shake by massacre innocent people in the street and destroy they dwelling if this bombardment continue if it increase in violence as it seem likely to do you will become odious and then be you a hundred time in the right you will still be in the wrong therefore it be most urgent that you give order to the artilleryman of courbevoie and mont valérien to moderate they zeal if you do not desire that pari -- neutral pari -- should make dangerous comparison between the assembly which fling we its shell and the commune which launch its decree and come to the conclusion that decree be less dangerous missile than cannon-ball as to the legality of the thing we do not much care about that we have see so many government more or less legal that we be somewhat _ blasés _ on that point and a few million of vote have scarcely power enough to put we in good humor with shot and shell certainly the commune such as the man at the hôtel de ville have constitute it be not a brilliant prospect it arrest priest stop newspaper wish to incorporate we in spite of ourselves in the national guard rob we -- so we be tell lie inveterately -- that be incontestable and altogether make itself a great bear but what do that matter -- human nature be full of weakness and prefer to be bore than bombard -lrb- illustration

citizen if you will allow I to express my humble opinion on the subject i shall take the opportunity of insinuate that the plan of citizen bergeret -- which have i acknowledge be completely unsuccessful -- be the only possible one capable of transform into a triumphant revolution the émeute of montmartre now the commune of paris let we look at it from a logical point of view if you please do it seem possible to you that pari can hold its own against the whole of the rest of france no most certainly not today especially after the disaster that have occur to the communal insurrectionist of marseille lyon and toulouse -- disaster which you lie official report have in vain try to transform into success today i say you can not possibly nourish any delusive hope of help from the province in a few day you will have the whole country in array in front of you rampart and you ruin fortress and then you be lose yes lose in spite of all the blinded heroism of those whom you have beguile to the slaughter the only hope you could reasonably have conceive be that of profit by the first moment of surprise and disorder which the victorious revolt have occasion among the small number of hesitating soldiery which then constitute the whole of the french army to surprise versaille inadequately defend and seize if it be possible on the assembly and the government you sudden revolution want to be follow up by a brusque attack there would then have be some hope -- a faint one i confess but still a hope and this plan of bergeret by the very reason of its audacity should not have be condemn by you who have only succeed through violence and audacity and can only go on prosper by the same means now what do you mean to do to resist the whole of france to resist you enemy inside the wall besides those enemy outside who increase in number and confidence every day you defeat be certain and from this day forth be only a question of time you be decidedly wrong to put bergeret in the shade as they say at the hôtel de ville -- firstly because he amuse we and secondly because he try the only thing that could possibly have succeed -- a enterprise worthy of a

so little importance to they life show I two and i will myself consent to be the third but i be interrupt dictator cluseret the decree of the fifth of April be therefore modify : the decree of the fifth of April be make by the commune but cluseret do not care a straw for that from seventeen to nineteen service in the marching-company be voluntary but from nineteen to forty it be obligatory for the national guard marry or unmarried i recommend all good patriot to be they own police and to see that this edict be carry out in they respective quartern and to force the refractory to serve as to the last paragraph of cluseret 's decree it be impossible to joke about it it be by far too odious this exhortation in favor of a press-gang -- this wish that each man should become a spy upon he

you may be sure for none but a wretch would follow the recommendation of cluseret -- a escape convict may take I by the collar and say come along and be kill for the sake of my municipal independence

summons like a willing slave and whether i like it or not drag I in night-cap and slipper in my shirt perhaps if it so please the brave _ sans-culotte _ to the nearest outpost now i swear to you cluseret i would not bear this if i have not during the last few hungry day of the siege sell to a curiosity dealer -- you colleague now in the commune -- my revolver which i have hope naïvely might

darkness into the light so many rascal and coward just as the sediment rise to the top when the wine be shake we must hope that there will be find in pari nobody to undertake the mean office of spy and detective and that the decree of m cluseret will remain a dead-letter like so many other decree of the commune i will not believe all i be tell i will not believe that last night several man without any precise order without any legal character whatever merely national guard introduce themselves into peaceful family wake the wife and child and carry off the husband as one carry off a housebreaker or a escape convict i be tell that this be a fact that it have happen more than fifty time at montmartre batignolle and belleville yet i will not believe it -lrb- 50 -rrb- i prefer to

spite of the excess that everyone condemn -- have naturally add to the validity of we just revendication the communist be wrong but the commune the true commune be right this be what pari believe and unhappily this be what versaille will not understand it want to remain as to the form of its government weakly stationary it make a municipal law that will be judge insufficient and as it obstinately persist in error which be wear out a month ago and be rotten now they will soon consider the conciliator whose idea have progress from day to day as the veritable agent of the insurrection and send

the good cause when they be only die for the good pleasure of monsieur avrial and monsieur billioray well and what be paris do all this time pari read the papers lounge run after the last news and ejaculate : ah ah they have put amouroux into prison the archbishop of paris have be transfer from the conciergerie to maza several thousand franc have be steal from monsieur denouille diable diable and then pari begin the same round of newspaper reading lounging and gossip again nothing seem change nothing seem interrupted even the proclamation of the famous cluseret who threaten we all with active service in the march regiment have not succeed in trouble the tranquillity and indifference of the greater number of parisian they look on at what be take place as at a performance and only bestow just enough interest upon it to afford they amusement this evening the cannonading have increase on listen attentively we can distinguish the sound of platoon-firing but pari take its glass of beer tranquilly at the café de madrid and its mazagran at the café riche sometimes towards midnight when the sky be clear pari go to the champ elysées to see thing a little nearer stroll under the tree and smoke a cigar exclaim : ah there go the shell then leisurely compare the roar of the battle of to-day to that of yesterday in stroll about thus in the neighborhood of the shell pari expose itself voluntarily to danger pari be indifferent and use be second nature then bed-time come paris look over the evening papers and ask with a yawn where the devil all this will end by a conciliation or the prussian perhaps and then pari fall asleep and get up the next morning just as fresh and lusty as if napoleon the third be still emperor by the grace of god and the will of the french nation xlvi a insertion in the _ journal officiel _ of versaille have justly irritated the greater part of the french press this be the paragraph false news of the most infamous kind have be spread in pari where no independent journal be allow to appear from these few line it may be conclude that in the eye of the government of versaille the whole of the pari newspaper whose editor have not desert they post have entirely submit to the commune and only think and say what the commune permit they to think and say this be a egregious calumny no thank heaven the parisian press have not renounce its independence and if no account be take -lrb- as be perfectly justifiable -rrb- of a heap of miserable little sheet which no sooner appear than they die and of some few other edit by member of the commune one would be oblige to acknowledge on the contrary that since the 18th of march the great majority of journal have exhibit proof of a proud and courageous independence each day without allow themselves to be intimidate either by menace of forcible suppression or threat of arrest they have fearlessly tell the member of the commune they opinion without concealment or circumlocution the french press have undoubtedly commit many offence during the last few year and be not altogether irresponsible for the trouble which have overwhelm the unhappy country but reparation be be make for these offence in this present hour of danger and the fearless attitude which it have maintain before these man of the hôtel de ville atones nobly for the past it have constitute itself judge condemn what be condemnable resist violence endeavor to enlighten the mass sometimes too -- and this be perhaps its greatest crime in the eye of the versaille government -- it permit itself to disapprove entirely of the act of the national assembly some journal go as far as to insinuate that the government be not altogether innocent of the present calamity but what do this prove that the press be no more the servant of the assembly than it be the slave of the commune in a word that it be free and what false news be this of which the _ journal officiel _ of versaille complain and against which it seem to warn we do it think it likely that we should be silly enough to give credence to the shout of victory that be record each morning on the handbill of the commune do it suppose that we look upon the deputy as nothing but a race of anthropophagus who dine every day off communist and federal at the _ table d'hôte _ of the hôtel des réservoirs not at all we easily unravel the truth from the entanglement of exaggeration forge by the man of the hôtel de ville and it be precisely this just appreciation of thing that we owe to those papers which the _ journal officiel _ condemn so inconsiderately but it be not of fake news alone probably that the versaille assembly be afraid it would not perhaps be sorry that we should ignore the real state of thing and i wager that if it have the power it would willingly suppress ill-informed journal -- although they be not communist the least in the world -- who allow themselves to state that for six day the shell of versaille have fall upon les ternes the champ elysées and the avenue wagram and have already cost as many tear and as much bloodshed as the prussian shell of fearful memory xlvii Wednesday 12th April -- another day pass as yesterday be as to-morrow will be the versaillai attack the fort of vanve and issy and be repulse there be fight at neuilly at bagneux at asnières in the town requisition and arrest be be make a detachment of national guard arrive before the northern railway-station they inquire for the director but director there be none embarrassing situation this the national guard can not come all this way for nothing determine on arrest some one they carry off m félix mathia head of the work and m coutin chief inspector a hour later other national guard imprison m lucien dubois general inspector of market in the depôt of the ex-prefecture of police here and there a few journalist be arrest without cause to serve as example some priest be despatch to maza among other m lartigue _ curé _ of _ saint leu _ yesterday the following be placard on the shut door of the church at montmartre : since priest be bandit and church retreat where they have morally assassinate the mass cause _ france to cower beneath the clutch of the infamous bonaparte favre and trochus _ the delegate of the stone mason at the ex-prefecture of police give order that the church of saint-pierre -lrb- not cinq-pierre this time -rrb- shall be close and decree the imprisonment of its priest and its _ frères ignorantin _ sign by le mousau to-day it be the turn of the church of notre dame de lorette a considerable number of worshipper have assemble in the holy place the national guard arrive head by man in plain clothes under the empire such man be call spy the woman find pray be turn out those who do not obey promptly enough with blow this do the guard retire what they have come there for be not know but what we be certain of be that they will begin again to-morrow in this same church or in another the day resemble each other as the child of a accursed family what frightful catastrophe will break this shameful monotony xlviii eh what it be impossible be you brain scatter i speak figuratively await the time when they will be scatter in earnest it must be some miserable jester who have word print and placard this unconscionable decree but no it be in the usual form the usual type this be rather too much gentleman of the commune it outstep the bound of the ridiculous you count a little too much this time on the complicity of some of the population and on the patience of other here be the decree : -lrb- illustration : the column in the place vendôme erect by the first napoleon to commemorate he german campaign of 1805 a imitation of the column of trajan at rome slightly taller it cost 1500000 franc -rrb- the commune of pari consider that the imperial column of the place vendôme be a monument of barbarian a symbol of brute force of false glory a encouragement of military spirit a denial of international rights a permanent insult offer by the conqueror to the conquer a perpetual conspiracy against one of the great principle of the french republic namely : fraternity decree : _ sole article _ -- the colonne vendôme be to be demolish now i must tell you plainly you be absurd contemptible and odious this sorry farce outstrip all one could have imagine and all that the versaille papers say of you must have be true for what you be do now be worse than anything they could ever have dare to imagine it be not enough to violate the church to suppress the liberty -- the liberty of write the liberty of speak the liberty of free circulation the liberty of risk one 's life or not it be not enough that blood should be recklessly spill that woman should be make widow and child orphan trade stop and commerce ruin it be not enough that the dignity of defeat -- the only glory remain -- should be swallow up in the shameful disaster of civil war in a word it be not sufficient to have destroy the present compromise the future you wish now to obliterate the past funereal mischief why the colonne vendôme be france and a trophy of its past greatness -- alas at present in the shade -- be not the monument but the record of a victorious race who stride through the world conquer as they go plant the tricolor everywhere in destroy the colonne vendôme do not imagine that you be simply overthrow a bronze column surmount by the statue of a emperor you disinter the remains of you forefather to shake they fleshless bone and say to they you be wrong in be brave and proud and great you be wrong to conquer town to win battle you be wrong to astound the universe by raise the vision of france glorified it be scatter to the wind the ash of hero it be tell those aged soldier see formerly in the street -lrb- where be they now why do we meet they no longer have you kill they or do they glory refuse to come in contact with you infamy -rrb- it be tell the maimed soldier of the invalide you be but blockhead and brigand so you have lose a leg and you a arm so much the worse for you idle scamp look on these rascal cripple for they country 's honor it be like snatch from they the cross they have win and deliver they into the hand of the shameless street urchin who will cry a hero a hero as they cry thief thief there be certainly purer and less costly grandeur than that which result from war and conquest you be free to dream for you country a glory different to the ancient glory but the heroic past do not overthrow it do not suppress it now especially when you have nothing with which to replace it but the disgrace of the present yet no complete you work continue in the same path the destruction of the colonne vendôme be but a beginning be logical and continue i propose a few decree : the commune of pari consider that the church of notre dame de paris be a monument of superstition a symbol of divine tyranny a affirmation of fanaticism a denial of human rights a permanent insult offer by believer to atheist a perpetual conspiracy against one of the great principle of the commune namely the convenience of its member decree : the church of notre dame shall be demolish what say you to my proposition do it not agree with you dearest desire but you can do better and better : believe I you ought to have the courage of you opinion the commune of pari consider that the museum of the louvre contain a great number of picture of statue and other object of art which by the subject they represent bring eternally to the mind of the people the action of god and king and priest that these action indicate by flattering brush or chisel be often delineate in such a way as to diminish the hatred that priest king and god should inspire to all good citizen moreover the admiration excite by the work of human genius be a perpetual assault on one of the great principle of the commune namely its imbecility decree : _ sole article _ -- the museum of the louvre shall be burn to the ground do not attempt to reply that in spite of the recollection of religion and despotism attach to these monument you would leave notre dame and the museum of the louvre untouch for the sake of they artistic importance beware of insinuate that you would have respect the colonne vendôme have it possess some merit as a work of art you respect the masterpiece of human art wherefore since when and by what right no little as you may have be know before you be master you be yet know enough for we to assert that one of you -- whom i will name : m lefrançais -- wish in 1848 to set fire to the _ salon carré _ there be another of you -- whom i will also name : m jule vallès -- assert that homer be a old fool it be true that m jule vallès be minister of public instruction if you have spare notre dame and the museum of the louvre up to this moment it be that you dare not touch they which be a proof not of respect but of cowardice ah we eye be open at last we be no longer dazzle by the chimerical hope we nourish for a moment of obtain through you communal liberty you do but adopt those opinion for the sake of mislead we as a thief assume the livery of a house to enter he master 's room and lay hand on he money we see you now as you be we have hope that you be revolutionist too ardent too venturous perhaps but on the whole impel by a noble intention : you be nothing but insurgent insurgent whose aim be to sack and pillage favor by disturbance and darkness if a few well-intentioned man be among you they have flee in horror count you number you be but a handful if there still remain any among you who have not lose all power of discriminate between justice and injustice they look towards the door and would fly if they dare yet this handful of furious fool govern pari still some among we have be order to they death and they have go how long will this last do we not surrender we arm can we not assemble as we do a month ago near the bank and deal justice ourselves without await a army from versaille ah i we must acknowledge that the deputy of the seine and the maire of pari mislead like ourselves err in siding with the insurrectionist they wish to avert street fighting be the strife we be witness not far more horrible than that we have escape one day 's struggle and it would have end yes we be wrong to lay down we arm but who could have believe -- the excess of the first few day seem more like the sad consequence of popular effervescence than like premeditated crime -- who could have believe that the chief of the insurrection lie with such impudence as be now only too evident and that before long the commune would be the first to deprive we of the liberty it be its duty to protect and develope the rural be right then -- they who have be so completely in the wrong in refuse to lend a attentive ear to the just prayer of a people eager for liberty they be right when they warn we against the ignorance and wickedness of these man ah be the national assembly but to will it there would yet be time to save paris if it really wish to establish a definite republic and concede to the capital of france the right free and entire of elect a independent municipality with what ardor should we not rally round the legitimate government how soon would the hôtel de ville be deliver from the contemptible man who have plant themselves there if the national assembly could only comprehend we if it would only consent to give pari its liberty and france its tranquillity by means of honorable concession xlix the delegate of the league of the republican union of the rights of pari return from versaille to-day the 14th April and publish the follow report : -- citizen -- the undersign choose by you to present you program to the government of versaille and to proffer the good office of the league to aid in the conclusion of a armistice have the honor of submit you a account of they mission the delegate have make know to monsieur thier the program of the league he reply that as chief of the sole legal government exist in france he have not to discuss the basis of a treaty but notwithstanding he be quite ready to treat with such person whom he consider as represent republican principle and to acquaint they with the intention of the chief of the executive power it be in accordance with these observation which denote in fact the true character of we mission that monsieur thier have make the follow declaration on different point of we program respect the recognition of the republic monsieur thier answer for its existence as long as he remain in power a republican state be put into he hand and he stake he honor on its conservation ay it be precisely that which will not satisfy paris -- pari sigh for peace and liberty we have all the most implicit faith in thier ' honor we be assure that the word french republic will head the white government placard as long as he remain in power but when thier be withdraw from power -- national assembly can be capricious sometimes -- what assure we that we shall not fall victim to a monarchical or even a imperial restoration ghost can appear in french history as well as in anne radcliffe 's novel to attempt to consider the elect member who sit at versaille as sincere republican be a effort beyond the power of we credulity you see that thier himself dare not speak he thought on what might happen be he to withdraw from power thus we find ourselves as before in a state of transition and this state of transition be just what appal we we address ourselves to the assembly and ask of it we be republican be you republican and the assembly pretend to be deaf and the deputy content themselves with hum under they breath some the royal tune of the white cockade and other the imperial air of partant pour la syrie this do not quite satisfy we it be true that thier say he will maintain the form of government establish in pari as long as he possibly can but he only promise for himself and it result clearly from all this that we shall not keep the republic long since its definite establishment depend in fact on the majority in the assembly while the assembly be royalist with a slight sprinkle of imperialism here and there but let we continue the reading of the report respect the municipal franchise of pari monsieur thier declare that paris will enjoy its franchise on the same condition as those of the other town accord to a common law such as will be set forth by the assembly of the representative of all france pari will have the common right nothing less and nothing more this again be little satisfactory what will this common right be what will the law set forth by the representative of all france be worth once more we have the most entire confidence in thier but have we the right to expect a law conformable to we wish from a assembly of man who hold opinion radically oppose to ours on the point which be in fact the most important in the question -- on the form of government concern the protection of paris now exclusively confide to the national guard monsieur thier declare that he will proceed at once to the organization of the national guard but that can not be to the absolute exclusion of the army in my personal opinion the president be perfectly right here but from the point of view which it be the mission of the delegate of the republican union to take be not this third declaration as evasive as the precede respect the actual situation and the means of put a end to the effusion of blood monsieur thier declare that not recognize as belligerent the person engage in the struggle against the national assembly he neither can nor will treat the question of a armistice but he declare that if the national guard of pari make no hostile attack the troops of versaille will make none either until the moment yet undetermined when the executive power shall resolve upon action and commence the war oh word word we be perfectly aware that thier have the right to speak thus and that all combatant be not belligerent but what be it as just as it be legal to argue the point so closely when the life of so many man be at stake and be a small grammatical concession so serious a thing that sooner than make it one should expose oneself to all the horrible feeling of remorse that the most rightful conqueror experience at the sight of the battle-field monsieur thier add : ` those who abandon the contest that be to say who return to they home and renounce they hostile attitude will be safe from all pursuit ' be thiers quite certain that he will not find himself abandon by the assembly at the moment when he enter upon this path of mercy and forgiveness monsieur thier alone except the assassin of general lecomte and general clément thoma who if take will be try for the crime and here he be undoubtedly right we must have be blind indeed the day that this double crime fail to open we eye to the true character of the man who if they do not commit it or cause it to be commit make at least no attempt to discover the criminal monsieur thier recognize the impossibility for a great part of the population now deprive of work to live without the allotted pay will continue to distribute that pay for several week longer such citizen be etc etc this report be sign by a dessonnaz a adam and donvallet alas we have foresee what the result of the honorable attempt make by the delegate of the republican union would be and this result prove that not only be the national guard at war with the regular troops but that a persistent opposition be also make by the national assembly of versaille to the most reasonable portion of the people of pari and yet the assembly represent france and speak and act only as she be commission to speak and act the truth then be this -- pari be republican and france be not republican there be division between the capital and the country the present convulsion bring about by a group of madman have its source in this divergence of feeling and what will happen will pari once more vanquish by universal suffrage bend she neck and accept the yoke of the provincial and rustic the right of these be incontestable but will it by reason of superiority of number take precedence of we right as incontestable as theirs these be dark question which hold the mind of man in suspense and which in spite of we desire to bring the national assembly over to we side the greater part of whose member could not join we without betray they trust cause we to bear the intolerable tyranny of the man of the hôtel de ville even while they sinister lucubration inspire we with disgust l during this time the wall resound with fun pari of the street and gutter -- pari gavroche and blackguard roll

to stamp out the vermin perhaps it be needless to add that the snake-like form issue from a hole in distant prussium meander through many nation cause great consternation and that m thier be finish off the french section in admirable style -rrb- li what have monsieur courbet to do among these people he be a painter not a politician a few beery speech utter at the hautefeuille café can not turn he past into a revolutionary one and a order refuse for the simple reason that it be more piquant for a man to have he button-hole without ornament than with a slip of red ribbon in it when it be well know that he disdain whatever every one else admire be but a poor title to fame to you last napoleon gaillard -lrb- 57 -rrb- to you paint-brush gustave courbet and if we say this it be not only from fear that the meager light of monsieur courbet be insufficient and may draw the commune into new act of folly -- -lrb- though we scarcely know alas if there be any folly the commune have leave undo -rrb- -- but it be above all because we fear the odium and ridicule that the false politician may throw upon the painter yes whatever may be we horror for the nude woman and unsightly production with which monsieur courbet -lrb- 58 -rrb- have honor the exhibition of painting we remember with delight several admirably true to nature with sunshine and summer breeze play among the leaf and stream murmur refreshingly over the pebble and rock whereon climb plant cling closely and besides these landscape a good picture here and there execute if not by the hand of a artist -- for the word artist possess a higher meaning in we eye -- at least by the hand of a man of some power and we hate that this painter should be at the hôtel de ville at the moment when the spring be awaken in forest and field and when he would do so much better to go into the wood of meudon or fontainebleau to study the wave of the branch and the eccentric twist and turn of the oak-tree 's huge trunk than in make answer to monsieur lefrançais -- iconoclast in theory only as yet -- and to monsieur jule vallès who have read homer in madame dacier 's translation or have never read it at all that one should try a little of everything even of polity when one be capable of nothing else be if not excusable at any rate comprehensible but when a man can make excellent boot like napoleon gaillard or good painting like gustave courbet that he should deliberately lay himself open to ridicule and perhaps to everlasting execration be what we can not admit to this monsieur courbet would reply : it be the artist that i represent it be the rights and claim of modern art that i uphold there must be a great revolution in painting as in politics we must federate too i tell you we 'll decapitate those aristocrat the titian and paul veronese we 'll establish instead of a jury a revolutionary tribunal which shall condemn to instant death any man who trouble himself about the ideal -- that king whom we have knock off he throne and at this tribunal i will be at once complainant lawyer and judge yes my brother painter rally around I and we will die for the commune of art as to those who be not of my opinion i do not care the snap of a finger about they by this last expression the friend of monsieur gustave courbet will perceive that we be not without some experience of he style of conversation courbet my master you do not know what you be talk about and all true artist will send you to old harry you and you federation do you know what a artistic association such as you understand it would

few thousand copy of we work without reduce himself to beggary we be happy when that be do we do not trouble ourselves much about we work the indulgence of a few friend and the indignation of a few fool be all we ask or hope for we federate why with whom if we work be bad will the association with any society in the world make it good will the work of other gain anything by they association with ours let we go home _ monsieur les artistes _ let we shut we door let we say to we servant -- if we have any -- that we be at home to no one and after have cut we best pencil or seize we best pen let we labor in solitude without relaxation with no other thought than that of do the best we can with no higher judge than that of we own artistic conscience and when the work be complete let we cordially shake hand with those of we comrade who love we let we help they and let they bring help to we but freely without obligation without subscription without society and without statute we have nothing to do with these free-masonry absurd when bring into the domain of intelligence and in which two or three hundred people get together to do that which some new-comer however unknown he bud

nothing to say and the interruption the clamor the apostrophise more highly color than courteous such a overwhelming tumult be never hear : -- no more jury yes yes a jury a jury out with the reactionist down with cabanel and the woman be the woman to be on the jury neither the woman nor the infirm and all the time there be monsieur gustave courbet the chairman desperately ring he bell for

September be condemn by the tribunal at versaille to six month ' imprisonment and a fine of 600 franc -- a slight penalty that astonish everyone -rrb- lii it be forbid to cross the place vendôme and naturally walk there be prohibit too i have be prowl about every afternoon for the last few day try to pass the sentinel of the rue de la paix hope that some lucky chance might enable I to evade the military order all i get for my pain be a sharply articulate _ pass au large _ and i remain shut out to-day as i be watch for a favourable opportunity a _ petite dame _ who hold up she skirt to show she stocking which be as red as the flag of the hôtel de ville -- out upon you for a female communist -- approach the sentinel and address he with she most gracious smile and oh these federal the man in office forget he duty and at once begin with the lady a conversation of such a intimate description that for discretion 's sake i feel myself oblige to take a slight turn to the left and a minute later i have slip into the forbid place a place -- no a camp it might more properly be call here and there be see a crowd of little tent which would be white if they be wash and litter about with straw under the tent lie national guard they be not see but plainly hear for they be snore you remember the absurd old bit of chop-logic often repeat in the class of philosophy one might apply it thus : he sleep well who have a good conscience the federal sleep well ergo the federal have a good conscience guard walk to and fro with they pipe in they mouth if i be to say that these honorable communist show by they easy manner gentlemanly bearing and superior conversation that they belong to the cream of parisian society you would perhaps be impertinent enough not to believe one word of what i say i think it therefore preferable in every way to assert the direct contrary there be a group of they fling away they pay at the usual game of _ bouchon _ the soldier 's pay and the game of cork be the title that might be give by those who would write the history of the national guard from the beginning of the siege to the present time and if to the cork they add the bottle they might pride themselves upon have find a perfect one this be how it come to pass the wife be hungry and the child be hungry but the father be thirsty and he receive the pay what do he do he be thirsty and he must drink one must think of oneself in this world when he have satisfy he thirst what remain a few sous the empty bottle and the cork very good he play he last sou on the famous game and in the evening when he return home he carry to he family -- what -- the empty bottle on the place two barricade have be make one across the rue de la paix and the other before the rue castiglione two formidable barricade say the newspaper which may be read thus : a heap of pave stone to the right and a heap of pave stone to the left i whisper to myself that two small field-piece one on the place of the new opera-house and the other at the rue de rivoli would not be long before they get the better of these two barricade in spite of the gun that here and there display they long bright cylinder the federal have decidedly a taste for gallantry about twenty woman -- i say young woman but not pretty woman -- be sell coffee to the national guard and add to they change a few ogle smile mean to be engage as to the column it have not the least appearance of be frighten by the decree of the commune which threaten it with a speedy fall there it stand like a huge bronze i and the emperor be the dot upon it the four eagle be still there at the four corner of the pedestal with they wreath of immortelle and the two red flag which wave from the top seem but little out of place the column be like the ancient honor of france that neither decree nor bayonet can intimidate and which in the midst of threat and tumult hold itself aloft in serene and noble dignity liii who would think it they be vote when i say they be vote i mean to say they might vote for as for go to the poll pari seem to trouble itself but little about it the commune too seem somewhat embarrassed you remember victor hugo 's song of the adventurer of the sea : en partant du golfe d'otrente nous étions trente mais en arrivant à cadix nous n'étions que dix -lrb- 59 -rrb- the gentleman of the hôtel de ville might sing this song with a few slight variation the gulf of otranto be not they start point but the butte montmartre though to make up for it they be eighty in number on arrive at c -- no i mean the decree of the colonne vendôme they be a few more than ten but not many what charming stanza in imitation of victor hugo might théodore de banville and albert glatigny write on the successive desertion of the member of the commune the first to withdraw be the _ maire _ of pari frighten to death at have be send by the vote of they fellow-citizen into a assembly which be not at all it appear they ideal of a municipal council and upon this subject monsieur desmarest monsieur tirard and they _ adjoint _ will perhaps permit I a unimportant question what right have they to persuade they elector and the friend of order to vote for the commune of paris if they be resolve to decline all responsibility when the vote have be give they they presence at the hôtel de ville would it not have infuse -- as we hope -- a powerful spirit of moderation even in the midst of excess that could even then be foretell when they have do all they can to persuade people to vote have they the right to consider themselves ineligible in a word why do they propose to we to elect the commune of paris if the commune be a bad thing and if it be a good thing why do they refuse to take they part in it whatever the cause no sooner be they elect than they send in they resignation then the hesitate and the timid disappear one after another not have the courage to continue the absurdity to the end add to all this the arrest make in its very bosom by the assembly of the hôtel de ville itself and you will then have a idea of the extent of the dilemma a few day more and the commune will come to a end for want of communist and then we shall cry haste to the poll citizen of pari and the white official handbill will announce supplementary election for Sunday 16th of April but here come the difficulty there may be election but not the shadow of a elector of candidate there be enough more than enough even to spare tote list where the elector ' name be inscribe ballot-urns-no ballot-box this time-to receive the list these be all to be find but voter to put the list into the ballot-box to elect the candidate we seek they in vain the voting locality may be compare to the desert of sahara view at the moment when not a caravan be to be see on the whole extent of the horizon so complete be the solitude wherever the eager crowd of voter be expect to hasten to the poll be we then so far from the day when the commune of pari in spite of the numerous absentee be form -- thanks to the strenuous effort of the few elector leave to we alas at that time we have still some illusion leave to we whilst now have you ever be at the second representation of a piece when the first be a failure the first day there be a cram the second day only the claque remain people have find oat the worth of the piece you see nevertheless though the place be people only with silence and solitude the claque continue to do its duty for it receive its pay for the same reason one see a few battalion march to the poll all together in step just as they would march to the fighting at the porte maillot and as they return they cry oh citizen how the people be vote never be such enthusiasm see but behind the scene -- i mean in the hôtel de ville -- author and actor whisper to each other : there be no doubt about it it be a failure footnote : -lrb- footnote 59 : on leave the gulf of otranto there be thirty of we there but on arrive at cadiz there be no more than ten -rrb- liv and what have become of the bourse what be the broker and jobber say and do now i ask myself this question for the first time as in ordinary circumstance the bourse be of all sublunary thing that which occupy I the least i be one of those excessively stupid people who have never yet be able to understand how all those black-coated individual can occupy three mortal hour of every day in come and go beneath the colonnade of the temple of plutus i know perfectly well that stockbroker and jobber exist but if i be ask what these stockbroker and jobber do i should be incapable of answer a single word we have all we special ignorance i have hear it be true of the _ corbeille _ -lrb- 60 -rrb- but i ingeniously imagine in my simple ignorance that this famous basket be make in wicker work and cram with sweet-scented leaf and flower which the gentleman of the bourse with the true gallantry of they nation make up into emblematical bouquet to offer to they lady friend i be show however how much i be deceive by a friend who enlighten I more or less as to what be really do in the bourse in usual time and what they be do there now i must begin by acknowledge that in use the worn metaphor of the temple of plutus just now i know little of what i be talk about the bourse be not a temple if it be it would necessarily be a church or something like one and consequently would have be close long ago by we most gracious sovereign the commune of paris the bourse then be open but what be the good of that you will say for all those who haunt it now could get in just as well through close door and oppose railing spectre and other supernatural being never find any difficulty in insinuate themselves through keyhole and slip between bar ` poor phantom thanks to the weakness of we government which have neglect to put seal on the portal of the bourse they be under the obligation of go in and come out like the most ordinary individual and a parisian who have not learn by a long intimacy with hoffmann and edgar poë to distinguish the living from the dead might take these ghost of the money-market for simple _ boursier _ thank heaven i be not a man to allow myself to be deceive by specious appearance on such a subject and i see at once with whom i have to do on the grand staircase there be four or five of they spectre lean as vampire who have not suck blood for three month they be walk in silence with the creep furtive step peculiar to apparition who glide among the yew-tree in church-yard from time to time one of they pull a ghost of a notebook from he ghost of a waistcoat-pocket and write appearance of note with the shadow of a pencil other gather together in group and one could distinctly hear the rattle of bone beneath they shadowy overcoat they speak in that peculiar voice which be only understand by the _ confrères _ of the magus elipha levy and they recall to each other 's mind the quotation of former day austrian fund triumphant government stock at 70 -lrb- _ quantum muta ab illâ _ -rrb- bond of the city of pari 1860-1869 and the fugitive apotheosis of the suez share they say with sigh : you remember the premium in former time there be report make in former time there be settle day at the end of the month and huge pocket-book 's be so well fill that they nearly burst but now we wander amidst the ruin of we defunct splendor as the shade of diomede wander amid the ruin of he house at pompeius we be of those who be the imaginary quotation of share that have disappear be like vain epitaph on tomb and we despair ghost we should die a second time of grief if we be not allow to appear to each other in this desert palace here to brood over we past financial glory thus speak the phantom of the money market and then add : oh commune commune give we back we settling day from time to time a phantom which still retain its haughty air and in which we recognize a defunct of distinction pass near they in the day of napoleon the third and the prussian this be a stockbroker it pass along with a mass of document under its arm -- as the father of hamlet rise from the grave still wear he helmet and he sword it enter the building go towards the _ corbeille _ shout out once or twice be answer only by a echo in the solitude and then return salute on he passage by he fellow-ghost and to think that a little bombardment follow by a successful attack seven or eight house set on fire by the versaille shell seven or eight hundred federal shoot a few woman blow to piece and a few child kill would suffice to restore these desolate spectre to life and joy but alas hope for they be defer the last circular of monsieur thier announce that the great military operation will not commence for several day they must wait still longer yet the people who cross the place de la bourse draw aside with a sort of religious terror from the necropolis where sleep the three per cent and the share of the _ crédit foncier _ and if the church be not close more than one charitable soul would perhaps burn a candle to lay the unquiet spirit of these despairing jobber footnote : -lrb- footnote 60 : a circular space in the great hall of the bourse enclose with a railing and in which the stockbroker stand to take bid it be nickname the basket -lrb- _ corbeille _ -rrb- -rrb- lv the game be play the commune be _ au complet _ in the first arrondissement 21260 elector be inscribe and there be 9 voter monsieur vésinier have 2 vote and monsieur vésinier be elect monsieur lacord -- more clever still -- have no vote at all and triumph by the unanimity of he elector monsieur lacord will preside over the commune of pari in future a very logical arrangement it must be evident to all serious mind that the legislator of the hôtel de ville have promulgate _ in petto _ a law which they do not think it necessary to make known but which exist nevertheless and most be couch somewhat in the follow term : -- clause 1st the election will not be consider valid if the number of voter exceed a thousandth part of the elector enter -- clause 2nd every candidate who have less than fifteen vote will be elect if he have sixteen he election will be a matter of discussion the poll be just like the game call he who lose gain and he who gain lose and the probable advantage of such a arrangement be see at once now let we do a bit of communal reasoning by whom be france lead within a inch of destruction by napoleon the third how many vote do napoleon the third obtain seven million and more by whom be paris deliver into the hand of the prussian by the dictator of the 4th September how many vote do the dictator of the 4th September get for themselves in the city of pari more than three hundred thousand _ ergo _ the candidate who obtain the greatest number of vote be swindler and fool the commune of pari can not allow such abuse to exist the commune maintain universal suffrage -- the grand basis of republican institution -- but turn it topsy-turvy michon have only have half a vote -- then michon be we master ah you do not only make we tremble and weep you make we laugh too what be this miserable parody of universal suffrage what be this farce of the will of the people be represent by a half a dozen elector the unknown individual who owe he triumph to the kindness of he concierge and he water-carrier become a member of the commune i shall be govern by vésinier with briosne and viard as supporter do you not see that the few man with any sense leave who still support you have refuse to present themselves as candidate and that even amongst those who be mad enough to declare themselves eligible there be some who dispute the validity of the election no you see nothing of all this or rather it suit you to be blind what be right and justice to you let we reign let we govern let we decree let we triumph all be contain in that rogeard please we so we 'll have rogeard if the people will not have rogeard so much the worse for the people beautiful admirable but why do not you speak out you opinion frankly there be some honest brigand -lrb- _ par parus refertur _ -rrb- in the roman state who be perhaps no better than you be but at least they make no pretension of be otherwise than lawless and follow they calling of brigand without hypocrisy when by the course of various adventure the band get diminish in number they stick no handbill on the wall to invite people to elect new brigand to fill up the vacant place they simply choose among the vagabond and such like individual those who seem to they the most capable of deal a blow with a stiletto or strip a traveller of he valuable and the band thus properly reinforce go about its usual

this almost general abstention of elector compare with the eagerness of former time be but the avowal of the error to which you masquerade have give rise and what do it prove but the resolution to mix in you carnival no more we see clearly through it now i tell you that the saturnalia be wear to its end in vain do the orchestra of cannon and mitrailleus under the direction of the conductor cluseret play madly on and invite we to the fête we will dance no more and there be a end of it but it will be fatal to pari if after say this she sit satisfied contempt be not enough there must be abhorrence

it be urgent that public opinion should not be divide that the national conscience should not be trouble that be right i entirely agree with you it be undoubtedly very urgent that public opinion should not be divide but let we see what mean you be go to take to obtain so desirable a result pari and the whole nation must know what be the nature the reason the object of the revolution which be now be accomplish doubtless but if that be indispensable to-day would it have be less useful on the very first day of the revolution we do not see why you have make we wait quite so long for it the responsibility of the mourn the suffering and the misfortune of which we be the victim should fall upon those who after have betray france and deliver pari to the foreigner pursue with blind obstinacy the destruction of the capital in order to bury under the ruin of the republic and of liberty the double evidence of they treason and they crime heigho what a phrase these clear and precise expression that throw so much light on the gloom of the situation be these yours félix pyat do the commune say _ pyat lux _ or be they yours pierre deni or yours vermorel i particularly admire the double evidence bury under the ruin of the republic happy metaphor the duty of the commune be to affirm and determine the aspiration and the view of the population of pari to fix precisely the character of the movement of the 18th of march misunderstand misinterpret and vilify by the man who sit at versaille ah yes that be the duty of the commune but for heaven 's sake do not keep we wait you see we be die with impatience once more paris labor and suffer for the whole of france and by she combat and she sacrifice prepare the way for intellectual moral administrative and economic regeneration glory and prosperity that be so true that since the commune exist in paris the workshop be close the factory be idle and france for whom the capital sacrifice herself lose something like fifty million a day these be fact it seem to I and i do not see what the traitor of versaille can say in reply what do paris demand ah yes what do she ask truly we should not be sorry to know or rather what do you ask for in the same way as loui le grand have the right to say the state i be the state you may say pari we be paris paris demand the recognition and the consolidation of the republic the only form of government compatible with the rights of the people and the regular and free development of society this once you be right pari demand the republic and must yearn for it eagerly indeed since neither you excess nor you folly have succeed in change its mind it demand the absolute entirety of the commune extend to all the locality of france ensure to everyone the integrity of its rights and to every frenchman the free exercise of he faculty and ability as man citizen and workman the rights of the commune should have no other limit but the equal rights of all other commune adhering to the contract a association which would assure the unity of france this be a little obscure what i understand be something like this you would make france a federation of commune but what be the meaning of word adherence to the contract you admit then that certain commune might refuse they adhesion in that case what would be the situation of these rebel would you leave they free or would you force they to obey the convention of the majority do you think it would be sufficient in the case of such a town as pezena for example refuse to adhere that the association would be incomplete that be to say that french unity would not exist be you very sure about pezena who tell you that pezena may not have its own idea of independence and that we may not hear presently that it have elect a duke who raise a army and coin money duke of pezena that sound well remember also that many other locality might follow the example of pezena and perhaps in order to insure the entirety of the commune it might have be wise to have ask they if they want it now what do you understand by locality marseille be a locality a isolate farm in the middle of a field be also a locality so france would be divide into a infinite number of commune would they agree amongst themselves these innumerable little state suppose they be agree to the contract it be not impossible that petty rivalry should lead to quarrel or even to blow a action about a party-wall might lead to a civil war how would you reduce the recalcitrant locality to reason for even suppose that the commune have the right to subjugate a commune the disaffected one could always escape you by declare that it no longer adhere to the social compact so that if this secession be produce not only by the vanity of one or more little hamlet but by the pride of one or more great town france would find herself all at once deprive of she most important city ah messieur this part of you program certainly leave something to be desire and i recommend you to improve it unless indeed you prefer to suppress it altogether the inherent rights of the commune be ` the vote of the commmunal budget the levying and the division of tax the direction of the local service the organization of the magistrature of the police and of education and of the administration of the property belong to the commune ' this paragraph be cunning it do not seem so at first sight but look at it closely and you will see that the most machiavellic spirit have preside over its production the ability consist in place side by side with the rights which incontestably belong to the commune other rights which do not belong to it the least in the world and in not appear to attach more importance to one than to the other so that the reader carry away by the evident legitimacy of many of you claim may say to himself really all that be very just let we unravel if you please this skein of red worst so ingeniously tangle the vote of the communal budget receipt and expense the levying and division of tax the administration of the communal property be rights which certainly belong to the commune if it have not get they it would not exist and why do they belong to it because it alone could know what be good for it in these matter and could come to such decision upon they as it think fit without injure the whole country but it be not the same as regard measure concern the magistracy the police and education well suppose one fine day a commune should say magistrate i do not want any magistrate these black-robed gentry be no use to I let other nourish these idler who send brave thief and honest assassin to the galley i love assassin and i honor thief and more i choose that the culprit should judge the magistrate of the republic now if a commune be to say that or something like that what could you answer in reply absolutely nothing for accord to you system each locality in france have the right to organise its magistracy as it please as regard the police and education it would be easy to make out similar hypothesis and thus to exhibit the absurdity of you communal pretension should a commune say no person shall be arrest in future and it be prohibit under pain of death to learn by heart the fable of the wolf and the fox what could you say to that nothing unless you admit that you be mistaken just now in suppose that the integrity of the commune ought to have no other limit but the right of equal independence of all the other commune there exist another limit and that be the general interest of the country which can not permit one part of it to injure the rest by bad example or in any other way the central power alone can judge those question where a single absurd measure -- of which more than one locality may probably be guilty -- might compromise the honor or the interest of france the magistracy the police and education be evidently question of that nature the other rights of the commune be always be it understand accord to the declaration make to the french people : the choice by election or competition with the responsibility and the permanent right of control over magistrate and communal functionary of every class the absolute guarantee of individual liberty of liberty of conscience and of liberty of labor the permanent participation of the citizen in communal affair by the free manifestation of they opinion and the free defense of they interest : guarantee to this effect to be give by the commune the only power charge with the surveillance and the protection of the full and just exercise of the rights of meeting and publicity the organization of the city defence and of the national guard which elect its own officer and alone ensure the maintenance of order in the city with regard to the affirmation of these rights we may repeat that which we have say above that some of they really belong to the commune but that the greater part of they do not paris desire nothing more in the way of local guarantee on condition let it be understand of finding in the great central administration in the great central administration appoint by the federated commune the realisation and the practice of the same principle that be to say in other word that pari will consent willingly to be of the same opinion as other if all the world be of the same opinion as itself but thanks to its independence and profit by its liberty of action pari reserve to itself the right of effect as it please the administrative and economic reform demand by the population to create proper institution for the development and propagation of instruction production commerce and credit to universalize power and property whew universalize property pray what do that mean may i ask communalism here present a singular likeness to communism accord to the necessity of the moment the desire of those interested and the lesson famish by experience : we enemy deceive themselves or the country when they accuse pari of wish to impose its will or its supremacy on the rest of the nation and to pretend to a dictatorship which would be a positive offence against the independence and the sovereignty of the other commune : they deceive themselves or they deceive the country when they accuse pari of desire the destruction of french unity constitute by the revolution amid the acclamation of we father hurry to the festival of the federation from all point of ancient france : political unity as impose upon we up to the present time by the empire the monarchy and parliamentarism be nothing more than despotic centralization whether intelligent arbitrary or onerous political unity such as pari demand be the voluntary association of all local initiative the spontaneous and free cooperation of individual energy with one single common object -- the well-being and the security of all the communal revolution inaugurate by the popular action of the 18th of march usher in a new era of experimental positive and scientific politics do you not think that during the last paragraph the tone of the declaration be somewhat modify it would seem as though felix pyat have become tired and hand the pen to pierre deni or to delescluze -- after communalism come socialism communal revolution be the end of the old governmental and clerical world of militarism of officialism -lrb- this new editor seem fond of word end in ism -rrb- of exploitation of commission of monopoly and of privilege to which the proletariat owe he thralldom and the country she misfortune and disaster of course there be nothing in the world that would please I better but if i be very certain that citizen rigault do not possess a improved glass enable he to observe I from a distance of several mile without leave he study or he armchair if i be very certain that citizen rigault could not read over my shoulder what i be write at this moment i might perhaps venture to insinuate that the revolution of the 18th of march appear to I to be at the present moment the apotheosis of most of the crime which it pretend to have suppress let then we grand and beloved country deceive by falsehood and calumny be reassure well in order that she may be reassure there be only one thing to be do -- be off with you the struggle go on between pari and versaille be one of those which can never be terminate by deceitful compromise there can be no doubt as to the issue -lrb- oh no there be no doubt about it -rrb- victory pursue with indomitable energy by the national guard will remain with principle and justice we ask it of france where be the necessity since you have the indomitable energy of the national guard convince that pari under arm possess as much calmness as bravery you will find that a very difficult thing to persuade france to believe that it maintain order with equal energy and enthusiasm order no doubt that which reign at warsaw the order that reign on the day after the 2nd of December that it sacrifice itself with as much judgment as heroism yes the judgment of a man who throw himself out of a fourth-floor window to prove that he head be harder than the paving-stone that it be only arm through devotion for the glory and liberty of all -- let france cause this bloody conflict to cease she 'll cause it to cease never fear but not in the way you understand it it be for france to disarm versaille up to the present time she have certainly do precisely the contrary by the manifestation of she irresistible will as she will be partaker in we conquest let she take part in we effort let she be we ally in this conflict which can only finish by the triumph of the communal idea or the ruin of paris the ruin of pari that be only i suppose a figurative expression for ourselves citizen of pari it be we mission to accomplish the modern revolution the grandest and most fruitful of all those that have illuminate history we duty be to struggle and to conquer the commune of pari such be this long emphatic but often obscure declaration it be not want however in a certain eloquence and although frequently disfigure by glare exaggeration it contain here and there some just idea or at least such as conform to the view of the great majority will it destroy the bad effect produce by the successive defeat of the federal at neuilly and at asnières will it produce any good feeling towards the commune in the mind of those who be daily drawing farther and farther from the man of the commune no it be too late have this proclamation be placard fifteen or twenty day sooner some part of it might have be approve and the rest discuss today we pass it by with a smile ah many thing have happen during the last three day the act of the commune of paris no longer allow we to take its declaration seriously and we look upon its member as too mad -- if not worse -- to believe that by any accident they can be reasonable these man have finish by render detestable whatever good there originally be in they idea footnote : -lrb- footnote 65 : he be bear in 1841 in the department of the rhône he education be complete very early at the age of twenty he be engage on two journal of the opposition _ la jeune france _ and _ la jeunesse _ those papers be soon suppress and they young contributor be imprison for three month in 1864 he become one of the staff of the _ presse _ whence he pass to the _ liberté _

have just condemn to death the commandant girod who refuse to march against the enemy the executive committee however have pardon commandant girod let we look at this matter a little if the executive committee occupy its time in undoing what the court-martial have do i can not quite understand why the executive have institute a court-martial at all if i be a member of the latter i should get angry what i should say they instal I in the hall where the courts-martial be hold they appoint guard to attend upon I and my president have the right to say ` guard remove the prisoner ' in a word they convert I into something which resemble a judge as much as a parody can resemble the work burlesque and when i a member of the court-martial desire to take advantage of the rights that have be confer upon I and order the commandant girod to be shoot they stand in the way of justice and save the life of he i have condemn this be absurd i have a liking for this commandant and i wish he to die by my hand never mind court-martial take it coolly you will have you revenge before long at this moment there be at least sixty-three ecclesiastic in the prison of maza the conciergerie and la santé although they be not precisely soldier they will be send before you to be judge and you may do just what you like with they without any fear of the executive commission interpose its veto the refractory also will give you work to do and against they you can exercise you pleasure as to the commandant girod he be a different case you understand he be the friend of citizen delescluze the member of the commune have not so many friend that they can afford to have any of they suppress but do not be downcast a dozen priest be well worth a major of the national guard lx it be precisely because the man that the commune send to the front fight and die so gloriously that we feel exasperate against its member a curse upon they for thus waste the moral riches of pari confusion to they for enlist into so bad a service the first-rate force which a successful revolt leave at they disposal i will tell you what happen yesterday the 22nd of April on the boulevard bineau and then i think you will agree with I that france who have lose so much still retain some of the bright dauntless courage which be she pride of old a trumpeter a mere lad of seventeen be march at the head of he detachment which have be order to take possession of a barricade that the versaille troops be suppose to have abandon when i say he march i be make a most incorrect statement for he turn somerset and execute fly leap on the road far in advance of he comrade until he progress be arrest by the barricade this he greet with a mock gesture and then with a bind or two be on the other side there have be some mistake the barricade have not be abandon we young trumpeter be immediately surround by a pretty large number of troops of the line who have lie hide among the sack of earth and pile of stone in the hope of surprising the company which be advance towards they several rifle be point at the poor boy and a sergeant say : if you move a foot if you utter a sound you die the lad 's reply be to leap to the highest part of the barricade and cry out with all the strength of he young voice do not come on they be here then he fall backwards pierce by four ball but he comrade be save lxi another and a sadder scene happen in the avenue des ternes a funeral procession be pass along the coffin bear by two man be very small the coffin of a young child the father a workman in a blouse walk behind with a

i tell you and then this battalion come to fetch they with the music and all now they be go to salute the republic come along i say double quick time so the butcher-boy and the woman with the child and myself and all the rest of the bystander turn and follow the eight or ten thousand member of parisian freemasonry who be crowd along the rue de rivoli in the front and rear of the procession i notice a large number of unarmed man dress in loose zouave trousers of dark-blue cloth with white gaiter white band and blue jacket they head be mostly bare i be tell these be the communist sharpshooter ever so far on in front of we a large white banner be float bear a inscription which i can not manage to read on account of the distance however the butcher-boy have make it out and inform we that love one another be write there happy delusive freemason tolerate one another be scarcely practicable in the meantime we continue to follow at the heel of the procession there be much shouting and noise here and there a feeble _ vive la commune _ but the principal cry be down with the murderer death to assassin down with versaille a freemason doff he hat and shout _ vive la paix _ it be peace we be go to seek i be still sadly confuse and can not make up my mind what all this be about patience however i shall know all at the hôtel de ville here we be the national guard keep the ground and the whole procession file into the cour d'honneur carry on by the crowd i find myself near the entrance and can see what be go on inside the whole of the commune be out on the balcony at the top of the grand staircase in front of the statue of the republic which like the communist wear a red scarf great trophy of red flag be wave everywhere man bear the banner of the society be

of the commune who be on the balcony come forward to speak i congratulate myself on be at last about to hear what all this mean but i be disappoint the push and squeeze be unbearable i have vigorously to defend my hat stick purse and cigar-case and be half stifle besides i almost despair of catch a single word but at last succeed in hear a few detach sentence : -- universal nationality liberty equality and fraternity manifesto of the heart -lrb- what be that -rrb- the standard of humanity rampart if i could only get a little nearer -- the word homicidal ball fratricidal bullet universal peace alone reach I be it to hear such stuff as this that the freemason have come to the hôtel de ville i suppose so for after a little more of the same kind the whole be drown in a stupendous roar of vive la commune and vive la république i have give up all hope of ever understand -lrb- illustration : félix pyat -lrb- 67 -rrb- -rrb- they have come to draw lot to see who be to go and kill m thier cry a red-haired gamin -- idiot retort he comrade they have no arm -- listen and you will hear say the first which be capital advice if i could but follow it the push become intolerable when suddenly the bald head of a unfortunate citizen execute a fatal plunge -- i can breathe at last -- and the follow word reach I pretty clearly : -- the commune have decide that we shall choose five member who be to have the honor of escort you and we be to draw lot -- there be i not right cry he of the carrotty hair i know they be go to draw lot a cleverly administer blow however soon silence he elation and we hear that the lot have be draw and that five member be choose to aid this glorious this victorious act there seem more rhyme than reason in this a act that will be read of in the future history of france and of humanity here the irrepressible break out again : -- now i be sure they be go to kill m thier whereupon he irritated adversary seize he by the collar give he head some well-applied blow against the curb-stone and then push through the crowd carry he off bodily as for I my curiosity unsatisfied i grow resign -- may the will of the commune be do -- and i give it up more hopeless mystification from the citizen beslay who regret not have be choose to aid in this heroic act he also allude to the drawing of lot and i begin after all to fancy poor m thier must be at the bottom of it all but he continue : -- citizen what can i say after the eloquent discourse of félix pyat you be about to interest yourselve in a act of fraternity -lrb- then something horrible be surely contemplate -rrb- in hoist you banner on the wall of we city and mix in we rank against we enemy of versaille a sudden light break upon I in the meantime citizen beslay be embrace the nearest freemason while another beg the honor of be the first to plant he banner the persévérance which be unfurl in 1790 on the rampart here a band play the marseillaise horribly out of tune a red flag be give to the freemason with a appropriate harangue then the citizen térifocq take back the flag with another harangue and end by wave it aloft and roar now citizen no more word to action this be clear the freemason be to hoist they banner on to the wall of paris side by side with the standard of the commune and who be blind enough to imagine that the shell and bullet indiscriminately homicidal fratricidal and infanticidal as they prove be imbue with tact sufficient to steer clear of the freemason ' banner and injure in they flight only those of the commune as the versaille projectile have only one end in view that of pierce both the parisian and they standard as a national consequence if both parisian and standard be pierce it be likewise most probable that the masonic banner will not remain unscathed in so dangerous a neighborhood and if so what will be the result accord to citizen térifocq the freemason of pari will call to they aid the direst vengeance the mason of all the province of france will follow they example everywhere the brother will fraternise with the troops which be march on to help pari on the other hand if the versaille gunner do not aim at the mason but only at the national guard -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- then the mason will join the battalion in the field and encourage by they example the gallant soldier defender of the city this be all rather complicate -- what can come of it escort by a ever-increasing crowd we reach the place de la bastille several discourse be spout forth at the foot of the column but the combined effect of noise dust and fatigue have blunt my sens and i hear nothing it seem however to be about the same thing over again for the same acclamation of the crowd greet the same gesture on the part of the orator we be off again down the boulevard the long procession with its wave banner and glittering sign be hail by the populace with delight have reach the place de la concorde i loiter behind group be station here and there i go

at conciliation with the government will this new effort be more successful than the precede one will the company of freemason obtain what the republican union fail in procure i would fain believe it but can not the obstinacy of the versaille assembly have become absolute deafness though we must admit that the freemason ' way of try to bring about reconciliation be rather singular somewhat like

astonish that a man as clever as you find that thing be take a bad turn should have think fit to give in you resignation when the house be burn one jump out of window but you cleverness have be so much pure loss for you amiable confederate be wait in the street to thrust you back into the midst of the flame again it be in vain that you have write the follow letter a chef-d'oeuvre in its way to the president of citizen president -- if i have not be detain at the ministry of war on the day when the election take place i should have vote with the minority of the commune i think that the majority for this once be in the wrong for this once be polite i doubt if she will ever retrieve she error if the commune be to retrace its step at each error it make it would advance slowly i think that the elect have not the right of replace the elector i think that the representative have not the right of take the place of the sovereign power i think that the commune can not create a single one of its own member neither make they nor unmake they and therefore that it can not of itself furnish that which be want to legalise they nomination ' oh monsieur félix pyat legality be strangely out of fashion and it be well for versaille that it be so i think also see that the war have change the population yes the war have change the population if not in the way you understand it at least in this sense that a great many reasonable people have go mad and that many -- ah how many -- be now dead i think that it be more just to change the law than to violate it the ballot give birth to the commune and in complete itself without it the commune commit suicide i will not be a accomplice in the fault we understand that it be quite enough to be a accomplice in the crime i be so convinced of this truth that if the commune persist in what i call a usurpation of the elective power i could not reconcile the respect due to the rote of the majority with the respect due to my own conscience i shall therefore be oblige much to my regret to give in my resignation to the commune before the victory _ salut et fraternité _ félix pyat before the victory be exquisitely comic but carry away by the desire of exhibit the wit of which he be master monsieur félix pyat fail to perceive that he irony be a little too transparent that before the victory evidently mean before the defeat and that

the following : -- the commune have assure to itself the receipt of a sum of 600000 franc a day -- eighteen million a month there be once upon a time a french forger name collé celebrate for the extent and importance of he swindling and who possess it be say a very large fortune when question upon the subject he use to answer : i have assure to myself a receipt of a hundred franc a day -- three thousand franc a month between collé and the commune there exist a difference however : in the first place collé affect a particular liking for the clergy whose various garb he use frequently to assume and the commune can not endure _ curés _ and secondly while collé in assure himself a receipt of three thousand franc a month have do all that be possible for he to do the commune put up with a miserable eighteen million when it might have ensure to itself a great deal more it be astounding and i may add little in accordance with its dignity that it should be satisfy with so moderate a allowance you show too much modesty it be not worth while be victorious for so little eighteen million -- a mere nothing you delicacy might be better understand be you more scrupulous as to the choice of you means thank heaven you do not err on that score come a little more energy if you please but sigh the commune i have do my best it seem to I thanks to jourde -lrb- 70 -rrb- who throw law into the shade and to dereure -lrb- 71 -rrb- the shoemaker -- financier and cobbler of la fontaine 's fable -- i pocket daily the gross value of the sale of tobacco which be a pretty speculation enough since i have have to pay neither the cost of the raw material nor of the manufacture i have besides this thanks to what i call the ` regular income from the public department ' a good number of little revenue which do not cost I much and bring I in a good deal now there be the post for instance i take good care to despatch none of the letter that be confide to I but i manage to secure the price of the postage by a arrangement with my employés this show cleverness and tact i think finally in addition to this i get the railway company to be kind enough to drop into my pocket the sum of two million of franc : the northern railway company will supply I with three hundred and ninety-three thousand franc the western with two hundred and seventy-five thousand the eastern three hundred and fifty-four thousand franc the lyon railway company with six hundred and ninety-two thousand franc the orlean railway three hundred and seventy-six thousand franc it be the financial delegate monsieur jourde who have the most brain of the whole band who plan this ingenious arrangement and in truth i consider that i have do all that be in my power and you be wrong in try to humiliate I by draw comparison between myself and collé who have some good in he but who be in no way equal to I my dear good commune i do not deny that you have the most excellent intention i approve the tobacco speculation and the fund draw from the public service money in which you include i suppose the profit make in you nocturnal visit to the public and other coffer and you fruitful round in the church as to the tax levy on railway it inspire I with a admiration approach enthusiasm but for mercy 's sake do not allow yourself to stop there nothing be achieve so long as anything remain to be do you waste you time in count up the present source of you revenue while so many opportunity remain of increase they be there no banker no stock-broker no notary in paris send a few of these honest patriot of yours to the house of the reactionary a hundred thousand franc from one two hundred thousand franc from another it be always worth the take from small stream come great river in you place i would not neglect the shopkeeper ' till either or the money-chest of the rich they be of the _ bourgeoisie _ those people and the _ bourgeois _ be you enemy tax they _ morbleu _ tax they by all means have you not all you friend and you friend ' friend to look after be it false key that fail you but they be easily make and amongst you number you will certainly find one or two locksmith quite ready to help you take pilotel for instance : a sane man that there be only eight hundred franc in the escritoire of monsieur chaudey and he appropriate the eight hundred franc thus you see how great house and good government be found and when there be no longer any money you must seize hold of the goods and furniture of you fellow-citizen you will find receiver of steal goods among you no doubt they tell I yesterday that you have send the titien and paul veronese of the louvre to london in order to be able to make money out of they a most excellent measure that i can well explain to myself because i can understand that monsieur courbet must have a great desire to get rid of these two painter for whom he feel so legitimate and profound a hatred but alas it be but a false report you confine yourselve to put up for sale the material compose the column of the place vendôme divide they into four lot two lot of stone and cement and two lot of metal two lot only why you know nothing about make the best

the land a barren waste : to put a strait jacket upon society : and if it be possible that such a state of thing could be prolong for several week -- to cause three or four million of human being to perish by horrible famine when the government shall be without resource when the country shall be without produce and without commerce : when starve pari blockade by the department will no longer discharge its debt and make payment no longer export nor import : when workman demoralise by the politics teach at the club and the closing of the workshop will have find a means of live no matter how : when the state appropriate to itself the silver and ornament of the citizen for the purpose of send they to the mint : when perquisition make in the private house be the only means of collect tax : when hungry band spread over the country commit robbery and devastation : when the peasant arm with loaded gun have to neglect the cultivation of he crop in order to protect they : when the first sheaf shall have be steal the first house force the first church profane the first torch fire the first woman violate : when the first blood shall have be spill : when the first head shall have fall : when abomination and desolation shall have spread over all france -- oh then you will know what we mean by a social revolution : a multitude let loose arm in hand mad with revenge and fury : soldier pike empty home knife and crowbar : the city silent and oppress the police in we very home opinion suspect word note down tear observe sigh count silence watch spy and denunciation : inexorable requisition force and progressive loan paper money make worthless : civil war and the enemy on the frontier : pitiless proconsul a supreme committee with heart of stone -- this would be the fruit of

heaven if the wind could only carry they away up to the moon or even a great deal further still lxviii i be surprised myself as i re-read the precede page at the strange contradiction i meet with during the first few day i be almost favourable to the commune i wait i hope to-day all be very different when i write down in the evening what i have see and think in the day i allow myself to blame with severity man that inspire I formerly with some kind of sympathy what have take place have my opinion change i do not think so besides i have in reality but one opinion i receive impression describe these impression without reserve without prejudice if these stray leaf should ever be collect in a volume they will at least possess the rare merit of be thoroughly sincere be it then that my nature be modify by no means if i be indulgent a month ago it be that i do not know those of whom i speak and that i be of a naturally hopeful and benevolent disposition : if i now show myself severe it be that -- like the rest of paris -- i have learn to know they better lxix the commune have naturally bring a infinite number of journal into existence try if you will to count the leaf of the forest the grain of sand on the seashore the star in the heaven but do not in you wildest dream attempt to enumerate the newspaper that have see the light since the famous day of the 18th of march félix pyat have a journal _ le vengeur _ vermorel have a journal _ le crus du people _ delescluze have a journal _ le reveil _ there be not a member of the commune but indulge in the luxury of a sheet in which he tell he colleague daily all the evil he think of they it must be acknowledge that these gentleman have a extremely bad opinion one of the other i defy even the _ gauloi _ of versaille -- yes the _ gauloi _ itself -- to treat félix pyat as vermorel treat he and if it be remember on the other hand what félix pyat say of vermorel the _ gauloi _ will be find singularly good-natured napoleon caution we long ago to wash we dirty linen at home but good patriot can not be expect to profit by the counsel of a tyrant so the column of the commune papers be devote to the daily and mutual pull to piece of the commune 's member but where will these ephemeral sheet be in six month in one month or in a week 's time perhaps the wind which waft away the leaf of the rose and the laurel will be no less cruel for the political leave let we then for the sake of posterity offer a specimen of what be -- or as we shall soon say what be -- the communalist press of to-day be they edit by marotteau or duchesne or paschal grousset or by any other emulator of paul-louis courier these worthy journal be all much alike and one example will suffice for the whole -lrb- illustration : vermesch -lrb- père duchesne -rrb- -lrb- 72 -rrb- -rrb- first of all and generally in enormous type stand the latest news the news from the porte maillot where the friend of the commune be fight and the news from versaille where the enemy of the country be sit they usually run somewhat in this style : -- it be more and more confirm that the assembly of versaille be surround and make prisoner by the troops return from germany the general of the empire have newly proclaimed napoleon : the third emperor after a violent quarrel about two national guard whom marshal macmahon have have shoot but have omit to have cook for he soldier monsieur thier send a challenge to the marshal by he two seconds these seconds be no other than the comte de chambord and the comte de paris marshal macmahon choose the ex-emperor and paul de cassagnac the duel take place in the rue des reservoir in the midst of a immense crowd the marshal be kill and be therefore oblige to renounce the command of the troops but the assembly would not accept he resignation we be in the position to assert that a company of the 132nd battalion have this morning surround fifteen thousand gendarme and sergents-de-ville in the park of neuilly see that all resistance be useless the supporter of monsieur thier surrender without reserve among they be seventeen member of the national assembly who not content with order the assassination of we brother have wish also to be present at the massacre -lrb- illustration : paschal grousset delegate for foreign affair -rrb- -lrb- 73 -rrb- a person worthy of credit have relate to we the follow fact : -- a _ cantinière _ of the 44th battalion -lrb- from the batignolle quarter -rrb- be in the act of pour out a glass of brandy for a artilleryman of the fort of vanve when suddenly the artilleryman be out in two by a versaille shell the brave _ cantinière _ drink off the contents of the glass just pour out for the dead man who lay in bit at she foot and take he place at the gun she perform she new part of artilleryman so bravely that ten minute later there be not a single gun uninjured in the meudon battery as to those who be serve the piece there they be all hurl to a distance of several mile and amongst they be say to have be recognize -- we give this news however with great reserve -- monsieur ollivier the ex-minister of the ex-emperor and count von bismarck who wish to verify for himself the actual range of the gun that he have lend to he good friend of versaille after the latest news come the report of the day the _ bulletin du jour _ as it be call now and it be in this that the editor a member of the commune reveal he talent we trust that the follow example be not quite unworthy of the pen of monsieur félix pyat or the signature of monsieur vermorel : -- pari 29th April 1871 they be lie in wait for we these tiger athirst for blood they be there these vandal who have swear that in all paris not a single man shall be spare nor a single stone leave standing but we be not in they power yet no nor shall we ever be the national guard be on the watch victorious and sublime they soldierly breast be not of flesh and blood but of bronze from which the ball rebind as they stand dauntless before the enemy ah so these lachrymose jule favre these fat picard these hungry jule ferry say amongst themselves ` we will take pari we will tear it up and its soil shall be divide after the victory between the wife of the _ sergent de ville _ ' they be begin to understand all the insanity of they plan why it be paris that will take versaille that will take all those blear-eyed old man who because they can not look steadily at monsieur thier ' face fancy that it be the sun it be in vain that they gorge with blood and wine they deceive soldier the moment be approach when these man will no longer consent to march against the city which be fight for they already yesterday the mêlée of a battle could be distinguish from the fort of vanve the line have come to blow with the _ gendarme _ of valentin and charette 's zouave courage parisian a few more day and you will have triumph over all the infamy that dare to stop the march of the victorious commune but it be not enough to vanquish the enemy without we must get rid also of the enemy that be within no more pity no more vacillation the justice of the people be wearied of formality and cry out for vengeance death to spy death to the _ réactionaires _ death to the priest why do the commune feed this collection of malefactor in you prison while the money they cost we daily would be so useful to the woman and child of those who be fight for the cause of pari we be assure that one of the prisoner eat half a chicken for he dinner yesterday how many good patriot might have be save from suffer with the sum which be take from the chest of the republic for this orgie there be no longer time to hesitate the versaillai be shooting and mutilate the prisoner we must revenge ourselves we must show they such a example that in perceive from afar the head of they infamous accomplice the traitor of versaille stick upon we rampart confound by the magnanimity of the commune they will lay down they arm at last and deliver themselves up as prisoner as to the refractory of pari we can not find word to express the astonishment we experience at the weakness that have be show with regard to they what we permit that there should still be coward in paris i think they be all at versaille we allow still to remain amongst we man who be not of we opinion this state of thing have last too long let they take they musket or die shoot they down those who refuse to go forward they have wife and child they be father of family they say a fine reason indeed the commune before everything and besides there must be no pity for the wife of _ réactionaires _ and the child of spy the _ bulletin du jour _ be sometimes set forth in gentler term but we have choose a fair average specimen between the lukewarm and the most violent then come the solid serious article generally write by a pen invest with all due authority by the man who have the most head in the place the subject vary accord to circumstance but the main point of the article be generally to show that paris have never be so rich so free nor so happy as under the government of the commune and this be a truth that be certainly not difficult to prove be not the fact of be able to live without work the best possible proof that people be well off well look at the national guard they have not touch a tool for a whole month and they have such a supply of money that they be oblige to make over some of it to the wineshop-keeper in exchange for a unlimited number of litre and seal bottle then who could say that we be not free the journal that allow themselves to assert the contrary have be prudently suppress besides be it not be free to have shake off the shameful yoke of the man who sell france to be no longer subject to the oppression of snob _ réactionaires _ and traitor and as to the most perfect happiness it stand to reason since we be both free and rich that we must be in the incontestable enjoyment of it finally after the official dispatch edit in the style you be acquaint with and after the account of the last battle come the miscellaneous news the _ fait diver _ and here it be that the ingenuity of the writer display itself to the greatest advantage yesterday evening towards ten o'clock the attention of the passer-by in the rue st denis be attract by cry which seem to proceed from a four-storied house situate at the corner of the rue sainte-apolline the cry be evidently cry of despair some people go to the nearest guardhouse to make the fact know and four national guard precede by they corporal enter the house guide by the sound of the cry they arrive at the fourth storey and break open the door a horrible spectacle be then expose to the view of the guard and of the person who have follow they in they quest three young child lay stretch on the floor of the room the disorder of which denote a recent struggle the poor little thing be without any cover whatever and there be trace of blow upon they body one of they have a cut across the forehead the national guard question the child with a almost maternal kindness they have not eat for four day and in consequence of this prolonged fast they be in such a state of moral and physical abasement that no precise information could be obtain from they the corporal then address himself to the neighbor and soon become acquaint with a part of the terrible truth in this room live a poor work-girl young and pretty one day as she be carry back she work to the shop she observe that she be follow by a well-dressed man whose physiognomy indicate the lowest passion he speak to she and be at first repulse but like the tempter faust offering jewel to marguerite he tempt she with bright promise and the poor girl to whom work do not always come listen to the base seducer blame she not too harshly pity she rather and reserve all you indignation for the wretch who betray she after three year which be but anguish and remorse to the miserable woman and during which she have no other consolation but the smile of the child whose very existence be a crime she be become reconcile at last to she life when the father of she child desert she this desertion coincide with the glorious revolution of the 18th of march and the poor work-girl who have still room in she heart for patriotism find some consolation in reflect that the day so miserable for she have at least bring happiness to france a fortnight pass the poor abandon mother have give up all hope of ever see the father of she three child again when one evening -- it be last Friday -- a man wrap in a black cloak introduce himself into the house and make inquiry of the _ concierge _ -- a great patriot and commander of the 114th battalion -- whether mademoiselle o be at home upon a answer in the affirmative from the heroic defender of right and liberty of paris the man mount the stair to the poor workwoman 's room it be he -- the seducer the _ concierge _ have recognize he what pass between the murderer and he victim that will be know perhaps -- never but certain it be that a hour afterwards he go out still envelop in he black mantle the next day and the day follow the _ concierge _ be much astonished not to see he lodger of the fourth floor who be accustom to stop and talk with he on she way to fetch she _ café au lait _ but he deep sense of duty as commander of the 114th battalion occupy he mind so thoroughly that he pay but little attention to the incident neither do he regard the sigh and sob which be hear from the upper story he can scarcely be blame for this negligence he be study he _ vade-mecum _ on the fourth day however the cry be so violent that they begin to inspire the passer-by with alarm and we have relate how four man head by they _ caporal _ be seek for to inquire into the cause we have already tell what be see and hear but the explanation of the neighbor be not sufficient to clear up the darkest side of the mystery and perhaps the truth would never have be know if the _ caporal _ -- exhibit by a rare proof of intelligence how far he be worthy of the grade with which he comrade have honor he -- have not be inspire with the idea of lift up the curtain of the bed horror upon the bed lay stretch the corpse of the unhappy mother a dagger plunge into she heart and in she clutched hand be find a paper upon which the victim before render she last breath have trace the follow line : -- ' i die murder by he who have betray I he would have murder also my three child if a noise in

we shall see no more of cluseret cluseret be do for cluseret be in prison -lrb- 75 -rrb- what have he do be he in disgrace on account of fort issy this would scarcely be just consider that if the fort be evacuate yesterday it be reoccupy this morning by the bye i can not explain satisfactorily to myself why the versaillai should have abandon this position which they seem to have consider of some importance if it be not on account of fort issy that cluseret be politely ask to go and keep monseigneur darboy company why be it i remember hearing yesterday and the day before something about a letter of general fabrice in which that amiable prussian it be report begged general cluseret to intercede with the commune in behalf of the imprison priest be it possible that the communal delegate at the risk of pass for a jesuit could have make the require demand why m cluseret that be quite enough for you to be put in prison and shot too into the bargain however you do not intercede for anybody for the very excellent reason that general fabrice no more thought of write to you than of give back alsace and lorraine so we must search somewhere else for the motive of this sudden eclipse some say there be a quarrel with dombrowskus that the latter thought fit to sign a truce without the authority of cluseret -- a truce what a idea have dombrowski any scruple about slaughter -- that cluseret fly into a great rage but that he rival get the best of it in the end you see if one be a american and the other a pole the commune must have a hard time of it between the two no neither the evacuation of fort issy -- in spite of what the _ journal officiel _ say -- monseigneur darboy nor the quarrel with dombrowskus be the real cause of the fall of cluseret cluseret 's destiny be to fall cluseret have fall because he do not like gold lace and embroidery -- that be the question all the rest be pretext so the noble delegate imagine he could quietly issue a proclamation one morning command all the officer under he order to rip off the gold and silver band which luxuriantly ornament they sleeve and cap -lrb- 76 -rrb- he think he staff would forego epaulet and other military gewgaw why the man must have be mad what would cora or armentine have say if they have see they military hero stalk into the café de suède or the café de madrid shear of all they brilliant appendage which make they look so wonderfully like the monkey-general at the neuilly fair in the good old time when there be such thing as fair and before neuilly be a ruin ask any soldier federal or otherwise if he will give up he pay or he jingle sword or even he rank he may perhaps consent but ask he to rip off he embroidery and he will answer never how can you imagine a man of sense consent not to look like a mountebank another of these absurd prescription have do much to lower cluseret in public estimation one day he take it into he head to prevent he officer from gallop in the street and boulevard under the miserable pretext that the rapid evolution of these horseman have occasion several accident well and if they have do you think a gallant captain of horse be go to deprive himself of the pleasure of curvetting within sight of he lady love for the pitiful reason that he may perchance upset a old woman or two or three child citizen cluseret do not know what he be talk about it be certain that if this valiant general have such a very great horror of accident he should begin by stop the firing at courbevoie which be a great deal more dangerous than the gallop of a horse on the boulevard montmartre as you may imagine the officer go on gallop and wear they finery under the very nose of the general while he walk about stoically in plain clothes however although they do not obey he they owe he a grudge for the order he have give opposition be be hatch and be ready to burst forth on the first opportunity which happen to be the evacuation of fort issy -lrb- 76 -rrb-

the responsibility of a command wherein every one deliberate and no one obey when it be necessary to organise the artillery the central committee of artillery deliberate but nothing be do after a month 's revolution that service be only carry on thanks to the energy of a very small number of volunteer on my nomination to the ministry i want to further the search for arm the requisition of horse and the pursuit of refractory citizen i ask help of the commune the commune deliberate but pass no resolution later the central committee come and offer its service to the war department i accept they in the most decisive manner and deliver up to its member all the document i have concern its organization since then the central committee have be deliberate and have do nothing during this time the enemy multiply its venturesome attack on fort issy have i have the smallest military force at my command i would have punish they for it the garrison badly command take flight the officer deliberate and send away from the fort captain dumont a energetic man who have be order to command they still deliberate they evacuate the fort after have stupidly talk of blow it up -- as difficult a thing for they to do as to defend it -lrb- illustration : delescluze delegate of war -lrb- 82 -rrb- -rrb- even that be not enough yesterday when every one ought to have be at work or fight the chief be deliberate upon another system of organization from that which i have adopt so as to make up for they want of forethought and authority the result of they council be a project when we want man and a declaration of principle when we want act my indignation bring they back to other thought and they promise I for to-day the largest force they could possibly muster -- a organise one of not more than 12000 man with these i undertake to march on the enemy these man be to muster at eleven o'clock : it be now one and they be not ready and the promise 12000 have dwindle to about 7000 which be not at all the same thing thus the utter uselessness of the artillery committee prevent the organization of the artillery the hesitation of the central committee stop all arrangement the petty discussion of the officer paralyse the concentration of the troops i be not a man to mind have recourse to violence yesterday while the chief discuss a company of man with loaded rifle await in the court but i do not want to take upon myself the initiative of so energetic a measure or draw upon myself the odium of such execution as would have be necessary to extricate obedience and victory from such a chaos even if i have be protect by the publicity of my act i need not have give up my position but the commune have not have the courage to confront publicity twice i wish to give some necessary explanation and twice in spite of I it insist on a secret council my predecessor be wrong to remain in so absurd a position enlighten by he example and know that the strength of a revolutionary only consist in the clearness of he position i have only two alternative either to break the chain which impede my action or to retire i will not break the chain because those chain be you and you weakness -- i will not touch the sovereignty of the people i retire and have the honor to beg for a cell at maza rossel -lrb- 83 -rrb- most certainly i do not like the pari commune such as the man of the hôtel de ville understand it deceive at first by my own delusive hope i now be sure that we have nothing to expect from it but folly upon folly crime upon crime i hate it on account of the suppress newspaper of the imprison journalist of the priest shut up at maza like assassin of the nun shut up at saint-lazare like courtesan i hate it because it incite to the crime of civil war those who would have be ready to fight against the prussian but who do not wish to fight against frenchman i hate it on account of the father of family send to battle and to death on account of we ruin rampart we dismantle fort each stone of which as it fall wound or destroy on account of the widow woman and the orphan child all of whom they can never pension in spite of they decree i can not pardon they the rob of the bank nor the money extort from the railway company nor the loan-share sell to a money-changer at liège i hate it on account of clémence the spy and allix the madman i be sorry to think that two or three intelligent man should be mix up with it and have to share in its fall i hate it particularly on account of the just principle it at one time represent and of the admirable and fruitful idea of municipal independence which it be not able to carry out honestly and which because of the excess that have be commit in they name will have lose for ever perhaps all chance of triumph still great as be my horror of this parody of a government to which we have have to submit for nearly two month i could not forbear a feeling of repulsion on read the letter of citizen rossel it be a capitally write letter firm concise conclusive differ entirely from the bombastic unintelligible document to which the commune have accustom we and besides it bring to light several detail at which i rejoice because it permit I to hope that the reign of we tyrant be nearly at a end i be glad to hear that the commune if it possess artillery be short of artilleryman it delight I to learn that they can only dispose of seven thousand combatant i have fear that it would be enable to kill a great many more and as to what citizen rossel say of the committee and officer who deliberate but do not act it be most pleasant news for it convince I that the commune have not the power to continue much longer a war which can but result in the death of pari and yet i highly disapprove of the letter of citizen rossel because it be on he part a act of treachery and it be not for the friend and servant of the commune to reveal its fault and to show up its weakness who oblige rossel commander of the staff to take the place of he general disgraced and imprison do he not accept willingly a position the difficulty of which he have already recognize he say himself that he predecessor be wrong to have stay in so absurd a position and why do he voluntarily put himself there where he blame another for remain if the new delegate hope by he own cleverness to modify the position he ought not the position remain the same accuse anything but he own incapacity in a word the conclusion at which we arrive be that he only accept power to be able to throw it off with effect like cato who only go to the public theater for the purpose of fussily leave the place at the moment when the audience call the actor before the curtain not be able or perhaps willing to save the commune m rossel desire to save himself at its expense there be something ungentlemanly in this do not however imagine for a moment that i believe in m rossel have be buy by m thier all those ridiculous story of sum of money have be offer to the member of the commune be merely absurd invention -lrb- 84 -rrb- what do you think they say of cluseret that he be in the habit of take he breakfast at the café d'orsay and afterwards play a game of domino one day he adversary be report to have say to he if you will deliver the fort of montrouge to the versaillai i will give you two million what fool people must be to believe such absurdity rossel have not sell himself for the very good reason that nobody ever think of buy he it be he own idea to do what he do for the pleasure of be insolent and show he boldness he have pull down from its pedestal what he adore consequently the most criminal among the member of the commune once a swindler now a pilferer be free to say to m

about one must live passenger walk backwards and forwards talk in a loud voice but the crowd condense itself between the rue richelieu and the rue du faubourg montmartre solitude have something terrible about it just now people congregate together for the pleasure of elbow each other of try to believe they be in great force quite a crowd collect round a little barefooted girl who be singing
