courteously part one the sea riddle i desert sea the late afternoon sky flaunt its splendor of blue and gold like a banner over the pacific across whose depths the trade wind drone in measure cadence on the ocean 's wide expanse a hulk wallow sluggishly the forget relict of a once brave and sightly ship possibly the sphinx of some untold ocean tragedy she lay black and forbid in the order procession of wave half a mile to the east of the derelict hover a ship 's cutter the turn of she crew 's head speak expectancy as far again beyond the united state cruiser _ wolverine _ outline she severe and trim silhouette against the horizon in all the spread of wave and sky no other thing be visible for this be one of the desert part of the pacific three hundred mile north of the steamship route from yokohama to honolulu five hundred mile from the nearest land gardner island and more than seven hundred northwest of the hawaiian group on the cruiser 's quarter-deck the officer line the starboard rail they interest be focus on the derelict look like a heavy job say ive one of the junior lieutenant these floater that lie with deck almost awash will stand more hammer than a mud fort wish they would let we put some six-inch shell into she say billy edward the ensign a wistful expression on he big round cheerful face i would like to see what they would do nothing but waste a few hundred dollar of you uncle sam 's money observe carter the officer of the deck it take place charge inside and out for that kind of work barnett 's the man for she then say ive he be no economist when it come to get result there she go without any particular haste as it seem to the watcher the hulk be shoulder out of the water as by some hidden leviathan its outline melt into a black outshowering mist and from that mist leap a giant up up he tower toss whirling arm a hundred foot abranch shiver and dissolve into a widespread cataract the water below be lash into fury in the midst of which a mighty death agony beat back the troubled wave of the trade wind only then do the muffle double boom of the explosion reach the ear of the spectator presently to be follow by a whisper swift-skimming wavelet that sweep irresistibly across the bigger surge and lap the ship 's side as for a message that the work be do here and there in the sea a glint of silver a patch of purple or dull red or a glistening apparition of black show where the unintended victim of the explosion the gay-hued open-sea fish of the warm water have succumb to the force of the shock of the intended victim there be no sign save a few fragment of wood bobbing in a swirl of water when barnett the ordnance officer in charge of the destruction return to the ship carter compliment he good clean job barnett she be a tough customer too what be she ask ive the _ caroline lemp _ three-masted schooner anyone know about she ive turn to the ship 's surgeon trendon a grizzled and brief-spoken veteran who have at he finger 's tip all the lore of all the water under the reign of the moon what do the information bureau of the seven sea know about it lose three year ago -- spring of 1901 -- get into ice field off the tip of the aleutian some of the crew freeze other get ashore part of survivor account for other not say they have turn native do not know myself the aleutian exclaim billy edwards great cat what a drift how many thousand mile would that be not as far as many another derelict have wander in she time son say barnett the talk wash back and forth across the hulk of classic sea mystery new and old of the _ city of boston _ which go down with all hand leave for record only a melancholy scrawl on a bit of board to meet the wonder eye of a fisherman on the far cornish coast of the _ great queensland _ which set out with five hundred and sixty-nine soul aboard bind by a route unknown to a tragic end of the _ naronic _ with she silent and empty lifeboat alone leave drift about the open sea to hint at the story of she fate of the _ huronian _ which ten year later on the same day and date and hail from the same port as the _ naronic _ go out into the void leave no trace of newfoundland captain who sail roar with drink under the arch of cathedral berg only to be prison bury and embalm in the one icy embrace of craft assail by the terrible one-stroke lightning cloud of the indian ocean find day after stone blind with they crew madly haul at useless sheet while the officer claw the compass and shriek of burning and piracy of pest ship and slave ship and ship mad for want of water of whelm earthquake wave and mysterious suction draw irresistibly against wind and steam power upon unknown current of stout hulk desert in panic although sound and seaworthy and of other so swiftly drag down that there be no time for any to save himself and of a hundred other strange stir and pitiful venture such as make up the inevitable peril and incorrigible romance of the ocean in a pause billy edward say musingly : well there be the _ laugh lass _ how do you happen to hit on she asked barnett quickly why not sir it naturally come into my head she be last see somewhere about this part of the world be not she after a moment 's hesitation he add : from something i hear ashore i judge we have a commission to keep a watch out for she as well as to destroy derelict what about the _ laugh lass _ ask mcguire the paymaster a new englander who have be in the service but a short time good lord do not you remember the _ laugh lass _ mystery and the disappearance of doctor schermerhorn karl augustus schermerhorn the man whose experiment to identify telepathy with the marconus wireless wave make such a furore in the papers oh that be only a by-product of he mind he be a original investigator in every line of physics and chemistry besides most of the natural science say barnett the government be particularly interested in he because of he contribution to aërial photography and he be lose with the _ laugh lass _ nobody know say edward he leave san francisco two year ago on a hundred-foot schooner with a assistant a big brass-bound chest and a ragamuffin crew a newspaper man name slade who drop out of the world about the same time be suppose to have go along too they schooner be last sight about 450 mile northeast of oahu in good shape and bind westward that be all the record of she that there be be that ralph slade ask barnett yes he be a free-lance writer and artist i know he well say barnett he be in we mess in the philippine campaign on the _ north dakota _ war correspondent then it be strange that i never identify he before with the slade of the _ laugh lass _ what be the object of the voyage ask ive they be suppose to be after bury treasure say barnett i have always think it more likely that doctor schermerhorn be on a scientific expedition say edward i know the old boy and he be not the sort to care a hoot in sheol for treasure bury or unburied every time a ship set out from san francisco without publish to all the world just what she business be all the world think it be one of those wild-goose hunt observe ive yes agree barnett flora and fauna of some unknown island would be much more in the schermerhorn line of traffic not unlikely that some of the festive native collect the unfortunate professor various theory be advance withdraw refute defend and the discussion carry they through the swift twilight into the darkness which have be hasten by a high-spreading canopy of storm-cloud abruptly from the crow 's - nest come startling news for those desolate sea : light -- ho two point on the port bow the lookout have give extra voice to it it be plainly hear throughout the ship the group of officer stare in the direction indicate but could see nothing presently ive and edward who be the keenest-sighted make out a faint suffused radiance at the same time come a second hail from the crow 's - nest on deck sir hello respond carter the officer of the deck there be a light here i can not make anything out of sir what be it like sort of a queer general glow general glow indeed mutter forsythe among the group aft that fellow 's get a imagination can not you describe it better than that call carter do not make it out at all sir ` tai not any regular and proper light look like a lamp in a fog among themselves the officer discuss it interestedly as it grow plainer not unlike the electric glow above a city see from a distance say barnett as it grow plainer yes : but the nearest electric-lighted city be some eight hundred mile away object ive mirage maybe suggest edward pretty hard-working mirage to cover that distance say ive though i have see 'em -- great heaven look at that shout edward a great shaft of pale brilliance shoot up toward the zenith under it whirl a maelstrom of varied radiance pale with distance but marvellously beautiful forsythe pass they with a troubled face on he way below to report as he relief go up the quartermaster report the compass behave queerly he say three minute later the captain be on the bridge the great ship have swing and they be speed direct for the phenomenon but within a few minute the light have die out another sea mystery to add to we list say billy edward do anyone ever see a show like that before what do you think doc humph grunt the veteran new to I volcanic maybe ii the _ laugh lass _ the fall of dusk on June the 3d find tired eye aboard the _ wolverine _ every officer in she complement have keep a private and personal lookout all day for some explanation of the previous night 's phenomenon all that reward they be a sky film with lofty cloud and the holiday parade of the epauletted wave nor do evening bring a repetition of that strange glow midnight find the late stayer still deep in the discussion one thing be certain say ive it be not volcanic why so ask the paymaster because volcano be mostly stationary and we head due for that light yes but do we keep head say barnett who be navigate officer as well as ordnance officer in a queer voice what do you mean sir ask edward eagerly after the light disappear the compass keep on vary the star be hide there be no tell just where we be head for some time then we might be fifty mile from the spot we aim at hardly that say the navigator we could guide she to some extent by the direction of wind and wave if it be volcanic we ought certainly to have sight it by now always some electricity in volcanic eruption say trendon make compass cut dido see it before where query carter off martinique pelée eruption needle chase its tail like a kitten be there many volcano hereabouts somebody ask we be in 162 west 31 north about say barnett no tell whether there be or not there be not at last account but that be no evidence that there be not some since they come up in the night these volcanic island just cast a eye on the chart say billy edwards full of e d 's and p d 's all over the shop every one of 'em volcanic e d 's and p d 's query the paymaster existence doubtful and position doubtful explain the ensign every time the skipper of one of these wander trade ship get a speck in he eye he report a island if he really do bump into a rock he cut in a arithmetic book for he latitude and longitude and let it go at that that be how the chart maker make a living get out new edition every few month but it be a fact that these sea be constantly change say barnett they be so little travel that no one happen to be around to see a island bear i do not suppose there be a part on the earth 's surface more liable to seismic disturbance than this region seismic cry billy edwards i should say it be seismic why when a native of one of these island group set he heart on a particular loaf of bread up he bread-fruit tree he do not bother to climb after it just wait for some earthquake to happen along and shake it down to he good boy billy say dr trendon approvingly do another it be a fact say the ensign heatedly why a couple of year back there be a trader here stock up with a lot of belly-mixture in bottle think he be go to make he pile because there would be a colic epidemic in the island the season before bottle be label ` do not shake ' that settle he business might as well have mark 'em ` keep frozen ' in this part of the world fellow go broke in any case say barnett such a glow as that we sight last night i have never see from any volcano nor i say trendon do not prove it might not have be i 'll just bet the best dinner in san francisco that it be not say edward you be on say carter let I in suggest ive and i 'll take one of it say mcguire come one come all say edward cheerily i 'll live high on the collective bad judgment of this outfit to-night be not likely to settle it anyhow say ive i move we turn in expectant mind do not lend themselves to sound slumber all night the officer of the _ wolverine _ sleep on the verge of wake but it be not until dawn that the cry of sail-ho send they all hurry to they clothes ordinarily officer of the we navy do not scuttle on deck like a crowd of curious schoolgirl but all hand have be key to a high pitch over the elusive light and the bet with edward now serve as a excuse for the betrayal of unusual eagerness hence the quarter-deck be soon alive with man who be wont to be deep in dream at that hour they find carter whose watch on deck it be reprimand the lookout no sir the man be insist she do not show no light sir i would ` a ' sight she a hour ago sir if she have we shall see say carter grimly who be you relief sennett let he take you place go aloft sennett as the lookout crestfallen and surly go below barnett say in subdue tone : upon my word i should not be surprise if the man be right certainly there be something queer about that hooker look how she handle herself the vessel be some three mile to windward she be a schooner of the common two-masted pacific type but she be comport herself in a manner uncommon on the pacific or any other ocean even as barnett speak she heel well over and come rush up into the wind where she stand with all sail shake slowly she pay off again bear away from they now she gather full headway yet edge little by little to windward again mighty queer tactic mutter edward i think she be steer herself good thing she carry a weather helm comment ive who be a expert on sailing rig most of that type do otherwise she would have jibe she mast out run loose that way captain parkinson appear on deck and turn he glass for a full minute on the strange schooner aloft there he hail the crow 's - nest do you make out anyone aboard no sir come the answer mr carter have the chief quartermaster report on deck with the signal flag yes sir be not we go to run up to she asked mcguire turn in surprise to edward and take the risk of get a hole punch in we pretty paint with she run amuck that way not much up come the signal quartermaster to get he order and there ensue a one-sided conversation in the pregnant language of the sea what ship be that no answer be you in trouble ask the cruiser and wait the schooner show a bare and silent main-peak heave to now uncle sam be give order but the other pay no heed we 'll make that a little more emphatic say captain parkinson a moment later there be the sharp crash of a gun and a shot go across the bow of the sailing vessel hasten by a flaw of wind that veer from the normal direction of the breeze the stranger make sharply to windward as if to obey ah there she come run the comment along the cruiser 's quarter-deck but the schooner after stand for a moment all flap answer another flaw and go wide about on the opposite tack derelict remark captain parkinson she seem to be in good shape too dr trendon yes sir the surgeon go to the captain and the other could hear he deep abrupt utterance in reply to some question too low for they ear might be sir beri-berus maybe more likely smallpox if anything of that kind but _ some _ of 'em would be on deck whew a plague ship say billy edwards just my luck to be order to board she he shiver slightly scared billy say ive edward have a record for daring which make this joke obvious enough to be safe i would not want to have my peculiar style of beauty spoil by smallpox mark say the ensign with a smile on he homely win face and i have a hunch that that ship be not a lucky find for this ship then i have a hunch that you hunch be a wrong one say ive how long would you guess that craft to be -lrb- illustration : a schooner comport herself in a manner uncommon on the pacific -rrb- they be now within a mile of the schooner edward scrutinise she calculatingly eighty to ninety foot say 150 ton and she be a two-masted schooner be not she continue ive insinuatingly she certainly be well i have a hunch that that ship be a lucky find for any ship but particularly for this ship great caesar cry the ensign excitedly do you think it be _ she _ a buzz of electric interest go around the group every glass be raise every eye strain toward she stern to read the name as she veer into the wind again about she come a sharp sigh of excited disappointment exhale from the spectator the name have be paint out no go breathe edward but i 'll bet another dinner -- mr edward call the captain you will take the second cutter board that schooner and make a full investigation yes sir take you time do not come alongside until she be in the wind leave enough man aboard to handle she yes sir the cruiser steam to within half a mile of the aimless traveller and the small boat put out not one of he fellow but envy the young ensign as he leave the ship steer by timmin a veteran bo 's 'n' s mate wise in all the in and out of sea way they see he board neatly run the small boat under the schooner 's counter they see the foresheet ease off and the ship run up into the wind then the foresail drop and the wheel lash so that she would stand so they await the reappearance of edward and the bo 's 'n' s mate when they have vanish below deck and with a intensity of eagerness they follow the return of the small boat billy edward 's face as he come on deck be a study it be alight with excitement yet between the eye two deep wrinkle of puzzlement quiver such a face the mathematician bend above he paper when some obstructive factor arise between he and he solution well sir there be a hint of effort at restraint in the captain 's voice she be the _ laugh lass _ sir everything ship-shape but not a soul aboard come below mr edward say the captain and they go leave behind they a boiling cauldron of theory and conjecture iii the death ship billy edward come on deck with a line of irritation right-angling the furrow between he eye go ahead the quarter-deck bid he see he aflush with information the captain will not believe I blurt out edward be it as bad as that ask barnett smile it certainly be reply the younger man seriously i do not know that i blame he i would hardly believe it myself if i have not -- oh go on out with it give we the fact never mind you credibility the fact be that there lie the _ laugh lass _ a little weather-worn but sound as a dollar and not a living be aboard of she she boat be all there everything 's in good condition though none too orderly pitcher half full of fresh water in the rack sail all o k ash of the galley fire still warm i tell you gentleman that ship have not be desert more than a couple of day at the outside be you sure all the boat be there ask ive dory dingy and two surf boat be not that enough plenty be over she inside and out no sign of collision no leak no anything except that the starboard side be blister a bit no evidence of fire anywhere else i tell you say billy edward pathetically it be give I a headache perhaps it be one of those case of panic that forsythe speak of the other night say ive the crew get frighten at something and run away with the devil after they but crew do not just step out and run around the corner and hide when they be scared object barnett that be true too assented ive well perhaps that volcanic eruption jar they so that they jump for it pretty wild theory that say edward no wilder than the fact as you give they be the retort that be so admit the ensign gloomily but how about pestilence suggest barnett maybe they die fast and the last survivor after the body of the rest be overboard get delirious and jump after they not if the galley fire be hot say dr trendon briefly no pestilence do not work that way do you look at the wheel billy ask ive do i there be another thing wheel 's all right but compass be no good at all it be regularly bewitch what about the log then could not find it anywhere hunt high low jack and the game everywhere except in the big brass-bound chest i find in the captain 's cabin could not break into that dr schermerhorn 's chest exclaim barnett then he be aboard well he be not aboard now say the ensign grimly not in the flesh and that be all he add suddenly no it be not all say barnett gently there be something else captain 's order oh no captain parkinson do not take enough stock in my report to tell I to withhold anything say edward with a trace of bitterness in he voice it be nothing that i believe myself anyhow give _ we _ a chance to believe it say ive well say the ensign hesitantly there be a sort of atmosphere about that schooner that be almost uncanny oh you have the shudder before you be order to board banter ive i know it i would have think it be one of those fool presentiment if i be the only one to feel it but the man be affect too they keep together like frightened sheep and i hear one say to another : ` hey boney d'you feel like someone be a-buzzin ' you nerve like a fiddle-string ' now demand edward plaintively what right have a jackie to have nerve that be strange enough about the compass say barnett slowly ours be all right again the schooner must have be so near the electric disturbance that she instrument be permanently derange that would lend weight to the volcanic theory say carter so the captain do not take kindly to you go-look-see question ive of edward as good as tell I i would miss the point of the thing say the ensign flushing perhaps he can make more of it himself at any rate he be go to try here he be now dr trendon say the captain appear you will please to go with I to the schooner yes sir say the surgeon rise from he chair with such alacrity as to draw from ive the sardonic comment : why i actually believe old trendon be excite for two hour after the departure of the captain and trendon there be dull time on the quarter-deck of the _ wolverine _ then the surgeon come back to they billy be right he say but he do not tell we anything cry ive he do not clear up the mystery that be what say trendon one thing billy say he add wax unusually prolix for he be truer than maybe he know thanks murmur the ensign what be that you say ` not a living be aboard ' exact word hey well what of it exclaim the ensign excitedly you do not mean you find dead -- keep you temperature down my boy no you be exactly right not a living be aboard thanks for nothing retort the ensign neither human nor other pursued trendon what food scatter around the galley crumb on the mess table ever see a wooden ship without cockroach never particularly investigate the matter do not believe such a thing exist say ive not a cockroach on the _ laugh lass _ ever know of a old hooker that be not overrun with rat no nor anyone else not above water find a dozen dead rat no sound or sign of a live one on the _ laugh lass _ no rat no mouse no bug gentleman the _ laugh lass _ be a charnel ship no wonder billy 's tender nerve go wrong say ive with irrepressible flippancy she be probably haunt by cockroach wraith he 'll have a chance to see say trendon captain 's go to put he in charge by way of apology then say barnett that be pretty square captain parkinson wish to see you in he cabin mr edward say a orderly come in a pleasant voyage captain billy say ive sing out if the goblin git yer fifteen minute later ensign edward with a quartermaster timmin the bo 's 'n' s mate and a crew be head a straight course toward he first command with instruction to keep company and watch for signal and intention to break into the brass-bound chest and ferret out what clue lay there if it take dynamite as he board barnett and trendon with both of whom the lad be a favorite come to a sinister conclusion it be poison i suppose say the first officer and a mighty subtle sort agree trendon do not like the look of it he shake a solemn head do not like it for a damn iv the second prize crew in semi-tropic pacific weather the unexpected so seldom happen as to be a negligible quantity the _ wolverine _ meet with it on June 5th from some unaccountable source in that realm of the heaven-scouring trade come a heavy mist possibly volcanic action deranging by its electric and gaseous outpouring the normal course of the wind have give birth to it be that as it may it sweep down upon the cruiser thicken as it approach until presently it have spread a curtain between the warship and its charge the wind die until after fall of night the _ wolverine _ move slowly bellow for the schooner but get no reply once they think they hear a distant shout of response but there be no repetition probably do not carry any fog horn say carter bitterly voice a general uneasiness no log compass crazy without fog signal i do not like that craft barnett ought to have be order to blow the damned thing up as a peril to the high sea we 'll pick she up in the morning surely say forsythe this can not last for ever nor do it last long a hour before midnight a pound shower fall lash the sea into phosphorescent whiteness it cease and with the growl of a leap animal a squall furiously beset the ship soon the great steel body be plunge and heave in the billow it be a gloomy company about the wardroom table upon each and all hang a oppression of spirit captain parkinson come from he cabin and go on deck constitutionally he be a nervous and pessimistic man with a fix belief in the conspiracy of event band for the undoing of he and he blind or dubious condition rack he soul but real danger find he not only prepared but even eager now he face be a picture of foreboding parky look as if davy jone be pull on he string observe the flippant ive to he neighbor worry about the schooner hope billy edward saw or hear or feel that squall come reply forsythe give expression to the anxiety that all feel he be a good sailor man say ive and that be a staunch little schooner by the way she handle herself oh it will be all right say carter confidently the wind 's moderate now but there be no tell how far out of the course this may have blow he barnett come down drip anything new ask dr trendon the navigate officer shake he head nothing but the captain 's in a state of mind he say what be wrong with he the schooner seem possess with the notion that there be something wrong with she be not you feel a little that way yourself say forsythe i be i 'll take a look around before i turn in he leave behind he a silent crowd he return be prompt and swift come on deck he say every man leap as to a order there be that in forsythe 's voice which sting the weather have clear somewhat though scud wrack still blow across they to the westward the ship roll heavily of the sea naught be visible except the arch wave but in the sky they behold again with a sickening sense of disaster that pale and lovely glow which have so bewildered they two night before the aurora cry mcguire the paymaster oh certainly reply ive with sarcasm dead in the west common spot for the aurora particularly on the edge of the south sea where they be thick then what be it nobody have a answer carter hasten forward and return to report it be electrical anyway say carter the compass be queer again edwards ought to be close to the solution of it venture ive this gale should have blow he just about to the center of interest if only he be not involve in it say carter anxiously what could there be to involve he ask mcguire i do not know say carter slowly somehow i feel as if the desertion of the schooner be in some formidable manner connect with that light for perhaps fifteen minute the glow continue it seem to be nearer at hand than on the former sighting but it take no comprehensible form then it die away and all be blackness again but the officer of the _ wolverine _ have long be in troubled slumber before the sensitive compass regain its exact balance and with the shift wind to mislead she the cruiser have wander by morning no man might know how far from she course all day long of June 6th the _ wolverine _ baffle by patch of mist and move rain-squall patrol the empty sea without sight the lose schooner the evening bring a envelope of fog again and presently a light breeze come up from the north a hour of it have fail to disperse the mist when there be bear down to the warship a flap sound as of great wing the flap grow louder -- wane -- cease -- and from the lookout come a hail ship 's light three point on the starboard quarter what do you make it out to be come the query from below green light 's all i can see sir there be a pause there be she port light now look to be turn and bear down on we sir come dead for we -- the man 's voice rise -- close aboard less 'n two ship 's length away as for a prearranged scene the fog-curtain part there loom silently and swiftly the _ laugh lass _ down she bear upon the greater vessel until it seem as if she must ram but all the time she be veer to windward and now she run into the wind with a castanet rattle of sail so close aboard be she that the eager eye of uncle sam 's man peer down upon she empty deck -- for she be void of life behind the cruiser 's blanket she pay off very slowly but presently catch the breeze full and again whiten the water at she prow forget regulation ive hail loudly : ahoy _ laugh lass _ ahoy billy edward no sound no animate motion come from aboard that apparition as she fall astern a shudder of horror run across the _ wolverine _ 's quarter-deck a wraith ship people with skeleton would have be less dreadful to they sight than the brisk and active desolation of the heel schooner be desert since early last night say trendon hoarsely how can you tell that ask barnett both sail reef down ready for that squall be no weather since to call for reef must have quit she during the squall then they jump cry carter for i see she boat it be not believable neither be the other say trendon grimly a hurry succession of order stop further discussion for the time ive be send aboard the schooner to lower sail and report he come back with a staggering dearth of information the boat be all there the ship be intact -- as intact as when billy edward have take charge -- but the cheery lovable ensign and he man have vanish without trace or clue as to the how or the wherefore they might rack they brain without guess there be the beginning of a log in the ensign 's handwriting which ive have find with high excitement and read with bitter disappointment have squall from northeast it run double reef she and she take it nicely seem a seaworthy quick ship further search for log no result have order one of crew who be a bit of a mechanic to work at the brass-bound chest till he get it open he report mark on the lock as if somebody have be try to pick it before he there be no further entry dr trendon be right say barnett whatever happen -- and god only know what it could have be -- it happen just after the squall just about the time of the strange glow cry ive it be decide that two man and a petty officer should be send aboard the _ laugh lass _ to make she fast with a cable and remain on board over night but when the order be give the man hang back one of they protest brokenly that he be sick trendon after examination report to the captain case of blue funk sir might as well be sick good for nothing other be not much better who be to be in charge congdon reply the doctor name one of the petty officer he be my coxswain say captain parkinson a first-class man i can hardly believe that he be afraid we 'll see -lrb- illustration : a man who be a bit of a mechanic be set to work to open the chest -rrb- congdon be send for you be order aboard the schooner for the night congdon say the captain yes sir be there any reason why you do not wish to go the man hesitate look miserable finally he blurt out not without a certain dignity : i obey order sir speak out my man urge the captain kindly well sir : it be mr edward then you could not scare he off a ship sir unless it be something -- something -- he stop fail of the word you know what mr edward be sir for pluck he conclude _ be _ cry the captain sharply what do you mean the schooner get he sir you do not make no doubt of that do you sir the man speak in a hushed voice with a shrink glance back of he will you go aboard under mr ive anywhere my officer go i 'll go and gladly sir ive be send aboard in charge for that night in a light breeze the two ship lay close together the schooner ride jauntily astern but not until morning illumine the world of water do the _ wolverine _ 's people feel confident that the _ laugh lass _ would not vanish away from they ken like a shape of the mist v the disappearance when barnett come on deck very early in the morning of June 7th he find dr trendon already up and stare moodily out at the _ laugh lass _ as the night be calm the tow have make fair time toward they port in the hawaiian group the surgeon be mutter something which seem to barnett to be in a foreign tongue think out any clue doctor ask the first officer _ petit chel _ -- pshaw _ jolie celimene _ no muttered trendon _ marie -- marie _ -- i have get it the _ marie celeste _ get what what about she parallel case say trendon sail from new york back in the seventy seven week out be find derelict everything in perfect order captain 's wife 's hem on the machine boat all account for no sign of struggle log write to within forty-eight hour what become of the crew wish i could tell you might help to unravel we tangle he shake he head in sudden unwonted passion evidently there be something criminal in she record say barnett frowning at the fusty schooner astern otherwise the name would not be paint out paint out long ago see how rusty it be schermerhorn 's work maybe reply trendon secret expedition remember in the name of wonder why should he do it secret expedition be not it um-ah that be true say the other thoughtfully it be quite possible captain wish to see both of you gentleman in the ward room if you please come a message below they find all the officer gather captain parkinson be pacing up and down in ill-controlled agitation gentleman he say we be face a problem which so far as i know be without parallel it be my intention to bring the schooner which we have in tow to port at honolulu in the present unsettled weather we can not continue to tow she i wish two officer to take charge under the circumstance i shall issue no order the duty must be voluntary instantly every man from the veteran trendon to the youthful paymaster volunteer that be what i expect say captain parkinson quietly but i have still a word to say i make no doubt in my own mind that the schooner have twice be beset by the gravest of peril nothing less would have drive mr edward from he post all of we who know he will appreciate that nor can i free myself from the darkest foreboding as to he fate and that of he companion but as to the nature of the peril i be unable to make any conjecture worthy of consideration have anyone a theory to offer there be a dead silence mr barnett dr trendon mr ive be there not possibly some connection between the unexplained light which we have twice see and the double desertion of the ship suggest the first officer after a pause i have ask myself that over and over whatever the source of the light and however near to it the schooner may have be she be evidently unharmed yes sir say barnett that seem to vitiate that explanation i thank you gentleman for the promptitude of you offer continue the captain in this respect you make my duty the more difficult i shall accept mr ive because of he familiarity with sailing craft and with these sea he eye range the group i beg you pardon captain parkinson eagerly put in the paymaster but i have handle a schooner yacht for several year and i would appreciate the chance of -- very well mr mcguire you shall be the second in command thank you sir you gentleman will pick a volunteer crew and go aboard at once spare no effort to find record of the schooner 's cruise keep in company and watch for signal report at once any discovery or unusual incident however slight not so easily be a crew obtain have in mind the excusable superstition of the man captain parkinson be unwilling to compel any of they to the duty awed by the mystery of they mate ' disappearance the sailor hang back finally by temptation of extra prize money a complement be make up at ten o'clock of a puffy mist-laden morning a new and strong crew of nine man board the _ laugh lass _ there be no farewell among the officer foreboding weigh too heavy for such open expression all the fate of weather seem to combine to part the schooner from she convoy as before the fog fall only to be succeed by squally rain-shower that cut out the vista into a checkerboard pattern of visible sea and impenetrable greyness before evening the _ laugh lass _ make slow way through the mist have become separate by a league of wave from the cruiser one glimpse of she between mist area the _ wolverine _ catch at sunset then wind and rain descend in furious volume from the southeast the cruiser immediately head about follow the probable course of she charge which would be beat far down to leeward it be a gloomy mess on the warship in he cabin captain parkinson be frankly sea-sick : a condition which nothing but the extreme of nervous depression ever induce in he for several hour the rain fall and the gale howl then the sky swiftly clear and with the clearing there rise a great cry of amaze from stem to stern of the _ wolverine _ for far toward the western horizon appear such a prodigy as the eye of no man aboard that ship have ever behold from a belt of marvellous glowing gold rich and splendid streamer of light spiral up into the blackness of the heaven in all the color of the spectrum they rise and fall blaze orange silken wonderful translucent blues and shimmering red below a broad band of paler hue like sheet lightning fix to rigidity waver and ripple all the aurora of the northland blended in one could but have pale away before the splendor of that terrific celestial apparition on board the cruiser all hand stand petrified bind in a stricture of speechless wonder after the first cry silence lay leaden over the ship it be break by a scream of terror from forward the quartermaster who have be at the wheel come clamber down the ladder and run along the deck he finger splay and stiffen before he in the intensity of he panic the needle the compass he shriek barnett run to the wheel house with trendon at he heel the other follow the needle be sway like a cobra 's head and as a cobra 's head spit venom it spit forth a thin steel-blue stream of lucent fire then so swiftly it whirl that the spark scatter from it in a tiny shower it stop quiver and curve itself upward until it rattle like a fairy drum upon the glass shield barnett look at trendon volcanic he say ` mine eye have see the come of the glory of the lord ' mutter the surgeon in he deep bass as he look forth upon the streaming radiant heaven it be like nothing else in the west the splendor and the terror shot to the zenith barnett whirl the wheel the ship respond perfectly i though she might be bewitch too he murmur you may heal she for the light mr barnett say captain parkinson calmly he have come from he cabin all he nervous depression go in the face of a imminent and visible danger slowly the great mass of steel swing to the unknown for a hour the unknown guide she then fall blackness sudden complete after that radiance the dazzled eye could make out no star but the look-out 's keen vision discern something else ship afire he shout hoarsely where away two point to leeward near where the light be sir they turn they eye to the direction indicate and behold a majestic rolling volume of purple light suddenly a fiercer red shot it through that be no ship afire say trendon volcano in eruption and the other ask the captain no volcano sir poor billy edward win he bet say forsythe in a low voice god grant he be on earth to collect it reply barnett solemnly no one turn in that night when the sun of June 8th rise it show a ocean bare of prospect except that on the far horizon where the chart show no land there rise a smudge of dirty rolling smoke of the schooner there be neither sign nor trace vi the castaway this ship growl carter the second officer to dr trendon as they stand watch the grow smoke-column be a worse hot-bed of rumor than a down-east village that be the third sea-gull we have have officially report since breakfast as he say three distinct time the _ wolverine _ have thrill to a imminent discovery which upon nearer investigation have dwindle to nothing more than a float fowl upon the heel of carter 's complaint come another hail boat ahoy three point on the starboard bow if that be another gull mutter carter i 'll have something to say to you my festive lookout the news run electrically through the cruiser and all eye be strain for a glimpse of the boat the ship swing away to starboard let I know as soon as you can make she out order carter aye aye sir there be certainly something there say forsythe presently i can make out a speck rise on the wave bit o ' wreckage from barnett 's derelict muttered trendon scowl through he glass ride too high for a spar or anything of that sort say the junior lieutenant she be a small boat come in the clear tone of the lookout driftin ' down anyone in she asked carter can not make out yet sir no one be in charge though sir captain parkinson appear and carter point out the speck to he yes give she full speed say the captain reply to a question from the officer of the deck forward leap the swift cruiser all too slow for the anxious heart of those aboard for there be not one of the _ wolverine _ who do not expect from this aimless traveller of desert sea at the least a lead clue to the riddle that oppress they aloft there aye aye sir can you make out she build ride high like a dory sir be not there a dory on the _ laugh lass _ cry forsythe on she stern davit answer trendon it be hardly probable that unattached small boat should be drift about these sea say captain parkinson thoughtfully if she be a dory she be the _ laugh lass _ 's boat that be what she be say barnett you can see she build plain enough now mr barnett will you go aloft and keep I post say the captain the executive officer climb to join the lookout as he ascend those below see the little craft rise high and slow on a broad swell same dory say trendon i would swear to she in constantinople what else could she be mutter forsythe somethin' that look like a man in the bottom of she sing out the crow 's - nest two of 'em i think for five minute there be stillness aboard break only by a occasional low-voiced conjecture then from aloft : two man roll in the bottom be they alive no sir not that i can see the wind which have be extremely variable since dawn now whip around a couple of point swing the boat 's stern to they barnet put aside he glass for a moment call down : that be the one sir i can make out the name good say the captain quietly we should have news at least ive or mcguire suggest forsythe in low tone or billy edwards amend carter not edward say trendon how do you know demand forsythe dory be aboard when we find she the second time after edward have leave can you make out which of the man be in she hail the captain do not think it be any of we people come the astonishing reply from barnett be you sure i can see only one man 's face sir it be not ive or mcguire he be a stranger to I it must be one of the crew then no sir beg you parding call the lookout nothin ' like that in we crew sir the boat come down upon they swiftly soon the quarter-deck be look into she she be of a type common enough on the high sea except that a step for a mast show that she have presumably be use for skim about open shore of she passenger one lay forward prone and quiet a length of sail cloth spread over he make it impossible to see he garb at he breast a ugly protuberance outline vaguely hint a deformity the other sprawled aft and at a nearer sight of he some of the man break out into nervous titter there be some excuse for surely such a scarecrow have never before be the sport of wind and wave a thing of shred he be elaborately ragged a face overrun with a scrub of beard and preternaturally draw surmount by a stiff-dried dirty cloth semi-turban with a wide forbid stain along the side work out the likeness to a make-up my god cackle forsythe with a hysterical explosion and again my god a long-drawn irrepressible aspiration of expectancy rise from the warship 's deck as the stranger raise he haggard face turn eye unseeingly upon they and fall back the forward occupant stir not save as the boat roll from between deck someone call out sharply a order in the grim silence it seem strangely incongruous that the measure business of a ship 's life should be go forward as usual something within the newcomer 's consciousness stir to that voice of authority mechanically like some huge hideous toy he raise first one arm then the other and hitch himself halfway up on the stern seat he mouth open he face wrinkle he seem grope for the meaning of a joke at which he know he ought to laugh suddenly from he lip in surprising volume raucous rasp yet with a certain rollick deviltry fit to set the head a-tilt burst a chanty : oh they coffin be they ship and they grave it be the sea : _ blow high blow low what care we _ and the quarter that we give they be to sink they in the sea : _ down on the coast of the high barbaree-ee _ long-drawn like the mockery of a wail the minor cadence waver through the stillness and die away the high barbaree cry trendon you know it ask the captain expectant of a clue one of those curse tune you can not forget say the surgeon hear a scoundrel of a beach-comber sing it year ago down in new zealand that be when the fever rise on he he would pipe up use to beat time with a steel hook he wear in place of a hand the thing haunt I till i be sorry i have not let the rascal die this creature might have learn it from he howl it out exactly like i do not see that that help we any say forsythe look down on the preparation that be make to receive the unexpected guest with a deftness which have make the _ wolverine _ famous in the navy for the nicety of seamanship the great cruiser let down she tackle as she draw skilfully alongside and make fast preparatory to lift the dory gently to she broad deck but before the order come to hoist away one of the jacky who have go down draw the cover back from the still figure forward and turn it over with a half-stifled cry he shrink back and at that the tension of soul and mind on the _ wolverine _ snap break into outcry and sudden sharp imprecation the face reveal be that of timmin the bo 's 'n' s mate who have sail with the first vanish crew a life preserver be fasten under he arm he be dead i be out say the surgeon briefly and stand with mouth agape never have the disciplined _ wolverine _ perform a sea duty with so ragged a routine as the get in of the boat contain the live man and the dead body the dead seaman be reverently dispose and cover as to the survivor there be some hesitancy on the part of the captain who be incline to send he forward until dr trendon after a swift scrutiny suggest that for the present at least he be berth aft they take the stranger to edward 's vacant room where trendon be closet with he for half a hour when he emerge he be beset with question can not give any account of himself yet say the surgeon weak and not rightly conscious what ail he enough gash in he scalp fever thirst and exhaustion nervous shock too i think how come he aboard the _ laugh lass _ do he know anything of billy be he a stow-away do you ask he about ive and mcguire how come he in the small boat where be the rest now now say the veteran chidingly how can i tell would you have I kill the man with question he leave they to look at the body of the bo 's 'n' s mate not a word have he to say when he return only the captain get anything out of he but growl and unintelligible expression which seem to be objurgatory and to express bewildered cogitation how long have poor timmin be drown the captain have ask he and trendon reply : captain parkinson the man be not drown no water in he lung not drown then how come he by he death if i be to diagnose it under any other condition i should say that he have inhale flame then the two man stare at each other in blank impotency meantime the scarecrow be show sign of return consciousness and a message be dispatch for the physician on he way he meet barnett who ask and receive permission to accompany he the stranger be toss restlessly in he bunk opening and shut he parched mouth in silent piteous appeal for the water that must still be dole to he parsimoniously i think i 'll try he with a little brandy say trendon and send for the liquor barnett raise the patient while the surgeon hold the glass to he lip the man 's hand rise waver and clasp the glass all right my friend take it yourself if you like say trendon the finger close tremulously hold the little glass tilted and rattle against the tooth there be one deep eager spasm of swallow then the fevered eye open upon the face of the _ wolverine _ 's first officer prosit barnett say the man in a voice like the rasp of rusty metal the navy man straighten up as from a blow under the jaw be careful what you be about warn trendon address he superior officer sharply for barnett have all but let he charge drop he face be a puckered mask of amaze and incredulity do you hear he speak my name -- or be i dream he half whisper hear he plain enough who be he the man 's eye close but he smile a little -- a singular wry-mouthed win smile with that there spring from behind the brush of beard fill out the deep line of emaciation a memory to the recognition of barnett a keen and gay countenance that whisk he back across seven year time to the day of dewey and the philippine ralph slade by the lord he exclaim of the _ laugh lass _ cry trendon of the _ laugh lass _ such a fury of eagerness burn in the face of barnett that trendon caution he see here mr barnett you be not go to fire a broadside of disturbing question at my patient yet a while he be in no condition but it be from the other that the question come open he eye he whisper the sailor where dead say trendon bluntly then break he own rule of repression he ask : do he come off the schooner with you pick he up be the strain answer drift the survivor look around he then into barnett 's face and he mind too traverse the year _ north dakota _ he query no i have change my ship say barnett this be the _ wolverine _ where 's the _ laugh lass _ barnett shake he head tell I begged slade wait till you be stronger admonish trendon can not wait say the weak voice the eye grow wild mr barnett tell he the bare outline and make it short say the surgeon we sight the _ laugh lass _ two day ago she be in good shape but desert that be we think she be desert the man nod eagerly i suppose you be aboard say barnett and trendon make a quick gesture of impatience and rebuke no say slade leave three -- four -- do not know how many night ago the officer look at each other go on say trendon to he companion we put a crew aboard in command of a ensign continue barnett and pick up the schooner the next night desert you must know about it where be billy edwards never hear of he whisper the other ive and mcguire then they be there after -- great god man he cry he agitation break out pull yourself together give we something to go on mr barnett say the surgeon peremptorily but the suggestion be work in the sick man 's brain he turn to the officer a face of horror you man edward -- the crew -- they leave she in the night what do he mean cry barnett the light you see it yes we see a strange light answer trendon soothingly slade half rise lose all lose he cry and fall back unconscious trendon explode into curse see what you have do to my patient he fume barnett look at he with contrite eye better get out before he come to growl the surgeon nice way to treat a man half dead of exhaustion it be nearly a hour before slade come back to the world again the doctor forbid he to attempt speech but of one thing he would not be deny there be a struggle for utterance then : the volcano he rasp out dead ahead be the reply stand by grasp slade he strive to rise to say something further but endurance have reach its limit the man be utterly do dr trendon go on deck he head sink between he shoulder for a minute he be in earnest talk with the captain presently the _ wolverine _ 's engine slow down and she lay head to the wave with just enough turn of the screw to hold she against the sea-way vii the free lance by the follow afternoon dr trendon report he patient as quite recover starve for water proffer the surgeon tissue fairly dry out soak he up feed he broth put he to sleep he be all right just wake up to eat then off again like a two-year old wonderful constitution the gentleman want to know if he can come on deck sir salute a orderly wake up eh come on barnett help I boost he on deck the two officer disappear to return in a moment arm-in-arm with ralph slade nearly twenty-four hour ' rest and skilful treatment have do wonder he be still a trifle weak and uncertain be still a little glad to lean on the arm of he companion but he eye be bright and alert and he hollow cheek mount a slight color this with the clothes lend he by barnett transform he appearance and lead captain parkinson to congratulate himself that he have not obey he first impulse to send the castaway forward with the man the officer press forward mighty glad to see you out hope you have get you pin under you again old man i be mighty glad we come along the chorus of greet be hearty enough but the journalist barely pay the courtesy of acknowledgment he eye sweep the horizon eagerly until it rest on the cloud of volcanic smoke billow up across the setting sun a sigh of relief escape he where be we he ask barnett i mean since you pick I up how long ago be that anyway yesterday reply the navigate officer we have stand off and on look for some of we man then that be the same volcano -- barnett laugh softly well they be not quite hold a caucus of volcano down in this country one like that be enough but slade brush the remark aside head for it he cry excitedly we may be in time there be a man on that island a man another not billy edward not some of we boy slade stare at they bewildered hold on interpose dr trendon authoritatively what be he name he inquire of the journalist darrow reply the latter percy darrow do you know he who in kamschatka be percy darrow demand forsythe why he be the assistant it be a long story -- of course it be a long story there be a lot we want to know interrupted captain parkinson quartermaster head for the volcano yonder mr slade we want to know where you come from and why you leave the schooner and who percy darrow be and there be dinner so we 'll just adjourn to the messroom and hear what you can tell we but there be one thing we be all anxious to know how come you in the dory which we find and leave on the _ laugh lass _ no later than two day ago i have not set eye on the _ laugh lass _ for -- well i do not know how long but it be five day anyway perhaps more reply slade they stare at he incredulously oh i see he burst out suddenly there be twin dory on the schooner the other one 's still there i suppose do you find she on the stern davit yes that be it then you see when i leave -- captain parkinson 's raise hand check he if you will be so good mr slade let we have it all at once after mess at table the young officer at a sharp hint from dr trendon converse on indifferent subject until the journalist have partake heartily of what the physician allow he slade eat with keen appreciation i tell you that be good he sigh when he have finish real live after-dinner coffee too why gentleman i have not eat a civilised meal with all the trimming for over two year doctor do you think a little of the real stuff would hurt I it be a pretty dry yarn one glass growl the surgeon no more scotch high-ball then vote slade the higher the better the steward bring a tall glass with ice in which the newcomer mixed he drink then for quite a minute he sit silent stare at the table he finger aimlessly rub into spot of wetness the water bead as they gather on the outside of he glass suddenly he look up i do not know how to begin he confess it be too confound improbable i hardly believe it myself now that i be sit here in human clothes surround by human being old scrub and the nigger and handy solomon and the professor and the chest and the -- well they be real enough when i be catch in the mess but i warn you you be not go to believe I and hang if i blame you a bit we have see marvel ourselves in the last few day encourage captain parkinson fire ahead man advise barnett impatiently just begin at the beginning and let it go at that slade sip at he glass reflectively well say he at length the best way to begin be to show you how i happen to be mix up in it at all the officer unconsciously relax into attitude of greater ease overhead the lamp sway gently to the swell the dull throb of the screw pulsate steward clothe in white move noiselessly fill the glass deferentially striking light for the smoker clear away the last dish of the repast i be a reporter by choice and a detective by instinct begin slade with startling abruptness furthermore i be pretty well off i be what they call a free lance for i have no regular desk on any of the journal i generally turn my stuff in to the _ star _ because they treat I well in return it be pretty well understand between we that i be to use my judgment in regard to ` story ' and that they 'll stand back of I for expense you see i have be with they quite a while he look around the circle as though in appeal to the comprehension of he audience some of the man nod other sip from they glass or draw at they cigar i loaf around here and there in the world have a good time travel visit fool around every once in a while something interest I the thing be a sort of instinct i run it down if it be a good story i send it in that be all there be to it he laugh slightly you see i be a sort of magazine writer in method but my stuff be newspaper stuff also the game suit I that be why i play it that be why i be here i have to tell you about myself this way so you will understand how i come to be mix up in this _ laugh lass _ matter i remember comment barnett that when you come aboard the _ south dakota _ you have a little trouble make captain arnold see it he turn to the other with a laugh he have all kind of papers of ancient date but nothing modern -- letter from the _ star _ dated five year back recommendation to everybody on earth except captain arnold certificate of bravery in apache campaign bank identification and all the rest ` maybe you be the _ star 's _ correspondent and maybe you be not ' say the captain ' i do not see anything here to prove it ' slade argue a hour no go remember how you catch he he inquire of slade the reporter grin assent after the old man have turn he down for good slade fish down in he warbag and haul out a old tattered document from a oilskin case ` hold on a minute ' say he ` you old shellback i have prove to you that i can write and i have prove to you that i have fight and now here i 'll prove to you that i can sail if write fighting and sailing do not fit I adequately to report any little disturbance you antiquated washboiler may blunder into i 'll go to raise cabbage ' with that he present a master 's certificate where do you get it anyway i never find out pass as ` fresh-water ' on the great lake reply slade briefly well the spunk and the certificate finish the captain he be a old square rigger himself in the civil war so much for myself slade continue as for the _ laugh lass _ -- part two the brass bind chest _ be the story tell by ralph slade free lance to the officer of the united state cruiser wolverine _ i the barbary coast a coincidence get I aboard she i 'll tell you how it be one evening late i be just come out of a dark alley on the barbary coast san francisco you know -- the water front where you can hear more tongue than at port say see stranger sight and meet adventure with the joyous certainty of mediaeval time i would be down there hunting up a man report by a wharf-rat of my acquaintance to have just return from a two year ' whaling voyage he have be shanghai aboard and as a matter of fact be worth nearly a million dollar land in the city without a cent could get nobody to believe he nor trust he to the extent of a telegram east wharf-rat laugh at he yarn but i believe it be true good copy anyway -- just at the turn of the alley i nearly bump into two man on the barbary coast you do not pass man in narrow place until you have reconnoiter a little i pull up thank fortune that they have not see I the first word be utter in a voice i know well you have all hear of dr karl augustus schermerhorn he do some big thing and have in mind still bigger i would meet he some time before in connection with he telepathy and wireless wave theory it be picturesque stuff for my purpose but be not in it with what the old fellow have really do he show I -- well that do not matter the point be that good staid self-centred or rather science-centred dr schermerhorn be stand at midnight in a dark alley on the barbary coast in san francisco talk to a individual whose facial outline at least be not ornamental my curiosity or professional instinct whichever you please be all arouse i flatten myself against the wall the first remark i lose the reply come to I in a shrill falsetto so grotesque be the effect of this treble from a bulk so squat and broad and hairy as the silhouette before I that i almost laugh aloud i guess you have make no mistake on that i be she master and she owner too well i haf be tell you might rent she say the doctor rent she mimic the falsetto well that -- hell yes i 'll _ rent _ she he laugh again doch recht the doctor be plainly at the end of he practical resource after wait a moment for something more definite the falsetto inquire rather drily : how long what to what for who be you anyway i be dr schermerhorn the latter answer see piece about you in the papers how many man haf you in the crew I and the mate and the cook and four hand and you could go -- soon soon as you want -- _ if _ i go i wish to leaf to-morrow if i can get the crew together i might make it but say let 's not hang out here in this run of darkness come over to the grog shop yonder where we can sit down to my relief for my curiosity be fully arouse -- dr schermerhorn 's movement be usually productive -- this proposal be veto no no cry the doctor with some haste this iss well somebody might oferhear the huge figure stir into a attitude of close attention after a pause the falsetto ask deliberately : where we goin ' i brefer not to say h be how long a cruise i want to rent you schooner and you crew as-long-as i-please-to remain h be how long be that likely to be maybe a few month maybe seferal year h be unknown port unknown cruise see here anything crooked in this no no not at all it iss simply business of my own not that i care comment the other easily only risk be worth pay for there shall not be risk pearl likely hazard the other without much heed to the assurance they jap gunboat be get pretty hard to dodge of late year however i have dodge 'em before now as to pay -- how mooch iss you boat worth i could almost follow the man 's thought as he ponder how much he dare ask well you see for a proposition like that -- do not know where we be go when we be go to get back -- and they gunboat -- how would a hundred and twenty-five a month strike you double it up i want you to do ass i say and i will also give you crew double wages bud i want goot man who will stay and who will keep the mouth shut gosh all fish-hook they would go to hell with you for that now you can get all you want of adam & marsh tell they it iss for I brovision for three year anyhow be ready to sail to-morrow tide turn at eight in the evening i will send some effect in the morning the master hesitate that be all right doctor but how do i know it be all right maybe by morning you 'll change you mind that can not be my plan be all -- it be the usual thing to pay something -- ach but yes i haf forget darrow tell I i will make you a check let we go to the table of which you speak they move away still talk i do not dare follow they into the light for i fear that the doctor would recognize I i would have give my eye tooth though to have gather the name of the schooner or that of she master as it be i hang around until the two have emerge from the corner saloon they pause outside still talk earnestly i venture a hasty interview with the bar-keeper do you notice the two man who be sit at the middle table i ask he sure say he shove I my glass of beer know they i inquire never lay eye on 'em before old chap look like a sort of corn doctor or corner spell-binder other be probably one of these longshore abalone man thanks i mutter and dodge out again leave the beer untouched i cursed myself for a blunderer when i get to the street the two man have disappear i should have shadow the captain to he vessel the affair interested I greatly apparently dr schermerhorn be about to go on a long voyage i prided myself on be fairly up to date in regard to the plan of those who interest the public and the public at that time be vastly interested in dr schermerhorn i in common with the rest of the world have imagine he anchor safely in philadelphium immerse in chemical research here he bob up at the other end of the continent make shady bargain with obscure shipping captain and pay a big premium for absolute secrecy it look good accordingly i be out early the next morning i have not much to go by schooner be as plenty as tadpole in san francisco harbor however i be sure i could easily recognize that falsetto voice and i know where the supplies be to be purchase adam & marsh be a large firm and cautious i know better than to make direct inquiry or to appear in the salesroom but by hang around the door of the shipping room i soon have track of the large order to be send that day in this manner i have no great difficulty in follow a truck to pier 10 nor to identify a consignment to captain ezra selover as probably that of which i be in search the mate be in charge of the stowage so i could not be quite sure here however be a schooner -- of about a hundred and fifty ton burden i look she over you be all acquaint with the _ laugh lass _ and the perfection of she line you have not know she under captain ezra selover she be the cleanest ship i ever see do not know how he accomplish it with a crew of four and the cook but he do the deck look as though it have be holyston every morning by a crew of jacky the stay be whip and tar the mast new-slushed and every foot of run gear coil down shipshape and bristol fashion there be a good deal of brass about she it shine like gold and i do not believe she own a inch of paint that be not either fresh or new-scrubbed i gaze for some time at this marvel it be unusual enough anywhere but aboard a californium hooker it be little short of miraculous the crew have all turn up apparently and a swarm of stevedore be hustle every sort of provision supplies stock spar line and canvas down into the hold it be a rush job and that mate be have he hand full i do not wonder at he language nor at he look both of which be somewhat muss up then almost at my elbow i hear that shrill falsetto squeal and turn just in time to see the captain ascend the after gangplank he be probably the most dishevelled and untidy man i ever lay my eye on he hair and beard be not only long but tangled and unkempt and grow so far toward each other as barely to expose a strip of dirty brown skin he shoulder be bow and enormous he arm hang like a gorilla 's palm turn slightly outwards on he head be jam a linen boat hat that have once be white gaping away from he hairy chest be a fade dingy check cotton shirt that have once be brown and white he blue trousers be spot and splash with dusty stain he be chew tobacco a figure more in contrast to the exquisitely neat vessel it would be hard to imagine the captain mount the gangplank with a steadiness that disprove my first suspicion of he have be on a drunk he glance aloft cast a speculative eye on the stevedore troop across the waist of the ship and ascend to the quarter-deck where the mate stand lean over the rail and utter direct curse from between sweat-beaded lip there the big man roam aimlessly on what seem to be a tour of casual inspection once he stop to breathe on the brass binnacle and to rub it bright with the dirtiest red bandana handkerchief i ever want to see he action amuse I the discrepancy between he personal habit and he particularity in the matter of he surroundings be exceedingly interesting i have often notice that such discrepancy seem to indicate exceptional character as i watch he he whole frame stiffen the long gorilla arm contract the hairy head sink forward in the tenseness of a serpent ready to strike he utter a shrill falsetto shriek that bring to a standstill every stevedore on the job and spring forward to seize he mate by the shoulder evidently the grasp hurt i can believe it might from those huge hand the man wrench himself about with a oath of inquiry and pain i could hear one side of what follow the captain 's high-pitched tone carry clearly but the grumble and growl of the mate be indistinguishable at that distance how far be it to the side of the ship you hound of hell shriek the captain mumble -- surprised -- for a answer well i 'll tell you you _ swab _ it be just two fathom from where you stand just two fathom how long would it take you to walk there how long just about six seconds there and back you -- i will not bother with all the epithet although by now i know captain selover 's vocabulary fairly well and you could not take six seconds off to spit over the side could not walk two fathom have to spit on my quarter-deck do you rumble from the mate no by god you will not call up any of the crew you 'll get a swab and do it yourself you 'll get a _ hand _ swab and get down on you knee damn you i 'll teach you to be lazy the mate say something again it do not matter if we be not under way that have nothing to do with it the quarter-deck be clean if the waist be not and nobody but a damn misbegotten son-of-a-sea-lawyer would spit on deck anyhow from this captain selover go on into a good old-fashioned deep-sea cuss out to the great joy of the stevedore the mate stand it pretty well but there come a time when further talk be useless even in regard to a most heinous offense and of course as you know the mate could hardly consider himself very seriously at fault why the ship be not yet at sea and in all the clutter of charge he begin to answer back in a moment it be a quarrel abruptly it be a fight the mate marked selover beneath the left eye the captain with beautiful simplicity crush he antagonist in he gorilla-like squeeze carry he to the side of the vessel and drop he limp and beat to the pier and the mate be a good stout specimen of a sea-farer too then the captain rush below emerge after a instant with a chest which he fling after he subordinate it be follow a moment later by a stream of small stuff -- mingle with language -- project through a open port-hole this in turn cease the captain reappear with a pail and brush scrub feverishly at the offend spot mop it dry with that same old red bandana handkerchief glare about he -- and abruptly become as serene and placid as a noon calm he take up the direction of the stevedore it be all most astounding nobody pay any attention to the mate he look toward the ship once or twice think better of it and begin to pick up he effect mutter savagely in a moment or so he throw he chest aboard a outgoing truck and depart it be now nearly noon and i be just in the way of go for something to eat when i catch sight of another dray laden with box and crate affair which i recognize as scientific apparatus it be follow in quick succession by three other ignorant as i be of the requirement of a scientist my common sense tell I this could be no explore outfit i revise my first intention of go to the club and buy a sandwich or two at the corner coffee house i do not know why but even then the affair seem big with mystery with the portent of tragedy perhaps the smell of tar be in my nostril and the sea call it have always possess for I a extraordinary allurement -- a little after two o'clock a cab drive to the after gangplank and stop from it alight a young man of whom i shall later have occasion to tell you more follow by dr schermerhorn the young man carry only a light leather serviette such as student use abroad while the doctor fairly stagger under the weight of a square brass-bound chest without handle the singularity of this unequal division of labor strike I at once it strike also one of the dock man who run forward eager for a tip kin i carry th ' box for you boss he ask at the same time reach for it the doctor 's thin figure seem fairly to shrink at the idea no no he cry it iss not for you to carry he hasten up the gangplank clutch the chest close at the top captain selover meet he hello doctor he squeak here in good time we be busy you see let I carry you chest for you no no dr schermerhorn fairly glare it be almighty heavy insist the captain let I give you a hand you must not _ touch _ emphatically order the scientist where iss the cabin he disappear down the companionway clasp he precious load the young man remain on deck to superintend the stowing of the scientific goods and the personal baggage all this time i have be think busily i remember distinctly one other instance when dr schermerhorn have disappear he come back inscrutably but within a week he result on aerial photography be public property i tell myself that in the present instance he lavish use of money the elaborate nature of he preparation the evident secrecy of the expedition as evidence by the fact that he have negotiate for the vessel only the day before set sail the importance of personal supervision as prove by the fact that he -- notoriously impractical in practical matter and notoriously dislike anything to do with business -- have conduct the affair himself instead of delegate it -- why gentleman do not you see that all this be more than enough to wake I up body and soul suddenly i come to a definite resolution captain selover have descend to the pier i approach he you need a mate say i he look I over perhaps he admit where 's you man right here say i he eye widen a little otherwise he show no sign of surprise i cursed my clothes fortunately i have my master 's certificate with I -- i would pass fresh-water on the great lake -- i always carry that sort of document on the chance that it may come handy it chance to have a couple of naval endorsement result of the late war look here i say before i give it to he you do not believe in I my clothes be too good that be all right they be all i have that be good i be break i come down here wonder whether i would better throw myself in the drink you look like a dude he squeak where do you ever ship i hand he my certificate the endorsement from admiral keay and captain arnold impress he he stare at I again and a gleam of cunning creep into he eye nothing crooked about this he breathe softly i have the key to this side of he character you remember i have overhear the night before he statement of he moral scruple i say nothing but look know what be it he murmur plain desertion or something worse i remain inscrutable well he concede i do need a mate and a naval man -- even if he be wantin ' to get out of sight -- he will not spit on you deck anyway i break in boldly captain selover 's hairy face bristle about the mouth this i subsequently discover be symptom of a grin you see that eh he treble be not you afraid he 'll bring down the police and delay you sailing i ask he grin again with a cunning twinkle in he eye you need not worry there be not goin ' to be any police he have he advance money and he will not risk it by tryin ' to come back we come to a agreement i profess surprise at the wages the captain guardedly explain that the expedition be secret what be we port i ask to test he we papers be make out for honolulu he reply we adjourn to sign article by the way say i i wish you would not make they out in my own name ` eagen ' will do all right he laugh i _ sabe _ eagen it be i 'll be aboard at six say i i have get to make some arrangement wish you could help with the lading say he still i can get along want any advance money no i reply then i remember that i be suppose to be break yes i amend he give I ten dollar i guess you 'll show up he say would not do this to everybody but a naval man -- even if he be dodgin ' uncle sam -- i 'll be here i assure he at that time i wear a pointed beard this i shave also i be accustom to use eye-glass the trouble be merely a slight astigmatism which bother I only in reading or close inspection i could get along perfectly well without the glass so i discard they i have my hair cut rather close when i have put on sea boot blue trousers and shirt a pea jacket and a cap i feel quite safe from the recognition of a man like dr schermerhorn in fact as you shall see i hardly speak to he during all the voyage out promptly at six then i return with a sea chest bind i know not whither to be go i know not for how long and pledge to act as second officer on a little hundred-and-fifty-ton schooner ii the graven image i have every reason to be satisfy with my disguise -- if such it could be call captain selover at first fail to recognize I then he burst into he shrill cackle do not know you he treble but you look shipshape come i 'll show you you quarter immediately i discover what i have suspect before that on so small a schooner the mate take rank with the man rather than the afterguard cabin accommodation be of course very limited my own lurk in the waist of the ship -- a tiny little airless hole here 's where johnson stay proffer selover you can bunk here or you can go in the foc ` sle with the man they be more room there we 'll get under way with the turn of the tide he leave I i examine the cabin it be just a trifle larger than its single berth and the berth be just a trifle larger than myself my chest would have to be leave outside i strongly suspect that my lung would have to be leave outside also for the life of I i could not see where the air be to come from with a mental reservation in favor of investigate the forecastle i go on deck the _ laugh lass _ be one of the prettiest little schooner i ever saw be it not for the line of she bilge and the internal arrangement of she hold it might be imagine she have be build originally as a pleasure yacht even the rake of she mast a little forward of the plumb bear out this impression which a comparatively new suit of canvas well stop down brass stanchion forward and two little gun under tarpaulin almost confirm one thing strike I as peculiar she complement of boat be ample enough she have two surf boat a dingy and a dory sling to the davit in addition another dory -- the one you pick I up in -- be lash to the top of the deck house they would mighty near have a boat apiece i think and go forward just outside the forecastle hatch i pause someone below be singing in a voice singularly rich in quality the word and the quaintness of the minor air strike I immensely and have cling to my memory like a burr ever since ` be you a man-o ' - war or a privateer ' say he _ blow high blow low what care we _ ` oh i be a jolly pirate and i be sail for my fee ' _ down on the coast of the high barbare-e-e _ i step to the companion the voice at once cease i descend a glimmer of late afternoon struggle through the deadlight i find myself in a really commodious space -- extend far back of where the forward bulk-head be usually place -- accommodate row and row of bunk -- eighteen of they in fact the unlighted lamp cast its shadow on wood stain black by much use but polish like ebony from the continue friction of man 's garment i wish i could convey to you the uncanny effect this -- of drop from the deck of a miniature craft to the internal arrangement of a square-rigged ship it be as though enter a cottage door you be to discover yourself on the floor of madison square garden a fresh sweet breeze of evening suck down the hatch i immediately decide on the forecastle already it be be bear in on I that i be little more than a glorified bo 's 'n' s mate the situation suit I however it enable I to watch the course of event more safely less expose to the danger of recognition i stand for a moment at the foot of the companion accustom my eye to the gloom after a moment with a shock of surprise i make out a shine pair of bead-point gaze at I unblinkingly from the shadow under the bitt slowly the man define himself as a shape take form in a fog he be lean forward in a attitude of attention he elbow rest on he knee he forearm depend between they he head thrust out i could detect no faintest movement of eyelash no faintest sound of breathe the stillness be portentous the creature be exactly like a wax figure one of the sort you meet in corridor of cheap museum and for a moment mistake for live being almost i think to make out the customary gray dust lie on the wax of he feature i be go to tell you more of this man because as you shall see he be destine to have much to do with my life the fate of dr karl augustus schermerhorn and the doom of the _ laugh lass _ he wear on he head a red bandana handkerchief i never see he with other cover from beneath it straggle oily and tangled lock of glossy black he face be long narrow hook-nosed and sinister he eye as i have describe they a steady and beady black i could at first glance ascribe great activity but only moderate strength to he slender wiry figure in this i be mistaken he sheer physical power be second only to that of captain selover one of he forearm end in a steel hook at the moment i could not understand this could not see how a man so maim could be useful aboard a ship later i wish we have more as handy he know a jam hitch which he catch over and under he hook quicker than most man can grasp a line with the naked hand it would render one way but hold fast the other he tell I it be a cinch-hook hitch employ by mule packer in the mountain and that he have use it on swamp-hook in the lumber wood of michigan i should not wonder he be a wander jew -- he name be anderson but i never hear he call that it be always handy solomon with man and master we stare at each other i fascinate by something some spell of the ship which i have never be able to explain to myself -- nor even describe it be a mystery a portent a premonition such as overtake a man sometimes in the dark passageway of life i can not tell you of it nor make you believe -- let it pass -- then by a slow process of successive perception i become aware that i be watch by other eye other wax figure other human being with unwavering gaze they seem to the sense of mystic apprehension that for the moment hold possession of I to be everywhere -- in the bunk on the floor back in the shadow watch watch watch from the advantage of another world -lrb- illustration : slowly the man define himself as a shape take form in a fog -rrb- i do not know why i tell you this why i lay so much stress on the first weird impression i get of the forecastle it mean something to I now -- in view of all that happen subsequently almost can i look back and see in that moment of occultism a warn a enlightenment -- but the point be it mean something to I then i stand there fascinate unable to move unable to speak then the grotesque figure in the corner stir well mate say the man believe or not believe it be in the book and it stand to reason too we have gold mine here in californy and nevada and all they state and we hear of gold mine in mexico and australium too but do you ever hear tell of gold mine in europe tell I that and where do the gold come from then before they discover america tell I that why they make it just as the man that write this-here say and you can kiss the book on that how about that place ophir i read about ask a voice from the bunk the man shoot a keen glance thither from beneath he brow know last year 's output from the mine of ophir thrackle he inquire in silky tone why no stammer the man address as thrackle well i do pursue the man with the steel hook and it be just the whole of nothing and you can kiss the book on that too there be not any gold output because there be not any mine and there never have be they make they gold he toss aside a book he have be hold in he left hand i recognize the fat little paper duodecimo with amusement and some wonder the only other copy i have ever lay my eye on be in the astor library it be somewhat of a rarity call _ the secret of alchemy or the grand doctrine of transmutation fully explain _ and be write by a dr edward duvall -- a most extraordinary volume to have fall into the hand of seaman i step forward greet and be greet besides the man i have mention they be four the cook be a bullet-headed squat negro with a broken nose i believe he have a name -- robinson or something of that sort he be to all of we simply the nigger unlike most of he race he be gloomy and taciturn of the other two a little white-faced thin-chested youth name pulz and a villainous-looking mexican call perdosa i shall have more to say later my arrival break the talk on alchemy it resume its course in the direction of we voyage each discover that the other know nothing and each blunder against the astounding fact of double wages all i know be the pay 's good and that be enough conclude thrackle from a bunk the pay 's too good growl handy solomon this be not no job to go look at the ` clipse of the moon or the devil 's a preacher w ` at you maik heem den query perdosa it be treasure of course say handy solomon shortly he he he laugh the negro without mirth what be the matter with you doctor demand thrackle treasure repeat the nigger you see dat box he do carry so cairful you see dat a pause ensue somebody scratch a match and light a pipe no i do not see that break out thrackle finally with some impatience i _ sabe _ how a man go after treasure with a box but why should he take treasure away in a box what do you think bucko he suddenly appeal to I i look up from my investigation of the empty berth i do not think much about it i reply except that by the look of the store we be due for more than honolulu and from the look of the light we would better turn to on deck a embarrassed pause fall who be you anyway bluntly demand the man with the steel hook my name be eagen i reply i have the berth of mate which of these bunk be empty they indicate what i desire with just a trace of sullenness i understand well enough they resentment at have a ship 's officer quarter on they -- the forec ` stle they consider as they only liberty when at sea and my presence as a curtailment to the freedom of speech i subsequently do my best to overcome this feeling but never quite succeed at my command the nigger go to he galley i ascend to the deck dusk be fall in the swift californian fashion already the outline of the wharf house be grow indistinct and the light of the city be begin to twinkle captain selover come to my side and lean over the rail peer critically at the black water against the pile she be at the flood he squeak and here come the lucy belle the tug take we in charge and puff with we down the harbor and through the golden gate we have sweat the canvas on she even to the fly jib and a huge club topsail she sometimes carry at the main for the afternoon trade have lose they strength about midnight we draw up on the farallone the schooner handle well we crew be divide into three watch -- a unusual arrangement but comfortable two man could sail she handily in most sort of weather handy solomon have the wheel otherwise the deck be empty the man 's fantastic headgear the fringe of he curl oily lock the hawk outline of he face momentarily silhouette against the phosphorescence astern as he glance to windward all lend he a appearance of another day i could almost imagine i catch the gleam of silver-butted horse pistol and cutlass at he waist i brooded in wonder at what i have see and how little i have explain the number of boat sufficient for a craft of three time the tonnage the capacity of the forec ` stle with its eighteen bunk enough for a passenger ship -- what do it mean and this wild unkempt villainous crew with its master and he almost ridiculous contrast of neatness and filth -- do dr schermerhorn realize to what he have trust himself and he precious expedition whatever it might be the light of shore have sink the _ laugh lass _ stagger and leap joyously with the glory of the open sea she seem alone on the bosom of the ocean and for the life of I i could not but feel that i be embark on some desperate adventure the notion be utterly illogical that i know well in sober thought i a reporter be shadow a respectable and venerable scientist who in turn be probably about to investigate at length some little-known deep-sea condition or phenomenon of a unexplored island but that do not suffice to my imagination the ship its surroundings its equipment its crew -- all read fantastic so much the better story i think shrug my shoulder at last iii the twelve repeat rifle after my watch below the next morning i meet percy darrow in many way he be or be the most extraordinary of my many acquaintance during that first half hour 's chat with he i change my mind at least a dozen time one moment i think he clever the next a utter ass now i find he frank open a good companion eager to please -- and then a droop of he blond eyelash a lazy impertinent drawl of he voice a hint of half-bored condescension in he manner convinced I that he be shy and affect in a breath i appraise he as intellectual a fool a shallow mind a deep schemer a idler and a enthusiast one result of he spasmodic confidence be to throw a doubt upon they accuracy this might be what he desire or with equal probability it might be the chance reflection of a childish and aimless amiability he be tall and slender and pale languid of movement languid of eye languid of speech he eye droop half-closed beneath blond brow a long wiry hand lazily twist a rather affect blond moustache he voice drawl he speech in a manner either insufferably condescending and impertinent or ineffably tired -- who could tell which i find he lean against the taffrail he languid graceful figure support by he elbow he chin prop against he hand as i approach the binnacle he raise he eye and motion I to he the insolence of it be so superb that for a moment i be angry enough to ignore he then i reflect that i be here not to stand on my personal dignity but to get information i join he you be the mate he drawl since i be on the quarter-deck i snap back at he he eye I thoughtfully while he roll with one hand a corn-husk mexican cigarette do you know where you be go he inquire at length depend on the moral character of my future action i rejoin tartly he allow a smile to break and fade then light he cigarette the first mate seem to have a remarkable command of language say he i do not reply well to tell you the truth i do not know where we be go he continue think you might be able to inform I where do this ship and its precious gang of cutthroat come from anyway mean I oh mean you too for all i know he shrug wearily suddenly he turn to I and lay he hand on my shoulder with one of those sudden burst of confidence i come later to recognize and look for but in which i could never quite believe -- nor disbelieve i be eat with curiosity he state in the least curious voice in the world i suppose you know who he nib be dr schermerhorn do you mean yes well i have be with he ten year i be he right-hand man all he business i transact down to the last penny i even order he meal he discovery have take shape in my hand suddenly he get a freak he will go on a voyage where i shall know in good time for how long i shall know in good time for what purpose same answer what accommodation shall i engage i experience the worst shock of my life -- he will engage they himself what scientific apparatus shock number two -- he will attend to that be there anything i can do what do you suppose he say how should i know i ask you should know in the course of intelligent conversation with I he drawl well he good old staid schermie with the vertebrated thought get kittenish he say to I ` joost imachin percy you be all-alone-on-a-desert-island place and that you will sit on those sand and wish within yourself all you would buy to be comfortable go out and buy I those thing -- in abundance ' those be my direction he puff what do he pay you he ask enough i reply more than enough by a good deal i 'll bet he rejoin the old fool he ought to have leave it to I what be this craft have you ever sail on she before no have any of the crew i reply that i believe all of they be selover 's man he throw the cigarette butt into the sea and turn back well i wish you joy of you double wages he mock so he know that after all how much more of he ignorance be pretended i have no means of guess he eye gleam sarcastically as he saunter toward the companion-way handy solomon be at the wheel steer easily with one foot and a elbow he steel hook lay fully expose glittering in the sunlight darrow glance at it curiously and at the man 's headgear well my genial pirate he drawl if you have a line to fit that hook you would be equip for fish the man 's tooth bare like a animal 's but darrow go on easily as though unconscious of give offence if i be you i would have it arrange so the hook would turn backward as well as forward it would be handier for some thing -- fight for instance he pass on down the companion handy solomon glare after he then down at he hook he bent he arm this way and that draw the hook toward he softly as a cat do she claw he eye clear and a look of admiration creep into they by god he be right he mutter and after a moment i have wear that ten year and never think of it the little son of a gun he remain stare for a moment at the hook then he look up and catch my eye he own turn quizzical he shift he quid and begin to hum : the bo 'n lay aloft aloft lay he _ blow high blow low what care we _ ` there be a ship upon the wind ` ard a wreck upon the lee ' _ down on the coast of the high barbare-e-e _ we have enter the trade and be make good time i be content to stay on deck even in my watch below the wind be strong the wave dash the sky very blue from under we forefoot the fly fish speed the monster pursue they a tingle of spray be in the air it be all very pleasant the red handkerchief around solomon 's head make a pretty spot of color against the blue of the sky and the darker blue of the sea silhouette over the flaw-less white of the deck house be the sullen polished profile of the nigger beneath I the ship swerve and leap yield and recover i breathe deep and see cutlass in harmless shadow it be two year ago i be young -- then -- at the mess hour i stand in doubt however i be inform by the captain 's falsetto that i be to eat in the cabin as the only other officer i eat alone after the other have finish help myself from the dish leave on the table it be a handsome cabin well keep with white woodwork spotlessly clean leather cushion -- much better than one would expect i afterwards find that the neatness of this cabin and of the three stateroom be maintain by the nigger -- at peril of he neck a rack hold a dozen rifle five revolver and -- at last -- my cutlass i examine the lot with interest they be modern weapon -- the new high power 30-40 box-magazine rifle shooting government ammunition -- and have be use the revolver be of course the old 45 colt be this be a extraordinary armament for a peaceable schooner of one hundred and fifty ton burden the rest of the cabin 's fitting be not remarkable by the configuration of the ship i guess that two of the stateroom must be rather large i could make out voice within on deck i talk with captain selover she be a snug craft i approach he he nod you have arm she well he mutter something of pirate and the china sea i laugh you have arm enough to give you crew about two magazine rifle apiece -- unless you fill all you berth forward captain selover look I direct in the eye talk straight mr eagen say he what be this ship and where be she bind i ask with equal simplicity he consider as for the ship he reply at length i do not mind say you be my first officer and on you i depend if it come to -- well the small arm below if the ship 's a little under the shade why so be you she be by way of be call a manner of hard name by some people i do not see it myself it be a matter of conscience if you would ask some interested they would call she a smuggler a thief a wrecker and all the other evil title in the catalogue she have take in chink by way of santa cruz island -- if that be smuggling the country be free and a chink be a man besides it pay ten dollar a head for the landing she have carry in a cargo or so of junk it be lie on the beach where a fool master have pile it and i take what i find i could not keep track of the underwriter ' intention but the room forward -- i break in well you see last season we be pearl fishing but you need only you diver and you crew i object there be the matter of a japanese gunboat or so he explain poach i cry so some call it the shell be there the island be not inhabit i do not see how man claim property beyond the tide water i have hear it argue -- hold on i cry there be a trouble last year in the ishigakus jima island where a poacher beat off the _ oyama _ it be a desperate fight captain selover 's eye light up i have command a black brigantine name of _ the petrel _ he admit simply she be a brigantine aloft but _ alow _ she have much the same line as the _ laugh lass _ he whirl on he heel to roll to one of the covered yacht 's cannon look like a harmless little toy to burn black powder do not she he remark he strip off the tarpaulin and the false brass muzzle to display as pretty a little maxim as you would care to see now you know all about it he say look here captain selover i demand do not you know that i could blow you whole shooting-match higher than gilderoy 's kite how do you know i will not do it when i get back how do you know i will not inform the doctor at once what kind of a outfit he have tie to he plant far apart he thick leg in they soil blue trousers push back he greasy linen boat hat and stare at I with some amusement how do you know i will not blow on lieutenant or ensign ralph slade usn when i get back he demand i bless that illusion anyway besides i know my man you will not do anything of the sort he walk to the rail and spat carefully over the side as for the doctor he go on he know all about it he tell I all about myself and everything i have ever do from the time i would lick buck jone until last season 's little diversion then he tell I that be why he want I to ship for this cruise the captain eye I quizzically i throw out my hand in a comic gesture of surrender well where be we bind anyway the dirty unkempt dishevelled figure stiffen mr eagen its falsetto shrill you be mate of this vessel you duty be to see that my order as to sailing be carry out beyond that you do not go as to navigation and latitude and longitude and where the hell we be that be outside you line of duty as to where we be bind you be get double wages not to get too damn curious remember to earn you wages mr eagen he turn away to the binnacle in spite of he personal filth in spite of the lawless almost piratical character of the man in that moment i could not but admire he if percy darrow be ignorant of the purpose of this expedition how much more so captain selover yet he accept he trust blindly and as far as i could then see intend to fulfil it faithfully i like he none the worse for snub I it indicate a streak in he moral nature akin to and quite as curious as he excessive neatness regard he immediate surroundings iv the steel claw during the next few day the crew discuss we destination discipline while maintained strictly be not conventional during the dog watch often every man aboard would be below for at that period captain selover love to take the wheel in person a thick cigar between he lip the dingy check shirt wide open to expose he hairy chest to the breeze in the twilight of the forecastle we have some great sea-lawyer 's talk -- i say we though i take little part in they generally i lay across my bunk smoking my pipe while handy solomon hold forth he speech punctuate by surly speculation from the nigger with hesitate deep-sea wisdom from the hairy thrackle or with voluminous burst of fractured english from perdosa pulz have nothing to offer but watch from he pale green eye the light shift and waver from one to the other as the ship sway : garment swing the empty berth yawn cavernous i could imagine the forecastle fill with the desperate man who have beat off the _ oyama _ the story be tell that they have sweep the gunboat 's deck with she own rapid-fire turn in no one know where we be go nor why the doctor puzzle they and the quantity of he belongings it be not pearl say handy solomon you can kiss the book on that for we be not a diver among we it be not chink for we be cruise sou ' - sou ' - west likely it be trade -- trade down in the island we be all below the captain himself have the wheel discipline while strict be not conventional contrabandista mutter the mexican for dat he geev we double pay we do not get she for nothing agree thrackle double pay and duff on Wednesday generally mean get you head break no trade say the nigger gloomily they turn to he with one accord why not demand pulz break he silence no trade repeat the nigger be not you get a reason doctor ask handy solomon no trade insist the nigger a uneasy silence fall i could not but observe that the other hold the nigger 's statement in a respect not due they as mere opinion subsequently i understand a little more of the reputation he possess he be believe to see thing hide as they phrase go nobody say anything for some time nobody stir except that handy solomon he steel claw remove from its socket whittle and test screw and turn try to fix the hook so that in accordance with the advice of percy darrow it would turn either way what be it then doctor he ask softly at last gold say the nigger shortly gold -- treasure that be what i say at first cry handy solomon triumphantly it be extraordinary the unquestioning and entire faith with which they accept as gospel fact the negro 's dictum there follow much talk of the nature of this treasure whether it be to be seek or convey buy steal or ravish in fair fight no further soothsaying could they elicit from the nigger they follow they own idea which lead they nowhere someone light the forecastle lamp they settle themselves pulz read aloud this be the program every day during the dog watch sometimes the watch on deck be absent leave only handy solomon the nigger and pulz but the order of the day be not on that account vary they talk they light the lamp they read always the talk be of the treasure as to the reading it be of the sort usual to seamen cowboy lumberman and miner thrackle have a number of volume of very cheap love story pulz have bring some extraordinary garish detective story the other contribute sensational literature with paper cover adorn lithographically by the usual incongruity a fragment of _ the marble faun _ be include in the collection the nigger have he copy of _ duvall on alchemy _ i have not the slightest idea where he could have get it while pulz read handy solomon work on the alteration of he claw he could never get it to hold and i remember as a undertone to pulz 's read the rumble of strange exasperated oath whatever the evening 's lecture it always end with the book on alchemy these man have no perspective by which to judge such thing they accept its speculation and theory at they face value extremely laughable be the discussion that follow i often wish the shade of old duvall could be permit to see these he last disciple spell out dimly he teaching mispronounce he grave utterance but believe utterly dr schermerhorn appear on deck seldom when he do often he finger hold a pen which he have forget to lay aside i imagine he preoccupy by some calculation of he own but the forecastle more picturesquely see he as guard constantly the heavy casket he have himself carry aboard he breathe the air walk briskly turn with the german military precision at the end of he score of stride and re-enter he cabin at the lapse of the half hour after he have go remain percy darrow lean indolently against the taffrail he graceful figure sway with the ship 's motion smoking always the corn-husk mexican cigarette which he roll with one hand he seem from that farthest point aft to hold in review the appliance the fabric the action yes even the very thought of the entire ship from they he select that on which he should comment or with which he should play always with a sardonic half-serious quite wearied and indifferent manner he inner knowledge view by the light of this manner or mannerism be sometimes uncanny though perhaps the source of he information be commonplace enough after all certainly he always view with amusement he victim 's wonder thus one evening at the close of we day-watch on deck he approach handy solomon it be at the end of ten day on no one of which have the seaman fail to tinker away at he steel claw darrow balance in front of he with a thin smile too bad it do not work my amiable pirate say he it would be so handy for fight -- see here he suddenly continue pull some object from he pocket here be a pipe present to I i do not smoke 'em twist she halfway like that she come out twist she halfway like this she go in that be you principle give she back to I when you get through he thrust the briar pipe into the man 's hand and turn away without wait for a reply the seaman look after he in open amazement that evening he work on the socket of the steel hook and in two day he have the job finish then he return the pipe to darrow with some growling of thanks that be all right say the young man smile full at he now what be you go to fight v the philosopher 's stone captain selover receive as he due the most absolute and implicit obedience imaginable when he condescend to give a order in he own person the man fairly jump to execute it the matter have evidently be thresh out long ago they do not love he not they but they fear he with a mighty fear and do not hesitate to say so vividly and often when in the privacy of the forecastle the prevail spirit be that of the wild beast cow but snarl still pulz and thrackle in especial have a great deal to say of what they be or be not go to do but i notice that they resolution always begin to run out of they when first foot be set to the companion ladder one day we be loaf along everything draw well and everybody but the doctor on deck to enjoy the sun i be in the crow 's - nest for my pleasure below I on the deck captain selover roam here and there as be he custom he eye cock out like a housewife 's for disorder he find it again in the evidence of expectoration and as perdosa happen to be handiest fall on the unfortunate mexican perdosa protest that he have have nothing to do with it but captain selover enrage as always when he precious deck be soil would not listen finally the mexican grow sulky and turn away as though refuse to hear more the captain thereupon fell he to the deck and begin brutally to kick he in the face and head perdosa writhe and beg but without avail the other member of the crew gather near after a moment they begin to murmur finally thrackle venture most respectfully to intervene you 'll kill he sir he interpose he be have enough have enough have he screech the captain well you take what be leave he mark thrackle heavily over the eye there be a breathless pause and then thrackle pulz the nigger and perdosa attack at once they catch the master unaware and bear he to the deck i drop at once to the ratlin and commence my descent before i have reach the deck however selover be afoot again the four hang to he like dog in a moment more he have shake they off and before i could intervene he have seize a belay pin in either hand and be haze they up and down the deck mutiny would you he shrill you poor swab forget who be you captain do ye well it be captain ezra selover and you can lay to that it would need about eight fathom of _ stuff _ like you to tie I down he chase they forward and he chase they aft and every time the pin fall blood follow finally they dive like rabbit into the forecastle hatch captain selover lean down after they now tie yourselve up he advise and then come on deck and clean up after yourselve he turn to I mr eagen turn out the crew to clean deck i descend to the forecastle follow immediately by handy solomon the latter have take no part in the affair we find the man in horrible shape what with the bruise and cut and bleed freely now you be a nice-looking Sunday school observe handy soloman eye they sardonically tackel old scrub will ye well some need a bale of cotton to fall on 'em afore they learn anything enjoy you little diversion mate and w ` at do you expect to gain i ask you that now you poor little infant be not you never tackle he afore do not remember a little brigatine name of the _ petrel _ my eye but you _ be _ a pack of damn fool to this he receive no reply the man sullenly assist each other then they go immediately on deck and to work after this taste of he quality captain selover enjoy a quiet ship we make good time but for a long while nothing happen finally the monotony be break by a incident one evening before the night wind i sit in the shadow of the extra dory on top of the deck house the moon be but just beyond the full so i suppose i must have be practically invisible certainly the nigger do not know of my presence for he come and stand within three foot of I without give any sign the companion be open in a moment some door below be open also and a scrap of conversation come up to we very clearly you haf dem finish the doctor 's voice inquire so that iss well -- papers rustle for a few moment and the r-result -- ah -- exactly -- it iss that exactly percy mein son that maig the experiment exact we haf the process -- i do not see sir quite reply the voice of percy darrow with a tinge of excitement i can follow the logic of the experiment of course -- so can i follow the logic of a trip to the moon but when you come to apply it -- how do you get you re-agent there be no known method -- dr schermerhorn break in : ach it iss that i haf perfect pardon I my boy it iss the first i haf work from you apart it iss for a surprise i haf make in small quantity the missing ingredient it will form a perfect interruption to the current now we go -- do you mean to say almost shout darrow that you have succeed in free it in the metal yes reply the doctor simply i could hear a chair overturn why with that you can -- i can do everything break in the doctor the possibility be enormous and you can really produce it in quantity i think so it iss for we to discover a pause ensue why come the voice of percy darrow awestricken with fifty centigramme only you could -- you could transmute any substance -- why you could make anything you please almost you could make enough diamond to fill that chest it be the philosopher 's stone diamond -- yes -- it be possible interrupted the doctor impatiently if it be worth while but you should see the real importance -- the ship careen to a chance swell a door slam the voice be cut off i look up the nigger 's head be thrust forward fairly into the glow from the companionway the mask of he sullenness have fall he eye fairly roll in excitement he thick lip be draw back to expose he tooth he powerful figure be gather with the tensity of a bow when the door slam he turn silently to glide away at that instant the watch be change and in a moment i find myself in my bunk ten seconds later the nigger detain by captain selover for some trifling duty burst into the forecastle he be possess by the wildest excitement this in itself be enough to gain the attention of the man but he first word be startling i find de treasure he almost shout i know where he keep they leap at he -- handy solomon and pulz -- and fairly shake out of he what he think he know he babble in the forget term of alchemy dress modern fact in the garment of mediaeval thought until they be scarcely to be recognize and so he say dat he fine he de philosopher stone and he keep he in dat heavy box we see he carry aboard and he don ' have to make gol ' with it -- he can make diamon 's -- _ diamon 's _ -- he say it too easy to fill dat box plum full of diamon 's they gesticulate and exclaim and breathe hard full of the marvel of such a thought then abruptly the clamor die to nothing i feel six eye bent on I six unwinking eye move restless in motionless figure suspicious deadly as cobra -- up to now my standing with the man have be well enough now they draw frankly apart one of the most significant indication of this be the increase respect they pay my office it be as though by prompt obedience instant deference and the emphasising of ship 's etiquette they intend to draw sharply the line between themselves and I there be much whispering apart many private talk and consultation in which i have no part ordinarily they talk freely enough before I even the reading during the dog watch be intermit -- at least it be on such day as i happen to be in the watch below but twice i catch the nigger and handy solomon consulting together over the volume on alchemy i be in two mind whether to report the whole matter to captain selover the only thing that restrain I be the vagueness of the intention and the fact that the afterguard be arm and be four to the crew 's five a incident however decide I one evening i be awaken by a sound of violent voice captain selover occasionally juggle the watch for variety 's sake and i now have handy solomon and perdosa the nigger be cook stand no watch you drunken greaser swab snarl handy solomon you misbegotten son of a yaqui i 'll learn you to step on a seaman 's foot and you can kiss the book on that i 'll cut you heart out and feed it to the shark potha sneer perdosa you cut heem you finger wid you knife they wrangle at first i think the quarrel genuine but after a moment or so i could not avoid a sort of reminiscent impression of the cheap melodrama it seem incredible but soon i could not dodge the conclusion that it be a made-up quarrel design to impress I why should they desire to do so i have to give it up but the fact itself be obvious enough i laugh to see they the affair do not come to blow but it do come to black look on meeting mutter oath growl of enmity every time they happen to pass each other on the deck perdosa be not so bad he mexican blood incline he to the histrionic and he mexican cast lend itself well to evil look but handy solomon for the first time in my acquaintance with he be ridiculous about this time we cross into frequent thunder one evening just at dark we make out a heavy black squall not know exactly what weight lay behind it i call up all hand we duck the staysail and foresail lower the peak of the mainsail and wait to feel of it -- a rough and ready seamanship often use in these little californium windjammer i be pretty busy but i hear distinctly handy solomon 's voice behind I i 'll kill you sure you greaser as soon as my hand be free and some muttered reply from the mexican the wind hit we hard hold on a few moment and moderate to a stiff puff there follow the rain so of course i know it would amount to nothing i be just stoop to throw the stop off the staysail when i feel myself seize from behind and force rapidly toward the side of the ship of course i struggle the japanese have a little trick to fool a man who catch you around the waist from behind it be part of the jiu-jitsu teach the samurai -- quite a different proposition from the ordinary policeman jiu-jitsu i pick it up from a friend in the nobility it come in very handy now and by good luck a roll of the ship help I in a moment i stand free and perdosa be pick himself out of the scupper the expression of astonishment be fairly well do -- i will say that for he -- but i be prepare for histrionics señor he gasp eet be you _ sacrosanta marium _ i think you be dat solomon pardon I señor pardon have i hurt you he approach I almost wheedle i could have laugh at the villain it be all so transparent he no more mistake I for handy solomon than he feel any real enmity for that person but be angry and perhaps a little scared i beat he to he quarter with a belay pin on think the matter over however i fail to see all the in and out of it i could understand a desire to get rid of I there would be one less of the afterguard and then too i know too much of the man 's sentiment if not of they plan but why all this elaborate farce of the mock quarrel and the alleged mistake could it be to guard against possible failure i could hardly think it worth while my only theory be that they have wish to test my strength and determination the whole affair even on that supposition be childish enough but i refer the exaggerated cunning to handy solomon and consider it quite adequately explain it be a minor point but subsequently i learn that this surmise be correct i be to be save because none of the conspirator understand navigation the next morning i approach captain selover captain say i i think it my duty to report that there be trouble brewing among the crew there always be he reply unmoved but this be serious dr schermerhorn come aboard with a chest which the man think hold treasure the other evening robinson overhear he tell he assistant that he could easily fill the box with diamond of course he be merely illustrate the value of some scientific experiment but robinson think and have make the other think that the chest contain something to make diamond with i be sure they intend to get hold of it the affair be come to a head captain selover listen almost indifferently i come back from the island last year he pipe with three hundred thousand dollar ' worth of pearl there be sixteen in the crew and every man of they be blood hungry for they pearl they have three or four shindy and kill one man over the proper way to divide the loot after they have get it they do not get it why he draw he powerful figure to its height and spread he thick arm out in the luxury of stretch why he repeat exhale abruptly because they captain be ezra selover well mr eagen he go on crisply captain ezra selover be they captain _ and they know it _ they 'll talk and palaver and git into dark corner and sharpen they knife and perhaps fight it out as to which one be go to work the monkey-doodle business in the doctor 's chest and which one be go to tie up the sack of they diamond but they will not git any farther as long as captain ezra be on deck yes i object but they mean business last night in the squall one of they try to throw I overboard captain selover grin what do you do he ask haze he to he quarter with a belay pin well that be all settle then be not it what more do you want i stand undecided i can take care of myself he go on you ought to take care of yourself then there be nothing more to do he muse a moment you have a gun of course he inquire i forget to ask no say i he whistle well no wonder you feel sort of lose and hopeless here take this it 'll make a man of you he give I a colt 's 45 the barrel of which have be file down to about two inch of length it be a most extraordinary weapon but effective at short range here be a few loose cartridge say he now go easy this be no warship and we be not get man to experiment on lick 'em with you fist or a pin if you can and if you do shoot for god 's sake just wing 'em a little they be awful good lad but a little restless i take the gun and feel better with it i could easily handle the member of my own watch and i do not doubt that with the assistance of percy darrow even a surprise would hardly overwhelm we i do not count on dr schermerhorn he be quite capable of lose himself in a problem of trajectory after the first shot vi the island i come on deck one morning at about four bell to find the entire ship 's company afoot even the doctor be there everybody be gaze eagerly at a narrow mountainous island lie slate-coloured across the early morning we be as yet some twenty mile distant from it and could make out nothing but its general outline the latter be sharply define rise and fall to a highest point one side of the middle over the island and raggedly clasp its side hang a cloud the only one visible in the sky i join the afterguard you see the doctor be exclaim it iss as i haf say the island iss there everything iss as it should be he be quite excited percy darrow too be shake out of he ordinary calm the volcano be active be he only comment but it explain the ragged cloud you say there be a harbor inquire captain selover it should be on the west end say dr schermerhorn captain selover draw I one side he too be a little arouse now would not that get you he squeak doctor run up against a norwegian bum who tell he about a volcanic island and give its bearing the island be not on the map at all doctor believe it and make I lay my course for those bearing _ and here be the island _ so the bum 's story be true i would like to know what the rest of it be he eye be shine do we anchor or stand off and on i ask captain selover turn to grip I by the shoulder i have order from darrow to get to a good berth to land to build shore quarter and to snug down for a stay of a year at least we stare at each other joyous prospect i muttered hope there be something to do there the morning wear and we rapidly approach the island it prove to be utterly precipitous the high rounded hill slope easily to within a hundred foot or so of the water and then fall away abruptly where the earth end be a fantastic filigree border like the fancy paper with which we mother use to line the pantry shelf below the white surge fling themselves against the cliff with a wild abandon thousand of sea bird wheel in the eddy of the wind thousand of raven perch on the slope with we glass we could make out the head of seal fishing outside the surf and a ragged belt of kelp when within a mile we put the helm up and run for the west end a bold point we avoid far out lest there should be outlying ledge then we come in sight of a broad beach and pound surf i be order to take a surf boat and investigate for a landing and a anchorage the swell be run high we row back and forth puzzle as to how to get ashore with all the freight it would be necessary to land the ship would lie well enough for the only open exposure be break by a long reef over which we could make out the sea tumble but inshore the great wave roll smoothly swiftly -- then suddenly fall forward as over a ledge and spread with a roar across the yellow sand the fresh wind blow the spume back to we we converse in shout we can surf the boat yell thrackle but we can not land a load that be my opinion we row slowly along parallel to the shore and just outside the line of breaker i do not know exactly how to tell you the manner in which we become aware of the cove it be as nearly the instantaneous as can be imagine one minute i look ahead on a cliff as unbroken as the side of a cabin the very next i peer down the length of a cove fifty fathom long by about ten wide at the end of which be a gravel beach i cry out sharply to the man they be quite as much astonished as i we back water watch closely at a give point the cove and all trace of its entrance disappear we could only just make out the line where the headland dissolve into the background of the cliff and that merely because we know of its existence the blending be perfect we row in the water be still a faint ebb and flow whisper against the tiny gravel beach at the end i note a practicable way from it to the top of the cliff and from the cliff down again to the sand beach everything be perfect the water be a beautiful light green like semi-opaque glass and from the indistinctness of its depths wave and beckon rose and disappear with indescribable grace and deliberation long feathery sea growth in a moment the bottom abruptly shallow the motion of the boat toward the beach permit we to catch a hasty glimpse of little fish darting of big fish turning of yellow sand and some vivid color then come the grate of gravel and the scrape of the boat 's bottom on the beach we jump ashore eagerly i leave the man very reluctant and ascend a natural trail to a high slope down over which blow the great trade grass spring knee-high a low hill rise at the back from below the fall of the cliff come the pound of surf i walk to the edge various ledge slope toward I run down to the sea against one of they be a wreck not so very old head on she afterwork go i recognize the name _ golden horn _ and be vastly astonished to find she here against this unknown island far up the coast i could see -- with the surge dash up like the explosion of shell and the cliff and the rampart of hill grow with grass and cactus a bold promontory terminate the coast view to the north and behind it i could glimpse a more fertile and wooded country the sky be partly overcast by the volcanic murk it flee before the trade and the red sun alternately blaze and cloud through it as there be nothing more to be see here i turn above the hollow of we cove skirt the base of the hill and so down to the beach it occupy a wide semicircle where the hill draw back the flat be dry and grow with thick coarse grass a stream emerge from a sort of canon on its landward side i taste it find it sulphurous and a trifle worse than lukewarm a little nearer the cliff however be a clear cold spring from the rock and of this i have a satisfying drink when i arise from my knee i make out a animal on the hill crest look at I but before i could distinguish its characteristic it have disappear i return along the tide sand the surf dash and roar lifting seaweed of a blood red so that in place the water look pink seal innumerable watch I from just outside the breaker as the wave lift to a semi-transparence i could make out other play dart back and forth up and down like disturbed tadpole cling to the wave until the very instant of its fall then disappear as though blot out the salt smell of seaweed be in my nostril : i find the place pleasant -- with these few and scattered impression we return to the ship it have be warped to a secure anchorage and snug down dr schermerhorn and darrow be on deck wait to go ashore i make my report the two passenger disappear they carry lunch and would not be back until night-fall we have order to pitch a large tent at a suitable spot and to lighten ship of the doctor 's personal and scientific effect by the time this be accomplish the two have return it be all right darrow volunteer to captain selover as he come over the side we have find what we want they clothes be pick by brush and they boot muddy next morning captain selover detail I to especial work you 'll take two of the man and go ashore under darrow 's order say he darrow tell we to take clothes for a week a axe apiece and a block and tackle we make up we ditty bag step into one of the surf boat and be row ashore there darrow at once take the lead we way proceed across the grass flat through the opening of the narrow cañon and so on back into the interior by way of the bed through which flow the sulphur stream the country be badly erode most of the time we march between perpendicular clay bank about forty foot high these be occasionally break by smaller tributary arroyo of the same sort it would have be impossible to reach the level of the upper country the bed of the main arroyo be flat and grow with grass and herbage of a extraordinary vividness due i suppose to the sulphur water the stream itself meander aimlessly through the broader bed it steadily grow warmer and the sulphur smell more noticeable above we we could see the sky and the sharp clay edge of the arroyo i notice the track of darrow and dr schermerhorn make the day before after a mile of this the bottom run up nearly to the level of the side and we step out on the floor of a little valley almost surround by more hill it be a extraordinary place and since much happen there i must give you a idea of it it be round and nearly encircle by naked paint hill from its floor come steam and a roar sound the steam blow here and there among the pine on the floor rise to eddy about the naked paint hill at one end we see intermittently a broad ascend cañon -- deep red and blue-black -- end in the cone of a smoking volcano the other seem quite close by the sheer hill in fact the only exit be the route by which we have come for the hill be utterly precipitous i suppose a man might have make he way up the various knob ledge and inequality but it would have require long study and a careful head i myself later work my way a short distance merely to examine the texture of they marvellous color this be at once varied and of great body -- not at all like the smooth glossed color of most rock but soft and rich you have see painter ' palette -- it be just like that pasty and _ fat _ there be red of all shades from a veritable scarlet to a red umber green from sea-green to emerald several kind of blue and a indeterminate purple-mauve the whole effect be splendid and barbaric we stop and gasp as it hit we eye darrow alone be unmoved he lead the way forward and in a instant have disappear behind the veil of steam thrackle and perdosa hang back murmur but at a sharp word from I gather they courage in they two hand and proceed we find that the first veil of steam and a fearful stench of gas proceed from a miniature crater whose edge be heavily encrust with a white salt beyond close under the rise of the hill be another between the two percy darrow have stop and be wait he eye we with he lazy half-quizzical glance as we approach think the place be go to blow up he inquire with a tinge of irony well it be not he turn to I here be where we shall stay for a while you and the man be to cut a number of these pine tree for a house better pick out the little one about three or four inch through : they be easier handle i 'll be back by noon we set to work then in the roar steam valley with the vapor swirl about we sometimes conceal we sometimes half reveal we gigantic again in the utterness of exposure show we dwindle pigmy against the magnitude about we the labor be not difficult by the time darrow return we have a pile of the sapling ready for he next direction he be accompany by the nigger very much terrify very much burden with food and cooking utensil the assistant be lazily relate tale of voodoo a glimmer of mischief in he eye vii captain selover lose he nerve i live in the place for three week we be afoot shortly after daybreak under way by sun-up and at work before the heat begin three of we work on the building and the rest form a pack train carry all sort of thing from the shore to the valley the man grumble fiercely at this but captain selover drive they with slight regard for they opinion or feeling you be get double pay be he only word earn it they certainly earn it during those three week the thing they bring up be astounding besides a lot of scientific apparatus and chest of chemical supplies everything that could possibly be require have be provide by that omniscient young man after we have build a long low structure window be forthcoming shelf table sink faucet forge burner all cut out fitted and ready to put together each with its proper screw nail clamp or pipe ready to we hand when we have finish we have construct as complete a laboratory on a small scale as you could find on a college campus even to the stone pillar down to bed-rock for delicate microscopic experiment and hot and cold water lead from the spring and we be utterly unskilled it be all percy darrow i be toward the last engage in screw on a fixture for the generation of acetelyne gas darrow say i there be one thing you have overlook you forget to bring a cupola and a gilt weather-cock for this concern after the laboratory be complete we put up sleep quarter for the two man with wide porch well screen and a square heavy storeroom by the end of the third week we have quite finished dr schermerhorn have turn with enthusiasm to the unpacking of he chemical apparatus almost immediately at the close of the freight-carrying he have appear lug he precious chest this time suffer the assistance of darrow and have camp on the spot we could not induce he to leave so we put up a tent for he darrow remain with he by way of safety against the man whose measure i believe he have take now that all the work be finish the doctor put in a sudden appearance percy say he now we will have the defense build he drag we with he to the narrow part of the arroyo just before it rise to the level of the valley here we will build the stockade-defence he announce darrow and i stare at each other blankly what for sir inquire the assistant i haf come to be undisturbed announce the doctor with owl-like teutonic gravity and i will not be disturbed darrow nod to I and draw he principal aside they converse earnestly for several minute then the assistant return to I no use he shrug in complete return to he indifferent manner stockade it be better make it of fourteen foot log slant out dig a trench across plant you log three or four foot bind they at the top that be he specification for it go at it but i expostulate what be the _ use _ of it even if the man be dangerous that would just make they think you _ do _ have something to guard i know that order reply percy darrow we build the stockade in a day when it be finish we march to the beach and never save in the three instance of which i shall later tell you do i see the valley again the next day we wash we clothes and move ashore with all we belongings i be not go to have this crew aboard state captain selover positively i be go to clean she he himself stay however we row in construct a hasty fireplace of stone spread we blanket and build a unnecessary fire near the beach clean she grumble thrackle my eye i would rather round the cape growl pulz hopelessly come now it can not be as bad as all that i try to cheer they it can not be more than a week or ten day ' job even if we careen she you do not know what you be talk about say thrackle it be worse than the yellow jack it be six week at least mind when we last ` clean she ' he inquire of handy solomon you can kiss the book on it reply he down by the line in that little swab of a sand island my eye but _ do not _ i remember i sweat my liver white they smoke in silence that be a main queer contrivance of the perfessor 's -- that stockade-like ventured solomon after a little he do not want any intrusion i say these scientific experiment be very delicate quite like he comment non-committally we sleep on the ground that night and next morning under captain selover 's direction we commence the task of lighten the ship he detail the nigger and perdosa for special duty i 'll just see to you shore quarter he squeak you empty she all day long we row back and forth from the ship to the cove landing the contents of the hold these by good fortune we do not have to carry over the neck of land for just above the gravel beach be a wide ledge on which we could pile the store we eat aboard and so have no opportunity of see what captain selover and he man be about until evening then we discover that they have collect and lower to the beach a quantity of stateroom door from the wreck and have trundle the galley stove to the edge where it await we assistance we hitch a cable to it and let it down gently the nigger be immensely please after some experiment he get it to draw and so cook we we supper on it after supper captain selover row himself back to the ship eagen he have say drawing I aside i be go to leave you with they it be better that one of we -- i think as owner i ought to be aboard -- of course sir say i it be the only proper place for you i be glad you think so he rejoin apparently relieved and anyway he cry with a burst of feeling i hate the gritty feeling of it under my foot solid oak 's the only walking for a man he leave I hastily as though a trifle ashamed i think he seem depressed even a little furtive and yet on analysis i could discover nothing definite on which to base such a conclusion it be rather a feeling of difference from the man i have know in my fatigue it seem hardly worth think about the man have roll themselves in they blanket tire with the long day next morning captain selover be ashore early he have quite recover he spirit and offer I a dram of french brandy which i refuse we work hard again again the master return at night to he vessel this time without a word to any of we again the man drug by toil turn in early and sleep like the dead we become entangled in a mesh of day like these during which thing be accomplish but in which be no space for anything but the task impose upon we the man for the most part have little to say por dio eet be too mooch work sigh perdosa once why do not you kick to the old man then sneer thrackle the silence that follow and the sullenness with which perdosa readdress himself to he work be significant enough of captain selover 's past relation with the man and how we do clean she we strip she of every stitch and sliver until she float high a empty hull even she spar and run rig ashore i understand now the crew 's grumble we literally go at she with a nail brush captain selover take charge of we when we have reach this period he and the nigger and perdosa have long since finish the installation of the permanent camp they have build we hut from the wreck collect stateroom door for the side and hatch for the roof huge and solid with iron ring in they the bronze and iron ventilation grating to the door give we glimpse of the coast through fretwork the rich inlaying of wood surround we we set up on a solid rock the galley stove -- with its rail to hold the cooking pot from upset in a sea way in it we burn the débris of the wreck all sort of wood some sweet and aromatic and spicy as a incensed cathedral i have see the nigger boil bean over a blaze of sandal wood fragrant as a eastern shop first we scrub the _ laugh lass _ then we paint she and resize and tar she standing rig resize and reeve she run gear slush she mast finally careen she and scrape and paint she below when we have quite finish we have the anchor chain deal out to we in fathom and scrape pound and polish that these be indeed day full of labor be busy from morning until night we know but little of what be about we we see the open sea and the wave tumble over the reef outside we see the headland and the bow of the bay and the surf with its watch seal and the curve of yellow sand we see the sweep of coast and the downs and the strange hut we have build out of depart magnificence and that be all that constitute we world in the evening sometimes we light a big bonfire sailor fashion just at the edge of the beach there we sit at ease and smoke we pipe in silence too tired to talk even handy solomon 's song be still outside the circle of light be mysterious thing -- strange waving of white hand bending of figure calling of voice rustling of foot we know they for the surf and the wind in the grass : but they be not the less mysterious for that logically captain selover and i should have pass most of we evening together as a matter of fact we so spend very few early in the dusk the captain invariably row himself out to he beloved schooner what he do there i do not know we could see he light now in one part of she now in the other the man claim he be scrub she tooth old scrub they call he to he back : never captain selover he have to clean up after he own foot he be so dirty sagely proffer handy solomon and this be true the seaman 's prophecy hold good seven week hold we at that infernal job -- seven week of solid grind work the worst of it be that we be keep at it so breathlessly as though we very existence be to depend on the headlong rush of we labor and then we have fully half the store to put away again and the other half to transport painfully over the neck of land from the cove to the beach so accustomed have i become to the routine in which we be involve so habituate to anticipate the come day as exactly like the day that have go that the completion of we job catch I quite by surprise i have throw myself down by the fire prepare for the some old half hour of drowsy nicotine to be follow by the accustomed heavy sleep and the usual early rising to toil the evening be warm i half close my eye handy solomon be come in last instead of drop to he place he straddle the fire stretch he arm over he head he let they fall with a sharp exhalation ` lay aloft lay aloft ' the jolly bo 'n cry _ blow high blow low what care we _ ` look ahead look astern look a-windward look a-lee ' _ down on the coast of the high barbare-e-e _ the effect be electrical we all spring to we foot and fall to talk at once by god we be _ through _ cry pulz i would clean forget it the nigger pile on more wood we draw closer about the fire all the interest in life so long hold in the background leap forward eager for recognition we speak of triviality almost for the first time since we landing fuse into a temporary but complete good fellowship by the relief wonder how the old doctor be get on venture thrackle after a while the devil 's a preacher i wonder cry handy solomon let 's make 'em a call suggest pulz do not believe they would appreciate the compliment i laugh better let they make first call : they be the longer establish this be lose on they of course but we all feel kindly to one another that evening i carry the glow of it with I over until next morning and be therefore somewhat dash to meet captain selover with clouded brow and a uncertain manner he quite ignore my greeting by god eagen he squeak can you think of anything more to be do i straighten my back and laugh have not you work we hard enough i inquire unless you gild the cabin i do not see what else there can be to do captain selover stare I over and you a naval man he marvel do not you see that the only thing that keep this crew from gettin ' restless be keep they busy i have sweat a damn sight more with my brain than you have with you back think up thing to do i can not see anything ahead and then we 'll have hell to pay oh they be a sweet lot i whistle and my crest fall here be a new point of view and also a new captain ezra where be the confidence in the might of he two hand he seem to read my thought and go on i do not feel _ sure _ here on this cussed land it be not like a deck where a man have some show they can scatter they can hide it be not right to put a man ashore alone with such a crew i be do my best but it be not goin ' to be good enough i wisht we be safe in ` frisco harbor -- he would have maunder on but i seize he arm and lead he out of possible hearing of the man here buck up i say to he sternly there be nothing to be scare of if it come to a row there be three of we and we have get gun we could even sail the schooner at a pinch and leave they here you have stand they off before not ashore protest captain selover weakly well they do not know that for god 's sake do not let they see you have lose you nerve this way he do not even wince at the accusation put up a front he shake he head the sand have completely run out of he yet i be convince that if he could have feel the heave and roll of the deck beneath he he would have face three time the difficulty he now fear however i could see readily enough the wisdom of keep the man at work you can wreck the _ golden horn _ i suggest i do not know whether there be anything left worth salvage but it 'll be something to do he clap I on the shoulder good he cry i never think of it another thing say i you better give they a day off a week that can not hurt they and it 'll waste just that much more time all right agree captain selover another thing yet you know i be not lazy so it be not that i be try to dodge work but you would better lay I off it 'll be so much more for the other that be true say he i could not recognize the man for what i know he to be he grope as one in the dark or as a sea animal take out of its element and place on the sand courage have give place to fear decision to waver and singleness of purpose to a divided counsel he who have so thoroughly dominate the entire ship eagerly accept advice of I -- a man without experience that evening i sit apart considerably disturbed i feel that the ground have drop away beneath my foot to be sure everything be tranquil at present but now i understand the source of that tranquillity and how soon it must fail with opportunity would come more scheming more speculation more cupidity how be i to meet it with none to back I but a scared man a absorb man and a indifferent man viii wreck of the golden horn percy darrow unexpected make he first visit to we the very next evening he saunter in with a mexican corn-husk cigarette between he lip carry a lantern blow the light out and sit down with a careless greet as though he have see we only the day before hullo boy say he be busy how be ye sir reply handy solomon good lord mate look at that we eye follow the direction of he forefinger against the dark blue of the evening sky to northward glow a faint phosphorescence arch-shaped from which shot with pulsating regularity long shaft of light they beat almost to the zenith and back again a half dozen time then the whole illumination disappear with the suddenness of gas turn out now i wonder what that might be marvel thrackle northern light hazard pulz i have see they almost like that in the behring sea northern light you eye sneer handy solomon you may have see they in the behring sea but never this far south and in August and you can kiss the book on that what do you think sir thrackle inquire of the assistant devil 's fire reply percy darrow briefly the island 's a little queer i have notice it before debbil fire repeat the nigger darrow turn directly to he yes devil 's fire and devil too for all i know and certainly vampire do you ever hear of vampire doctor no growl the nigger well they be woman wonderful beautiful woman a man on a long voyage would just smack he lip to see they they have shiny gray eye and lip red as raspberry when you meet they they will talk with you and go home with you and then when you be asleep they tear a little hole in you neck with they sharp claw and they suck the blood with they red lip when they be not woman they take the shape of big bat like bird he turn to I with so beautifully casual a air that i want to clap he on the back with the joy of it by the way eagen have you notice those big bat the last few evening over by the cliff _ i _ can not make out in the dusk whether they be vampire or just plain bat he direct he remark again to the nigger next time you see any of those big bat doctor just you notice close if they have just plain black eye they be all right but if they have gray eye with red rim around 'em they be vampire i wish you would let I know if you do find out it be interesting don ' get I near no bat growl the nigger where 's selover inquire darrow he stay aboard i hasten to say want to keep a eye on the ship that be laudable what have you be do we have be clean ship just finish yesterday evening what next we be think of wreck the _ golden horn _ quite right well if you want any help with you engine or anything of the sort call on I he arise and begin to light he lantern i hope as how you be get on well there above sir venture handy solomon insinuatingly very well i thank you my man reply percy darrow drily remember those vampire doctor he swing the lantern and depart without further speech we follow the spark of it until it disappear in the arroyo behind we bellow the sea over against we in the sky be the dull threatening glow of the volcano about we be mysterious noise of cry bird bark seal rustling or rush wind i feel the throng ghost of all the old world 's superstition swirl madly behind we in the eddy that twist the smoke of we fire we wreck the _ golden horn _ forward be a rusted-out donkey engine which we take to piece and put together again it be no mean job for all the run part have to be clean smooth and with the exception of a rudimentary knowledge on the part of pulz and perdosa we be ignorant in fact we should not have succeed at all have it not be for percy darrow and he lantern the first evening we take he over to the cliff 's edge he laugh aloud jove boy how could you guess it _ all _ wrong he wonder with a few brief word he set we right pulz perdosa and i listen intently the other indifferent in the hopelessness of be able to comprehend of course we go wrong again in we next day 's experiment but darrow be down two or three time a week and gradually we edge toward a practical result he explanation consume but a few moment after they be finish we adjourn to the fire thus we come gradually to a better acquaintance with the doctor 's assistant in many respects he remain always a puzzle to I certainly the man never know how to take he he be evidently not only unafraid of they but genuinely indifferent to they yet he display a certain interest in they need and affair he practical knowledge be enormous i think i have tell you of the completeness of he arrangement -- everything have be foresee from grindstone to gas nipper the same quality of concrete speculation show he what we lack in we own life there be as you remember the matter of handy solomon 's steel claw he show thrackle a kind of lanyard knot that deep-sea person have never use he teach captain selover how to make soft soap out of one species of seaweed I he initiate in the art of fishing with a white bone lure we camp itself he reconstruct on scientific line so that we enjoy less aromatic smoke and more palatable dinner and all of it he do amusedly as though he idea be almost too obvious to need communication we become in a manner intimate with he he guy the man in he indolent fashion playing on they credulity they good nature even they forbearance they alternately grin and scowl he leave always a confused impression so that no one really know whether he cherish rancor against percy darrow or kindly feel the nigger be darrow 's especial prey the assistant have early discover that the cook be give to sign omen and superstition from a curious scholar 's lore he draw fantastic with which to torment he victim we hear of all the witch warlock incubi succibi harpy devil imp and haunter of avitchus from all the teaching of history sacred and profane hindu egyptian greek mediaeval swedenborg rosicrucian theosophy theology with every last ounce of horror mystery shiver and creep squeeze out of they they be gorgeous ghost story for they be tell by a man fully inform as to all the legendary and gruesome detail at first i use to think he might have communicate it more effectively then i see that the cool drawl manner the level voice be in reality the highest art he tell he story in a half-amused detach manner which impose confidence more readily than any amount of earnest asseveration the mere fact of he own belief in what he say come to matter little he be the vehicle by which be bring accurate knowledge he have read all these thing and now report they as he have read : each man could decide for himself as to they credibility at last the donkey engine be clear and reinstall atop the cliff the nigger build under she a fire of black walnut captain selover hand out grog all around and we start she up with a cheer just to see the wheel revolve next we half bury some long hatch end up to serve as bitt for the line hitch we cable to they and joyfully commence the task of pull the _ golden horn _ piece by piece up the side of the cliff the store be badly damage by the wet and there be no liquor for which i be sincerely grateful we break into the box and array ourselves in various garment -- which speedily fall to piece -- and appropriate gim-crack of all sort there be some arm but the ammunition have go bad perdosa out of forty or fifty mis-fire get one feeble sputter and a tremendous _ bang _ which blow up he piece leave only the stock in he hand a few tinned goods be edible but all the rest be destroy a lot of hard wood a thousand foot of chain cable and a fairly good anchor might be consider as prize as for the rest it be foolishness but we haul it up just the same until nothing at all remain then we shut off the donkey engine and put on dry clothes we have be quite happy for the eight month it be now well along toward spring the winter have be like summer and with the exception of a few rain of a week or so we have enjoy beautiful sky the seal have thin out considerably but be now return in vast number ready for they annual domestic arrangement we sunday we have mostly spend in rest or in fishing there be many deep sea fish to be have of great palatability but small gameness they come like so many leaden weight a few of we have climb some of the hill in a half-hearted curiosity but from they summit see nothing to tempt weariness practically we know nothing beyond the mile or so of beach on which we live captain selover have make a habit of come ashore at least once during the day he have contented himself with stand aloof but i take pain to seem to confer with he so that the man might suppose that i as mate be engage in carry out he direction the dread of he be my most potent influence over they during the last few day of we wreck captain selover have omit he daily visit the fact make I uneasy so that at my first opportunity i scull myself out to the schooner i find he moist-eyed as usual lean against the mainmast do nothing we have finish sir say i he look at I will you come ashore and have a look sir i inquire i be not go ashore again he mutter thickly what i cry i be not go ashore again he repeat obstinately and that be all there be to it it be too much of a strain on any man suit yourself you run they i ship as captain of a vessel i be no dock walloper i will not _ do _ it -- for no man i gasp with dismay at the man 's complete moral collapse it seem incredible i catch myself wonder whether he would recover tone be he again to put to sea my god man but you _ must _ i cry at last i will not and that be flat say he and turn deliberately on he heel and disappear in the cabin i go ashore thoughtful and a little scared but on reflection i regain a great part of my ease of mind you see i have be with these man now eight month during which they have be as orderly as so many primary schoolboy they have work hard without grumble and have even approach a sort of friendliness about the camp fire my first impression be overlay as i look back on the voyage with what i take to be a clearer vision i could not but admit that the incident be in themselves trivial enough -- a natural excitement by a superstitious negro a little tall talk that mean nothing it must have be the glamour of the adventure that have deceive I that and the unusual stage setting and costuming certainly few man would work hard for eight month without a murmur without a chance to look about they in that of course i be deceive by my inexperience i realize later the wonderful effect captain selover throw away with he empty brandy bottle the crew might grumble and plot during the watch below but when captain ezra selover say _ work _ they work he have be say work for eight month they have from force of experience obey he it be all very simple ix the empty brandy bottle so there i be at once deprive of my chief support although no danger seem imminent nevertheless the necessity of act on my own initiative and responsibility oppress I somewhat truth to tell after the first i be more relieved than dismayed at the captain 's resolution to stay aboard he drinking habit be grow on he and afloat or ashore he be now little more than a figurehead so that my chief asset as far as he be concern be rather he reputation than he direct influence in contact with the man i dreaded lest sooner or later he do something to lessen or destroy the awe in which they hold he of course dr schermerhorn have be mistake in he man : a real captain of man would have rise to circumstance wherever he find they but who could have foretell captain selover have be a rascal always but a successful and courageous rascal he have run desperate chance dominate desperate crew who could know that a crumble of island beach and six month ashore would turn he into what he have become yet i believe such case be not uncommon in other walk of life a man and he work combine to mean something yet both may be absolutely useless when separate it be the weak link -- i put in some time pray earnestly that the eye of the crew might be blind and that the doctor would finish he experiment before the cauldron could boil up again my first act as real commander be to announce holiday my idea be that the island would keep the man busy for a while then i would assign they more work to do they propose at once a tour into the interior we start up the west coast after three or four mile along a mesa formation where often we have to circle long detour to avoid the gully we come upon another short beach and beyond it a series of ledge on which bask several hundred seal they do not seem alarm in fact one old bull scar by many battle make toward we we leave he scale the cliff and turn up a broad pleasant valley toward the interior there the later lava flow have be deflect all that show of the original eruption be occasional red outcropping rock soil and grass have overlay the mineral scatter tree be plant throughout the flat cactus and semi-tropical bush mingle with brush on the rounded side hill a number of brilliant bird flutter at we approach suddenly handy solomon who be in advance stop and point to the crest of the hill a file of animal move along the sky line mutton say he or the devil 's a preacher sheep cry thrackle where do they come from _ golden horn _ i suggest remember that wide empty deck forward they carry sheep there the man separate intend fresh meat the affair be ridiculous these sheep have become as wild as deer we surround party with its silly bared knife could only look after they open-mouthed as they skip nimbly between its member get a gun of the old man mr eagen suggest pulz and we 'll have something besides salt horse and fish i nod we continue the island be like this as far as we go when we climb a ridge we find ourselves look down on a spider-web of other valley and cañons of the same nature all diverge to broad downs and a jump into the sea all converge to the outwork that guard the volcano with its canopy of vapor on we way home we cut across the higher country and the head of the cañons until we find ourselves look down on the valley and dr schermerhorn 's camp the steam from the volcanic blowhole sway below we through its rift we see the top of the building presently we make out percy darrow dress in overalls he sleeve roll back and carry a retort he walk very preoccupy to one of the miniature crater where he kneel and go through some operation indistinguishable at the distance i look around to see my companion stare at he fascinate they neck crane out they body draw back into hide in a moment he have finish and carry the retort carefully into the laboratory the man sigh and stand erect once more themselves as we turn away perdosa voice what must have be in the mind of all a man could climb down there say he why should he want to i demand sharply _ quien sabe _ shrug he we turn in silence toward the beach each brood he thought the sight of that man dress in overalls carry on some mysterious business bring home to each of we the fact that we expedition have a object as yet unknown to we the thought have of late drop into the background for my part i have be so immerse in the adventure and the labor and the insistent need of the hour that i have forget why i have come dr schermerhorn 's purpose be as inscrutable to I as at first what have i accomplish the man too seem strike with some such idea there be no yarn about the camp fire that night percy darrow do not appear for which i be sincerely sorry he presence might have create a diversion for some unknown reason all my old apprehension my sense of impending disaster have return to I strengthen in the firelight the nigger 's sullen face look sinister pulz 's nervous white countenance look vicious thrackle ' heavy bulldog expression be threatening perdosa 's mexican cast fit for knife work in the back and handy solomon stretch out lean on he elbow with he red headgear he snaky hair he hook nose he restless eye and he glittering steel claw -- the glow write across he aura the name of kid morgan blackbeard they sit smoking stare into the fire with mesmerise eye the silence get on my nerve i arise impatiently and walk down the pale beach where the star glimmer in splash along the wettest sand the black silhouette of the hill against the dark blue of the night sky the white of breaker athwart the indistinct heave of the ocean a faint light mark the position of the _ laugh lass _ -- that be everything in the world i make out some object roll about in the edge of the wash at the cost of wet foot i rescue it it be a empty brandy bottle -lrb- illustration : these sheep have become as wild as deer -rrb- x change of master the next day we continue we exploration by land and so for a week after that i think it best not to relinquish all authority so i organised regular expedition and order they direction the man do not object it be all good enough fun to they the net result be that we find a nesting place of sea bird -- too late in the season for egg a hot spring near enough camp to be useful and that be about all the sheep be the only animal on the island although there be several sort of bird in general the country be as i have describe it -- either volcanic or overlaid with fertile earth in any case it be cañon and hill we soon grow tired of climb and turn we attention to the sea with the surf boat we skirt the coast it be impregnable except in three place : we own beach that near the seal rookery and on the south side of the island we land at each one of these place but return close to the coast we happen upon a cave mouth more or less guard by a outlying rock the day be calm so we venture in at first i think it merely a gorge in the rock but even while peer for the end wall we slip under the archway and find ourselves in a vast room we eye be dazzle so we could make out little at first but through the still clear water the light filter freely from below show the bottom as through a sea glass we see the fish near the entrance and coral and sea growth of marvellous vividness they wave slowly as in a draught of air the medium in which they float be absolutely invisible for of course there be no reflection from its surface we seem to be suspend in mid-air and only when the dip oar make ring could we realize that anything sustain we suddenly the place let loose in pandemonium the most fiendish cry groan shriek break out confusing themselves so thoroughly with they own echo that the volume of sound be continuous heavy splash shake the water the boat rock the invisible surface be break into facet we shrink terrify from all about we glow hundred of eye like coal of fire -- on a level with we above we almost over we head two by two the coal be extinguish below we the bottom be cloud with black figure dart rapidly like a school of minnow beneath a boat they darken the coral and the sand and the glistening sea growth just as a cloud temporarily darken the landscape -- only the occultation and brightening succeed each other much more swiftly we stare stupefied we think power blur by the incessent whirl of motion and noise suddenly thrackle laugh aloud seal he shout through he trumpeted hand we eye be expand to the twilight we could make out the arch of the room its shelf and hollow and niche lie on they we could discern the seal hundred and hundred of they all stare at we all bark and bellow as we approach they scramble from they elevation and diving to the bottom scurry to the entrance of the cave we lay on we oar for ten minute then silence fall there persist a tiny _ drip drip drip _ from some point in the darkness it merely accentuate the hush suddenly from far in the interior of the hill there come a long hollow _ boo-o-o-m _ it reverberate roar the surge that have lift we boat some minute before thus reach its journey 's end the chamber be very lofty as we row cautiously in it lose nothing of its height but something in width it be marvellously color like all the volcanic rock of this island in addition some chemical drip have throw across its vividness long gauzy streamer of white we row in as far as the faintest daylight last we the occasional reverberate _ boom _ of the surge seem as distant as ever this be beyond the seal rookery on the beach below it we enter a open cleft of some size to another squarer cave it be now high tide the water extend a scant ten fathom to end on a interior shale beach the cave be a perfectly straight passage follow the line of the cleft how far in it reach we could not determine for it too be full of seal and after we have drive they back a hundred foot or so they fiery eye scare we out we do not care to put they at bay the next day i row out to the _ laugh lass _ and get a rifle i find the captain asleep in he bunk and do not disturb he perdosa and i with infinite pain track and stalk the sheep of which i kill one we find the mutton excellent the hunting be difficult and the quarry as time go on more and more suspicious but henceforward we do not lack for fresh meat furthermore we soon discover that fine trolling be to be have outside the reef we rig a sail for the extra dory and spend much of we time at the sport i do not know the name of the fish they be very gamy indeed and run from five to a indeterminate number of pound in weight above fifty pound we light tackle part so we have no means of know how large they may have be thus we spend very pleasantly the greater part of two week at the end of that time i make up my mind that it would be just as well to get back to business accordingly i call perdosa and direct he to sort and clear of rust the salvage chain cable he refuse flatly i take a step toward he he draw he knife and back away perdosa say i firmly put up that knife no say he i pull the saw-barrelled colt 's 45 and raise it slowly to a level with he breast perdosa i repeat drop that knife the crisis have come but my resolution be fully prepare for it i should not have care greatly if i have have to shoot the man -- as i certainly should have do have he disobey there would then have be one less to deal with in the final accounting which strangely enough i now for a moment never doubt would come i have not before aim at a man 's life so you can see to what tensity the baffling mystery have string I perdosa hesitate a fraction of a instant i really think he might have chance it but handy solomon who have be watch I closely growl at he drop it you fool he say perdosa let fall the knife now get at that cable i command still at white heat i stand over he until he be well at work then turn back to set task for the other man handy solomon meet I halfway beg you pardon mr eagen say he i want a word with you i have nothing to say to you i snap still excite it be not reasonable not to hear a man 's say he advise in he most conciliatory manner i be talk for all of we he pause a moment take my silence for consent and go ahead beg you pardon mr eagen say he we be not go to do any more useless work there be not no laziness about we but we be not go to be busy at nothing all the camp work and the haulin ' and cuttin ' and cleanin ' and the rest of it we 'll do gladly but we be not goin ' to pound any more cable and you can kiss the book on that you mean to mutiny i ask he make a deprecatory gesture put we aboard ship sir and let we hear the old man give he order and you 'll find no mutiny in we but here ashore it be different do the old man give order to pound the cable i represent the captain i stammer he catch the evasion i think so well if you get any kick on we please sir go get the old man if he say to we face pound cable why pound cable it be be not that right boy they murmur something perdosa deliberately drop he hammer and join the group my hand stray again toward the sawed-off colt 's 45 i would not do that say handy solomon almost kindly you could not kill we all and w ` at good would it do i ask you that i can cut down a chicken with my knife at twenty foot you must surely see sir that i could have kill you too easy while you be cover pancho there this be not get to be a war mr eagen just because we do not want to work without any sense to it there be more of the same sort i have plenty of time to see my dilemma either i would have to abandon my attempt to keep the man busy or i would have to invoke the authority of captain selover to do the latter would be to destroy it the master have become a stuff figure a bogie with which to frighten a empty bladder that a prick would collapse with what grace i could muster i have to give in you 'll have to have it you own way i suppose i snap thrackle grin and pulz start to say something but handy solomon with a peremptory gesture and a black scowl stop he short now that be what i call right proper and handsome he cry admiringly we reely have no right to expect that boy as seaman from we first officer you can kiss the book on it that very few crew have such kind master mr eagen have the right and we sign to it all straight to work we as he please and w ` at do he do why he up and give we a week shore leave and then he give we light watch and all the time we pay go on just the same now that be w ` at i call right proper and handsome conduct or the devil 's a preacher and i venture with all respect to propose three cheer for mr eagen they give they grin broadly the villain stand look at I a sardonic gleam in the back of he eye then he give a little hitch to he red head cover and saunter away hum between he tooth i stand watch he choke with rage and indecision the hum break into word ` oh quarter oh quarter ' the jolly pirate cry _ blow high blow low what care we _ but the quarter that we give they be to sink they in the sea _ down on the coast of the high barbare-e-e _ here you swab he cry to thrackle and you pancho get some wood lively and pulz bring we a pail of water doctor let 's have duff to celebrate on the man fall to work with alacrity xi the corrosive that evening i smoked in a splendid isolation while the man whisper apart i have nothing to do but smoke and to chew my cud which be bitter there could be no doubt however i may have save my face that command have be take from I by that rascal handy solomon i be in two mind as to whether or not i should attempt to warn darrow or the doctor yet what could i say and against whom should i warn they the man have grumble as man always do grumble in idleness and have perhaps talk a little wildly but that be nothing the only indisputable fact i could adduce be that i have allow my authority to slip through my finger and adequately to excuse that i should have to confess that i be a writer and no handler of man i abandon the unpleasant train of think with a snort of disgust but it have lead I to another in the joy and uncertainty of live i have practically lose sight of the reason for my come with I it have always be more the adventure than the story my writing be a by-product a utilisation of what life offer I i have set sail possess by the sole idea of ferret out dr schermerhorn 's investigation but the gradual development of affair have end by absorb my every faculty now cast into a eddy by my change of fortune the original idea regain its force i be out of the active government of affair with leisure on my hand and my thought naturally turn with curiosity again to the laboratory in the valley darrow 's devil fire be again paint the sky i have notice they from time to time always with increase wonder the man accept they easily as only one of the unexplained phenomenon of a sailor 's experience but i have not as yet hit on a hypothesis that suit I they be not ally to the aurora they differ radically from the ordinary volcanic emanation and scarcely resemble any electrical display i have ever see the night be cool the star bright : i resolve to investigate without further delay i arise to my foot and set off into the darkness immediately one of the group detach himself from the fire and join I go for a little walk sir ask handy solomon sweetly that be quite right and proper nothin ' like a little walk to get you fit and right for you bunk he hold close to my elbow we get just as far as the stockade in the bed of the arroyo the light we could make out now across the zenith but owe to the precipitance of the cliff and the rise of the arroyo bed it be impossible to see more handy solomon feel the defence carefully a man would think sir it be a cannibal island he observe all so tight and tidy-like here it would take a ship 's gun to batter she down a man might dig under these here two gate log if no one be against he like to try it sir no i answer gruffly from that time on i be virtually a prisoner yet so carefully be my surveillance accomplish that i could place my finger on nothing definite someone always accompany I on my walk and in the evening i be herd as closely as any cattle handy solomon take the direction of affair off my hand you may be sure he set no very heavy task the man cut a little wood carry up a few pail of water -- that be all lack incentive to stir about they come to spend most of they time lie on they back watch the sky this in turn breed a languor which be the sickest most soul - and temper-destroying affair invent by the devil they could not muster up energy enough to walk down the beach and back and yet they be weary to death of the inaction after a little they become irritable toward one another each suspect the other of do less than he should you who know man will realize what this mean the atmosphere of we camp become surly i recognize the precursor of its become dangerous one day on a walk in the hill i come on thrackle and pulz lie on they stomach gaze down fixedly at dr schermerhorn 's camp this be nothing extraordinary but they start guiltily to they foot when they see I and make off growl under they breath all this that i have tell you so briefly take time it be the eating through of man 's spirit by that worst of corrosive idleness i conceive it unnecessary to weary you with the detail -- the situation be as yet uneasy but not alarming one evening i overhear the beginning of a absurd plot to gain entrance to the valley -- that be as far as detail go i become convinced at last that i should in some way warn percy darrow that seem a simple enough proposition do it not but if you will stop to think one moment of the difficulty of my position you will see that it be not as easy as at first it appear darrow still visit we in the evening the man never allow I even the chance of private communication while he be with we one or two take pain to stretch out between we twice i arise when the assistant do resolve to accompany he part way back both time man resolutely escort we and as resolutely separate we from the opportunity of a single word apart the crew never threaten I by word or look but we understand each other i be not permit to row out to the _ laugh lass _ without escort therefore i never attempt to visit she again the man be not anxious to do so they awe of the captain make they only too glad to escape he notice that empty shell of a past reputation be my only hope it shield the arm and ammunition as i look back on it now the period seem to I to be one of merely potential trouble the man have not take the pain to crystallise they idea i really think they compelling emotion be that of curiosity they want to _ see _ it need a definite impulse to change that desire to one of greed the impulse come from percy darrow and he idle talk of voodoo as usual he be direct he remark to the sullen nigger voodoo he say of course there be do not fool yourself for a minute on that there be good one and bad one you can tame they if you know how and they will do anything you want they to pulz chuckle in he throat you do not believe it drawl the assistant turn to he well it be so you know that heavy box we be so careful of well that be get a tame voodoo in it the other laugh what he like ask the nigger gravely he be a fine voodoo with wavery arm and green eye and red glow watch narrowly its effect he swing off into one of the genuine old croon voodoo song once so common down south now so rarely hear no one know what the word mean -- they be generally hold to be charm-word only -- a magic gibberish but the nigger spring across the fire like lightning he face alter by terror to seize darrow by the shoulder doan you doan you he gasp shake the assistant violently back and forth dat he king voodoo song dat call he all de voodoo -- all he stare wildly about in the darkness as though expect to see the night throng there be a moment of confusion eager for any chance i hiss under my breath danger look out i could not tell whether or not darrow hear I he leave soon after the mention of the chest have focus the man 's interest well pulz begin we have be here on this spot o ' hell for a long time a year and five month reckon thrackle a man can do a lot in that time if he be busy they have be busy yes wonder what they have do there be no answer to this and the sea lawyer take a new tack i suppose we be all get double wages that be so and that be say four hunder ' for we and mr eagen here i suppose the old man do not let the schooner go for nothing two hundred and fifty a month say i and then would have have the word back they cry out in prolonged astonishment seventeen month pursue the logician after a few moment he scratch with a stub of lead that make over eleven thousand dollar since we have be out how much do you suppose he outfit stand he he appeal to I i be sure i can not tell you i reply shortly well it be a pile of money anyway nobody say anything for some time wonder what they have do pulz ask again something that pay big thrackle supply the desire answer dat chi ' -- suggest perdosa voodoo -- mutter the nigger that be to scare we out say handy solomon with vast contempt that be what make I sure it _ be _ the chest pulz mutter some of the jargon of alchemy that be it approve handy solomon if we could get -- we would not know how to use it interrupted pulz the book -- say thrackles well the book -- assert pulz pugnaciously how do you know what it will be it may be the philosopher 's stone and it may be one of these other damn thing and then where would we be it be astounding to hear this nonsense bandy about so seriously and yet they more than half believe for they be deep-sea man of the old school and this be in print thrackle voice approximately the general attitude philosopher 's stone or not something 's up the old boy take too good care of that box and he be spend too much money and he be get hold of too much hell afloat to be do it for he health you know w ` at i t ` ink smile perdosa he mak ' di ` mon 's he _ say _ dat the nigger have enter one of he black brooding mood from which these man expect oracle get he che ' he mutter i see he full -- full of di ` mon 's they listen to he with vast respect and be visibly impress so deep be the sense of awe that handy solomon unbent enough to whisper to I : i do not take any stock in the nigger 's talk _ ordinarily _ he be a hell of a fool nigger but when he eye look like that then you want to listen close he see thing then lot of time he be see thing even last year -- the _ oyama _ -- he tell about she three day ahead that be why we be so ready for she he chuckle nothing more develop for a long time except a savage fight between pulz and perdosa i hunt sheep fish wander about -- always with a escort tire to death before he start the thought come to I to kill this man and so to escape and make cause with the scientist my common sense forbid I i begin to think that common sense be a very foolish faculty indeed it teach I the obvious -- that all this idle vapouring talk be common enough among man of this class so common that it would hardly justify a murder would hardly explain a unwarranted intrusion on those who employ I how would it look for I to go to they with these word in my mouth : the captain have take to drink to dull the monotony the crew think you be a alchemist and be make diamond they interest in this fact seem to I excessive so i kill one of they and here i be and who be you they could ask i be a reporter would be my only truthful reply you can see the false difficulty of my position i do not defend my attitude undoubtedly a bear leader of man like captain selover at he best would have know how to act with the proper decision both now and in the inception of the first mutiny at heart i never doubt the reality of the crisis even percy darrow see the surliness of the man 's attitude and with he usual good sense divine the cause you chap be get lazy say he why do not you do something where 's the captain they growl something about there be nothing to do and explain that the captain prefer to live aboard do not blame he say darrow but he might give we a little of he squeaky company occasionally boy i 'll tell you something about seal the old bull seal have long stiff whisker -- a foot long do you know there be a market for those whisker well there be the chinese mount they in gold and use they for cleaner for they long pipe each whisker be worth from six bit to a dollar and a quarter why do not you kill a few bull seal for the ` trimming ' nothin ' to do with a voodoo grunt handy solomon darrow laugh amusedly no this be the truth he assure i 'll tell you what : i 'll give you boy six bit apiece for the whisker hair and four bit for the gall i expect to sell they at a profit next morning they shake off they lethargy and go seal-hunting i be practically command to attend this attitude have be grow of late : now it begin to take a definite form mr eagan do not you want to go hunting or mr eagen i guess i 'll just go along with you to stretch my leg have give way to we be go fishing : you would better come along i have know for a long time that i have lose any real control of they and that perhaps humiliate I a little however my inexperience at handle such man and the anomalous character of my position to some extent console I in the filament brush across the face of my understanding i could discover none so strong as to support a overt act on my part i can not doubt that have the affair come to a focus i should have warn the scientist even at the risk of my life in fact as i shall have occasion to show you i do my best but at the moment in all policy i could see my way to little besides acquiescence we kill seal by sequestrate the bull surround they and club they at a certain point of the forehead it be surprising to see how hard they fight and how quickly they succumb to a blow properly direct then we strip the mask with its bristle of long whisker take the gall and drag the carcass into the surf where it be devour by fish at first the man please by the novelty strip the skin the blubber often two or three inch in thickness have then to be cut away from the pelt cube by cube it be a long a oily and odoriferous job we stink mightily of seal oil we garment be shiny with it the very pore of we skin seem to ooze it and even after the pelt be fairly well clear it have still to be tan percy darrow suggest the method but the process be long and generally unsatisfactory with the acquisition of the fifth greasy heavy and ill-smelling piece of fur the man 's interest in peltry wane they confine themselves in all strictness to the trimming percy darrow show we how to clean the whisker the process be evil the mask be quite simply to be advance so far in the way of putrefaction that the bristle would part readily from they socket the first batch the man hang out on a line a few moment later we hear a mighty squawking and rush out to find the island raven make off with the entire catch protection of net have to be rig we catch seal for a month or so there be novelty in it and it satisfy the lust for kill as time go on the bull grow warier then we make expedition to outlying rock later handy solomon approach I on another diplomatic errand the seal be get shy sir say he they be say i the only way to do be to shoot they say he quite like i agree a pause ensue we have get no cartridge he insinuate and you have take charge of my rifle i point out oh not a bit sir he cry thrackle he just take it to clean it -- you can have it whenever you want it sir i have no cartridge -- as you have observe say i there be plenty aboard he suggest and they be in very good hand there say i he ruminate a moment polish the steel of he hook against the other arm of he shirt suddenly he look up at I with a humorous twinkle you be afraid of we he accuse i be silent not know just how to meet so direct a attack no need to be he continue i say nothing he look at I shrewdly then stand off on another tack well sir i do not mean just that i do not mean you be really scare of we but we be gettin ' to know each other livin ' here on this old island brothers-like there be not no officer and man ashore -- be there now sir when we get back to the old _ laugh lass _ then we drop back into we dooty again all right and proper you can kiss the book on that old scrub he know that he do not want no shore in he _ he _ know enough to stay aboard where we would all rather be he stop abruptly spat and look at I i wonder whither this devious diplomacy lead we still in one way a officer 's a officer and a seaman 's a seaman think you and discipline must be hold up among mate ashore or afloat think you quite proper sir and i can see you think that the arm be for the afterguard except in case of trouble quite proper you can do the shooting and you can keep the cartridge always by you just for discipline sir the man 's boldness in so fully arm I be astonishing and he carelessness in allow I aboard with captain selover astonish I still more nevertheless i promise to go for the desire cartridge fully resolve to make a appeal a further consideration of the element of the game convinced I however of the fellow 's shrewdness it be no more dangerous to allow I a rifle -- under direct surveillance -- for the purpose of hunting than to leave I my saw -- off revolver which i still retain the argument he have use against my shooting perdosa be quite as cogent now as to the second point i find the sun unexpectedly strong return from the cove for my hat and so overhear the follow between thrackle and he leader : what be to keep he from stay aboard cry thrackle protest well he might acknowledge handy solomon and then be we the worse off you be not go to make a boat attack against old scrub be you thrackle hesitate you can kiss the book on it you be not go on handy solomon easily nor I nor pulz nor the greaser nor the nigger nor none of we all together we have have we dose of that well if he go aboard and _ stay _ where be we the worse off i ask you that but he will not this be w ` at goin ' to happen say he to old scrub ` sir the man need you to bash in they head ' ` bash 'em in yourself ' say he ` that be w ` at you be for ' and if he should come ashore w ` at could he do i ask you that we be not disobey no order dooly deliver we be ready to pull halliard at the word no let he go aboard and if he peach to the old man why all the better for it just get the old man down on he how about old scrub -- do not you believe none in luck ask handy solomon aye well so do i with w ` at that law-crimp use to call joodicious assistance i row out to the _ laugh lass _ very thoughtful and a little shake by the plausible argument captain selover be lie dead drunk across the cabin table i do my best to waken he but fail take a score of cartridge -- no more -- and depart sadly nothing could be gain by stay aboard every chance might be lose besides a open to escape in the direction of the laboratory might offer -- i as well as they believe in luck judiciously assist in the ensue day i learn much of the habit of seal we sneak along the cliff top until over the rookery then lay flat on we stomach and peer cautiously down on we quarry the seal have become very wary a slight jar the fall of a pebble sometimes even sound unnoticed by ourselves be enough to send they into the water there they line up just outside the surf they sleek head glossy with the wet they calm soft eye fix unblinkingly on we it be useless to shoot they in the water : they sink at once when however we succeed in gain a advantageous position it be necessary to shoot with extreme accuracy a bullet directly through the back of the head would kill cleanly a hit anywhere else be practically useless for even in death the animal seem to retain enough blind instinctive vitality to flop they into the water there they be lose each rookery consist of one tremendous bull who officiate apparently as the standing army a number of smaller bull he direct descendant the cow and the pup the big bull hold he position by force of arm occasionally other unattached bull would come swimming by on arrive opposite the rookery the stranger would utter a peculiar challenge it be never refuse by the resident champion who promptly slide into the sea and engage battle if he conquer the stranger go on he way if however the stranger win the big bull immediately strike out to sea abandon he rookery while the new-comer swam in and attempt to make he title good with all the younger bull i have see some fierce combat out there in the blue water they gash each other deep -- you can see by this how we hunting be never at a end on Tuesday we would kill the boss bull of a certain establishment by Thursday at latest another would be install i learn curious fact about seal in those day the hunting do not appeal to I particularly because it seem to I useless to kill so large a animal for so small a spoil still it be a means to my all-absorbing end and i confess that the stalk the lie belly down on the sun-warmed grass over the surge and under the clear sky be extremely pleasant while await the return of the big bull often we have opportunity to watch the other at they daily affair and even the unresponsive thrackle be strike with they almost human intelligence do you know that seal kiss each other and weep tear when grieve the man often discuss among themselves the narrow dry cave there the animal be practically pen in they agree that a great killing could be make there but the impossibility of distinguish between the bull and the cow deter they the cave be quite dark immerced in we own affair thus the day week and month go by event have slip beyond my control i have embark on a journalistic enterprise and now that purpose be entirely out of my reach up the valley dr schermerhorn and he assistant be engage in some experiment of whose very nature i be still ignorant also i be likely to remain so the precaution take against interference by the man be equally effective against I as if that be not enough any move of investigation on my part would be radically misinterpret and to my own danger by the man i might as well have be in london however as to my first purpose in this adventure i have evolve another plan and therefore be content i make up my mind that on the voyage home if nothing prevent i would tell my story to percy darrow and throw myself on he mercy the result of the experiment would probably by then be ready for the public and there be no reason as far as i could see why i should not get the scoop at first hand certainly my sincerity would be without question and i hope that two year or more of service such as i have render would tickle dr schermerhorn 's sense of he own importance so adequate do this plan seem that i give up think on the subject my whole life now lay on the shore i be not again permit to board the _ laugh lass _ captain selover i see twice at a distance both time he seem to be rather uncertain the man do not remark it the day go by i relapse into that state so well know to you all when one seem catch in the mesh of a dream existence which have have no beginning and which be destine never to have a end we be to hunt seal and fish and pry bivalve from the rock at low tide and build fire and talk and alternate between suspicion and security between the danger of sedition and the insanity of man without define purpose world without end forever xii old scrub come ashore the inevitable happen one noon pulz look up from he labor of pull the whisker from the evil-smelling mask how many of these damn thing we get he inquire about three hunder ' and fifty thrackle reply well we have get enough for I i be sick of this job it stink they look at each other i could see the disgust rise in they eye the reek of rotten blubber expand they nostril with one accord they cast aside the mask it be not such a hell of a fortune growl pulz he evil little white face thrust forward there be other thing worth all the seal trimmin 's of the island diamon 's gloom the nigger you have hit it doctor cut in solomon there we be again back to the old difficulty only worse idleness descend on we again we grow touchy on little thing as a misplace plate a shortage of firewood too deep a draught at the nearly empty bucket the noise of bicker become as constant as the noise of the surf if we value peace we keep we mouth shut the way a man spat or eat or sleep or even breathe become a cause of irritation to every other member of the company we stand the outrage as long as we could then we object in a wild and ridiculous explosion which communicate its heat to the object of we wrath then there be a fight it need only liquor to complete the deplorable state of affair gradually the smaller thing come to worry we more and more a certain harmless singer of the cricket or perhaps of the tree-toad variety use to chirp he innocent note a short distance from we cabin for all i know he have do so from the moment of we installation but i have never notice he before now i catch myself listen for he irregular recurrence with every nerve on the quiver if he delay by ever so little it be a agony yet when he do pipe up he feeble strain strike to my heart cold and paralysing like a dagger and with every advance minute of the night i become broader awake more tense fairly sweating with nervousness one night -- good god be it only last week it seem age ago another existence a state cut off from this by the wonder of a transmigration at least last week i do not sleep at all the moon have rise have mount the heaven and now be sail overhead by the fretwork of its radiance through the chink of we rudely-built cabin i have mark off the hour a thunderstorm rumble and flash hull down over the horizon it be many mile distant and yet i do not doubt that its electrical influence have dry the moisture of we equanimity leave we rattle husk for the wind of destiny to play upon certainly i can remember no other time in a rather wide experience when i have feel myself more on edge more choke with the restless purposeless nervous energy that leave a man 's tongue parch and he eye stare and still that infernal cricket or whatever it be chirp i have think myself alone in my vigil but when finally i could stand it no longer and kick aside my cover with a oath of protest i be surprise to hear it echo from all about I damn that cricket i cry and the dead shadow stir from the bunk and the hollow-eyed victim of insomnia creep out to curse they tormentor we organise a expedition to hunt he down it be ridiculous enough six strong man prowl for the life of one poor little insect we do not find he however though we succeed in silencing he but no sooner be we back in we bunk than he begin it again and such be the turmoil of we nerve that day find we sit wan about a fire hug we knee we be so genuinely empty not so much by the cricket as by the two year of fermentation that not one of we stir toward breakfast in fact not one of we move from the listless attitude in which day find he until after nine o'clock then we pull ourselves together and cook coffee and salt horse as a significant fact the nigger leave the dish unwashed and no one care handy solomon finally shake himself and arise i be sick of this say he i be goin ' seal-hunting they arise without a word they be sick of it too sick to death we be a silent gloomy crew indeed as we thrust the surf boat afloat clamber in and ship the oar no one speak a word no one have a comment to make even when we see the rookery slide into the water while we be still fifty yard from the beach we pull back slowly along the coast beyond the rock we make out the entrance to the dry cave there be seal in there cry handy solomon lot of 'em he thrust the rudder over and we head for the cave no one express a opinion as it be again high tide we row in to the steep shore inside the cave 's mouth and beach the boat the place be full of seal we could hear they bellow two of you stand here shout handy solomon and take they as they go out we 'll go in and scare 'em down to you they 'll run over we scream pulz no they will not you can dodge up the side when they go by this be indeed well possible so we grip we club and venture into the darkness we advance four abreast for the cave be wide enough for that as we penetrate the bellowing and bark become more deafening it be impossible to see anything although we _ feel _ a indistinguishable tumble mass recede before we footstep thrackle swear violently as he stumble over a laggard with uncanny abruptness the black wall of darkness in front of we be alive with fiery eyeball the seal have reach the end of the cave and have turn toward we we too stop a little uncertain as to how to proceed the first plan have be to get behind the band and to drive it slowly toward the entrance to the cave this be now see to be impossible the cavern be too narrow its side at this point too steep and the animal too thickly congest we eye become accustomed to the twilight now begin to make out dimly the individual body of the seal and the general configuration of the rock one big boulder lay directly in we path like a island in the shale of the cave 's floor perdosa step to the top of it for a better look the man attempt to communicate they idea of what be to be do but could not make themselves hear above the uproar i could see they face contort with the fury of be baffle a big bull make a dash to get by all the herd flipper after he if he have win past they would have follow as obstinately as sheep and nothing could have stop they but the big bull go down beneath the club thrackle hit the animal two vindictive blow after it have succumb this settle the revolt and we stand as before pulz and handy solomon try to converse by sign but evidently fail for they face show angry in the twilight perdosa on he rock roll and light a cigarette thrackle pace to and fro and the nigger lean on he club farther down the cave they have be leave at the entrance but now in lack of result have join they companion now thrackle approach and scream himself black try to impart some plan he fail but stoop and pick up a stone and throw it into the mass of seal the other understand a shower of stone follow the animal mill like cattle bellow the louder but would not face they tormentor finally a old cow flop by in a panic i think they would have let she go but she die a little beyond the bull no more follow although the man throw stone as fast and hard as they be able they face be livid with anger like that of a evil-tempered man with a obstinate horse suddenly handy solomon put he head down and with a roar distinctly audible even above the din that fill the cave charge directly into the herd i see the beast cringe before he i see he club rise and fall indiscriminately and then the whole back of the cave seem to rise and come at we this be no chance of sport now but a struggle for very life we realize that once down there would be no hope for while the seal be more anxious to escape than to fight we know that they jaw be powerful there be no time to pick and choose we hit out with all the strength and quickness we possess it be like a bad dream like struggle with a elusive hydra-headed monster knee high invulnerable we hit but without apparent effect new head rise the press behind increase we give ground we stagger struggle desperately to keep we foot how long this last i can not tell it seem hour i know my arm become leaden from swing my club my eye be full of sweat my breath gasp a sharp pain in my knee nearly double I to the ground and yet i remember clamp to the thought that i must keep my foot keep my foot at any cost then all at once i recall the fact that i be arm i jerk out the short-barrelled colt 's 45 and turn it loose in they face whether the flash and detonation frighten they whether perdosa still cling to he rock manage to turn they attention by he flanking effort or whether quite simply the wall of dead finally turn they back i do not know but with one accord they give over the attempt i look at once for handy solomon and be surprise to see he still alive standing upright on a ledge the other side of the herd he clothing be literally tear to shred and he be cover with blood but in this plight he be not alone for when i turn toward my companion they too be tattered tear and gory we be a dreadful crew standing there in the half-light we chest heave we rag drip red for perhaps ten seconds no one move then with a yell of demoniac rage my companion clamber over the rampart of dead seal and attack the herd the seal be now cow and defenceless it be a slaughter and the most debauching and brutal i have ever know i have hit out with the rest when it have be a question of defense but from this i turn aside in a sick loathing the man seem possess of devil and of they unnatural energy perdosa cast aside the club and take to he natural weapon the knife i can see he yet roll over and over embrace a big cow he head jam in a ecstasy of ferocity between the animal 's front flipper he leg clasp to hold she body only he right arm rise and fall as he plunge he knife again and again she struggle turn he over and under weep great tear and fairly whine with terror and pain finally she be still and perdosa stagger to he foot only to stare about he drunkenly for a moment before throw himself with a screech on another victim the nigger alone do not jump into the turmoil he stand just down the cave he club ready occasionally a disorganised rush to escape would be make the nigger 's lip snarl and with a truly mad enjoyment he beat the poor animal back i press against the wall horrify fascinate unable either to interfere or to leave a close sticky smell take possession of the air after a little a tiny stream grow each moment begin to flow past my foot it seek its channel daintily as streamlet do feeling among the stone in eddy quiet pool miniature fall and rapid for the moment i do not realize what it could be then the light catch it down where the nigger wait and i see it be red at first the racket of the seal be overpower now gradually it be lose volume i begin to hear the blasphemy ferocious cry scream of anger hurl against the cave wall by the man the thick sticky smell grow stronger the light seem to grow dimmer as though it could not burn in that fetid air a seal come and look up at I big tear roll from she eye then she flipper aimlessly away out of she poor wit with terror the sight finish I i stagger down the length of the black tunnel to the boat after a long interval a little three month ' pup waddle down to the water 's edge catch sight of I and with a squeal of fright dive far poor little devil i would not have hurt he for world as far as i know this be the only survivor of all that herd the man soon appear one by one tired sleepy-eyed glutted walking in a cat-like trance of satiety they be blood and tatters from head to foot and from dry red mask peer they bloodshot eye not a word say they but tumble into the boat push off and in a moment we be float in the full sunshine again we row home in a abstraction for the moment berserker rage have burn itself out handy solomon continually wet he lip like a animal lick its chop thrackle stare into space through eye drug with kill no one speak we land in the cove and be surprise to find it in shadow the afternoon be far advance over the hill we drag ourselves and down to the spring there the man throw themselves flat and drink in great gulp until they could drink no more we build a fire but the nigger refuse to cook someone else turn he growl i cook aboard ship perdosa who have hew the fuel at once become angry i cut heem de wood he say i do my share eef i cut heem de wood you mu ' cook heem de grub but the nigger shake he head and perdosa go into a ecstasy of rage he kick the fire to piece he scatter the unburned wood up and down the beach he even throw some of it into the sea eef you no cook heem de grub you no hab my wood he shriek with enough oath to sink he soul finally pulz interfere here you damn foreigner say he quit it let up i say we get to eat you let that wood alone or you 'll pick it up again perdosa spring at he with a screech pulz be small but nimble and understand rough and tumble fight he meet perdosa 's rush with two swift blow -- a short arm jab and a upper-cut then they clinch and in a moment be roll over and over just beyond the wash of the surf the row wake the nigger from he sullen abstraction he seem to come to himself with a start he eye fall surprisedly on the combatant then light up with a unholy joy he draw he knife and creep down on the fighter it be too good a opportunity to pay off the mexican but thrackle interfere sharply come off he command none o ' that go to hell growl the nigger a great rage fall on they all blind and terrible like that lead to the slaughter of the seal they fight indiscriminately hit at each other with fist and knife it be difficult to tell who be against whom the sound of heavy breathing dull blow the tear of cloth and grunt of punishment receive the swirl of the sand the heave of struggle body all rivet my attention so that i do not see captain ezra selover until he stand almost at my elbow stop he shriek in he high falsetto voice and would you believe it even through the blood haze of they combat the man hear he and heed they draw reluctantly apart get to they foot stand look at he through reek brow half submissive and half defiant the bull-headed thrackle even take a half step forward but freeze in he track when old scrub look at he i hire you man to fight when i tell you to and only then say the captain sternly what do this mean he menace they one after another with he eye and one after another they quail all they plotting they threat they dangerousness dissipate like mist before the command of this one resolute man these pirate who have seem so dreadful to I now be nothing more than cringe schoolboy before they master and then suddenly to my horror i watch closely see the captain 's eye turn blank i be sure the man must have feel the change though certainly they be too far away to see it for they shift by ever so little from they first frozen attitude the captain 's hand seek he pocket and they freeze again but instead of the expect revolver he produce a half-full brandy bottle the change in he eye have creep into he feature they have turn foolishly amiable vacant confide ` llo boy say he appealingly you good fellowsh be not you have a drink 's good stuff good ol' bottl ' he lurch catch himself and advance toward they still with the empty smile they stare at he for ten seconds quite at a loss then : by god he be drunk handy solomon breathe scarcely louder than a whisper there be no other signal give they spring as with a single impulse one instant i see clear against the wane daylight the bulky foolish-swaying form of captain selover : the next it have disappear carry down and obliterate by the rush of attack body knife gleam ruddy in the sunset there be no struggle i hear a deep groan then the murderer rise slowly to they foot xiii i make my escape i have plenty of time to run away i do not know why i do not do so but the fact stand that i remain where i be until they have finish captain selover then i take to my heel but be soon cornered i draw my revolver remember that i have empty it in the seal cave -- and have time for no more coherent mental process a smother weight fling itself on I against which i struggle as hard as i could shrink in anticipation from the thirsty plunge of the knife however though the weight increase until further struggle be impossible i be not harm and in a few moment find myself wrist and ankle tie beside a roar fire while i collect myself i hear the grate of a boat be shove off from the cove and a few moment later make out light aboard the _ laugh lass _ the looting party return very shortly they plundering have go only as far as liquor and arm thrackle let down from the cliff top a keg at the end of a line perdosa and the nigger each carry a armful of the 30-40 rifle the keg be roll to the fire and broach the man get drunk wildly drunk but not helplessly so a flame communicate itself to they through the liquor the ordinary characteristic of they composition spring into sharper relief the nigger become more sullen perdosa more snake-like pulz more viciously evil thrackle more brutal while handy solomon stagger from he seat to the open keg and back again roar fragment of a chanty he red headgear contrast with he smoky black hair and he swarthy hook-nosed countenance -- he need no further touch they evil passion be all awake and the plan so long indefinite develop like a photographer 's plate that be one say thrackle one go to hell and now the diamond mutter pulz there be a ship upon the windward a wreck upon the lee _ down on the coast of the high barbare-e-e _ roar

from the fire when thrackle have throw on the armful of wood a idea come to I i hitch myself to the spark and lay across it the rope with which my wrist be tie this behind my back be not easy to accomplish and twice i burn my wrist before i succeed fortunately i be at the edge of illumination and behind the group i turn over on my side so that my back be toward the fire then rapidly i cast loose my ankle lashing thus i be free and select a moment when universal attention be turn toward the rum barrel i roll over a sand dune get to my hand and knee and creep away through the coarse grass i creep thus to the very entrance of the arroyo then rise to my foot in the middle distance the fire leap red its glow fall intermittently on the surge rolling in the man stagger or lay prone either as gigantic silhouette or as tatterdemalion paint by the light the keg stand solid and substantial the hub about which reel the orgy at the edge of the wash i could make out something prone dim limp throw constantly in new position of weariness as the water ebb and flow beneath it now a arm throw out now cast back as though old scrub sleep feverishly the drunkard be get noisy handy solomon still reel off the verse of he song the other join in frightfully off the key or punctuate the performance by wild staccato yell they coffin be they ship and they grave it be the sea _ blow high blow low what care we _ and the quarter that we give they be to sink they in the sea _ down on the coast of the high barbare-e-e _ bellow handy solomon i turn and plunge into the cool darkness of the cañon xiv a adventure in the night ten seconds after enter the arroyo i be stumble along in a absolute blackness it almost seem to I that i could reach out my hand and touch it as one would touch a wall or perhaps not exactly that for a wall be hard and this darkness be soft and yield in the manner of envelop hanging directly above I be a narrow jagged and irregular strip of sky with star i splash in the brook find its water strangely warm rustle through the grass my head back chin out hand extend as one make he way through a house at night there be no sound except the tinkle of the sulphurous stream : successive bend in the cañon wall have shut off even the faintest echo of the bacchanalium on the beach the way seem much longer than by daylight already in my calculation i have traverse many time the distance when with a jump at the heart i make out a glow ahead and in front of it the upright log of the stockade to my surprise the gate be open i ascend the gentle slope to the valley 's level -- and stumble over a man lie prostrate shiver violently and moan i bent over to discover whom it might be as i do so a brilliant light seem to fill the valley throw a illumination on the man at my foot i see it be the nigger and perceive at the same instant that he be almost beside himself with terror he eye roll he tooth chatter he frame contract in a strong convulsion and the black of he complexion have fade to a washed-out dirty gray revolting to contemplate he feel my touch and spring to he foot clutch I by the shoulder as a man clutch rescue my gawd he shiver look dar it be again he fall to pattering in a tongue unknown to I -- charm spell undoubtedly to exorcise the devil that have hold of he i follow the direction of he gaze and myself cry out the doctor 's laboratory stand in plain sight between the two column of steam blow straight upward through the stillness of the evening it seem burst with light every little crack leak it in generous stream while the main illumination appear fairly to bulge the wall outward this be in itself nothing extraordinary and indicate only the activity of those within but while i look a irregular patch of incandescence suddenly splash the cliff opposite for a single instant the very substance of the rock glow white hot then from the spot a shower of spiteful flake shoot as from a pyrotechnic and the light be blot out as suddenly as it come at the same moment it appear at another point exhibit the same phenomenon die flash out at still a third place and so be repeat here and there with bewildering rapidity until the wall of the valley crackle and spit spark abruptly the darkness fall as abruptly it be break again by a similar exhibition only this time the fire be blue blue be follow by purple purple by red then ensue the briefest possible pause in which a figure move across the bar of light escape through the chink of the laboratory and then the whole valley blaze with patch of vari-coloured fire it be not a reflection : it be actual physical conflagration of the solid rock in irregular area some of the fire shape be most fantastic and with the unexpectedness of a burst shell the surface of the ground before we foot crackle into a ghastly blue flame the nigger utter a cry in he throat and disappear i feel a sharp breath on my neck a ejaculation of surprise at my very ear it be startling enough to scare the soul out of a man but i hold fast and be just about to step forward when my collar be twist tight from behind i raise both hand feel steel and know that i be in the grasp of handy solomon 's claw the sailor have I foul i do my best to twist around to unbutton the collar but in vain i feel my wind leave I the ghastly blue light be shoot with red distinctly i hear the man 's sharp intaken breath as some new phenomenon meet he eye and he great oath as he swear by the mother of god he cry it be the devil then i be jerk off my foot and the next i know i be lie on my back very wet on the beach the day be break and the man quite sober be talk vehemently it be impossible to make out what they say but as handy solomon and the nigger be the center of discussion i could imagine the subject i feel very stiff and sore and hazy in my mind my neck be lame from the drag and my tongue dry from the choke for some time i lay in a half-torpor watch the lilac of dawn change to the rose of sunrise utterly indifferent to everything they have throw I down across the first rise of the little sand dune back of the tide sand and from it i could at once look out over the sea full of the restless shadow of dawn and the land narrow to the mouth of the arroyo i remember wonder whether captain selover be up yet then with a sharp stab at the heart i remember the thought be like a dash of cold water in clear my faculty i raise my head seaward a white gull have catch the first ray of the sun beyond the cliff landward -- i see with a choke in my throat -- a figure emerge from the arroyo at the sight i make a desperate attempt to move but with the effort discover that i be again bind my stir thus call pulz 's attention before i could look away he have follow the direction of my gaze the discussion instantly cease they wait in grim silence i do not know what to do percy darrow carry some sort of large book be walk rapidly toward we perdosa have disappear thrackle after a instant come and sit beside I and clap he big hand over my mouth it be horrible when within a hundred pace or so i could see that darrow labor under some great excitement he usual indifferent saunter have as i have indicate give way to a firm and decide step he ironical eye glisten he sallow cheek glow boy he shout cheerfully the time 's up we have succeed we 'll sail just as soon as the lord 'll let we get ready rustle the stuff aboard the doctor 'll be down in a short time and we ought to be load by night handy solomon and pulz lay hand on two of the rifle near by and begin surreptitiously to fill they magazine the nigger shake he knife free of the scabbard and sit with it in he left hand conceal by he body i could feel thrackle 's muscle stiffen another fifty pace and it would be no longer necessary to stop my mouth the thought make I desperate i have fail as a leader of these man and i have be force to stand by at debauch cruel and murderous affair but now it be over i thank heaven the reproach can not be make against I that at any time i count the consequence to myself thrackle 's hand lay heavy across my mouth i bit it to the bone and as he involuntarily snatch it away i roll over toward the sea thus for a instant i have my mouth free run run i shout for god 's sake -- thrackle leap upon I and strike I heavily upon the mouth then spring for a rifle i manage to struggle back to the dune whence i could see xv five hundred yard ' range percy darrow with the keenness that always characterise he mental apprehension have understand enough of my strangle cry he have not hesitate nor delay for a explanation but have turn track and be now run as fast as he long leg would carry he back toward the opening of the ravine my companion stand watch he but make no attempt either to shoot or to follow for a moment i could not understand this then remember the disappearance of perdosa my heart jump wildly for the mexican have be go quite long enough to have cut off the assistant 's escape i could not doubt that he would pick off he man at close range as soon as the fugitive should have reach the entrance to the arroyo there can be no question that he would have do so have not he mexican impatience betray he he shoot too soon percy darrow stop in he track although we hear the bullet sing by we for a instant we think he be hit then perdosa fire a second time again without result darrow turn sharp to the left and begin desperately to scale the steep cliff i once take part in a wild boar hunt on the coast of californium we dog have pen a small band at the head of a narrow _ barranca _ from which a single steep trail lead over the hill we perch on another hill some three or four hundred yard away shoot at the animal as they toil up the trail the range be long but we have time for the severity of the climb force the boar to a foot pace it be exactly like that percy darrow have two hundred foot of ascent to make he could go just so fast must consume just so much time in he snail-like progress up the face of the hill during that time he furnish a excellent target and the loose sandstone show where each shot strike a significant indication be that the man do not take the trouble to get nearer for which maneuver they would have have time in plenty but distribute themselves leisurely for a shooting match first shot claim handy solomon and without delay fire off-hand a puff of dust show to the right nerve no good he comment jerk she just as i pull pulz fire from the knee the dust this time puff below think she would carry up at that distance he mutter the nigger too miss and thrackle grin triumphantly i get a show say he he spread he massive leg apart draw a deep breath and raise he weapon it lay in he grasp steady as a log and i see that percy darrow 's fate be in the hand of that dangerous class of natural marksman that possess no nerve but for the second time my tooth save he life the trigger guard slip against thrackle 's lacerated hand almost at the instant of discharge he miss and the bullet go wide darrow have climb a matter of twenty foot now the seaman distribute themselves for more leisurely and accurate marksmanship handy solomon lay flat on he stomach rest the rifle muzzle across the top of a sand dune pulz sit down a elbow on either knee for the greater steadiness the nigger knelt but thrackle remain on he foot no rest could be steadier than the stone-like rigidity of he thick arm the firing now become miscellaneous no one pay any attention to anyone else each discover what i could have tell they that even the human figure at five hundred yard be a small mark for a strange rifle the constant correction of elevation however bring the puff of dust always closer and i could not but realize that the doctrine of chance must bring home some of the bullet i soon discover by way of comfort that only thrackle and handy solomon really understand firearm and of those two thrackle alone have have much experience at long range he tell I afterward he have hunt otter about halfway up the cliff thrackle fire he fifth shot no dust follow the discharge and i see percy darrow stagger and almost lose he hold the man yell savagely but the assistant pull himself together and continue he crawl the sun have be shine in we face i could imagine its blur effect on the sight now abruptly it be blot out and a semi-twilight fall we all look up in spite of ourselves a opaque veil have be draw quite across the heaven through which we could not make out even the shape of the sun it be like a thunder cloud except that its under surface instead of be the usual grey-black be a deep earth-brown as we look up a deep bellow stir the air which have fall quite still long fork of lightning shot horizontally from the direction of the island 's interior and flash of dull red be reflect from the canopy of cloud the man stare with they mouth open undoubtedly the change have be some time in preparation but all have be so absorb in the affair of the doctor 's assistant that no one have notice it come to we consciousness with the suddenness of a theatrical change a dull roar commence grow in volume and then a great explosion shake the very ground under we foot we stare at each other we face whitening what kind of hell have break loose muttered pulz the nigger fall flat on he face utter deep lamentation voodoo voodoo he groan a gentle shower of white flake begin powder the surface of everything far out to sea we could make out the sun on the water gradually the roar die down the lightning cease comparative peace ensue we look again toward the cliff percy darrow have not for one instant cease to climb he be just top the edge of the bluff handy solomon with a cry of rage seize another rifle and empty the magazine at he as fast as the lever could be work the dust fly wild in a half dozen place darrow draw himself up to the sky line raise he hat ironically and disappear -lrb- illustration : the firing now become miscellaneous no one pay any attention to any one else -rrb- damn he soul cry handy solomon he face livid he throw he rifle to the beach and dance on it in a ecstasy of rage what do we care growled thrackle he be no good to we w ` at i want to know be wat 's up here anyhow do not you never see a volcano go off you swab snapped handy solomon easy with you name mate no i never do we better get out without the chest s ` pose we go up the gulch and get it then suggest thrackle but at this handy solomon draw back in evident terror up that hole of hell he object not i you a ' pulz go they wrangle over it pulz join perdosa shake to the soul creep in and make a bee-line for the rum barrel he and the nigger be frankly scare they have the nervous jump at every little noise or unexpected movement and even the natural explanation of these phenomenon give they very little reassurance i know that darrow would hurry as fast as he could back to the valley by way of the upper hill i know that he have there several sport rifle and i hope greatly that he and dr schermerhorn might accomplish something before the man have recover they wit to the point of foresee he probable attack the uncanny cloud in the heaven the weird half-light and the explosion which now grow more frequent have they strong effect in spite of explanation the man be not really afraid to venture in quest of the suppose treasure but they be in a frame of mind that dread the first plunge and time be go by but the fate be against we as always in this ill-starred voyage i watch from my sand dune see a second figure emerge from the arroyo 's mouth it appear to stagger as though hurt and every eight or ten pace it stop and rest in a bent-over position the murky light be too dim for I to make out detail but after a moment a rift in the veil enable I to identify dr schermerhorn carry with great difficulty the chest xvi the murder i take no chance but begin at once to shout as soon as i see the man have notice he come it be impossible for I to tell whether or not dr schermerhorn hear I if he do he misunderstand my intention for he continue painfully to advance the only result i gain be to get myself well gag with my own pocket handkerchief and throw in a hollow between the dune thence i could hear handy solomon speak fiercely and rapidly now you let I run this he command we get to find out somethin' it be not no good to we without we know -- and we want to find out how he be get the rest hide they assent i be goin ' out to help he carry she in announce the seaman a long pause ensue in which i watch the deep canopy of red-black thicken overhead a strange and unearthly light have fall on the world and the air be quite still after a while i hear handy solomon and dr schermerhorn join the group there you be perfessor cry handy solomon in tone of the greatest heartiness i 'll put she right there and she 'll be as safe as a babby at home she be heavy though dr schermerhorn laugh a pleased and excited laugh i could tell by the tone of he voice that he be string high and guess that he triumph need a audience you may say so well he say it iss heafy and it iss heafy with the world-desire the great substance than can do efferythe where iss percy he be go aboard we must embark the time be joost right a day sooner and the egsperiment would haf be spoil but now -- he laugh -- let the island sink we do not care we must embark hastily it 'll take a man long time to carry down all you thing perfessor oh lead they go the eruption have alretty swallow they oop the lava iss by now a foot deep in the valley before long it flow here so we must embark but you have lose all they vallyable thing perfessor say handy solomon now i call that hard luck dr schermerhorn snap he finger they do not amoundt to that he cry here here in this leetle box iss all the treasure here iss the labor of ten year here iss the _ laugh lass _ and the crew and all the equipmendt comprise here iss the world i be a plain seaman perfessor and i suppose i get to believe you but she be a main small box for all that with that small box you can haf all you wish assert the professor still in the german lyric strain over he triumph it iss the box of enchantment you haf but to will the change you would haf taig place -- it iss do the substance of the rock the molecule -- all could a man make diamond ask pulz abruptly i could hear the sharp intake of the man 's breathing as they hang on the reply much more wonderful change than that it can accomplish reply the doctor with a indulgent laugh that change iss simple carbon iss coal carbon iss diamond you see one have but to change the form not the substance then it 'll change coal to diamond ask handy solomon yes you gather my meaning -- i hear a sharp squeak like a terrify mouse then a long dreadful silence then two dull heavy blow space with deliberation a moment later i catch a glimpse of handy solomon bent forward to the labor of drag a body toward the sea he steel claw hook under the angle of the jaw as a man handle a fish pulz come and throw off my bond and gag come along say he all keep look fearfully toward the arroyo a dense white steam mark its course the air be now heavy with portent successive explosion some light some severe shake the foundation of the island great rock and boulder bound down the hill the flash of lightning have become more frequent we move exaggerated to each other 's vision by the strange light uncouth and gigantic let 's get out of this cry thrackle we turn at the word and run thrackle stagger under the weight of the chest all we belongings we abandon and set out for the _ laugh lass _ with only the tatters in which we stand luckily for we a great part of the ship 's store have be return to she hold after the last thorough scrubbing so we be in subsistence but all we clothes all we personal belongings be leave behind we on the beach for after once we have top the cliff that lead over to the cove i doubt if any consideration on earth would have induce we to return to that accursed place the row out to the ship be wet and dangerous seismic disturbance be undoubtedly responsible for high pyramidic wave that lift and fall without onward movement we fairly tumble up out of the dory which we do not hoist on deck but leave at the end of the painter to beat she side against the ship xvii the open sea we haste however avail we little for there be no wind at all we lay for over two hour under the weird light over-canopied by the red - brown cloud while the explosion shake the foundation of the world nobody venture below the sail flap idly from the mast : the block and spar creak : the three-cornered wave rise straight up and fall again as though reach from the deep when the man first begin to sweat the sail up evidently in preparation for a immediate departure i object vehemently you be not go to leave he on the island i cry he 'll die of starvation they do not answer I but after a little more when my expostulation have become more positive handy solomon drop the halliard and draw I to one side look here you he snarl you would better just stow you gab you be lucky to be here yourself let alone botherin ' you thick head about anybody else and you can kiss the book on that do you know why you be not with they carrion he jerk he thumb toward the beach it be because solomon anderson 's you friend thrackle would have kill you in a minute ` count of he bit hand i get you you chance now do not you be a fool for i be not goin ' to stand between you and they another time besides he will not last long if that volcano keep at it he leave I whatever truth lay in he assumption of friendship and i doubt there exist much of either truth or friendship in he i see the common sense of he advice i be in no position to dictate a course of action after the sail be on she we gather at the starboard rail to watch the shore there the hill run into inky blackness as the horizon sometimes merge into a thunder squall a dense white steam come from the creek bed within the arroyo the surge beat on the shore louder than the ordinary and the foam even in these day hour seem to throw up a faint phosphorescence frequent earthquake oscillate the landscape we watch i do not know for what we eye strain into the murk of the island nobody thought of the chest which lay on the cabin table aft i contribute maliciously my bit to they fear these volcanic island sometimes sink entirely i suggest and in that case we would be carry down by the suction it be intend merely to increase they uneasiness but strangely enough after a few moment it end by impose itself on my own fear i begin to be afraid the island would sink begin to watch for it begin to share the fascinate terror of these man the suspense after a time become unbearable for while the portent -- whether physical or moral we be too far under its influence to distinguish -- grow momentarily we own soul do not expand in due correspondence we talk of towing of kedge out of go to any extreme even to small boat then just as we be about to move toward some accomplishment a new phenomenon chained we attention to the shore in the mouth of the arroyo appear a red glow a moment later a wave of lava white-hot red iridescent cooling to a black crust crack in incandescence roll majestically out over the grassy plain each instant it grow in volume until the ravine must have be flow half full before its scorch the grass even at the edge of the sea be smoking and we camp have already burst into flame we have to shield we face against the heat and the wooden railing under we hand be grow warm pulz turn a ashy countenance toward we my god he scream what be go to happen when she hit the sea she hit the sea and immediately a great cloud of steam arise and the hiss as of a thousand serpent we feel the strong suction under we keel and stagger under the jerk of the ship 's cable as she swing toward the beach the paint be begin to crackle along the rail we could see nothing for the scalding white veil that envelop we we could hear nothing for the roar of steam the bombardment of explosion and the crash of thunder but we nostril be assault by a most unearthly medley of smell hell 's loose growled thrackle we be cling hard as the ship reel huge surge be race in from seaward grow larger with each successive billow handy solomon raise he head listen intently and strike he forehead wind he scream at the top of he voice and jump for the halliard thrackle follow he but no one else move in a instant the two be back striking and kick savagely rouse they companion to the danger we all lay into the canvas like mad and in no time have snug down to a staysail and the peak of we mainsail thrackle draw he knife and jump for the cable while handy solomon he eye snap seize the wheel we finish just in time i be turn away after tie the last gasket on the foresail when the deck up-ended and tip I headforemost into the starboard scupper at the same time a smother of salt water blow over the port rail now far above I to drench I as thoroughly as though i have fall overboard i brush out my eye to find the ship smack on she beam end and the wind howling by from the sea i have company enough in the scupper only handy solomon cling desperately to the wheel jam he weight to port in the hope she might pay up : thrackle too he eye squint along some bearing of he own be wait for she to drag presently it become evident that she be do so whereupon he draw he knife across we hawser my god chatter pulz at my ear if we go ashore -- he do not need to finish unless the _ laugh lass _ could recover before the squall have drive she to leeward a scant half mile we should be cook alive in the boiling cauldron at the shore 's edge for a interminable time as it seem to I we lay absolutely motionless the scene be stamp indelibly on my memory -- the bulwark high above I the steep sleek deck the piratical figure tense at the wheel the snarling water racing from beneath we the lurid glow to landward crawl up on we inch by inch like a hungry wild beast then almost imperceptibly the brave schooner right the strained line on handy solomon 's carven feature relax little by little thrackle stare over the side let out a mighty roar steerage way he shout and execute a awkward clog dance on the reel deck she move forward there be no doubt of that for gradually we be eat toward the wind -- but we make considerable leeway as well handy solomon taut as the weather rig take he little advantage one by one like precious gift light there be none the land be blot out by the steam and murk which have creep to sea and now be hurl back by the wind all we could do be to hang there tasting the copper of excitement wait for these different force to adjust themselves inch by inch we creep forward : foot by foot we make leeway the intensest of the lava glow work its way from directly abeam to the quarter by this we know we must be nearly opposite the cove at once a new doubt spring up in we mind a moment ago all the energy of we desire have go up in the ambition to avoid be cast on the beach now we see that that be not enough it be necessary to squeeze around the point where lay the _ golden horn _ in order to avoid the fate that have overtake she handy solomon yell something at we we could not hear but we own knowledge tell we what it must be and with one accord we turn to on the foresail with the peak of it hoist we move a trifle faster though the schooner lay over at a perilous angle a moment later the fog part to show we the cliff loom startlingly near there be the donkey engine and the work we have construct for wreck -- and there beside they watch we reflectively stand percy darrow for ten minute we stare at he fascinate during which time the ship labor against the staggering wind gain and lose in its buffet with the great surge the breaker hurl themselves in wild abandon against the rock send they back-wash of tumble peak to we very bilge the few remains of the _ golden horn _ alternately drench and drain seem to picture to we we inevitable end i think we have all select the same two point for we bearing a rock and a drop of the cliff bolder than the ordinary if the rock open from the cliff to eastward we be lose if it remain stationary we be at least hold we own if it open out to westward we be save we watch with a strained eagerness impossible to describe at each momentary gain or rebuff we utter ejaculation the nigger mumble charm every once in a while one of we would snatch a glance to leeward at the cruel white water the whirl of eddy where the sea be beat only to hurry back to the rock and the point of the cliff whence we message of safety or destruction be to be fling once i look up percy darrow be lean gracefully against a stanchion watch he soft hat be pull over he eye he stroke softly he little moustache i catch the white puff of he cigarette during the moment of my inattention something happen a wild shout burst from the man i whirl and see to my great joy a strip of sky westward between the cliff and the rock and at that very instant a billow larger than the ordinary rolled beneath we and in the back suction of its passage i could dimly make out cruel dangerous rock lie almost under we keel slowly we creep away we progress seem infinitesimal and yet it be real in a while we have gain sea room in a while more we be fairly under sailing way and the cliff have begin to drop from we quarter with one accord we look back percy darrow wave he hand in a indescribably graceful and ironic gesture then turn square on he heel and saunter away to the north valley out of the course of the lava that be the last i ever saw of he as we make we way from beneath the island the weight of the wind seem to lessen we get the foresail on she then a standing jib finally little by little all she ordinary work canvas before we know it we be bowl along under a stiff breeze and the island be drop astern from a distance it present a truly impose sight the center shot intermittent blast of ruddy light explosion deaden by distance still reverberate strongly the broad canopy of brown-red split with lightning spread out like a huge umbrella the lurid gloom that have envelop we in the atmosphere apparently of a nether world have give place to a twilight abruptly we pass from it to a sun-kissed sparkling sea the breeze blow sweet and strong the wave run untortured in they natural long course at once the man seem to throw off the superstitious terror that have cow they pulz and thrackle go to bail the extra dory alongside which by a miracle have escape swamp the nigger disappear in the galley perdosa relieved handy solomon at the wheel and handy solomon come directly over to I xviii the catastrophe he approach I with a confidence that proclaim the new leader a brace of colt 's revolver swing from he belt the tatters of he blood-stained garment hang about he well here we be he remark i nod wait for what he have to disclose and lucky for you that you be here at all say i he continue and now that you be here w ` at be you go to do that be the question -- w ` at be you go to do he cock he head sidewise and look at I speculatively as a cat might look at a rather large mouse we be a little rough he go on after a moment and some folk be strait-laced there might be trouble and you know a heap too much what do you want of I i demand it be just this he return briskly if you 'll lay we we course to san salvador we 'll let you go as one of we and no question ask if not i inquire he shrug he shoulder i leave it to you there be always the sea i suggest and it be deep he agree we look out to the horizon in a diplomatic silence i do not know whether to be angry amuse or alarm that the man estimate my cleverness so slightly why the hook be barely conceal and the bait of the coarsest that i would go safe to a sight of san salvador i do not doubt : that i would never enter the harbor i be absolutely certain the choice offer I be practically whether i prefer be throw overboard now or several hundred mile to southeastward i think rapidly it might be possible to announce a daily false reckoning to the crew to sail the ship within rowing distance of some coast and then to escape while the man believe themselves many hundred mile at sea it would take nice calculation to prevent suspicion but as it be the only chance i resolve upon it immediately that be all very well i say firmly but you can not get anywhere without I and i be not go to put in two year and then keep my mouth shut for nothing i want a share in the swag -- a even share with the rest of you oh that 'll be all right he cry you can have it if anything be need to convince I of the man 's sinister intention this too ready acquiescence would have be enough i know he too well if he have have the slightest intention of permit I to go free he would have bargain the nigger call we to mess we eat in the after cabin the chest be lock and the man have as yet be unable to break into it pulz profess some skill in locksmithing and promise to experiment later after mess we go on deck again the island have drop down to the horizon and show as a brilliant glow under a dark canopy i lean over the rail look at it below I the extra dory bump along the idea come to I that if i could escape that night i could row back to percy darrow the two of we could make shift to live on fish and shellfish and mutton the plan rapidly define itself in my brain from the remains of the _ golden horn _ we could construct some kind of a craft in which to run free to the summer trade thus we might in time reach some one or another of the sandwich island whence a pass trader could take we back to civilisation there be many element of uncertainty in the scheme but it seem to I less desperate than trust to the caprice of these man especially since they now have free access to the liquor store while i lean over the rail engross in these thought one of the black thunder cloud that have be gather and dissipate over the island during the entire afternoon suddenly glow overhead with a strange white incandescence startlingly akin to darrow 's so-called devil fire strangely enough this illumination unlike the volcanic glow appear to be cast on the cloud from without rather than shoot through they from within as be the other volcanic emanation at the same instant i experience a sharp interior revulsion of some sort most briefly momentary but of a character that shake I from head to toe i have no time to analyze these various impression however for my attention be almost instantly distract from the cabin come the sound of a sharp fall then a man cry out and on the heel of it pulz dart from the cabin scream horribly we be all on deck and as the little man rush toward the stern handy solomon twist he deftly from he foot my god mate what be it he cry as he pin the sufferer to the deck but pulz could not answer he shiver stiffened and lay rigid he eye roll back fit remark thrackle impatiently the excitement die rum be force between the victim 's lip after a little he recover but could tell we nothing of he seizure after the dish have be sweep aside from supper handy solomon announce a second attempt to open the chest pancho here say he be be a mechanic say he i right well know he be be a housebreaker so he be get the _ sabe _ for the job and you can kiss the book on that perdosa with a grin lean over the cover from behind and begin to pick away at the lock with a long crooked wire the other draw close about i slip nearer the door imagine that in they rivet interest i see my opportunity to my surprise i catch a glimpse of leg disappear up the companion i take stock pulz have go on deck this surprise I for i should have think every man interested enough in the suppose treasure to wish to be present at its uncover and it annoy I still more -- the success of my plan demand a clear deck however there be nothing for it now but to trust that pulz have wish to visit the forecastle and that i might find the afterwork empty i pause at the foot of the companion and look back a breathlessness of excitement hold the pirate in a vise from above the hang lamp throw strong shadow across they face bring out the deep line accentuate the dominant passion with they rag and blood they unshaven face they firearm they filth they show in violent antithesis to the immaculate white of old scrub 's cabin its glittering brass and its shine leather i dart up the step the contrast of the starry night with the glare of the cabin lamp dazzle my eye i stand stock still for a moment during which the only sound audible be the singing of the wind through the rig the wash of the sea and the small sharp click of perdosa 's instrument as he work at the chest presently i could see better i look forward and aft for pulz but could see nothing of he and have just about conclude that he have go forward when i happen to glance aloft there to my astonishment i make he out huddle in silhouette against the star close to the main truck what he be do there i could not imagine however i do not have time to bother my head about he further than to rejoice that he could not obstruct I i should very much have like to get hold of a rifle and ammunition or at least to lay in biscuit and water but for this there be no time it be not absolutely essential the dull glow of the island be still visible i have my pillar of fire and smoke to guide I without further delay i jerk loose the painter and draw the extra dory alongside i have proceed just so far in my movement when the most extraordinary thing happen i shall try to tell you of it as accurately as possible and in the exact order of its occurrence first a long straight shaft of white light shot straight up through the cabin roof to a great height it shine through the wooden plank as a ordinary light shine through glass by contrast the surround blackness be throw into a deeper shade and yet the shaft itself be so brilliant as almost to scotch the sight curiously enough it be define accurately be exactly in shape like one of the rectangular tin air-shaft you see so often in city hotel at the instant of its appearance the wind fall quite calm almost immediately the rectangle on the roof through which the light make its passage begin to splay out like light oil although the column retain still the integrity of its outline the fire if such it could be call run with incredible rapidity along the seam between the plank forward and aft until the entire deck be sketch like a pyrotechnic display in thin vivid line of incandescence from each of these line then the fire begin again to spread as though soak through the plank all take place practically in a instant of time i have no opportunity to move nor to cry out indeed my perception be inadequate to the task of mere observation up to now there have be no sound the wind have fall the water pass unnoticed a stillness of death seem to have descend on the ship it be break by a sharp double report one as of the fall of a metallic substance the other cause by the body of pulz which shake loose from the truck by a heavy roll smash against the rail of the ship and splash overboard someone cry out sharply a instant later the entire crew struggle out from the companionway rush in grim silence to the side of the vessel and throw themselves into the sea my own idea be somewhat confuse the fire have practically envelop the ship i think to feel it and yet my skin be cool to the touch the ship 's outline become blur a dizziness overtake I and then all at once a great desire seize and shake my very soul i can not tell you the vehemence of this desire it be a madness nothing could stand in the way of its gratification whatever happen i must have water it be not thirst nor yet a purpose to allay the very real physical burning of which i be now dimly conscious but a craving for the liquid itself as something apart from and unconnected with anything else without hesitation and as though it be the most natural thing in the world i vault the rail to cast myself into the ocean i dimly remember a last fly impression of a furnace of light then a great shock thud through I and i lose consciousness part three the maroon i in the wardroom over the wardroom of the _ wolverine _ have fall a silence it hold after slade have finish captain parkinson stiff and erect in he chair stare fixedly at a spot two foot above the reporter 's head seem to weigh as a judge weigh the fact so picturesquely set forth dr trendon he sturdy frame half in shadow have slouch far down into himself only the regard of he keen eye fix upon slade 's face unwaveringly and a bit anxiously show that he be think of the narrator as well as of the narrative the other have fall completely under the spell of the tale they sit as child in a theater absorb forgetful of the world around they wrap in a more vivid element at the close they stir and blink half daze by the abrupt fall of the curtain slade have tell he story with fire with something of passion even now he feel the sharp reflex he mutter uncertainly beneath he breath and glance from one to another of the circle face that be all he say unsteadily there pass through the group a stir and a murmur someone break into sharp cough chair shove back grate on the floor well of all the extraordinary -- begin a voice ruminatingly and break short off as if abashed at its own infraction of the silence that be all repeat slade a note of insistence in he voice why do not you say something confound you why do not you say something he speech rise husky and crack do not you believe it hold on say the surgeon quietly no need to get excited oh well mutter the reporter with a sudden lapse possibly you think i be romance it do not matter i do not suppose i would believe it myself in you place but we be head for the island suggest forsythe that be so cried slade well that be all right believe or disbelieve as much as you like only get percy darrow off that island then we 'll have he version there be a few thing i want to find out about myself there be several that promise to be fairly interesting say forsythe under he breath slade turn to the captain have you any question to put to I sir he ask formally just one moment interrupted trendon boy a pony of brandy for mr slade the reporter drink the liquor and again turn to captain parkinson only about we man say the commanding officer after a little thought slade shake he head i be sorry i can not help you there sir dr trendon say that you know nothing about edward edward repeat slade inquiringly he mind still absorb in the event which he have be relate grope backward trendon come to he aid barnett ask you about he you remember it be when you recover consciousness we ensign take over charge of the _ laugh lass _ oh of course i be a little dazed i fancy we put mr edward aboard when we first pick up the desert schooner explain the captain pardon I say the other my head do not seem to work quite right yet just a moment please he sit silent with closed eye you say you pick up the _ laugh lass _ when he ask presently four -- five -- six day ago the first time then you put out the fire the circle close in on slade with a unconscious hitching forward of chair he have fix he eye on the captain he mouth work obviously he be under a tensity of endeavor in keep he faculty set to the problem the surgeon watch he frown there be no fire say the captain slade leap in he chair no fire but i see she i tell you when i go overboard she be one live flame you land in the small boat knock you senseless say trendon concussion of the brain idea of flame might have be a retroactive hallucination retroactive rot cry the other i beg you pardon dr trendon but if you would see she as i see she -- barnett he turn in appeal to he old acquaintance there be no fire slade reply the executive officer gently no sign of fire that we could find except that the starboard rail be blister oh that be from the volcano say slade that be nothing it be all there be return barnett just let I run this thing over say the free lance slowly you find the schooner she be not afire she do not even seem to have be afire you put a crew aboard under you ensign edward storm separate you from she you pick she up again desert be that right day before yesterday morning then cry the other excitedly the fire be smoulder all the time it break out and you man take to the water impossible say barnett fiddlestick say the more downright surgeon i hardly think mr edward would be drive overboard by a fire which do not even scorch he ship suggest the captain mildly it drive we lot overboard insist slade do you think we be a pack of coward i tell you when that hellish thing break loose you have to go it be not fear it be not pain it be -- what be the use you can not explain a thing like that we certainly see the glow the night billy edward be -- disappear mused forsythe and again night before last say the captain what be that cry slade where be the _ laugh lass _ i would give something pretty to know say barnett be not she in tow in tow say forsythe no indeed we have not adequate facility for tow she do not you tell he mr barnett where be she then slade fire the question at they like a cross - examiner why we ship another crew under ive and mcguire that noon we be part again and have not see they since god forgive you say the reporter after the warning you would have too it be -- it be -- my order mr slade say captain parkinson with quiet dignity of course sir i beg you pardon return the other but -- you say you see the light again the first night they be out say barnett in a low voice then you second crew be with you first crew say slade shakily and they be with thrackle and pulz and solomon and many another black - hearted scoundrel and brave seaman down there he point under foot captain parkinson rise and go to he cabin slade rise too but he knee be unsteady he totter and but for the swift aid of barnett 's arm would have fall overdo say dr trendon with some irritation cost you something in strength foolish performance turn in now slade try to protest but the surgeon would not hear of it and march he incontinently to he berth return trendon report with growl of discontent that he patient be in a fever could not expect anything else he fume pack of human interrogation point hound he all over the place what do you think of he story ask forsythe the grizzled surgeon draw out a cigar light it take three deliberate puff turn it about examine the ash end with concentration and reply : man 's tell a straight story you think it be all true cry forsythe humph grunt the other _ he think it be all true _ a orderly appear and knock at the captain 's cabin beg pardon sir they hear he say mr carter would like to know how close in to run volcano 's act up pretty bad sir captain parkinson go on deck follow by the rest ii the jolly roger feel the way forward the cruiser be soon catch in a maze of cross current hither and thither she be bear a creature bereft of volition order follow order like the rattle of quick-fire and be obey with something more than the _ wolverine 's _ customary smartness from the bridge captain parkinson himself direct he ship he face be placid : he bearing steady and confident this in itself be sufficient earnest that the cruiser be in ticklish case for it be a axiom of the man who sail under parkinson that the calmer that nervous man grow the more cause be there for nervousness on the part of other the approach be from the south but suspicious aspect of the water have fend the cruiser out and around until now she stand prow-on to a bold headland at the northwest corner of the island above this headland lay a dark pall of vapor in the shift breeze it sway sluggishly heavily as if ride at anchor like a logy ship of the air only once do it show any marked movement it be spread out toward we say barnett to he fellow officer gather aft time to move then grunt trendon the other look at he inquiringly about as healthful as prussic acid those volcanic gas explain the surgeon the ship edge on and inward presently the sing-song of the leadsman sound in measure distinctness through the silence then a sudden activity and bustle forward the rattle of chain and the _ wolverine _ be at anchor the captain come down from the bridge what do you think dr trendon he ask more explicit inquiry be not necessary the surgeon understand what be in he superior 's mind never can tell about volcano sir he say of course agree the captain but -- well do you recognize any of the symptom want I to diagnose a case of earthquake sir grin trendon she might go off to-day or she might behave herself for a century well it be all chance say the other cheerfully the man _ might _ be alive at any rate we must do we best on that theory what do you make of that cloud on the peak poisonous vapor i suppose think we would have a chance to make sure just now seem to be come right for we wind 's shift it since there could not be anything alive up there not so much as a bug reply the doctor positively yet i think when the vapor lift a bit that i see something move when be that sir ten or fifteen minute back we 'll see soon enough sir put in forsythe the wind be drive it down to the south ` ard sullenly reluctantly the forbid mass move across the headland all glass be bent upon it without take he binocular from he eye trendon begin to ruminate aloud if he could have get to the beach no vapor there signal though perhaps he have not time and i would hate to risk good man on that hell 's cauldron just as much risk here perhaps only it seem -- there it be cried forsythe look the highest point dull gray wisp of murk the afterguard of the gaseous cloud be twist and spiral in a witch-dance across the landscape and see by snatch and glimpse through it something flap darkly in the breeze suddenly the veil part and flee a flag stand forth in the sharp gust rigid and appalling it be black the jolly roger by god they have come back exclaim forsythe and set up the sign of they shop add barnett if they stick to they flag -- good-bye observe trendon grimly dr trendon say captain parkinson you will arm yourself and go with I in the gig to make a landing yes sir respond the surgeon mr barnett yes sir should we be overtake by the vapor while on the highland and be unable to get back to the beach you be to send no rescue party up there until the air have clear but sir may we not -- do you understand yes sir in case of a attack you will at once send in another boat with a howitzer yes sir dr trendon will you see mr slade and inquire of he the best point for landing trendon hesitate i suppose it would hardly do to take he with we pursue the commanding officer if he be rouse now even for a moment i will not answer for the consequence sir say the surgeon bluntly surely you can have he point out a landing place say the captain on you responsibility return the other obstinately he be under opiate now be it so say captain parkinson after a time go in they see no sign of life along the shore even the bird have desert it for the time the volcano seem to have pretermitt its activity now and again there be a spurtle of smoke from the cone follow by subterranean growling but on the whole the condition be reassure penny-pop-pinwheel of a volcano anyhow remark trendon disparagingly real man-size eruption would have wipe the whole thing off the map first whack as they draw in it become apparent that they must scale the cliff from the boat farther to the south open out a wide cove that suggest easy beaching but over it hang a cloud of steam lava pour down say trendon fortunately at the point where the cliff look easiest the sea run low rope have be bring after some dainty manoeuvre two of the sailor gain foothold and sling the rope so that the remainder of the disembarcation be simple nor be the ascent of the cliff a harsh task half a hour after the landing the explore party stand on the summit of the hill where the black flag wave over a scene of utter desolation the vegetation be wither to pallid rag : even the tiniest weedling in the rock crevice have be poison by the devastating blast in the midst of that deathly scene the flag seem instinct with a sinister liveliness whoever have set it there have accurately choose the highest available point on that side of the island the spot of all other where it would make good its signal to the eye of any chance farer upon those shipless sea for the staff a ten-foot sapling finely polished serve a mound of rock-slab support it firmly upon the cloth itself be no design it be of a dull black the hue of soot captain parkinson stand a few yard off view it with disfavor furl that flag he order congdon the coxswain of the gig step forward and begin to work at the fastening presently he turn a grin face to the captain who be scan the landscape through he glass beggin ' you pardon sir he say well what be it demand captain parkinson beggin ' you pardon sir that be not rightly no flag that be what you might rightly call a garment sir it be a undershirt beggin ' you pardon black undershirt 's a new one to I mutter trendon no sir it be not rightly black look wrenching the object from its fastening he flap it violently a cloud of sooty dust beat out spread about he face with a strangle cry the sailor cast the shirt from he and roll in agony upon the ground you fool cry trendon stand back all of you open he medicine case he bent over the rack sufferer presently the man sit up pale and abashed that be how poisonous volcanic gas be say the surgeon to he command officer only inhale remnant of the dust too a ill outlook for the man we be seek the captain muse dead if he be anywhere on this highland declare trendon let 's look at he flag-pole he examine the staff come from the beach he pronounce waterworn h be maybe he be not so dead either i do not quite follow you dr trendon why i guess we man have figure this thing all out bring this pole up from the beach to plant it here why because this be the best observation point no good as a permanent residence though plant he flag and go back why do not we see he on the beach then do you notice a cave around to the north good refuge in case of fume it be worth try say the captain put up he glass hold on sir what be this here 's something look here trendon point to a small bit of wood rather neatly carve to the shape of a indicatory finger and lash to the staff at the height of a man 's face the other cluster around oh the devil cry trendon it must have get twist it be point straight down strange performance say the captain however since it point that way -- heave aside those rock man the first slab lift bring to light a corner of cardboard this on closer examination prove to be the cover of a book the rock roll right and left and as the flag-staff deprive of its support totter and fall the trove be drag forth and hand to the captain while the ground jar with occasional tremor and the mountain puff forth its vaporous threat he and the surgeon seat on a rock give themselves with complete absorption to the read iii the cache outwardly the book accord ill with its surroundings in that place of desolation and death it typify the petty neatness of office process properly place it should have be find on a desk with pen ruler and other paraphernalia form exact angle or parallel to it it be a quarto bind in marbled paper with black leather over the hinge no external label suggest its ownership or use but through one corner blacken and formidable in its contrast to the peaceful purpose of the volume a hole have be bore the agency of perforation be obvious a bullet have make it see something of life i reckon say trendon as the captain turn the volume about slowly in he hand and of death return captain parkinson solemnly do you know trendon i almost dread to open this pshaw return the other what be it to we he throw the cover back neatly letter on the inside in the fine and slightly angular write characteristic of the teutonic scholar be the legend : karl augustus schermerhorn 1409-1\/2 spruce street philadelphium pa -lrb- illustration : with a strangle cry the sailor cast the shirt from he -rrb- the opposite page be blank captain parkinson turn half a dozen leave german he cry in a note of disappointment can you read german script after a fashion reply the other let 's see _ e wonnte sech -- und -- dreissig unterjacke _ he read why blast it be the man run a haberdashery what have three dozen undershirt to do with this a memorandum for outfit probably suggest the captain try here chemical formula say trendon page of 'em the devil can not make a thing of it well here 's something in english good say the other _ by combine the hyper-sulphate of iridium with the fume arise from oxide of copper heat to 1000 c and combine with picric acid in the proportion describe in formulum x 18 a reaction the nature of which i have not fully determine follow this must be perform with extreme care owe to the unstable nature of the benzene compound _ picric acid benzene compound those be high explosive say captain parkinson we should have barnett go over this here be a name under the formulum _ dr a mardenter ann arbor mich _ that explain its being in english probably copy from a letter this must have be one of the experiment in the valley that slade tell we of say the captain thoughtfully why see here he cry with something like exultation that be what dr schermerhorn be do here he have the clue to some explosive so terrific that he go far out of the world to experiment with its manufacture for companion he choose a gang of cutthroat that the world would never miss in case anything go wrong possibly it be some trial of the finish product that start the eruption even do you see do not explain enough grunt trendon desert ship billy edward mysterious light slade and he story any explosive in those good enough far as it go do not go far enough it certainly leave gap admit the other he turn over a few more page formula formula formula what be this here be some marginal annotation unbehasslich read trendon let 's see that mean ` highly unsatisfactory ' or word to that effect hi here 's where the old man lose he temper listen : _ ` may the devil take carroll and crum for careless ' _ -- h be -- well _ ` pig-dog ' _ now where do carroll and crum come in they be a firm of analytical chemist in washington say the captain when i be on the ordnance board i use to get they circular fit in what more english worse than the german this be the write beginning evenly enough at the top of a page run along for a line or two then fall sprawl in huge ragged character the full length trendon stumble among they indignantly _ June 1

world-problem _ why the old fool be crazy and he writing be crazier can not make head or tail of it the captain turn several more page they be blank at any rate it seem to be the end he say i should hope so return the other disgustedly he take the book on he knee flutter the leaf between thumb and finger suddenly he check cast back and throw the book wide open here beginneth a new chapter say he quietly no imaginable chirography could have strike the eye with more of contrast to the professor 's small and nervous hand large round and ramble it fill the page with few and careless word _ June 2

furnish a sinister period to the signature trendon hand the ledger back to the captain who take one quick look close it and hand it to congdon wrap that up and carry it carefully he say aye aye sir say the coxswain swathe it in he jacket and tuck it under he arm now to find that cave say captain parkinson to the surgeon the cave in the cliff of course say trendon notice it come in you know where on the north shore about a mile to the east of here then we 'll cut directly across beg you pardon sir put in congdon but i do not think we can make it from this side sir why not no beach sir and the cliff 's like the side of a ship look to be deep water right into the cave 's mouth back to the boat then bring that flag along the descent be swift at time reckless but the party embark without accident soon they be forge through the water at race speed the boat leap to the impulsion of the sailorman 's strongest motive curiosity and the hope of save a life iv the twin slab within half a hour the gig have reach the mouth of the cave as the coxswain have predict the sea run into the lofty entrance elsewhere the surf fall whitely but through the arch the wave roll unbroken into a heavy stillness only as the boat hover for a moment at the face of the cliff could the explore party hear far within the hollow boom that tell of breaker on a distant subterranean beach run she in easy come the captain 's order keep a sharp lookout for hidden rock to the whisper plash of the oar they move from sunlight into twilight from twilight into darkness of a sudden the oar jerk convulsively a great roar have break upon the ear of the sailor the invisible roof above they the water heave beneath they the wall that hem they in call with a multiplication of resonance upon the name of darrow the boat quiver with the start of its occupant then one or two laugh weakly as they realize that what they have hear be no supernatural voice it be the captain hail for the maroon man no vocal answer come but a indeterminable space away they could hear a low splash follow by a second and a third something cough weakly in front and to the right trendon 's hand go to he revolver the man sit stiffen one of they swear in a whisper and the oath come back upon they echo the name of the savior in hideous sibilance silence in the boat say the captain in such buoyant tone that the man brace themselves against the expect peril light the lantern and pass it to I come the order keep below the gunwale man as the match splutter : do you see something a few rod to port ask the captain in trendon 's ear pair of green light say trendon eye _ seal _ _ seal seal seal _ shout the wall for the surgeon have suddenly release he voice and as the mockery boom the green light disappear and there be more splash from the distance the crew sit up again the lantern spread its radiance it be reflect from battlements of fairy beauty everywhere the wall be set as with gem in broad wale of varied and vivid hue dazzle at first the explorer soon be able to discern the general nature of the subterranean world which they have enter in most place the wall rise sheer and unscaleable from the water in other turretted rock thrust they gleaming crag upward over to starboard a little beach shone with quaker greyness in that spectacular display the end of the cavern be still beyond the area of light must have be a swimmer to get in here comment trendon glancing at the wall unless he have a boat say the captain but why do not he answer better try again no tell how much more there be of this the surgeon raise he ponderous bellow and the cave roar again with the summons silence formidable and unbroken succeed house to house search be now in order he say must be in here somewhere -- unless the seal get he cautiously the boat move forward once she graze on a half submerged rock again a tiny islet loom before she scattered bone glisten on the rocky shore but they be not human relic occasional beach tempt a landing but all of these lead back to precipitous cliff except one from the side of which open two small cave into the first the lantern cast its glare reveal emptiness for the arch be wide and the cave shallow the entrance to the other be so narrow as to send a visitor to he knee but inside it seem to open out moreover there be fish bone at the entrance the captain the surgeon and congdon the coxswain land captain parkinson reach the spot first stoop he thrust he head in at the orifice a sharp exclamation break from he he rise to he foot turn a contorted face to the other poisonous he cry more volcano say trendon he bent to the black hole and sniff cautiously i 'll go in sir volunteer congdon i have have fire-practice my business say trendon briefly decomposition unpleasant but not dangerous push the lantern before he he worm he way until the light be blot out presently it shine forth from the funnel show that the explorer have reach the inner open space captain parkinson drop down and peer in but the evil odour be too much for he he retire gagging and cough trendon be go for what seem a interminable time he superior officer fidget uneasily at last he could stand it no longer dr trendon be you all right he shout yup answer a choke voice cub oud dow again the funnel be darken a pair of foot appear then the surgeon 's chunky trunk he head and the lantern once twice and thrice he inhale deeply phew he gasp think i be tough but -- phee-ee-ee-ew do you find -- no sir not darrow only a poor devil of a seal that crawl in there to die the exploration continue half a mile as they estimate from the open they reach a narrow beach shut off by a perpendicular wall of rock skirt this they return on the other side minutely examine every possible crevice when they again reach the light of day they have arrive at the certain conclusion that no living man be within those wall would a corpse rise to the surface soon in water such as these dr trendon ask the captain might sir might not no tell that the captain ruminate then he beat he fist on he knee the other cave what other cave ask the surgeon the cave where they kill the seal surely exclaim trendon wait though do not slade say it be between here and the point yes beyond the small beach no cave there declare the surgeon positively there must be congdon do you see a opening anywhere in the cliff as we come along no sir this be the only one sir we 'll see about that say the captain grimly head she about skirt the shore as near the breaker as you safely can the gig retrace its journey there be the beach as slade describe it say captain parkinson as they come abreast of the little reach of sand and what be those two bird-roost on it ask trendon see 'em dead against that patch of shore-weed bit of wreckage fix in the sand do not think so sir too well match we have no time to settle the matter now say the captain impatiently we must find that cave if it be to be find hover just outside the final drag of the surf under the skilful guidance of congdon the boat move slowly along the line of beach to the line of cliff all be open as the day the blaze sun pick out each detail of jut and hollow evidently the poisonous vapor from the volcano have not spread they blight here for the face of the precipice be bright with many flower so close in move the boat that its occupant could even see butterfly flutter above the bloom but that which they eager eye seek be still deny they no opening offer in that smile cliff-side not by so much as would admit a terrier do the mass of rock and rubble gape and slade describe the cave as big enough to ram the _ wolverine _ into muttered trendon up to the point of the headland and back pass the boat blank disappointment be the result what be you opinion now dr trendon ask the captain of the older man do not know sir answer the surgeon hopelessly look as if the cave might have be a hallucination i shall have something to say to mr slade on we return say the captain crisply if the cave be a hallucination as you suggest the seal-murder be fiction look so agree the other and the murder of the captain how about that and the mutiny of the man add the surgeon and the killing of the doctor you patient seem to be a romantic genius and the escape of darrow hold hard quoth trendon darrow 's no romance nothing fictional about the flag and ledger true enough say the captain and fall to consideration anyway say trendon vigorously i would like to have a look at those bird - roost mighty like signpost to my mind very well say the captain it 'll cost we only a wet run she in congdon with all the coxswain 's skill and the oarsman 's technique the passage of the surf be a lively one and little driblet of water mark the trail of the officer as they shuffle up the beach the two slab stand less than fifty yard beyond high water tide near they the visitor see that each mark a mound but not until they be close up could they read the neat carve on the first it run as follow : _ here lie _ solomon anderson _ alia _ handy solomon _ who murder he employer he captain and he shipmate and be find dead of he desert on these shore June 5 1904 this slab be erect as a memento of admire esteem by the last of he victim and you can kiss the book on that _ percy darrow _ fecit _ say the surgeon you can kiss the book on _ that _ too then slade be tell the truth apparently seem good corroboration the captain turn to the other mound its slab be carve by the same hand _ sacred to the memory of a ensign of the u s navy whose body wash upon this coast be here bury with all reverence by strange hand whose soul may god rest the sea shall sing he requiem June the sixth mxmiv _ billy edward say the captain very low he uncover the surgeon do likewise so for a space they stand with bare head between the twin grave v the pinwheel volcano the surgeon speak first another point say he darrow be alive within a few day captain parkinson turn slowly away from the grave you be right he say with a effort we business be with the living now the dead must wait hide and seek growled trendon if he be here why do not he show himself the other shake he head place be all trample up with he footprint say trendon he be plod back and forth like a prisoner in a cell the ledger say the captain i would forget it that grave drive everything else out of my mind bring the book here call trendon congdon unwrap it from he jacket and hand it to he the sailor cast curious glance at the two headstone mount guard over mr edward 's grave command the captain the coxswain salute and give a order one of the sailor step forward to the first mound not that one rasp the officer the other the man salute and move on with you permission sir say trendon on a nod from he superior officer he open the ledger and take up darrow 's record here it be entry of June 3d _ everything lovely schooner lose to sight query -- to memory dear not exactly though i should not mind have she under order for a few day queer glow in the sky last night : if they have be investigate they may have get what be come to they volcano exhibit fit of temper spout out considerable fire about nine o'clock quite spectacular but no harm do can foresee short ration of tobacco lava in valley still too hot for comfort no sign of dr schermerhorn still sleep on beach _ not much there sniff trendon go on say the captain _ June 3 evening thick and squally weather again local atmospheric condition seem upset volcano still lead strenuous life climb the headland this afternoon wind very shifty get a occasional whiff of volcanic output one in particular would have send a skunk to the camphor bottle no living on the headland will explore cave to-morrow with a view to domicile have come down to a allowance of seven cigarette per diem June 4 explore cave to-day full of dead seal not only dead but all bitten and cut to piece must have be lively doings in seal-town not much choice between air in the cave and vapor from the volcano bar seal everything suitable for light housekeeping such as mine undertake to clean house drag late lament out into the water some sink and be sweep away by the sea-puss other i regret to say float find trickle of fresh water in depth of cave and little sand-ledge to sleep on so far so good : we may be ` appy yet if only i have my cigarette supply once hear a botanist say that leaf of the white shore-willow make fair substitute for tobacco fair substitute for nux vomica would like to interview say botanist _ the fellow be a tobacco maniac growl trendon feeling in he breast pocket the devil he cry bring forth a empty hand silently the captain hand he a cigar thank you sir he say light it and continue read _ June 5 have a caller to-day climb the headland this morning find volcano take a day off look for sign of _ laughing lass _ notice something heliograph to I from the wave beyond the reef seem to be metal i guess a tin can catch in the swirl it round the cape and i come down to the shore to meet it halfway down the cliff i have a better view i see it be not a tin can there be a dark body under it which the wave be toss about and as the metal move with the body it glint in the sun suddenly it be bear in upon I that a arm be do the signalling wave to I with a sprightly even a jocular friendliness then i see what it really be it be handy solomon and he steel hook he be ride quite high every now and again he would bow and wave he ground gently on the sand beach i plant he promptly first however i remove a bag of tobacco from he pocket poor stuff and water soaked but still tobacco spend a quiet afternoon carve a headstone for the dear depart pity it be that virtue so shine should be uncommemorated idle as the speculation be i wonder who my next visitor will be thrackle i hope evidently some of they have be play the part of pandora spend last night in the cave air quite fresh June 6 see the glow again last night _ the surgeon pause in he reading that would be the night of the 5th : the night before we pick she up empty yes agree captain parkinson that be the night billy edward -- go on _ see the glow again last night do not understand it once should have be enough for they this matter of hoard tobacco may be a sad error if old spitfire keep on the way she have to-day i sha not need much more it would be a raw jest to be burn or swallow up with a month 's supply of unsmoked cigarette on one cave get shaky still i think i 'll stick there as between be burn alive and bury alive i be for the respectable and time honor fashion of interment bombardment be mostly to the east to-day but no tell when it may shift June 7 this morning i find a body rolling in the surf it be the body of a young man large and strongly build dress in the uniform of a ensign of we navy surely a strange visitor to these shore there be no mark of identification upon he except a cigarette case grave with a undecipherable monogram in tiffany 's most illegible style of arrow-headed inscription this i bury with he and stake the grave with a headboard a officer and a gentleman a youth of friendly way and kindly live if one may judge by the face of the dead and he come by the same end to the same goal as handy solomon why not and why should one philosophise in a book that will never be read hold on perhaps -- just perhaps -- it may be read the officer be not long dead ensign of the u s navy do not wander about untraversed water alone there must be a warship somewhere in the vicinity but why then a unburied officer float on the ocean i will smoke upon this luxuriously and plentifully -lrb- later -rrb- no use i can not solve it but one thing i do i put up a signal pole on the headland and cache this record under it this afternoon from day to day with the kindly permission of the volcano i will add to it bad doings by old spitfire the cloud be come down on I also seem to be move along the cliff i will retire hastily to my private estate in the cave _ that be all except the scrawl on the last page say trendon some action of the volcano scare he off he just have time to scrawl that last message and drop the book into the cache the question be do he get back alive i doubt it say the captain we will search the headland for he body but the cave insist the surgeon we ought to have find some sign of he there slade be the solution say the captain we must ask he they put back to the ship barnett be anxiously await they you patient have be in a bad way dr trendon he say what be wrong ask trendon frowning he come up on deck wild-eyed and staggering there be a sheet of paper in he hand which seem to have some bearing on he trouble when he find you have go to the island without he he begin to rage like a maniac i have to have he carry down by force in the rumpus the paper disappear i assume the responsibility of give he a opiate quite right approve trendon i 'll go down will you come with I sir he say to the captain they find slade in profound slumber will not do to wake he now growl trendon hello what be here lie in the hollow of the sick man 's right hand where it have be crush to a ball be a crumpled mass of trace paper trendon smooth it out peer at it and pass it to the captain it be a sketch of a indian arrow-head he exclaim in surprise at the first glance what be all these mark map of the island bark trendon look here the drawing be a fairly careful one show such geographical point as have be of concern to the two-year inhabitant there be the large cavern indicate as they have find it and at a point between it and the headland the legend seal cave but it be wrong cry captain parkinson setting finger to the spot we pass there twice there be no opening no guarantee that there may not have be return the other this island have be considerably shake up lately entrance may have be close by a landslide down the cliff notice sign myself but do not think of it in connection with the cave that be work for barnett then say the captain brighten we 'll blow up the whole face of the cliff if necessary but we 'll get at that cave he hurry out order follow order and soon the gig with the captain trendon and the torpedo expert be drive for the point marked seal cave on the map over which they be bent vi mr darrow receive you say the last entry be June 7th ask barnett as the boat enter the light surf trendon nod that be the night we see the last glow and the big burst from the volcano be not it right the island would have be badly shake up not so violently but that the flag-pole stand say the captain that be true sir but there be be a good deal of volcanic gas go the man 's be pen up for four day give the fellow a chance growl trendon air may be all right in the cave good water there too say so himself by slade 's account he be a pretty capable citizen when it come to look after himself would not wonder if we would find he fit as a fiddle there be no clue to ive and mcguire ask barnett presently none it be the captain who answer the gig grate and the tide be high they wade to the base of the cliff barnett carry he precious explosive aloft in he arm here be the spot say the captain see where the water go in through those crevice open at the top too say trendon he let out he bellow roar darrow 's name i doubt if you could project you voice far into a cave thus block say captain parkinson we 'll try this he draw he revolver and fire the man listen at the crevice of the rock no sound come from within you enterprise mr barnett say the commander with a gesture which turn over the conduct of the affair to the torpedo expert barnett examine the rock with enthusiasm look like moderately easy stuff he observe see how the vein run you could almost blow a design to order in that yes but how about bring down the whole cave oh of course there be always a element of uncertainty when you be deal with high explosive admit the expert but unless i be mistaken we can chop this out as neat as with a axe drop he load of cartridge carelessly upon a flat rock which project from the water he busy himself in a search along the face of the cliff presently with a ah of satisfaction he climb toward a hand 's breadth of platform where grow a patch of purple flower throw I up a knife somebody he call take notice say trendon good-naturedly that i be the botanist of this expedition oh you can have the flower all i want be what they grow in loosen a handful of the dry soil he bring it down and lay it with the explosive next he call one of the sailor to boost he and be soon perch on the flat slant of a huge rock which form as it be the keystone to the blockade let 's see he ruminate we want a slow charge for this one that will exert a widespread pressure without much shatter force the no 3 i think how be that mr barnett ask the captain with lively interest you see sir return the demonstrator perch high like a sculptor at work on some heroic masterpiece what we want be to split off this rock he pat the flank of the huge slab there be a lovely vein run at a angle inward from where i sit split that through and the rock should roll of its own weight away from the entrance it be hold only by the upper projection that run under the arch here neat program comment trendon with a tinge of sardonic scepticism wait and see retorted barnett blithely for he be in he element now i 'll appoint you my assistant just toss I up that cartridge : the third one on the leave the surgeon recoil suppose you do not catch it well suppose i do not it be dynamite be not it something of the same nature joveite it be call still the surgeon stare at he barnett laugh oh you have get the high explosive superstition he say lightly dynamite do not go off as easy as people think you could drop that stuff from the cliffhead without danger have i get to come down for it with a wry face trendon toss up the package it be deftly catch now wet that dirt well put it in the canvas bag yonder and send one of the man up with it i be go to make a mud pie break the package open he spread the yellow powder in a slightly curving line along the rock with the mud he cap this over form a little arched roof to keep it from blow away surmised trendon no to make it blow down instead of blow up oh rot return the downright surgeon that pound of dirt will not make the shadow of a feather 's difference will not it retort the other curious thing about high explosive a mud-cap will hold down the force as well as a ton of rock wait and see what happen to the rock beneath he slide off he perch into the ankle-deep water and wade out to the boat here he burrow for a moment presently emerge with a box this he carry gingerly to a convenient rock and open first he lift out some soft padding a small tin box honey-combed inside come to light with infinite precaution barnett pick out a object that look like a 22 - calibre short cartridge wad some cotton batten in he hand set the thing in the wad lay it on the rock carefully return the small box to the large box and the large box to the boat take up the cartridge again and wade back to the cliff they watch he in silence this be the little devil he say indicate he delicate burden fulminate of mercury this be the stuff that 'll remove you hand with neatness and despatch it be the quickest temper little article in the business just give it one hard look and it be off here say trendon i resign from now on i be a spectator barnett swing the fulminate in he handkerchief and give it to a sailor to hold the man dandle it like a new-born infant back to he rock go barnett produce some cord he let down a end tie the handkerchief on and get out of the way he direct with painful slowness the man carry out the first part of the order the latter half he obey with sprightly alacrity very slowly very delicately the expert draw in he dangerous burden once a current of air puff it against the face of the rock and the operator 's head be hastily withdraw nothing happen another minute and he have the tiny shell in hand a fuse be fix in it and it be shove under the mud-cap barnett stand up will you kindly order the boat ready captain parkinson he call the order be give as soon as i light the fuse i will come down and we 'll pull out fifty yard leave the rest of the joveite where it be all ready here go he touch a match to the fuse it catch for a moment he watch it go all right he report as he strike the water plenty of time some seventy yard out they rest on they oar they wait and wait and wait it be out grunt trendon from the face of the cliff puff a cloud of dust a thud report boom over the water just a wisp of whitish-grey smoke arise and beneath it the great rock with a gap seam across its top roll majestically outward send a shower of spray on all side and open to they eager view a black chasm into the heart of the headland the experiment have work out with the accuracy of a geometric problem that be all sir barnett report officially magic modern magic say the captain he stare at the open door for the moment the object of the undertaking be forget in the wonder of its exact accomplishment darrow 'll think a earthquake 's come after he remark trendon give way order the captain the boat grate on the sand captain parkinson would have enter but barnett restrain he it be best to wait a minute or two he advise occasionally slide follow a explosion tardily and the gas do not always dissipate quickly where they stand they could see but a short way into the cave trendon squat and funnel he hand to one eye -lrb- illustration : sorry not to have meet you at the door he say courteously -rrb- there be fire inside he say in a moment they all see it a single pin-point glow far back in the blackness a cyclopean eye that sway as it approach alternately it wane and brighten suddenly it illuminate the dim lineament of a face the face near they it join itself to reality by a very solid pair of shoulder and a man saunter into the twilit mouth of the cavern remove a cigarette from he lip and give they greet sorry not to have meet you at the door he say courteously it be you that knock be it not yes it rouse I from my siesta they stare at he in silence he blink in the light with unaccustomed eye you will pardon I for not ask you in at once past circumstance have render I -- well -- perhaps suspicious be not too strong a word they notice that he hold a revolver in he hand captain parkinson come forward a step the host half raise he weapon then he drop it abruptly navy man he say in a altered voice i beg you pardon i could not see at first my name be percy darrow i be captain parkinson of the united state cruiser _ wolverine _ say the commander this be mr barnett mr darrow dr trendon mr darrow they shake hand all around like some damned silly afternoon tea trendon say later in retail it to the mess a pause follow will not you step in gentleman say darrow may i offer you the makings of a cigarette would not you be rob yourself inquire the captain with a twinkle oh you find the diary then say darrow easily rather silly of I to complain so but really in condition like these tobacco become a serious problem so one might imagine say trendon drily he look closely at darrow the man 's eye be light and dancing from the nostril two livid line run diagonally such line one might make with a hard blue pencil press strongly into the flesh the surgeon move a little nearer can you give I any news of my friend thrackle ask darrow lightly or the esteem pulz or the scholarly and urbane robinson of ethiopian extraction dead say the captain ah a pity say the other he put he hand to he forehead i have think it probable he face twitch dead very good in fact really er amusing he begin to laugh quite to himself it be not a pleasant laugh to hear trendon catch and shake he by the shoulder drop it he say darrow seem not to hear he dead all dead he repeat and i have outlast 'em god damn 'em i have outlast 'em and he mirth break forth in a strangely shocking spasm trendon lift a hand and strike he so powerfully between the shoulder blade that he all but plunge forward on he face quit it he order again get hold of yourself darrow turn and grip he the surgeon wince with the pain of he grasp i can not gasp the maroon between paroxysm i have be live in hell a black shake shiver hell for god know how long what do you know have you ever be bury alive and again the agony of laughter shake he this then mutter the doctor and the hypodermic needle shot home during the return darrow lay like a log in the bottom of the gig the opiate have do its work consciousness be mercifully dead within he vii the survivor rest and good food quickly bring percy darrow back to he normal poise one inspection satisfied dr trendon that all be well with he he ask to see the captain and that gentleman come to ive 's room which have be assign to the rescue man i hope you have be able to make yourself comfortable say the commander courteously it would be strange indeed if i could not return darrow smile you forget that you have set a savage down in the midst of luxury make yourself free of ive 's thing invite captain parkinson poor fellow he will not use they again i fear one of you man lose ask darrow ah the young officer whose body i find on the beach perhaps no but we have to thank you for that burial say the captain darrow make a swift gesture oh if thanks be go he cry and pause in hopelessness of adequate expression this have be a bitter cruise for we continue the captain he sigh and be silent for a moment there be much to tell and to be tell he resume much agree the other gravely you will want to see slade first i presume say the captain one of you officer whom i have not yet have the pleasure of meet the captain stare slade he say ralph slade apparently there be a miss link or -- i fear i be not wholly myself yesterday for a time possibly something occur that i do not quite take in perhaps we would better wait say captain parkinson with obvious misgive you be not quite rest you will feel more like -- if you do not mind say darrow composedly i would like to get at this thing now i be in excellent understanding i assure you very well i be speaking of the man who act as mate in the _ laugh lass _ the journalist who -- good heaven what arrant stupidity i have to beg you pardon mr darrow it have just occur to I he call himself eagen with you eagen what be this be eagen alive and on this ship we pick he up in a open boat and you say he call himself slade he be ralph slade adventurer and journalist mr barnett know he and vouch for he and he be on we island under a assumed name say darrow in tone that have the smoothness and the rasp of silk rather annoy not good form quite even for a pirate yet i believe he save you life suggest the captain darrow look up sharply why yes he admit so he do i have hope -- he check himself i have think that all of the crew go the same way you do not find any of the other none darrow get to he foot i think i would like to see eagen -- slade -- whatever he call himself i do not know begin the captain it might not be -- he hesitate and stop darrow draw back a little misinterpret the other 's attitude do i understand that i be under restraint he ask stiffly certainly not why should you be well return the other contemplatively it really might be regard as a subject for investigation of course i know only a small part of it but there have certainly be suspicious circumstance piracy there have be : no doubt of that murder too if my intuition be not at fault or at least a disappearance to be account for robbery can not be deny and there be a dead body or two to be properly accredit he look the captain in the eye well you 'll find my story highly unsatisfactory in detail i fancy i merely want to know whether i be to present it as a defense or only a explanation we shall be glad to hear you story when you be ready to tell it -- after you have see mr slade thank you say darrow simply you have hear he yes it need fill in when may i see he that be for dr trendon to say he come to we almost dead i 'll find out the surgeon report slade much better but all a-quiver with excitement hate to put the strain on he say he but he 'll be in a fever till he get this thing off he mind send mr darrow to he after a moment 's consideration darrow say : i should like to have you and dr trendon present captain parkinson while i ask eagen one or two question understand one thing mr darrow say trendon briefly this be not to be a inquisition ah say darrow unmoved i be to be neither defendant nor prosecutor you be to respect the condition of dr trendon 's patient sir say captain parkinson with emphasis outside of that you attitude toward a man who have twice think of you life before he own be for you to determine no little cynicism lurk in darrow 's tone as he say : you have confidence in mr slade alia eagen yes reply captain parkinson in a tone that close that topic still i should be glad to have you gentleman present if only for a moment insist darrow presently perhaps it would be as well -- on account of the patient say the surgeon significantly very well assent the captain the three go to slade 's cabin he be lie prop up in he bunk trendon enter first follow by the captain then darrow here 's you prize slade say the surgeon darrow halt just inside the door with a eager light in he face slade lean forward and stretch out he hand i could not believe it until i see you old man he cry darrow 's eyebrow go up before slade have time to note that there be no response to he outstretched hand the surgeon have jump in and push he roughly back upon he pillow what do you promise he growl you be to lie still be not you and you 'll do it or out we go how be you eagen drawl darrow not eagen i be do with that they have tell you have not they darrow nod be you the only survivor he inquire except yourself the nigger pulz thrackle the captain all drown not the captain they murder he ah say darrow softly and you -- i beg you pardon -- you -- er -- friend dispose of the doctor in the same way handy solomon reply slade with shake lip hell 's get that fiend if there be a hell for human fiend they throw the doctor 's body in the surf you do not notice whether there be any papers if there be they must have be destroy with the body when the lava pour down the valley into the sea the lava : of course assent darrow with elaborate nonchalance well he be a kind old boy a cheerful simple wise old child i would have give my right hand to save he cry slade it be so sudden -- so damnable -- better to have save he than I say darrow he speak with the first touch of feeling that he exhibit i have to thank you for my life eagen -- i beg you pardon : slade it be hard to remember dr trendon arise and captain parkinson with he give you two hour mr darrow say the surgeon no more if he seem exhaust give he one of these powder i 'll look in in a hour at the end of a hour he return slade be lie back on he pillow darrow be talk eagerly confidentially in another hour he come out the whole thing be clear he say to captain parkinson i be ready to report to you this evening say the captain the mess will want to hear yes they will want to hear assented darrow you have have slade 's story i 'll take it up where he leave off and he 'll check I mine be as incredible as -- as slade 's be and it be as true viii the maker of marvel as they have gather to hear ralph slade 's tale so now the deplete mess of the _ wolverine _ group themselves for percy darrow 's sequel slade himself sit directly across from the doctor 's assistant before he lay a paper cover with jot note trendon slouch low in the chair on slade 's right captain parkinson have the other side convenient to darrow 's hand lay the material for cigarette as he talk he roll cylinder after cylinder and between sentence consume they in long satisfying puff first you will want to learn of the fate of you friend and shipmate he begin they be dead one of they mr edward fall to my hand to bury as you know he lie beside handy solomon the other we shall probably not see : any one of a score of ocean current may have sweep they far away the last great glow that you see be the signal of they destruction so the work of a great scientist a potent benefactor of the race a gentle and kindly old heart have bring about the death of you friend and of my enemy the innocent and the guilty the murderer with he plunder the officer follow he duty one and the same end a paltry thing we vaunted science be in the face of such tangled fate he speak low and bitterly then he square he shoulder and he manner become businesslike interrupt I when any point need clear up he say it be a blind trail at best you have the right to see it as plain as i can make it -- with slade 's help cut right in with you question : there 'll be plenty to answer and some never will be answer now let I get this thing lay out clearly in my own mind you first see the glow -- let I see -- night of June 2d say barnett June 2d agree darrow that be the end of solomon thrackle & co a very surprising end to they if they have time to think he add grimly surprising enough from the survivor 's viewpoint say slade doubtless they have have that story from you i need not go over it this ship pick up the _ laugh lass _ desert and put you first crew aboard that night be it not you see the second pillar of fire barnett nod so you man meet they death then come the second finding of the empty schooner captain parkinson they must have be brave man who face the unknown terror of that prodigy they volunteer sir say the captain with simple pride darrow bow with a suggestion of reverence in the slow movement of he head and that night -- or be it two night later -- you see the last appearance of the portent well i shall come to that slade have tell you how they live on the beach with we in the valley it be different almost from the first i be alone the doctor cease to be a companion he cease to be human almost a machine that be what he be he one human instinct be -- well distrust he whole force of be be centre on he discovery it be to make he the foremost scientist of the world the foremost individual entity of he time -- of all time possibly even to outline it to you would take too much time light heat motive power in incredible degree and under such control as have never be know : these be to be the agency at he call the push of a button the turn of a screw -- oh he be to be master of such power as no monarch ever wield riches -- pshaw riches be the least of it he could create they practically but they would be superfluous power : unlimited absolute power be he goal with he end achieve he could establish a autocracy a dynasty of science : whatever he choose oh it be a rich-hued golden glowing dream a dream such as man 's soul do not formulate in these stale day -- not we kind of man the teutonic mysticism -- you understand and it be all true oh quite do you mean we to understand that he have this power you describe ask captain parkinson in he grasp then come a practical gentleman with a steel hook a follower of dream too in he way conflict interest -- you know how it be one well-aimed blow from the more practical dreamer and the greater vision pass i be get ahead of myself just a moment he cigarette glow fiercely in the dimness before he take up he tale again you all know who dr schermerhorn be none of you know -- i do not know myself though i have be he factotum for ten year -- along how many vary line of activity that mind play one of they be the secret of energy : concentrated resistless energy man 's contrivance be too puny for he the most powerful engine he regard as toy for a time high explosive claim he attention he want to harness they once he get to the point of practical experiment you can see the ruin yet : a hole in southern new jersey nobody ever understand how he escape but there he be on he foot across a ten-foot fence in a ploughed field -- yes he fly the fence -- and run run furiously in the opposite direction when the dust clear away someone stop he finally tell he the danger be over ` yet i will not return ' he say firmly and faint away that disgust he with high explosive what secret he discover he give to the government they be not without value i believe they be not indeed corroborate barnett next he interest turn to the natural phenomenon of high energy he study lightning in a open steel network laboratory with few result save a succession of rheumatic attack and a improve electric interrupter since adopt by one of the great telegraph company the former obliged he to stop these experiment and the invention he consider trivial probably the great problem of get at the secret of energy lead he into he attempt to study the mysterious electrical wave radiate by lightning flash at any rate he be soon as deep into the subject of electrical science as he countryman hertz have ever be he use to tell I that he often wonder why he have not take up this line before -- the world of energy he now set out to explore wave in that tremendous range between those we hear and those we see it be natural that he should then come to the most prominent radio-active element uranium thorium and radium but though he knowledge surpass that of the much-exploited authority he be never satisfy with any of he result ` pitchblende no ' he would exclaim ` it have not the great power the mine be not deep enough yet ' then suddenly the great idea that be to bring he success and cost he he life come to he the bowels of the earth must hold the secret he take up volcano do all this sound foolish it be not if you know the man he be a mighty enthusiast a bear martyr not cold-blooded like the rest of we the fire be in he vein a light please thank you we chase volcano there be a theory under it all he believe that volcanic emanation be cause by a mighty and uncomprehended energy something that achieve result ascribable neither to explosion nor heat some eternal inner source radium if you choose only he do not call it that radium itself as know to we modern scientist he regard as the harmless plaything of people with time hang heavy on they hand he be not after force in pin-point quantity : he want bulk result yet i believe that after all what he seek be a sort of higher power of radium the phenomenon be related and he have some of that concentrated essence of pitchblende in the chest when we start oh not much : say about twenty thousand dollar ' worth maybe thirty for use no rather for comparison i judge yes we chase volcano i become use to camping between sample hell of all know variety i get so that the fume of a sulphur match seem like a draught of pure fresh air wherever any of the earth 's pimple show sign of come to a head there be we take part in the trouble by and by the doctor get so thoroughly poison that he have to lay off back to philadelphium we come there a aged seafaring person temporarily strand mulct the professor of a dollar -- a undertaking that require no art -- and in the course of he recital touch upon yonder little cesspool of infernal iniquity a uncharted volcanic island : one that he could have all for he own you may guess whether dr schermerhorn be interested ` that iss for which we haf so-long-in-vain seek percy ' he say to I in he quaint link-chain style of speech ' a leedle prifate volcano - laboratory to ourselves to have totally unknown : undescribed not-on-the - chart-to-be-found to-morrow we start i make a list of the things-to - get ' he begin he list as i remember with three dozen undershirt a gallon of pennyroyal for insect bite a box of assorted fish hook thirty pound of tea and a case of carpet tack when i have not anything else to worry over i use to lie awake at night and speculate on the purpose of those carpet tack he have something in mind : if there be anything on which he pride himself it be he practical bent but the list never get any further : it cease short of one page in the ledger as you may have notice i outfit by telegraph on the way across the continent the doctor do not ask I whether i would go he take it for grant that be probably why i do not back out nor do i tell he that the three life insurance company which have foolishly and trustingly accept I as a risk merely on the strength of a good constitution be make frantic effort to compromise on the policy they feel hurt those company : my healthy condition have cease to appeal to they what be a good constitution between earthquake no there be no use tell the doctor it would only have worry he besides i do not believe that the island be there i think it be a myth of that stranded ancient mariner 's imagination when it rise to sight at the proper spot none be more astounded than the bad risk who now address you yet i must say for the island that it come handsomely up to specification down where you be slade you do not get a real insight into its disposition but in back of we there be any kind of action for you money geyser hell-spouts fume fissure cunning little craterlet with half-portion of molten lava ready to serve hot more gas than you could create in all the world 's chemical laboratory : in fact everything to make the place a paradise for old nick -- and dr schermerhorn he bring along in he precious chest besides the radium some sort of raw material : also as near as i could make out a sort of cage or guardianship scheme for he concentrated essence of cussedness when he should get it out of the volcano in the first seven month he putter around the little fumer with a occasional excursion up to the main crater it be my duty to follow on and drag he away when he fall unconscious sometimes i would try to get he before he be quite go then he would become indignant and fight I perhaps that help to lose I he confidence more and more he withdraw into himself there be day when he speak no word to I it be lonely do you know why i use to visit you at the beach slade i suppose you think i be keep watch on you it be not that it be loneliness in a way it hurt I too : for one could not help but be fond of the old boy and at time it seem as if he be not quite himself pardon I if i may trouble you for the match thanks matter go very wrong at time : the doctor fume like he little crater growl out long-winded exhaustive german imprecation : would not even eat then again the demon of work would drive he with thong and spur : he would rush to he crater to he laboratory to he ledger for the purpose of enter unintelligible commentary he have some peculiar contrivance like a misshapen retort with which he collect gas from the craterlet whenever i would hear one of those smash i know it be a bad day meantime the volcano also become -- well what you might call temperamental it get to be a year and a quarter -- a year and a half i wonder whether we should ever get away my tobacco be run short and the bearing of the man be become fidgetty my visit to the beach become quite interesting -- to I one day the doctor come run out of he laboratory with so bright a face that i venture to ask he about departure ` not so long now percy ' he say in he old kind manner ` not so long the first real success it iss make we have yet under-entire - control to bring it but it iss make ' ` and about time sir ' say i ` if we do not do something soon we may have trouble with the man ' ` so ' say he in surprise ` but they could do nothing nothing ' he wag he great head confidently ` we be arm ' ` oh yes arm so be they ' ` we be arm ' he repeat obstinately ` such as no man be ever arm be we arm ' he check himself abruptly and walk away well i have since wonder what would have happen have the man attack we it would have be worth see and -- and surprising yes : i be quite certain it would have be surprising perhaps too i might have learn more of the great secret and yet i do not know it be all dark a hint here theory mere glint of light where do i put ah thank you ix the achievement for some moment darrow sit gaze fixedly at the table before he he cigarette tip glow and fail someone suggest drink the captain ask darrow what he would have but the question go unnoted how i pass the next six month i could hardly tell you he begin again quite abruptly at time i be bore -- fearfully bore yet the element of mystery of uncertainty of underlie peril give a certain zest to the affair in the period of dulness i find some amusement in visit the lower camp and bait the nigger slade will have tell you about he he possess quite a fund of bastard voodooism : he possess more before i get through with he yes if he have live to return to he country i fancy he would have add considerably to afro-american witch - lore you remember the vampire bat slade and the devil-fire naturally i do not mention to you that the devil-fire business be not altogether as clear to I as i pretend it be not though but at the time it serve very well as a amusement all the while i realize that my self - entertainment be not without its element of danger too : i remember glance not altogether friendly but always a little doubtful a little awed even handy solomon practical as he be have a scruple or two of superstition in he make-up on which one might work only eagen -- slade i mean -- be beyond I there you puzzle I not a little in those day slade well do i say that i be sometimes annoy by the doctor 's attitude yes : it seem that he might have give I a little more of he confidence but one can not judge such a man as he be among the ordinary affair of life he have rely on I for every detail now he be independent of I independent i doubt if he remember my existence at time even in he blackest mood of depression he be sufficient unto himself it be strange how he do rage the day the chemical from washington go wrong i be wash my shirt in the hot water spring when he come bolt out of the laboratory and keel I over i come out pretty indignant apologise not at all he just sputter he nearest approach to coherence seem to indicate a desire that i should go back to washington at once and destroy a perfectly reputable firm of chemist finally he calm down and take it out in enter it in he daily record he be quite proud of that daily record and remember to write in it on a average of once a week then the chest go wrong whether it have rust a bit or whether the chemical have get in they work on the hinge i do not know but one day the professor of he own initiative recognize my existence by lug he box out in the open and ask I to fix it previously he have empty it it be rather a complicated thing with a inner compartment over which be a hollow cover open along one rim that i conjecture be design to hold some chemical compound or salt there be many minor opening too each guard by a similar hollow door my business be with the heavy top cover ` it should shut and open softly gently ' explain the professor ` so not with-a-grating-sound-to-be-accompanied ' he add with he curious effect of link phraseology half a day 's work fix it the lid would stand open of itself until tip at a considerable angle when it would fall and lock only on the outer shell be there a lock : that one be a good bit of craftsmanship ` so percy my boy ' say the doctor kindly ` that will with-sufficient - safety guard we treasure when we obtain it percy when it entirely - finished-and-completed shall be ' ` and when will that be ' i ask ` god know ' he say cheerfully ` it progress ' whenever i go stroll at night he would produce he curious light sometimes they be fairly startling one fact i make out by accident look down from a high place they do not project from the laboratory he always work in the open when the light be to be produce once the experiment take a serious turn the light have flicker and go dr schermerhorn have return to he laboratory i come up the arroyo as he fling the door open and rush out he be a grotesque figure clothe in a undershirt and a worn pair of trousers fasten with a old bit of tar rope in lieu of he suspenders which i have be repair about he waist flicker a sort of aura of radiance which be extinguish as he fling himself headforemost into the cold spring i haul he out he seem daze to my question he reply only by mumbling the burden of which be : ' i do not understand it be a not-to-be-comprehended accident ' it appear that he do not quite know why he have take to the water or if he do he do not want to tell next day he be as good as new just as silent as before but it be a smile satisfied silence so it go for week for month with the access of depression and anger always rarer then come a afternoon when return from a stalk after sheep i hear strange and shocking noise from the laboratory strict as be the embargo which keep I outside the door i burst in only to be seize in a suffocating grip of a sudden i realize that i be be embrace the doctor flourish a hand above my head and jig with ponderous step the dismal noise continue to emanate from he mouth he be sing i wish i could give you a notion of the amazement the paralyse wonder with which no you do not know dr schermerhorn : you would not understand we polka into the open there he cast I loose he stop singing and burst into a rhapsody of disjointed word mostly german it be -- a wondrous jumble of the scientific and poetic ` eureka ' occur at interval then he would leap in the air it be weird it be distressing crazy oh quite for the time you understand if any of we should suddenly become the most potent individual in the world would not he be apt to lose balance temporarily one must make allowance there be excuse for the doctor he have reach the goal ` percy you shall be reward ' he say ` you haf like-a-trump-card stick by I you shall haf riches gold what you will you be young you blood run red with such riches nothing be beyond you you could the ancient-tombs-of-egypt explore it be open to you such collections-as - have-never-been-gathered to make what shall it be scarab missal prehistoric implement amuse yourself _ mein kind _ we shall be able the - bills-with-usurious-interest to pay what will you haf ' i say i would like a vacation if convenient ` presently ' he reply ` there yet remain the guardianship to be perfect then to-a-world-astonished-and-respectful we return to-night we celebrate i play you a rubber of pinochle ' we play with the greatest secret of science rest at we elbow we play the doctor win my mind be not strictly on the game in the morning the doctor sing once more i shall never hear its like again be it a week or a month after that i can not remember i fancy i be excite then too there be something in the atmosphere about the laboratory i do not know imagination possibly once we have a little manifestation : the night that the nigger and slade be terrify by the rock fire day of excitement and pleasant work with the little volcano grumble more sulkily all the time i have spend worse day such indifference as the doctor display toward the volcano i have never know if i ventured to warn he he would assure I that there be no cause for alarm i think he regard that little hell 's kitchen as merely a feed-spout for he vast enterprise he feel a sort of affection toward it he be tolerant of its petty fit of temper that he complete he work before the destruction come be sheer luck nothing else the day before the outburst he come to I with a tiny phial of complicated design ` percy i will at-a-reasonable-price sell this to you ' he say ` how much ' i inquire respond to he playfulness ' a bargain ' he cry gaily ` five million dollar no shall i upon-a - needy-friend hard-press never one million one little million dollar ' ' i have not that amount with I ' i begin ` of no account ' he declare airily ` soon we shall haf many more time as that gif I you co d' ` my i o u ' i inquire ` it make no matter see i will gif it to you gratis ' he hand I the metal contrivance it be close ` inside iss a little such a very little not yet iss it arrange the motive-power to give-forth one more change-to-be-made that shall require but the other phenomenon be all in this little half-grain comprise later i shall tell you more take it it iss without price ' he lay he hand on my shoulder ` like the love of friend ' he say gently feeling in he upper waistcoat pocket darrow bring out a phial so tiny that it roll in the palm of he hand he contemplate it lose in think radium query barnett with the keen interest of the scientist god know what it be say darrow rousing himself not the perfect product the doctor say that when he give it to I if i could remember one-tenth of what he tell I that night it be like a disorder dream a phantasmagoria of monstrous power light up with a intolerable almost a infernal radiance this much i do gather : that dr schermerhorn have achieve what the greatest mind before he have barely outline yes and more becquerel the curie rutherford -- they be play with the letter of the greek alphabet alpha gamma and rho while the simple gentle old boy that i serve have read the secret from the molten eruption of the rack earth he have take gas and potency that be nameless by what method of combination and refining i do not know he produce something that be to be the final word of power control -- control -- that be all that lack reduce to its simplest term it mean this : the doctor have something as much greater than radium as radium be greater than the pitchblende of which a thousand ton be melt down to the one ounce of extract and the incredible energy of this he propose to divide into department of activity one manifestation should be light a light that would illuminate the world another be to make motive power so cheap that the work of the world could be do in a hour out of the day some idea he have of healing property yes he be to cure mankind or kill kill as no man have ever kill do he choose the army and navy of the power would be at he mercy magnetism be to be he slave aerial navigation transmutation of metal the screening of gravity -- do this sound like delirium sometimes i think it be that night he turn over to I the key of the large chest and he ledger the latter he bid I read it be a complete jumble you have see it we be up a good part of the night with we pet volcano it be suffer from internal disturbance ` so ' the doctor would say indulgently when a particularly active rock come bound down we way ` little play-antics-to-exhibit now that the work iss finish ' in the morning he insist on my leave he alone and go down to give the order i take the ledger intend to send it aboard it save my life possibly : solomon 's bullet deflect slightly i think in pass through the heavy paper slade have tell you about my flight i ought to have go straight up the arroyo yet i could hardly have make it i do not see he again the doctor my last glimpse the old man -- i remember now how the gray have spread through he beard -- he be grow old -- it have be ageing labor he stand there at he laboratory door and the mountain spout and thunder behind ` we will a name-to-suit-properly gif it ' he say as i leave he ` it shall make we as the god we will call it celestium ' i leave he there smile smile happily the greatest force of he age -- if he have live very wise very simple -- a kind old child may i trouble you for a light thanks x the doom nothing remain but to search for he body i be sure they have kill he and take the chest i have little expectation of find he dead or alive none after i see the stream of lava pour into the sea one save he own life by instinct i suppose there i be i have to live it do not matter much but i continue to do it by various shift that last day on the headland the fume nearly get I you may have note the rather excited scrawl in the back of the ledger yes i think i be go that time but i get to the cave it be low tide then the earthquake and i be wall in mr barnett 's very accurate explosive -- slade 's insistence -- you risk you life as you do mite on the crust of a red-hot cheese -- i hope you know how i feel about it all one can not thank a man properly for the life oh the pirate necessarily it must be a matter of theory but i think we have it right slade and i build it up for what it be worth here it be let I see : you sight the glow on the night of the 2d next day come the desert ship it must have puzzle you outrageously it do say captain parkinson drily not a easy problem even with all the datum at hand you of course have none on slade 's show handy solomon and he worthy associate think they have a chest full of riches when they get the doctor 's treasure believe they own the machinery for make diamond or gold or what-not of ready-to-hand wealth it be fair to assume a certain eagerness on they part disturbed weather keep they busy until they be well out from the island then to the chest open it be not so easy : i have the key you know he bring a curious and delicately work skeleton from he pocket tip with platinum he observe rather a gem of a key i think you see there must have be some action even through the keyhole or he would not have use a metal of this kind but the crew be rich in certain quality it seem which i fail stupidly to recognize in my acquaintance with they both pulz and perdosa appear to have be handy man where lock be concern first pulz sneak down and have he turn at the chest he get it open small profit for he in that : the next we know of he he be scandalise handy solomon by have a fit on the deck that be what i could not figure out to save my life say slade eagerly if you recollect i tell you of the professor 's plunge in the cold spring in a sort of paroxysm one day say darrow that be the physiological action of the celestium at other time i have see he come out and deliberately roll in the creek head under once he explain that the medium he work in cause a kind of uncontrollable longing for water something have none of the quality of burning or thirst but a irresistible temporary mania it worry he a good deal he do not understand it that then be what ail pulz when he open the chest there be as i surmise a trifling quantity of this stuff lie in the inner lid it be not the celestium itself as i imagine but a sort of by - product with the physiological and radiant effect of the real thing and it have be set there on guard a discouragement to the spirit of investigation as it be so when the top be lift we little guardian get in its work produce the light phenomenon that so puzzle slade and inspiring pulz with a passion for the roll wave which be only interrupt by handy solomon 's tackle he as he flee he must have pull down the cover he do say slade i hear the clang but i see the radiance on the cloud and the whole thickness of a solid oak deck be in between the sky and the chest oh a little thing like a oak deck would not interrupt the kind of ray the doctor use he have he own method of screening you understand however this inconsiderable guardian affair must have use itself up which true celestium would not have do so when perdosa set he genius for lock-picking to the task the inner box full of the genuine article have no warning sign-post so to speak everything 's peaceful until they raise the compound-filled hollow layer of the inner cover which serve to interrupt the action then come the general exit and the superior firework that be when the ray run through the ship say slade it seem to follow the deck-line the stuff have a strange affinity for tar say darrow i tell you of the circle of fire about professor schermerhorn 's waist the day he give I such a scare that be the celestium work on the tar rope he wear for a belt it make a livid circle on he skin do i tell you of he experiment with pitch it do not matter where be i at the place where we all jump say slade oh yes and you dive into the small boat try to reach the water wait a bit say barnett if that be the exhibition of radiance we see it die out in a few minute how be that do they close the chest before they run probably not reply darrow slade speak of pulz take to the maintop and be shake out by the sudden shock of a wave that may have be a volcanic billow whatever it be it undoubtedly heel the ship sufficiently to bring down both lid which be rather delicately balanced yes for billy edward find the chest close and lock say barnett of course it be a spring lock you send mr edward and he man aboard no such expert as pulz or perdosa be in you crew consequently it take longer to get the chest open when at length the lid be raise there be a repetition of the tragedy mr edward and he man leap probably they be paralyse almost before they strike the water you bo 'n whom slade pick up be the only one who have time even to grab a life preserver before the impulse toward water become irresistible there be no element of fright you understand : no desertion of they post they be drag as by the sweep of a tornado darrow speak direct to captain parkinson if there be any feeling among you other than sorrow for they death it be unjust and unworthy thank you mr darrow return the captain quietly we find the chest close again when the empty ship come back observe barnett be masterless the schooner begin to yaw continued darrow the first time she come about would have heel she enough to shut the chest now come the turn of you other man ive and mcguire say the captain as darrow pause the glow come again that night and the next day we pick up slade say barnett you know what the glow mean for you companion say darrow but the ship the _ laugh lass _ man she be vanish no one have see she since you be wrong there say darrow i have see she in a common impulse the little circle lean to he yes i have see she i wish i have not let I bring my story back to the cave on the island after the volcanic gas have drive I to the refuge i sit near the mouth of the cave look out into the darkness that be the night of the 7th the night you see the last glow it be very dark except for occasional burst of fire from the crater judge of my incredulous amazement when in a access of this illumination i see plainly a schooner hardly a mile off shore come in under bare pole under bare pole cry slade the halliard must have disintegrate from some slow action of the celestium it could be destructive : terrifically destructive you shall judge there be the schooner naked as you hand possibly i might have think it a hallucination but for what come after darkness fall again i suppose then that handy solomon 's crew be manage -- or mismanage -- the _ laugh lass _ without the aid of they leader whom i have satisfactorily bury i hope they would come ashore on the rock yes i be vengeful then of a sudden there spring from the darkness a ship of light you have all see those great electric effect at exposition someone touch a button you know it be like that only that the piercingly brilliant jewelled wonder of a ship be set in the midst of a swirl of vari-coloured radiance such as i can not begin to describe you see it from a distance imagine what it be come close upon you that way -- dead on out of the night a living glory a living terror he voice sink with a shake hand he fumble amid he cigarette papers it come on a human figure glowing like a diamond ablaze leap out from it another shoot down from the foremast i do not know how many i see go it be like a theatric effect unreal unconvincing incredible the end fit it darrow 's eye rove it fall upon a quaintly modelled ship hang above the door what be that he cry fool thing some malay give I grunt trendon pretend to be grateful because i cut he foot off no good go on with the story no good you do not care what happen to it mean to heave it overboard before now growl the other someone hand it down to darrow if i have something to hold enough water mutter he i would like to float it i would like to see for myself how it work out i would like to see that devil-work in action he speak feverishly boy fill the portable rubber tub in mr forsythe 's cabin and bring it here order the captain that will do say darrow recover himself he float the model in the tub now i do not know how this will come out he say nor do i know why the _ laugh lass _ meet she fate under ive and mcguire and not before perhaps the chest lay open longer long enough anyway we 'll try it from he pocket he take a curious small phial be that what dr schermerhorn give you ask slade yes say darrow he set it carefully inside the little model and slip a lever slade quietly turn down the light a faint glow shoot up it grow bright and eddy in lovely variant color as if set to a powder train it run through the ship the pale face of the spectator shine ghastly in its radiance from someone burst a sudden gasp there be not enough for danger say darrow quietly as a point of interest grunt trendon everyone look at he outstretched hand a little pocket compass lay in the palm the needle spin madly project blue vivid sparkling my god cry slade and cover he eye for a moment he snatch away he hand as a suppress cry go up from the other as i expect say darrow quietly the little craft open out it disintegrate all that radiance dissolve and with its go the substance upon which it shape itself vanish the last glow show a formless pulp spreading upon the water so pass the _ laugh lass _ say darrow solemnly and the chest be at the bottom of the sea say barnett good place for it mutter trendon in all probability it close as the ship dissolve around it say darrow otherwise we should see the effect in the water it might be recover cry slade excitedly could you chart it darrow think of the possibility -- let it lie say the captain have it not cost enough let it lie the water in the tub fume and sparkle faintly and be still darkness fall except where darrow 's cigarette point glow and fade the end end of the
