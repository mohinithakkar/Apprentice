during the earlier period of the present war and now collect together for publication do not -- as will be evident to the reader -- pretend to any sort of completeness in they embrace of the subject or finality in its presentation rather they be scatter thought suggest by the large and tangled drama which we be witness and i be sufficiently conscious that they expression involve contradiction as well as repetition the truth be that affair of this kind -- like all the _ great _ issue of human life love politics religion and so forth do not at they best admit of final dispatch in definite view and phrase they be too vast and complex for that it be indeed quite probable that such thing can not be adequately represent or put before the human mind _ without _ logical inconsistency and contradiction but -lrb- perhaps for that very reason -rrb- they be the subject of the most violent and dogmatic difference of opinion nothing people quarrel about more bitterly than politics -- unless it be religion : both be subject of which all that one can really say for certain be -- that nobody understand they when as in the present war a dozen or more nation enter into conflict and hurl at each other accusation of the angriest sort -lrb- often quite genuinely make and yet absolutely irreconcilable one with another -rrb- and when on the top of that score and hundred of writer profess to explain the result situation in a few brief phrase -lrb- but unfortunately they explanation be all different -rrb- and calmly affix the blame on russium or germany or france or england -- just as if these name represent certain responsible individual suppose for the purpose of the argument to be of very wily and far-scheming disposition -- whereas it be perfectly well know that they really represent most complex whirlpool of political force in which the merest accident -lrb- as whether two member of a cabinet have quarrel or a ambassador 's dinner have disagree with he -rrb- may result in a long and fatal train of consequence -- it become obvious that all so-called explanation -lrb- though it may be right that they should be attempt -rrb- fall infinitely short of the reality -lrb- 1 -rrb- feeling thus the impossibility of deal at all adequately with the present situation i have prefer to take here and there just a aspect of it for consideration with a view especially to the difference between germany and england i have think that instead of spending time over recrimination one might be on safer ground by try to get at the root-cause of this war -lrb- and other war -rrb- thus make one 's conclusion to some degree independent of a multitude of detail and accident most of which must for ever remain unknown to we there be in general four rather well-marked species of war -- religious war race war war of ambition and conquest and war of acquisition and profit -- though in any particular case the four species may be more or less mingle the religious and the race motive often go together but in modern time on the whole -lrb- and happily -rrb- the religious motive be not so very dominant war of race of ambition and of acquisition be however still common enough yet it be noticeable as i frequently have occasion to remark in the follow papers that it only very rarely happen that any of these war be start or set in motion by the mass-people themselves the mass-people at any rate of the more modern nation be quiescent peaceable and disincline for strife why then do war occur it be because the urge to war come not from the mass of a nation but from certain class within it in every nation since the dawn of history there have be find beside the toiling mass three great main clique or class the religious the military and the commercial it be so in far-back ancient indium it be so now each of these class endeavor in its turn -- as one might expect -- to become the ruling class and to run the government of the nation the government of the nation thus become class-government and it be one or another of these class that for reason of its own alone or in combination with another class foment war and set it go in say this i do not by any means wish to say anything against the mere existence of class in itself in a sense that be a perfectly natural thing there _ be _ different division of human activity and it be quite natural that those individual whose temperament call they to a certain activity -- literary or religious or mercantile or military or what not -- should range themselves together in a caste or class just as the different function of the human body range themselves in definite organ and such grouping in class may be perfectly healthy _ provide the class so create subordinate itself to the welfare of the nation _ but if the class do _ not _ subordinate itself to the general welfare if it pursue its own end usurp governmental power and dominate the nation for its own use -- if it become parasitical in fact -- then it and the nation inevitably become diseased as inevitably as the human body become diseased when its organ instead of supply the body 's need become the tyrant and parasite of the whole system it be this class-disease which in the main drag the nation into the horror and folly of war and the horror and folly of war be the work out and expulsion on the surface of evil which have long be fester within how many time in the history of civilization have a bigoted religious clique or a swollen-headed military clique or a greedy commercial gang -- care not one jot for the welfare of the people commit to its charge -- drag they into a senseless and ruinous war for the satisfaction of its own suppose interest it be here and in this direction -lrb- which search deeper than the mere weigh and balance of foreign policy and diplomacy -rrb- that we must look for the explanation of the war of to-day and even race war -- which at first sight seem to have little to do with the class trouble -- illustrate the truth of my contention for they almost always arise from the hatred generate in a nation by a alien class establish itself in the midst of that nation -- establish itself maybe as a governmental or dominant class -lrb- generally a military or landlord clique -rrb- or maybe as a parasitical or compete class -lrb- as in the case of the jew in europe and the japanese in america and so forth -rrb- they arise like all other war from the existence of a class within the nation which be not really in accord with the people of that nation but be pursue its own interest apart from theirs in the second of the follow papers the root of the great war i have draw attention to the influence of the military and commercial class especially in germany and the way in which they policy come into conflict with a similar policy in the other western nation have inevitably lead to the present embroilment in eastern europe similar cause be at work but there the race element -- and even the religious -- constitute a more important factor in the problem by a curious fatality germany have become the center of this great war and world-movement which be undoubtedly destine -- as the german themselves think though in a way quite other than they think -- to be of vast importance and the beginning of a new era in human evolution and the more one consider germany 's part in the affair the more one see i think that from the combined influence of she historical antecedent and she national psychology this fatality be to be expect in roughly put together these antecedent element and influence i have entitle the chapter the case _ for _ germany because on the principle of _ tout comprendre _ the fact of the evolution be inevitable constitute she justification the nation can not fairly complain of she have move along a line which for a century or more have be slowly and irresistibly prepare for she on the other hand the nation do complain of the manner and the method with which at the last she have precipitate and conduct the war -- as indeed they have show by so widely combine against she however right from the point of view of destiny and necessity germany may be she have apparently from the point of view of the moment put herself in the wrong and the chapter deal with this phase of the question i have call the case _ against _ germany whatever further complication and postponement may arise there will certainly come a time of recovery and reconstruction on a wide and extend scale over europe and a large part of the world to even outline this period would be impossible at present but in the sixth chapter and the last as well as in the intermediate piece i have give some suggestion towards this future healing of the nation \* \* \* \* \* the evil -- huge and monstrous as it be -- be not senseless one may feel sure even now here in england one perceive a extraordinary pull together and brace up of the people a development of solidarity and mutual helpfulness a greater seriousness and a disregarding of artificiality which be all to the good these thing be gain even though the way of they manifestation be through much of enmity and ignorance and one may fairly suppose that similar result be traceable in the other nation concerned wound and death may seem senseless and needless but those who suffer they do not suffer in vain all these shatter experience whether in a nation 's career or in the career of a individual cause one -- they force one -- to look into the basis of life and to get nearer its reality if in this case the experience of the war and the fire which the nation be pass through serve to destroy and burn up much of falsity in they respective habit and institution we shall have to admit that the attendant disaster have not be all loss -- even though at the same time we admit that if we have have a grain of sense we might have mend we falsity in far more economical and sensible fashion if in the follow page -- chiefly concern as they be with germany and england -- i have seem to find fault with either party or to affix blame on one or the other it be not necessary to suppose that one harbor ill-feeling towards either or that one fail to recognize the splendid devotion of both the combatant two nation so closely related as the german and the english can not really be so hopelessly different in temperament and character and a great deal of the suppose difference be obviously artificial and class-made for the occasion still there _ be _ difference and as we both think we be right and as we be unable to argue the matter out in a rational way there seem to be nothing for it but to fight war have often be speak of as a great game and mr jerome k jerome have lately write eloquently on that subject it be a game in which the two party agree so to speak to differ they take side and in default of any more rational method resort to the arbitrament of force the stake be high and if on the one hand the game call forth a immense amount of resource skill alertness self-control endurance courage and even tenderness helpfulness and fidelity on the other hand it be liable to let loose pretty bad passion of vindictiveness and cruelty as well as to lead to a awful accumulation of mental and physical suffering and of actual material loss to call war the great game may have be all very well in the more rudimentary war of the past but to-day when every horrible invention of science be conjure up and utilize for the express purpose of blow human body to bit and strew battlefield with human remains and the human spirit itself can hardly hold up against such a process of mechanical slaughter the term have cease to be applicable the affection and the conscience of mankind be too violently outrage by the spectacle and a great mass of feeling be form which one may fairly hope will ere long make this form of strife impossible among the more modern people still even now as mr jerome himself contend the term be partly justify by a certain fine feeling of which it be descriptive and which be indeed very noticeable in all rank whether in the army or navy among bluejacket or private soldier or officer the feeling be certainly very much that of a big game -- with its own rule of honor and decency which must be adhere to and carry on with extraordinary fortitude patience and good-humour whether it arise from the mechanical nature of the slaughter or from any other cause the fact remain that among we fight people to-day -- at any rate in the west -- there be very little feeling of _ hatred _ towards the enemy it be difficult indeed to hate a foe whom you do not even see chivalry be not dead and at the least cessation of the stress of conflict the tendency to honor opponent to fraternize with they to succor the wound and so forth assert itself again and chivalry demand that what feeling of this kind we credit to ourselves we should also credit to the other party in the game we do cordially credit they to we french and belgian ally and if we do not credit they quite so cordially to the german that be _ partly _ at least because every lapse from chivalrous conduct on the part of we opponent be immediately fasten upon and make the most of by we press chivalry be by no means dead in the teutonic breast though the sentiment have certainly be obscure by some modern german teaching while these present war-producing condition last we have to face they candidly and with as much good sense as we can command -lrb- which be for the most part only little -rrb- we have to face they and make the best of they -- though by no means to encourage they perhaps after all even a war like the present one -- monstrous as it be -- do not denote so great a deviation of the old earth from its appoint orbit as we be at first inclined to think under normal condition the death on we planet -lrb- and many of they exceedingly linger and painful -rrb- continue at the rate of rather more than one every second -- say 90000 a day the worst battle can not touch such a wholesale slaughter as this life at its normal best be full of agonizing and endless toil and suffering what matter what _ it be really there for _ be that we should learn to conduct it with dignity courage goodwill -- to transmute its dross into gold if war _ have _ to continue yet for a time there be still plenty of evidence to show that we can wrest -- even from its horror and insanity -- some thing that be worth while and among other the priceless jewel of human love and helpfulness footnote : -lrb- 1 -rrb- some people take great pleasure in analyze white book and gray book and orange book and yellow book without end and prove this or that from they -- as of course out of such a mass of material they can easily do accord to they fancy but when one remember that almost all the document in these book have be write with a _ view _ to they later publication and when one remember also that however incompetent diplomatist as a class may be no one suppose they to be such fool as to entrust they _ most _ important _ entente _ and understanding with each other to print record -- why one come to the conclusion that the analysis of all these state papers be not a very profitable occupation ii war-madness _ September _ 1914 how mad how hopelessly mad it all seem i with fifteen to twenty million soldier already mobilize and more than half that number in the fighting line with engine of appalling destruction by land and sea and over the land and under the sea with northern france belgium and part of germany poland russium servium and austrium drench in blood the nation exhaust they human and material resource in savage conflict -- this war mark the climax and -lrb- let we hope -rrb- the _ finale _ of we commercial civilization be the most monstrous the old earth have ever see and yet as in a hundred earlier and lesser war we hardly know the why and wherefore of it it be like the sorriest squabble of child and schoolboy -- utterly senseless and unreasoning but broken body and limb and broken heart and a endless river of blood and suffering be the outcome iii the root of the great war -lrb- 2 -rrb- _ October _ 1914 in the present chapter i wish especially to dwell on -lrb- 1 -rrb- the danger to society mention in the introduction of class-ascendancy and class-rule and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the hope for the future in the international solidarity of the worker through all the mist of lie and slander create on such a occasion -- by which each nation after a time succeed in prove that its own cause be holy while that of its opponent be wicked and devilish through the appeal to god and justice common to both side through the shuffling and winding of diplomat and the calculate attitude of politician adopt for public approval through the very real rage and curse of soldier the desperate tear and agony of woman the murder of babe and the smoke of burn town and village : it be difficult indeed to arrive at clear and just conclusion when the war first break out no one could give a adequate reason for it it all seem absurd monstrous impossible then arise a babel of explanation it be that germany desire to crush france finally it be that she be determine to break great britain 's naval and commercial supremacy it be that she must have a outlet on the sea through belgium and holland that she must force a way to the mediterranean through servium that she must carry out she financial scheme in asia minor and the baghdad region it be she hatred of the slav and she grow dread of russium it be she desire for a colonial empire it be fear of a revolution at home it be the outcome of long year of pan-germanist philosophy it be the result of pure military ambition and the class-domination of the junker each and all of these reason -lrb- and many other -rrb- be in turn cite and magnify into the mainspring of the war and yet even to-day we can not say which _ be _ the main reason or if we admit they all we can not say in what exact proportion they influence be combine moreover they all assume that germany be the aggressor and we have to remember that this would not be admit for a moment by a vast number of the german themselves -- who cease not to say that the war be simply force upon they by the hostile preparation of russium by the vengefulness of france by the jealous foreign policy of england and by the obvious threat embody in the _ entente _ between those three nation and that if they -lrb- the german -rrb- make preparation for or even precipitate it that be only out of the sheer necessity of self-preservation -lrb- 3 -rrb- thus we be still leave without any generally accept conclusion in the matter moreover we be strike in consider the list of reason cite by a feeling that they be all in they way rather partial and superficial -- that they do not go to the real root of the subject out of they all -- and after the first period of confusion and doubt have pass -- we own people at home have settle down into the conviction that german militarism in general and prussian junkerdom in particular be to blame and that for the good of the world as well as for we own good we be out to fight these power of evil prussian class-militarism it be say under which for so long the good people of germany have groan have become a thing intolerable the arrogance the insolence of the junker officer he aristocratic pretension he bearish manners have make he a byword not only in he own country but all over europe and he belief in sheer militarism and jingo imperialism have make he a menace the kaiser have only make thing worse vain and flighty to a degree and like most vain people rather shallow wilhelm ii have suppose himself to be a second and greater bismarck destine by providence to create the say teutonic world-empire it be simply to fight these power of evil that we be out of course there be a certain amount of truth in this view at the same time it be lamentably insufficient the fact be that in the vast flux of destiny which be involve in such a war as the present and which no argument can really adequately represent we be fain to snatch at _ some _ neat phrase however superficial by way of explanation and we be compel moreover to find a phrase which will put we own effort in a ideal light -- otherwise we can not go on fight no nation can fight confessedly for a mean or base object every nation inscribe on its banner _ freedom justice religion culture _ versus _ barbarism _ or something of the kind and in a sense redeem itself in so fight it save its soul even though bodily it may be conquer and this be not hypocrisy but a psychological necessity though each nation of course accuse the other of hypocrisy we be fight to put down militarism and the dominance of a military class say the great bp and one can only hope that when the war be over we shall remember and rivet into shape this great and good purpose -- not only with regard to foreign militarism but also with regard to we own certainly whatever other or side view we may take of the war we be bind to see in it a illustration of the danger of military class-rule you can not keep a 60-hp daimler motor-car in you shed for year and year and still deny yourself the pleasure of go out on the public road with it -- even though you know you be not a very competent driver and you can not continue for half a century perfect you military and naval organization without in the end make the temptation to become a political road-hog almost irresistible still accept for the moment the popular explanation give above of germany 's action as to some degree justify we can not help see how superficial and unsatisfactory it be because it at once raise the question which indeed be be ask in all direction and not satisfactorily answer : how do it happen that so peace-loving sociable and friendly a people as the great german mass-folk as we have hitherto know they with they long scientific and literary tradition they love of music and philosophy they lager beer and tobacco and they generally democratic habit should have be lead into a situation like the present whether by a clique of junker or by a clique of militarist philosopher and politician and the answer to this be both interesting and important it resolve itself into two main cause : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the rise of the great german commercial class and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the political ignorance of the german people it be obvious i think that a military aristocracy alone or even with the combined support of empire-building philosopher and a jack-boot kaiser could not have hurry the solid german nation into so strange a situation in old day and under a avowedly feudal order of society such a thing might well have happen but to-day the source and seat of power have pass from crown head and baron into another social stratum it be the financial and commercial class in the modern state who have the sway and unless these class desire it the military clique may plot for war in vain since 1870 and the unification of germany the growth of she manufacture and she trade have be enormous she commercial prosperity have go up by leap and bound and this extension of trade especially of international trade have lead -- as it have already so conspicuously do in england -- to the development of corresponding ideal and habit of life among the population the modest simple-living middle-class household of fifty year ago have largely disappear and in they place have spring up at any rate in the larger town the very same commercial and parasitical class with they philistine luxury and fatuous ideal which have be so depressing and distressing a feature of _ we _ social life during the same period naturally the desire of these class have be for the glorification of germany the establishment of a absolutely world-wide commercial supremacy and the ousting of england from she market germany say peter kropotkin -lrb- 4 -rrb- a year or two ago on enter a striking period of juvenile activity quickly succeed in double and treble she industrial productivity and soon increase it tenfold and now the german middle class covet new source of enrichment in the plain of poland in the prairie of hungary on the plateau of africa and especially around the railway line to baghdad -- in the rich valley of asia minor which can provide german capitalist with a labor population ready to be exploit under one of the most beautiful sky in the world it may be so with egypt some day therefore it be port for export and especially military port in the adriatic the persian gulf on the african coast in beira and also in the pacific that these schemer of german colonial trade wish to conquer they faithful servant the german empire with its army and ironclad be at they service for this purpose it be this class then which by back both financially and morally the military class have be chiefly responsible for bring about the war not that i mean in say so that the commercial folk of germany have directly instigate its outbreak at the present moment and in the present circumstance -- for many or most of they must have see how dangerous it be likely to prove to they trade but in respect of the general policy which they have so long pursue they be responsible one can not go on for year -lrb- and let england too remember this -rrb- preach militarism as a means of secure commercial advantage and then refuse to be answerable for the result to which such a policy may lead the junker class of prussium and they kaiser might be suffer from a bad attack of swell head vanity and arrogance might be fill they with dream of world-empire but there would have be no immediate european war have not the vast trade-interest of germany come into conflict or seem to come into conflict with the trade-interest of the surround nation -- have not the financial greed of the nation be stir as well as its military vanity and talking of general trade and finance one must not forget to include the enormous power exercise in the present day by individual corporation and individual financier who intrude they operation into the sphere of politics we see _ that _ in we own boer war and behind the scene in germany to-day similar influence be at work the deutsche bank with immense property all over the world and some # 85000000 sterling in its hand in deposit alone initiate financially the baghdad railway scheme its head herr arthur von gwinner the great financier be a close adviser of the kaiser the railway be already nearly half build and it represent a german investment of between # 16000000 and # 18000000 let this be think of when people imagine that germany and austrium go to war with the idea of avenge the murder of a archduke all german trade would suffer if the baghdad railway scheme be to fail -lrb- 5 -rrb- then there be herr August thyssen -- king thyssen -- who own coalmine roll mill harbor and dock throughout germany iron-ore mine in france warehouse in russium and _ entrepôts _ in nearly every country from brazil and argentina to indium -lrb- 6 -rrb- he have declare that german interest in asia minor must be safeguard at all cost but russium also have large prospective commercial interest in asia minor the moral be clear and need no enforce such man as these -- and many other the rathenaus siemen krupp ballin and heineken -- exercise in germany a immense political influence just as do we financial magnate at home they represent the peak and summit of wide-spreading commercial activity whose basis be root among the general public yet through it all it must not be forget that they represent in each case -lrb- as i shall explain more clearly presently -rrb- the interest of a _ class _ -- the commercial class -- but not of the whole nation one must then modify the first conclusion that the blame of the war rest with the military class by add a second factor namely the rise and influence of the commercial class these two class act and react on each other and push -- though for different reason -- in the same direction be answerable as far as germany be concern for drag europe into this trouble and they must share the blame if it be true as already suggest that germany 's action have only be that of the spark that fire the magazine still she part in the affair afford such a extraordinarily illuminating text and illustration that one may be excuse for dwelling on it here in she case we have the division of a nation 's life set out in well-marked fashion we have a military clique head by a personal and sadly irresponsible ruler we have a vulgar and much swollen commercial class and then besides these two we have a huge ant 's nest of professor and student a large population of intelligent and well-trained factory worker and a vast residuum of peasant thus we have at least five distinct class but of these the last three have -- till thirty or forty year ago -- pay little or no attention to political matter the professor and student have have they nose bury in they departmental science and _ fach _ study the artisan have be engross with they technical work and have be only gradually drift away from they capitalist employer and into the socialist camp and the peasant -- as elsewhere over the world absorb in they laborious and ever-necessary labor -- have accept they fate and pay but little attention to what be go on over they head yet these three last-mentioned class form the great bulk of the nation have be sweep away and suddenly at the last into a huge embroilment in which to begin with they have no interest or profit this may seem strange but the process after all be quite simple and to study it in the case of germany may throw helpful light on we own affair however the blame may be apportion between the junker and commercial class it be clear that fire by the bismarckian program and greatly overstretch it they play into each other 's hand the former rely for the financing of its scheme on the support of the commercial the latter saw in the militarist a power which might increase germany 's trade-supremacy vanity and greed be meet together patriotism and profit have kiss each other a navy league and a army league and a air league arise professor and teacher be subsidize in the university the child be teach pan-germanism in the school a new map of europe be put before they a enormous literature grow up on the line of treitschke houston chamberlain and bernhardus with novel and romance to illustrate side-issue and the press playing martial music the student and intellectual begin to be infect the small trader and shopkeeper be move and the war-fever gradually spread through the nation as to the artisan they may as i have say have largely belong to the socialist party -- with its poll of four million vote in the last election -- and in the word of herr haase in the reichstag just before the war they may have wish to hold themselves apart from this curse imperialist policy but when the war actually arrive and the fever and the threat of russium and the fury of conscription they perforce have to give way and join in how on earth could they do otherwise and the peasant -- even if they escape the fever -- could not escape the compulsion of authority nor the old blind tradition of obedience they do not know even to-day why they be fight and they hardly know whom they be fight but in they ancient resignation they accept the inevitable and shout deutschland über alle with the rest and so a whole nation be sweep off its foot by a small section of it and the insolence of a class become as in louvain and rheim 's the scandal of the world -lrb- 7 -rrb- and the people bleed yes it be always the people who bleed the train arrive at the hospital basis hundred positively hundred of they full of wound shattered human form lie in thousand on straw inside the truck and wagon or sit painfully recline in the passenger compartment they face grime they clothes ragged they toe protrude from they boot some have be stretch on the battlefield for forty-eight hour or even more torment by frost at night cover with fly by day without so much as a drink of water and those that have not already become a mere lifeless heap of rag have be jolt in country cart to some railway-station and there or at successive junction have be shunt on siding for endless hour and now with they wound still slowly bleed or ooze they be pick out by tender hand and the most cry case be roughly dress before consign to a hospital and some face be shatter hardly recognizable and some have limb tear away and there be internal wound unspeakable and countenance deadly pallid and moaning which can not be stifle and silence worse than moan yes the agony and bloody sweat of battlefield endure for the domination or the ambition of a class be appalling but in many case though more dramatic and appealing to the imagination one may doubt if it be worse than the year-long and age-long agony of daily life endure for the same reason maeterlinck in he eloquent and fiery letter to the _ daily mail _ of September 14th maintain that the whole german nation be equally to blame in this affair -- that all class be equally involve in it with no _ degree _ of guilt we may excuse the warmth of personal feeling which make he say this but we can not accept the view we be bind to point out that it be only by some such analysis as the above and estimation of the method by which the delusion of one class may be communicate to the other that we can guard ourselves too from fall into similar delusion i mention that besides the growth of the commercial class a second great cause of the war be the political ignorance of the german people and this be important fifty year ago and before that when germany be divide up into score of small state and duchy the mass of its people have no practical interest in politics such politics as exist as between one duchy and another be mere teacup politics read eckermann 's _ conversation _ and see how small a part they play in goethe 's mind that may have be a advantage in one way the brain of the nation go into science literature music and when after 1870 the unification of germany come and the political leadership pass over to prussia the same state of affair for a long time continue the professor continue they investigation in the matter of the thyroid gland or the rock inscription in the isle of thera but they leave the internal regulation of the state and its foreign policy confidently in the hand of the kaiser and the nominee of the great and rise _ bourgeoisie _ and themselves remain unobservant and uninstructed in such matter it be only when these latter power declare -- as in the emperor 's pan-german proclamation of 1896 -- that a teutonic world-empire be about to be form and that the study of _ welt-politik _ be the duty of every serious german that the thinking and read portion of the population suddenly turn its attention to this subject a immense mass of political writings -- pamphlet prophecy military and economic treatise romance of german conquest and the like -- naturally many of they of the crudest sort be pour forth and eagerly accept by the public and a veritable fool 's paradise of german suprernacy arise it be only in this way by note the long-preceding ignorance of the german citizen in the matter of politics he absolute former non-interference in public affair and the dazed state of he mind when he suddenly find himself on the suppose pinnacle of world-power -- that we can explain he easy acceptance of such cheap and _ ad hoc _ publication as those of bernhardus and houston chamberlain and the fact that he be so easily rush into the false situation of the present war -lrb- 8 -rrb- the absurd _ canard _ which at a early date gain currency in berlin -- as that the united state have swallow canada that the afghan in mass be invade indium that ireland be plunge in civil war -- point in the same direction and so do the barbarity of the teutonic troops in the matter of humanity and art for though in all war and in the heat of battle there be barbarity perpetrate it argue a strange state of the german national psychology that in this case a heartless severity and destruction of the enemy 's life and property should have be preach beforehand and quite deliberately by professor and militarist and accept apparently by the general public it argue to say the least a strange want of perception of the very unfavourable impression which such a program must inevitably excite in the mind of the world at large \* \* \* \* \* it be no doubt pleasant in its way for we british to draw this picture of germany and to trace the cause which lead the ruling power there year ago to make up they mind for war because of course the process in some degree exonerate we but as i have already say i have dwell on germany not only because she afford such a good illustration of what to avoid but also because she afford so clear a example of what be go on elsewhere in europe -- in england and france and italy and among all the modern nation we can not blame germany without implicitly also blame these what indeed shall we say of england germany have for year maintain that with she own grow population and she grow trade she need a more extended seaboard in europe and coaling station and colony in other region of the globe but that england jealous of commercial supremacy have be determine to deny she these and if possible to crush she that she -lrb- germany -rrb- have live in perpetual fear and panic and that if in this case she have be the first to strike it have only be because to wait england 's opportunity would have be to court defeat allow for the exaggeration inseparable from oppose point of view be there not some justification for this plea england who plunge into the crimean war in order to _ prevent _ russium from obtain a seaboard and she natural commercial expansion and who afterwards join with russium in order to plunder persium and to prevent germany from get she railway along the persian gulf who calmly appropriate egypt with its valuable cottonland and market who at the behest of a group of capitalist and financier turn she great military machine on a little nation of boer farmer in south africa who it be say -lrb- 9 -rrb- sell 300000 ton of coal to russium to aid she fleet against japan and at the same time furnished japan with gold at a high rate of interest for use against russium -- what trust can be place in she england say bernhardus in spite of all she pretence of a liberal and philanthropic policy have never seek any other object than personal advantage and the unscrupulous suppression of she rival let we hope that this never be _ too _ harsh let we at least say hardly ever but still be we not compel to admit that if the rise of commercial ambition in germany have figure as a danger to _ we _ we far greater commercial ambition have not only figure as a danger to germany but in conjunction with we alliance with france and russium she ancient foe may well have lead to a state of positive panic among she people and if as the ally would doubtless say there be really no need for any such panic the situation be obviously sufficiently grave to be easily make use of by a military class for its own end or by a armament ring or a clique of financier for theirs indeed it would be interesting to know what enormous profit kruppism -lrb- to use hg well ' expressive term -rrb- _ have _ already make out of this world-madness nor can it be deny that the commercial interest in england if not deliberately intend to provoke war with germany have not be at all sorry to seize this opportunity of lay a rival power low -- if only in order to snatch the say rival 's trade that indeed the daily press reveal only too clearly from all this the danger of class-domination emerge more and more into relief in prussium the old feudal caste remain -- in a decadent state certainly but perhaps for that very reason more arrogant more vulgar and less conscious of any _ noblesse oblige _ than even before by itself however and if unsupported by the commercial class it would probably have do little harm in britain the feudal caste have cease to be exclusively military and have become blended with the commercial class the british aristocracy now consist largely or chiefly of retired grocer and brewer commercialism here have become more confessedly dominant than in germany and whereas there the commercial class may _ support _ the military in its ambition here the commercial class _ use _ the military as a matter of course and for its own end we have become a nation of shopkeeper have we own revolver and machine-gun behind the counter and yet not really a nation of shopkeeper but rather a nation rule by a shopkeeping _ class _ -lrb- this be the point in the text refer to by footnote 25 below -rrb- people sometimes talk as if commercial prosperity and the interest of the commercial folk represent the life of the whole nation that be a way of speaking and it illustrate certainly a common modern delusion but it be far from the truth the trading and capitalist folk be only a class and they do _ not _ properly speak represent the nation they do not represent the landowning and the farming interest both of which detest they they do not represent the artisan and industrial worker who have expressly form themselves into union in order to fight they and who have only be able to maintain they rights by so do they do not represent the labourer and peasant who be ground under they heel it would take too long to go into the economics of this subject interesting though they be -lrb- 10 -rrb- but a very brief survey of fact show we that wherever the capitalist and trading class have triumph -- as in england early last century and until socialistic legislation be call in to check they -- the condition of the mass of the people have by no means improve rather the contrary japan have develop a world trade and be on the look out for more yet never before have there be such distress among she mass-population russium have be lately move in the same direction she commercial interest be rapidly progress but she peasantry be at a standstill france and italy have already grow a fat _ bourgeoisie _ but they worker remain in a limbo of poverty and strike and in all these country include germany socialism have arise as a protest against the commercial order -- which fact certainly do not look as if commercialism be a generally acknowledged benefit no commercial prosperity mean only the prosperity of a class yet such be the curious glamour that surround this subject and make a fetish of statistics about import and export that nothing be more common than for such prosperity to be take to mean the prosperity of the nation as a whole the commercial people have command of the press and of the avenue and highway of public influence do not find it at all difficult to persuade the nation that _ they _ be its representative and that _ they _ advantage be the advantage of all this illusion be only a part i suppose of a historical necessity which as the feudal regime pass bring into prominence the commercial regime but do not let we be delude by it nor forget that in submit to the latter we be be nose-led by a class just as much as the german have be in submit to the prussian junker do not let we at the behest of either class be so foolish as to set out in vain pursuit of world-empire and above all do not let we in free ourselves from military class-rule fall under the domination of financier and commercial diplomat let we remember that war for world-market be make for the benefit of the merchant _ class _ and not for the benefit of the mass-people and that in this respect england have be as much to blame as germany or any other nation -- nay pretty obviously more so what be clearly want -- and indeed be the next stage of human evolution in england and in all western land -- be that the people should emancipate themselves from class-domination class-glamour and learn to act freely from they own initiative i know it be difficult it mean a spirit of independence courage willingness to make sacrifice it mean education alertness to guard against the insidious scheme of wire-puller and pressman as well as of militarist and commercial it mean the perception that only through eternal vigilance can freedom be maintain yet it be the only true democracy and the logic of its arrival be assure to we by the historical necessity that progress in all country must pass through the preliminary stage of feudalism and commercialism on its way to realize the true life of the mass-people to-day the uprising of socialist ideal of the power of trade union and especially the formation of international union show we that we be on the verge of this third stage we be shape we way towards the real democracy with the attainment of which war -- though they will not cease from the world -- will certainly become much rarer the international _ entente _ already establish itself among the manual worker of all the european country -- and which have now become a accept principle of the labor movement -- be a guarantee and a promise of a more peaceful era and those who know the artisan and peasant of this and other country know well how little enmity they harbor in they breast against each other racial and religious war will no doubt for long continue but war to satisfy the ambition of a military clique or a personal ruler or the ambition of a commercial group or the scheme of financier or the engineering of the press -- war from these all too fruitful cause will under a sensible democracy cease if britain during the last twenty year have really favor the cause of the people and they international understanding there would have be no war now for she espousal of the mass-people ' cause would have make she so strong that it would have be too risky for any government to attack she but of course that could not have happen for the simple reason that conservatism and liberalism be not democracy conservatism be feudalism liberalism be commercialism and socialism only be in its essence democracy it be no good scolding at sir edward gray for make friend with the russian government for he only alternative would have be to join the international -- which he certainly could not do be essentially a creature of the commercial regime the balance of power and the _ entente _ and alliance of figure-head government _ have _ to go on till the day -- which we hope be at hand -- when figure-head will be no more need footnote : -lrb- 2 -rrb- reprint by kind permission from the _ english review _ for December 1914 -lrb- 3 -rrb- as a example of this belief read the manifesto of professor eucken who

whose people i have so many personal friend allow also the utmost for the general cause in europe which have be for year lead up towards war -- and some of which i have indicate already in the page above -- i still feel it be impossible not to throw on she the _ immediate _ blame for the present catastrophe however we distribute the indictment and the charge among the various party concerned whether we accuse mainly the sway of prussian militarism or the rise of german commercialism or the long tradition and growth of a _ welt-politik _ philosophy or the general political ignorance which give to these influence such rash and uncritical acceptance or whether we accuse the somewhat difficult and variable personal equation of the kaiser himself -- the fact still remain that for year and year this war have be by the german government most deliberately and systematically prepare for the fact remain that britain -- though for a long period she have foresee danger and have on the naval side slowly brace herself to meet it -- be on the military side catch at the last moment unprepared that france be so little intend war that a large portion of the nation be actually still protest against a increase in the size of the standing army and that russium -- whatever plan she may have have or not have in mind -- be confessedly at the same period two year or so behind in the organization and completion of she military establishment whether right or wrong it can hardly be deny that the moment of the precipitation of war be choose and insist on by germany after austrium 's monstrous and insulting dictation to servium -lrb- 23rd July -rrb- and servium 's incredibly humble apology -lrb- 25th -rrb- austrium be still not allow to accept the latter and the conference propose -lrb- 26th July -rrb- by sir e gray -- though accept by france russium and italy -- be refuse by germany -lrb- 27th -rrb- on the 28th austrium declare war on servium it be perfectly clear to every one that russia -- after what have happen before in 1908-9 with regard to bosnium and herzegovina -- could not possibly allow this insult to servium to pass germany therefore by this move force russium 's hand and at a moment when russium be know or suppose to be comparatively unprepared -lrb- 11 -rrb- france have be involve in some military scandal and be still debate as to the two year ' instead of three year ' period for she normal military service the german ambassador at vienna have openly say that france be not in a condition for face a war england be currently suppose in germany to be seriously hamper by domestic trouble at home -- chiefly of course among the irish but also amongst the suffragette -lrb- -rrb- _ and _ by widespread disaffection in indium it be think therefore that england would certainly remain neutral -- and i think we may fairly say that the extent to which germany count on this expect neutrality be evidence by she disappointment and public rage when she find that she be mistaken germany 's initiative in the matter be further evidence by she _ instant readiness _ to attack she be in luxemburg within a few hour of the declaration of war with russium and it be clearly she intention to rush pari and then turn back upon russium it may be say that from she own point of view germany be quite right to take the initiative if she sincerely believe that the _ entente _ be plot she downfall she be justify in attack instead of wait to be attack that may be so it be the line to which general bernhardus again return in he latest book -lrb- _ britain as germany 's vassal _ translate by j elli barker -rrb- but it do not alter the fact that this be a immense responsibility to take and that the immediate onus of the war rest with germany if she under all the above circumstance precipitate war she can hardly be surprise if the judgment of europe -lrb- one may also say the world -rrb- be against she if she have play she card so badly as to put herself entirely in the wrong she must naturally dree she weird there remain the case of she treatment of belgium britain certainly -- who have only lately assist at the dismemberment of persium and who be even now allow russium -lrb- in the face of persian protest -rrb- to cross neutral territory in the neighborhood of tabriz on she way to attack turkey who have utter moreover no word of protest against the late ukase -lrb- of mid-november -rrb- by which the independent rights of finland have be finally crush -- britain i say need talk no cant about belgian neutrality britain for she own absolute safety have always require and still require belgian neutrality to be respect and that by itself be a sufficient and the most honest reason but in the eye of the world at large germany 's deliberate and determine sacrifice of belgium simply because the latter stand in the way of the rapid accomplishment of she warlike design against france -lrb- and england -rrb- can never be condone -- little belgium who have never harm or offend germany in any way add to this she harsh and brutish ill-treatment of the belgian civilian people she ravage of they ancient building and work of art and she clearly express intention both in word and deed to annex they territory by force should the fortune of war favor she -- all these fact which we may say be prove beyond the shadow of a doubt form a most serious indictment they substantiate the charge that germany by act throughout in this high-handed way have deeply violate the natural law of the comity of nation which be the safeguard of civilization and they confirm the rightful claim of europe to sit in judgment on she i say nothing at the moment about the charge of atrocity commit by german troops partly because such charge be always in warfare make by each side against the other and partly because they verification should be the subject of a world-inquiry later on it may be say however that the belgian and french commission of inquiry have certainly present material and evidence which _ ought _ to be investigate later -- material which would hardly be credible of so humane and culture a people as the german be it not for the fact allude to already of such severity have be deliberately recommend beforehand by the philosophical writer military and political who have during the last half-century mould german public opinion england as i say be in no position herself to sit in judgment on germany and lecture she -- much as she undoubtedly enjoy do so england 's long-standing policy of commercial greed lead to political grab in every part of the world she infidelity in late year towards small people like the boer and the persian she neglect of treaty obligation and silence about they when they do not suit she she most dubious alliance with a military despotism like russium : all render it impossible for she to accuse germany the extraordinary thing be that in the face of such prevarication as these which be patent to the whole world britain at any moment of serious crisis always come forward with the air of utmost sincerity and in a almost saintly pose as the champion of political morality how be it the world laugh and talk of _ heuchlereus _ and _ cant britannique _ but i almost think -lrb- perhaps i stretch a point in order to save the credit of my country -rrb- that the real cause be not so much british hypocrisy as british _ stupidity _ -- stupidity which keep we mind in watertight compartment and prevent we perceive how confused and inconsistent we own judgment be and how insincere they appear to we neighbor at any rate whether the cause be pure hypocrisy or pure stupidity or whether a scotch mixture of these it can not be deny that its result be most irritating to decent-minded people it be curious how a certain strain or vein of temperament like that just mention will run through a nation 's whole life and color its action in all department recognize and comment on by the whole outside world and yet remain unobserved by the nation itself every one who have know the german at home -- even year back -- have be conscious of a certain strain in the teutonic character which have have a like bearing in the german national life how shall i describe it it be a certain want of tact unperceptiveness -- a kind of overbearing simplicity of mind whether it be in the train or the hotel or the private house the german do not always seem to see the personal situation whether you prefer to talk or remain silent whether you wish the window open or shut whether you desire to partake of such and such a dish or whether you do not -- of such little matter he -lrb- or she -rrb- seem unaware perhaps it be that the teutonic mind be so vigorous that it override you without be conscious of do so or that it be so convinced of its own tightness or perhaps it be that the scientific type of mind depend always on formula and statistics necessarily lose a certain finer quality anyhow the fact remain that sociable kindly _ gemüthlich _ and so forth as the german be there be a lack of delicate touch and perception about they of gentle manners and a certain insensitiveness to the opinion of those with whom they have to deal the strain may not be without its useful bearing in the direction of strength and veracity but it run curiously through the national life and color deeply not only the domestic and social relation of the people but they foreign politics also and even they war tactic and strategy i have speak before of the political ignorance of the german mass-people which date from year back cause they to be easily lead by they empire-building philosopher to a certain very dangerous pinnacle of ambition and there tempt the same want of perception of how they action would be view by the world in general cause the government to act in the most egregiously high-handed manner in the matter of the precipitation and declaration of the war itself and subsequently likewise in the ruthless invasion of belgium and treatment of she people and she city the want of discernment of what be go on outside the sphere of she own psychology lead she into fatal delusion as to the attitude of england of ireland of belgium italy indium and so forth it cause she general to miscalculate and seriously under-estimate the strategic force oppose to they both in france and russium and in actual battle it have cause they to adopt with disastrous result tactic which be foolishly inspire by contempt of the enemy without insist too much on the story of atrocity -- which be still to a certain extent _ sub judice _ -- it do rather appear that even those excess which the commission of inquiry have report -lrb- and which occur be it say chiefly in the early day of the campaign -rrb- be due to a intoxication not merely of champagne but of excited self-glorification and blindness to the human rights of people at least as brave as themselves -lrb- 12 -rrb- however that last point may be it be certainly curious to think how -- whether it be in the case of the german or the english or any other people -- a vein of temperament or character may decide a nation 's fate or color its history quite as much as or even more than matter of wealth and armament personally one feel sorry for the great and admirable german people -- though i do not suppose it will matter to they whether one feel sorry or not and i look forward to the day when there will come a better understanding between they and ourselves -- better perhaps than have ever be before -- when we shall forgive they they sin against we and they will forgive we we sin against they one of which certainly be we meanness and shopkeeperiness in rejoice in the war as a means of collar they trade i feel sure that the german mass-people will wake up one day to the knowledge that they have be grossly betray at home not only by prussian militarism but by pan-german commercial philosophy and bunkum as well as by they own inattention to and consequent ignorance of political affair and i hope they will wake up to the conviction that destiny and the god in this matter be after all bring they to a conclusion and a consummation far finer than anything they have perhaps imagine for themselves if indeed when the war be over they be fortunate enough to be compel by the term of settlement to abandon they army and navy -- or _ all _ but the merest residue of these -- the consequence undoubtedly will be that free from the frightful burden which the upkeep of these entail they will romp away over the world through a era of unexampled prosperity and influence they science liberate will give they the lead in many art and industry they philosophy and literature no longer cripple by national vanity will rise to the splendid world-level of former day they colonize enterprise unhindered by conscriptionist veto will carry they far and wide over the globe and even they trade will find that without fortify seaport and tariff wall it will in these day of universal movement and intercommunication do fully as well as if not much better than ever it do before in that day however let we hope that -- the more communal conception of public life have prevail and come to its own -- the success of trade among any nation or people will no longer mean the successful manufacture of a dominant and vulgar class but the real prosperity and welfare of the whole nation include all class and in that day possibly the other nation witness the extraordinary prosperity and success of that one which have abandon armament and kruppism will -- if they have a grain of sense leave in they -- follow suit and voluntarily divest themselves too of they ancient armor give up the foolishness of national enmity and jealousy and adopt the attitude of humanity and peace which alone can be the worthy and sensible attitude for we little mortal when we shall have arrive at year of discretion upon the earth -lrb- just after write the above i receive the follow remark in a letter of a friend from south america which may be worth reprint he say : in spite of the event of 1815 and 1870 french ` culture ' be supreme to-day over all south america south america be a suburb of pari and french culture have win its triumph wholly irrespective of the defeat of french arm therefore i incline to think that true german culture in science and music will gain rather than lose by the destruction of german arm not only will that nation cease to spend its time write dull military book but other nation will be more likely to appreciate what there be in german thought and culture when this be no longer offer we at the point of the bayonet german commerce in south america have suffer rather than gain by talk of ` shine armor ' and the poet scientist and business man will gain rather than lose if no longer connect with potsdam -rrb- footnote : -lrb- 11 -rrb- it be say that russium take some step towards mobilization as early as the 25th if she do that would seem quite natural under the circumstance -lrb- 12 -rrb- there may possibly be find another explanation of these excess -- namely in the galling strictness of the prussian military regime after year and year of monotonously regulate and official life it may be that to both officer and man in they different way orgy of one kind or another come as a almost inevitable reaction v the case for germany have put in the last chapter some of the point which seem to throw the immediate blame of the war on germany it would be only fair in the present chapter to show how in the long run and look to the general european situation to-day as well as to the history of germany in the past the war have become inevitable and in a sense necessary as a stage in the evolution of european politics after the frightful devastation of germany by the religious dissension of the early part of the seventeenth century and the thirty year war it fall to frederick the great not only to lay a firm foundation for the prussian state but to elevate it definitely as a rival to austria in the leadership of germany thenceforth prussium grow in power and influence and become the nucleus of a new germany it would almost seem that thing could not well have be otherwise germany be seek for a new root from which to grow clerical and ultra-catholic austrium be of no use for this purpose bavarium be under the influence of france lutheran prussium attract the best element of the teutonic mind it seem strange perhaps that the sandy waste of the north-east and its rather arid dour population _ should _ have become the center of growth for the new german nation consider the latter 's possession of its own rich and vital characteristic and its own fertile and beautiful land but so it be perhaps the general german folk with they speculative easygoing almost sentimental tendency _ need _ this hard nucleus of prussianism -- and its matter-of-fact organize type of ability -- to crystallize round the napoleonic war shatter the old order of society and spread over europe the seed of all sort of new idea in the direction of nationality republicanism and so forth fichte stir by napoleon 's victory at jena -lrb- fichte 's birthplace -rrb- and the consequent disaster to he own people write he _ address to the german nation _ plead eloquently for a national regeneration he like vom stein treitschke and many other in they time come to berlin and establish himself there as in the center of a new national activity vom stein about the same time carry out the magnificent and democratic work by which he establish on napoleonic line -lrb- and much to napoleon 's own chagrin -rrb- the outline of a great and free and federated germany carl von clausewitz do in the military world much what stein do in the civil world he formulate the strategical method and teaching of napoleon and in he book _ vom krieg _ -lrb- publish 1832 -rrb- not only outline a greater military germany but lay the basis it have be say of all serious study in the art of war vom stein and clausewitz die in the same year 1831 in 1834 heinrich von treitschke be bear the three hohenzollern king all name frederick william who reign from the death of frederick the great -lrb- 1786 -rrb- to the accession of william i -lrb- 1861 -rrb- do not count much personally the first and third of those mention be decidedly weakminded and the third towards the close of he reign become insane but the idea already initiate in germany continue to expand the zollverein be establish the teutonic federation become closer and the lead of prussium more decide with the joint effort of william i and bismarck the policy become more governmental more positive and more deliberate -- the policy of consolidation and of aggrandisement and with this definite program in view bismarck engineer the three war of 1864 1866 and 1870 against denmark austrium and france they all three have the effect of confirm the military power of prussium the first war give she a much desire increase of access to the north sea the second lead to the treaty with austrium and ultimately to the formation of the triple alliance the third end in the definite establishment of the prussian hegemony the crowning of william i as emperor and the union and consolidation of all the german state under he but alas it leave a seed of evil in the wresting of alsace-lorraine from france for france never forgive this bismarck and moltke know she would not forgive and be sorely tempt to engineer a _ second _ war which should utterly disable she but this war never come off the seed of revenge however remain with france and the seed of fear with germany and these two thing be destine to lead to a harvest of disaster in 1866 treitschke come to berlin though saxon by birth he become ultra-prussian in sympathy and temperament somewhat deaf and by no means yield or facile in temper he be not cut out for a political career but politics be he interest he lecture on history be successful at leipzig and have still more scope at berlin he become the strongest of german unionist and with a keen but somewhat narrow mind take a absolute pleasure in attack every movement or body of people that seem to he in any way to stand in the path of germany 's advancement or not to assist in she consolidation thus he pour out he wrath in turn on saxony -lrb- he own land -rrb- and on hanover on the pole the socialist and the catholic and ultimately in he later year on britain -lrb- 13 -rrb- he conceive follow the line of the prussian tradition that germany have a great military mission to fulfil she immense energy and power which have bulk so large in the early history of europe and which have be so sadly scatter during the religious war be now to come to its own again she be to make for herself a great place in europe and to expand in colony over the world it be a pleasing and natural ambition and the expression of it give a great vogue and popularity to treitschke 's lecture the idea be enormously reinforce by the cause which i have already mention and dwell upon -- the growth of the commercial interest in germany from 1870 onward this growth be huge and phenomenal in a comparatively short time a whole new social class spring up in the land and a whole new public opinion if expansion from the point of view of junker ambition have be desirable before the same from the point of view of the financial and trading class be doubly so now if a military irruption into the politics of the world be favor before it be clamour for now when a powerful class have arise which not only call the tune but could pay the piper thus by the combination of military and commercial interest and entanglement the web of destiny be weave and germany be hurry along a path which -- though no definite war be yet in sight -- be certain to lead to war the general military program of treitschke the conviction that force and force alone could give he country she rightful place in the world be more and more cordially adopt in a sense this be a perfectly natural and logical program and amid the surround european condition excusable -- as i shall point out presently but before long it become a weird enthusiasm almost a obsession it be take up over the land and repeat in a thousand book and on as many platform one of these propagandist be general von bernhardus who enter in more detail into the technical and strategical aspect of the program the rude and almost brutal frankness of both writer may be admire but the want of real depth and breadth of view can not be conceal and must be deplore the argument in favor of force of unscrupulousness of terrorism be -- especially in bernhardus -lrb- 14 -rrb- -- casuistical to a degree they be those of a man who be determine to press he country into war at all cost and who will use any kind of logic as long as it will lead in he direction the whole movement -- largely make possible by the political ignorance of the mass-people of which i have speak in a former chapter -- culminate in a extraordinary national fever of ambition and in the announcement of scheme for the germanization of the world almost juvenile in the want of experience and the sense of proportion which they display it would not be fair to take one writer as conclusive but as a _ specimen _ of the kind of thing we may quote the follow extract -lrb- give by mr hal fisher the oxford historian in he able brochure _ the war : its cause and issue _ -rrb- from the writings of bronsart von schellendorf : do not let we forget the civilizing task which the decree of providence have assign to we just as prussium be destine to be the nucleus of germany so the regenerated germany shall be the nucleus of a future empire of the west and in order that no one shall be leave in doubt we proclaim from henceforth that we continental nation have a right to the sea not only to the north sea but to the mediterranean and atlantic hence we intend to absorb one after another all the province which neighbor on prussium we will successively annex denmark holland belgium northern switzerland then trieste and venice finally northern france from the sambre to the loire this program we fearlessly pronounce it be not the work of a madman the empire we intend to find will be no utopia we have ready to we hand the means of found it and no coalition in the world can stop we bronsart von schellendorf -lrb- 1832-91 -rrb- be one of the prussian general who negotiate the surrender of the french at sedan he become chief of the staff and war minister -lrb- 1883-9 -rrb- and write on tactic etc he above utterance therefore can not be neglect as that of a irresponsible person there be as i have already have occasion to say a certain easygoing absurdity in the habit we commonly have of talking of nation -- germany france england and so forth -- as if they be simple and plainly responsible person or individual when all the time we know perfectly well that they be more like huge whirlpool of humanity cause by the impact and collision of countless and often oppose current flow together from various direction yet there be this point of incontestable similarity between nation and individual person that both occasionally go mad if germany be afflict by a kind of madness or divine _ dementia _ previous to the present war britain can by no means throw that in she tooth for britain certainly go mad over mafeking and it be sheer madness that in 1870 throw the people of france and napoleon iii -- utterly unready for war as they be and over a most trifling quarrel -- into the arm of bismarck for the fulfilment of he scheme but that some sort of madness do in consequence of the above-mentioned circumstance seize the german people shortly before the outbreak of the present war we can hardly doubt though -lrb- remember the proverb -rrb- we must not put the blame for that on she but on the god it be a heady intoxication cause largely i believe by that era of unexampled commercial prosperity follow upon a period of great political and military expansion and confirm by the direct incitement of the military and political teacher i have mention all these thing act on a people unskilled in politics -- of whom bernhardi himself say we be a non-political people -lrb- 15 -rrb- -- have they natural effect but it seem part of the irony of fate that at this very juncture germany should have fall under the influence of a man who of all the world be perhaps least fitted to guide she steadily through a difficult crisis we all know the kaiser say mr fisher the most amazing and amusing figure on the great stage of politics the outline of he character be familiar to everybody for he whole life be spend in the full glare of publicity we know he impulsiveness he naïveté he heady fit of wild passion he spacious curiosity and quick grasp of detail he portentous lack of humor and delicacy he childish vanity and domineering will a character so romantic spontaneous and robust must always be a favorite with the british people who be he lunacy less formidable would regard he as the most delectable burlesque of the age however the british generally may regard he it be certain that the german nation accept he as they acclaimed leader clever good-looking versatile imperious fond of the romantic pose wilhelm be exactly the hero in shine armor that would capture the enthusiasm of this innocent people they idolize he and it be possible that they quick response confirm he in he rather generous estimate of he own capability he dismiss bismarck and become he own foreign secretary and enter upon a perilous career as imperial politician under the aegis of god and the great tradition of the hohenzollern a career make all the more perilous by he constant change of rôle and he real uncertainty as to he own mind he seven thousand speech and three hundred uniform be only the numerous and really emblematic disguise of a character unable to concentrate persistently and effectively on any one settle object with a kind of theatrical sincerity he make successive public appearance as war lord or william the peaceful as artist poet architect biblical critic preacher commercial magnate generalissimo of land force and creator of a world navy and with whitman he might well have say i can resist anything better than my own diversity if wilhelm ii be popular -lrb- as he be -rrb- among he own mass-people it may well be guess that he be a perfect terror to he own political adviser and general undoubtedly a large share of responsibility for the failure of german diplomacy before the war and of german strategy during the war must be lay to the account of he ever-changing plan and ill-judged interference it be difficult indeed to imagine a character more dangerous as a great nation 's leader but out of danger great thing do often arise a kind of fatality as i have say have envelop the whole situation and still lead on to new and pregnant evolution for the german people and for the whole world germany will in the end be justified but in a way far different from what she imagine up to the period of germany 's rise commercial prosperity germany and england have be on fairly friendly term there be no particular cause of difference between they but when commercial and colonial expansion become a definite and avowed object of the former 's policy she find whereso she might look that britain be there in the way -- everywhere british colony british coal station and float over a fifth of the globe the british flag could anything be more exasperating and these absent-minded beggar the english without any forethought or science or design without prussian organization or prussian bureaucracy and statecraft have simply walk into this huge inheritance without know what they be do it certainly be most provoking but what england have do why should not germany do -- and do it indeed much better with due science and method britain have show no scruple in appropriate a fifth part of the globe and deal summarily with she opponent whether savage or civilized why should germany show scruple and it must be confess that here germany have a very good case imitation be the sincerest form of flattery and if germany approve britain 's example could only show herself strong enough to imitate it in actual fact britain at least could not blame she besides in she internal industrial development germany be already show she equality with england in she iron and steel manufacture she agricultural machine she cutlery she armament work she glass work she aniline dye she toy and she production of a thousand and one article -lrb- like lamp -rrb- of household use she be show a splendid record -- better in some way than england for while england be lose ground germany be gain all the time england be become degenerate and lack in enterprise the zeiss glassworks at jena have now become the center of the optical-glass industry of the world carl zeiss the founder try hard at one time to get the english glass-maker to turn out a special glass for he purpose with very high refractive index they would not trouble about it zeiss consequently be force to take the matter up himself succeed at last in get such glass make in germany and collar the trade the same happen in other department a certain amount of friction arise the german at one time know the english reputation for cutlery mark they knife and razor as make in scheffield the english retaliate in what seem a insulting way by mark the fatherland 's goods as make in germany with germany 's success commercial jealousy between the two nation -lrb- found on the utterly mistaken but popular notion that the financial prosperity of the country you trade with be inimical to you own prosperity -rrb- begin to increase on the german side it be somewhat bitter on the english side though not so bitter it be aggravate by the really shameful ignorance prevail in this country with regard to thing german and the almost entire neglect of the german tongue in we school and university and among we literary folk as a expression -lrb- though one hope exceptional -rrb- of commercial jealousy on we side i may quote a passage from a letter from a business friend of mine in lancashire he say : i remember about a _ fortnight before _ the war break out with germany have a conversation with a business man in manchester and he say to I that we most certainly ought to join in with the other nation and sweep the german off the face of the earth i ask he _ why _ and he only answer be ' _ look at the figure of germany 's export they be almost as high as ours _ ' all he have against they be they enterprise -- commercial jealousy on the other hand the head of a large warehouse tell I only a few day later that when travel in germany for he firm some fifteen year ago he have a conversation with a german in the course of which he -lrb- the englishman -rrb- say : i find you people so oblige and friendly that i think surely whatever little difference there be between we as nation will be dispel by closer intercourse and so all danger of war will pass away no reply the german you be quite mistaken you and i be friendly but that be only as individual as nation we shall never rest till we have war the english nation may well be contented because they have already _ get _ all the good thing of the earth -- they trade they port they colony but germany will not allow this to go on for ever she will fight for she rightful position in the world she will challenge england 's mercantile supremacy she will have to do so and she will not fail -lrb- 16 -rrb- thus the plot thicken the entanglement increase the boer war rouse ill-feeling between england and germany the german navy bill follow in 1900 and the kaiser announce he intention of create a sea-power the equal of any in the world britain of course reply with she navy bill and the two country be commit to a mad race of armament the whole of europe stand by anxious fear and greed the two meanest of human passion rule everywhere fear of a militarist germany begin to loom large upon the more pacific state of europe on the other hand the fatality of alsace-lorraine loom in germany full of foreboding of revenge france have find a friend in russium -- a sinister alliance britain convince that trouble be at hand come to a understanding with france in 1904 and with russium in 1907 the triple entente be bear as a set-off against the triple alliance the agadir incident in 1911 betray the purely commercial nature of the design of the four power concern -- france spain england and germany -- and a war over the corpse of morocco be only narrowly avoid germany feel quite naturally that she be the victim of a plot and thenceforth be alternately convulse by mad ambition and haunt by a lurk terror and now we come to the last act of the great drama so far the relation of germany with russium have not be strain if there be any fear of russium it be quite in the background the junker -- themselves half slav -- have supply a large number of the russian official man like plehve and klingenberg the russian bureaucracy be found on and follow the method of the german the japanese war call russium 's attention away to another part of the world and at the same time expose she weakness but if germany be not trouble about russium a different sentiment be grow up in russium itself the people there be begin to hate the official german influence and its hard atmosphere of militarism so foreign to the russian mind they be look more and more to france bismarck have make a great mistake in the treaty of berlin -- mistake which he afterwards fully recognize and regret he have use the treaty to damage and weaken russium and have so throw russium into the arm of france a strange nemesis be prepare the program of german expansion -- natural enough in itself but engineer by prussium during all this long period with that kind of blind haughtiness and overbearing assurance which indeed be a tempting of providence -- have so far not concerned itself much about muscovite policy but now there arise a sudden fear of danger in that quarter hitherto the main german objective have undoubtedly be england and france belgium and holland -- the westward movement towards the atlantic and the great world but now all unexpectedly or at any rate with dramatic swiftness russium appear on the scene and there be a _ volte face _ towards the east the balkan war of 1912 and 1913 break out whatever simmering of hostility there may have be between germany and russium before the relation of the two now become seriously strain the balkan league form under russian influence be nominally direct against turkey but it be also a threat to austria it provide a powerful backing to the servian agitation it be a step towards the dissolution of austrium and it decisively close the door on germany 's ambition to reach salonika and to obtain a direct connection with the baghdad railway germany and austrium all at once find themselves isolate in the midst of europe with russium servium france and england hostile on every side it be indeed a tragic situation and all the more so when view as the sorry outcome and culmination of a hundred year of prussian diplomacy and statecraft why under these circumstance austrium -lrb- with germany of course behind she -rrb- should have dictate most insulting term to servium and then refuse to accept servium 's most humble apology be difficult to understand the only natural explanation be that the germanic power on the whole thought it best even as matter stand to precipitate war that notwithstanding all the complication they think that the long-prepared-for hour have come the german white book put the matter as a mere _ necessity _ of self-defence have the servian be allow with the help of russium and france to endanger the integrity of the neighbouring monarchy much longer the consequence must have be the gradual disruption of austrium and the subjection of the whole slav world to the russian sceptre with the result that the position of the german race in central europe would have become untenable but it be obvious that this plea be itself untenable since it make a quite distant and problematic danger the excuse for a sudden and insulting blow -- for a blow in fact almost certain to precipitate the danger how the matter be decide in berlin we can not at present tell or what the motive exactly be it seem rather probable that the kaiser throw he weight on the side of peace the german executive at any rate see that the great war they have so long contemplated and so long prepare for be close upon they -- only in a unexpected form hugely complicated and threatening they must have realize the great danger of the situation but they very likely may have think that by another piece of bluff similar to that of 1908-9 they might intimidate russium a second time and they believe that russium be behindhand in she military preparation they also it appear think that england would not fight be too much preoccupy with ireland indium and other trouble and so it may have seem that now be the psychological moment austrium open with war on servium -lrb- 28th of July -rrb- and the next day russium declare a considerable though not complete mobilization from that moment a general conflagration be practically inevitable the news of russium 's warlike movement cause a perfect panic in berlin the tension of feeling swing round completely for the time be from enmity against england and france to fear of russium the final mobilization of the russian troops -lrb- 31st of July -rrb- be follow by the telegram between the kaiser and the tsar and by the formal mobilization -lrb- really already complete -rrb- of the german army and navy on the 1st of August war be declare at berlin on the 1st of August and the same or next day the german force enter luxemburg on August 4th they enter belgium and war be declare by england against germany \* \* \* \* \* look back at the history of the whole affair one seem to see as i have say a kind of fatality about it the great power and vigor of the german people show by they early history in europe have be break up by the religious and other dissension of the sixteenth and seventeenth century it fall to prussia to become the center of organization for a new germany the rich human and social material of the german state -- they literary artistic and scientific culture they philosophy they learning -- cluster curiously enough round the hard and military nucleus of the north it be perhaps they instinct and for the time they salvation to do so the new germany hem in on all side by foreign power could only see she way to reasonable expansion and recognition and a field for she latent activity by the use of force military force a long succession of political philosopher drill this into she she embark in small war and always with success she become a political unity and a great power in europe and then come she commercial triumph riches beyond all expectation flow in and a mercantile class arise in she midst whose ideal of life be of a corresponding character -- the ideal of the wealthy shopkeeper what wonder that feel she power feeling herself more than ever baulk of she rights she cast she eye abroad and covet the imperial and commercial supremacy of the world in this she have the example of britain before she britain have lay land to land and market to market over the globe and show no particular scruple in the matter why should not germany do the same it be true that britain always carry the bible with she -- but this be mere british cant britain carry the bible in she left hand but in she right a sword and when she use the latter she always let the former drop germany could do likewise -- but without that odious pretence of morality and those crocodile tear over the unfortunate whom she devour it be only a question of might and organization and armament so far germany seem to have have a perfectly good case and though we in england might not like she ambition we could not reasonably find fault with motive so perfectly similar to we own we might indeed make a grievance of the frank brutality display in she method and the defense of they but then she might with equal right object to we everlasting pretence of morality and we concealment of mercenary and imperial aim under the cloak of virtue and innocence one really must confess that it be difficult to say which be the worse but if the crystallization of germany round the prussian nucleus be for the time the source of germany 's success it be a question whether it be not even now become something quite different and the likely cause of a serious downfall it would seem hardly probable that the amalgamation between element so utterly dissimilar can permanently endure the kindly studious sociable rather naïvely innocent german mass-people drag by the scruff of the neck into the arena of militarism and world-politics may for a time have have they head turn by the exalted position in which they find themselves but it be not likely that they will continue for long to enjoy the situation with no great instinct for politics nor any marked gift of tact and discernment unsuccessful as a rule as colonist -lrb- 17 -rrb- and with no understanding of how to govern -- except on the prussian line which be every day become more obsolete and less adapt to the modern world -- the rôle which they empire-building philosopher set out for they be one which they be eminently unfitted to fulfil it be sad but we can not blame they for the defect they blame the world in general for siding against they in this affair but do not see that in most case it have be they own want of perception which have leave they on the wrong side of the hedge bismarck with he blood and iron policy make a huge blunder in not perceive that in the modern world spiritual force be arise which must for ever discredit the same he emphasize the blunder by wrest alsace-lorraine from france and again by crippling russium in the treaty of 1878 -- thus make enemy where generosity might have bring he friend the german executive in July of last year -lrb- 1914 -rrb- show extraordinary want of tact in not see that russium rebuff in 1908 over bosnium and herzegovina would never put up with a _ second _ insult of the same kind over servium the same government be strangely unable to perceive that whatever it might tactically gain by the invasion and devastation of belgium would be more than lose by the moral effect of such action on the whole world and notwithstanding its army of spy it have not the sense to see that england whether morally bind to or not be certain at all cost to fight in defense of belgium 's neutrality so true it be that without the understanding which come from the heart all the paraphernalia of science and learning and the material result of organization and discipline be of little good but however we choose to apportion the blame or at least the responsibility for the situation among the various government concern the main point and the main lesson of it all be to see that any such apportionment do not much matter as long as we government be construct as they be -- that be on the principle of represent not the real mass of they respective people but the interest of certain class especially the commercial financial and military class -- so long will such war be inevitable the real blame rest not with the particular foreign policy of this or that country but with the fact that europe already rise through she mass-people into a far finer and more human and spiritual life than of old still lie bind in the chain of a almost feudal social order when the great german mass-people find this out when they discover the little rift in the lute which now separate they real quality from the false standard of they own dominant military and commercial folk then they true rôle in the world will begin and a glorious rôle it will be footnote : -lrb- 13 -rrb- a german he say could not live long in the atmosphere of england -- a atmosphere of sham prudery conventionality and hollowness see article on treitschke by wh dawson in the _ nineteenth century _ for January 1915 -lrb- 14 -rrb- the influence however of bernhardus in he own country have be somewhat exaggerated in england -lrb- 15 -rrb- it seem that the same remark be make about the german in the usa that they take little interest in politics there -lrb- 16 -rrb- this attitude be exactly corroborate by herr maximilian harden 's manifesto originally publish in _ die zukunft _ and lately reprint in the _ new york time _ -lrb- 17 -rrb- though this be only perhaps true of they state colony in they individual and missionary colonize group and as pioneer settler they seem to have succeed well vi the healing of nation -lrb- 18 -rrb- it be quite possible that the little rift within the lute allude to in the conclude paragraph of last chapter may widen so far as to cause before long great internal change and reconstruction in germany herself but short of that happen it would seem that there be no alternative for the ally but to continue the war until she militarism can be put out of court and that for long year to come there be no alternative because she have reveal she hand too clearly as a menace -- if she should prevail -- of barbarous force to the whole world it be this menace which have rouse practically the whole world against she and there be this amount of good in the situation namely that while with the victory of germany a german terror might be establish through the world with the victory of the ally neither england nor france nor russium nor little belgium nor any other country could claim a final credit and supremacy with the latter victory we shall be free from the nightmare claim of any one nation 's world-empire but in order to substantiate this result england must also abdicate she claim she must abdicate she mere crass insistence on commercial supremacy the nation of shopkeeper theory which have in the past make she the hate of other nation which have create within she border a vulgar and unpleasant class -- the repository of much arrogant wealth -- must cease to be the standard of she life i have before I at this moment a manifesto of the british empire league patronize by royalty and the duke and of which lord rothschild be treasurer the constitution of the league be frame in 1895 and i note with regret that positively the five principal object of the league mention therein have solely to do with the extension and facilitation of britain 's trade and the co-operation of the military and naval force of the empire with a special view to the due protection of the trade route not a word be say _ in the whole manifesto _ about the human and social responsibility of this vast empire not a word about the guardianship and nurture of native race they guidance and assistance among the pitfall of civilization not a word about the principle of honor and just deal with regard to we civilized neighbour-nation in europe and elsewhere not a word about the political freedom and welfare of all class at home one rub one 's eye and look at the document again but it be so its one inspiration be -- trade see that i confess to a sinking of the heart can we blame germany for struggle at all cost to enlarge she border when _ that _ be what the british empire mean until we rise as a nation to a conception of what we mean by we national life finer and grander than a mere counting of trade-return what can we expect save failure and ill-success possibly in the conviction that she be fight for a worthy object -lrb- the ending of militarism -rrb- and in the determination -lrb- if sincerely carry out -rrb- of once more play she part in the world as the protector of small nation britain may find she salvation and a cause which will save she soul it be certainly encourage to find that there be a grow feeling in favor of the recognition and rehabilitation of the small people of the world if it be true that britain by she grasp imperial commercialism in the past -lrb- and let we hope that period _ be _ past -rrb- have rouse jealousy and hatred among the other nation equally be it true that germany to-day by she dream of world-conquest have be rousing hatred and fear but the day have go by of world-empire found on the lust of conquest whether that conquest be military or commercial the modern people surely be grow out of dream so childish as that the world-empire of goethe and beethoven be even now far more extensive far more powerful than that which wilhelm ii and he junker be seek to encompass there be something common unworthy in the effort of domination and while the great power have thus vulgarize themselves it be the little country who have go forward in the path of progress in modern europe what do we not owe to little switzerland light the torch of freedom six hundred year ago and keep it alight through all the century when despotic monarchy hold the rest of the european continent and what to free holland with she great man of learning and she painter surpass those of all other country save italy so the small scandinavian nation have give to the world famous man of science from linnaeus downward poet like tegner and björnson scholar like madvig dauntless explorer like fridthiof nansen england have in the age of shakespeare bacon and milton a population little larger than that of bulgarium to-day the united state in the day of washington and franklin and jefferson and hamilton and marshall count fewer inhabitant than denmark or greece -lrb- 19 -rrb- in all they internal politics and social advancement switzerland holland denmark norway and sweden finland -lrb- until the paw of the bear be on she -rrb- and belgium -lrb- till the claw of the spread-eagle -rrb- have be well to the fore it be they who have carry on the banner of idealism which germany herself uplift when she be a small people or a group of small people it be they who have really have prosperous healthy independent and alert population how much more interesting we may say would europe be under the variety of such a regime than under the monotonous bureaucracy and officialism of any great power and to some such scheme we must adhere it would mean of course the alliance of all the state of western europe large and small -lrb- and include both a remodel germany and a largely remodelled austrium -rrb- in one great federation -- whose purpose would be partly to unite and preserve europe against any common foe from the east or elsewhere and partly to regulate any overweening ambition of a member of the federation such as might easily become a menace to the other member a secondary but most important result of the formation of such a united state of europe would be that while each state would probably preserve a small military establishment of its own the enormous and fatal incubus of the present armament system would be render unnecessary and so at last the threat of national bankruptcy and ruin which have of late pursue the nation like a evil dream might pass away but in that matter of finance it can not be disguise that a terrible period still await the european people already the moneylender sit on they chest form a veritable nightmare but with fresh debt by the thousand million sterling be contract there be great danger that the mass-people beneath will be worse paralyse and break even than they be now -- unless indeed with a great effort they rouse themselves and throw off the evil burden that the world be wake up to a recognition of _ racial _ rights -- that be the right of each race to have as far as possible its own government instead of be lord over by a alien race -- be a good sign and a european settlement along that line must be press for at last after century of discomfort we at home be find we solution of the irish question in this very obvious way and it may be that europe tire of war may finally have the sense to adopt the same principle of course there be case where population be so mixed as for instance the czech and slovak and german in bohemia and moravium or where small colony of one race be so embedded in the midst of another race as be the german among the roumanian of transylvanium that this solution may be difficult that be no reason however why the general principle should not be apply it _ must _ indeed be apply if europe be not to return to barbarism and it interest we -- have regard to what i have say about _ class _ rule be so fruitful a cause of war -- to remember that the rule of one race by another always do mean class rule the alien conqueror who descend upon a country become the military and landlord caste there thus the norman baron in england the english squire in ireland the magyar in hungary the german baron in east prussium and the baltic province and so forth they make they profit and maintain themselves out of the labor and the taxation of the subject people in the earlier form of social life when man live in tribe a rude equality and democracy prevail there be nothing that could well be call class-government there be simply custom and the leadership of the elder of the tribe then with the oncoming of what we call civilization and the growth of the sense of property difference arise -- accumulation of wealth and power by individual enslavement of tribe by other tribe and class spring up and class-government and so the material of endless suffering and oppression and hatred and warfare i have already explain -lrb- in the introduction -rrb- that class in itself as the mere formation within a nation of group of similar occupation and activity -- work harmoniously with each other and with the nation -- be a perfectly natural and healthy phenomenon it be only when it mean group pursue they own interest counter to each other and to the nation that it become diseased there will come a time when the class-element in this latter sense will be eject from society and society will return again to its democratic form and structure there will be no want in that time of variety of occupation and talent or of differentiation in the social organism quite the contrary but simply there will be no predatory or parasitical group within such organism whose interest will run counter to the whole and which will act -lrb- as such class act now -rrb- as focus and seedbed of disease and strife within the whole with a return to the recognition of racial rights and autonomy over the world it be clear that one great cause of strife will be remove and we shall be one step nearer to the ending of the preposterous absurdity of war and talk about the difficulty of sort out mixed population or of deal with small colony of one race embed in the midst of another race it be evident that once you get rid of autocratic or military or class-government of any kind and return to democratic form this difficulty will be much reduce or disappear small democratic commune be perfectly simple to form in group of any magnitude or minuteness which may be desirable and such group would easily federate or ally themselves with surround democracy of alien race whereas if lord over by alien conqueror they would be in a state of chronic rebellion of such democratic alliance and federation of people of totally different race switzerland supply a well-recognized and far-acclaimed example \* \* \* \* \* that in the future there will be a outcry in favor of conscription make by certain party in britain go without say but that must be persistently oppose the nation say it be fight to put down militarism why then make compulsory militarism foundational in we national life to abolish militarism _ by _ militarism be like put down drink by swallow it the whole lesson of this war be against conscription germany could never have impose herself on europe without it and yet she soldier brave as they naturally be and skilfully as they have fight have not do themselves justice how could they under such condition -- force into battle by they officer fling in heap on the enemy 's gun the voluntary response in britain to the call to arm have be inspiriting and if voluntaryism mean momentary delay in a crisis still it mean success in the end no troops have fight more finely than the british say surgeon-general evatt speaking in london in October -- and general evatt 's word in such a matter ought to carry weight : after long experience in study russian german bavarian saxon french spanish and american fight unit my verdict be unhesitatingly in favor of the british what have occur lately have be a splendid triumph of citizenship because people be allow they proper liberty and the consciousness of freely share in a great empire besides it must always be remember that conscription give a government power to initiate a iniquitous war whereas voluntaryism keep the national life clean and healthy a free people will not fight for the trumped-up scheme and selfish machination of a class -- not indeed unless they be grossly deceive by press and class plot anyhow to force man to fight in cause which they do not approve to compel they to adopt a military career when they temperament be utterly unsuited to such a thing or when they conscience or they religion forbid they -- these thing be both foolish and wicked if the nation want soldier it must pay for they england for example be roll in wealth and it be simply a scandal that the wealthy class should sit at home in comfort and security and pay to the man in the trench -- who be risk he life at every moment and often live in such exhaustion and misery as actually to wish for the bullet which will _ end _ he life -- no more than the minimum wage of a ordinary day-labourer and that they should begrudge every penny pay to he dependent -- whether he be live or dead -- or to himself when he return a lifelong cripple to he home to starve and stint you own soldier to discourage recruiting and then to make the consequent failure of man to come forward into a excuse for conscription be the meanest of policy as a matter of fact the circumstance of the present war show that with anything like decent reward for they service there be a abundant a almost over-abundant supply of man ready to flock to the standard of they country in a time of necessity nor must it be forget in this matter of pay that the general type and average of we force to-day whether naval or military be far higher than it be fifty year ago the man be just as plucky and more educate more alert more competent in every way to keep they up to this high standard of efficiency they need a high standard of care and consideration it may however be say -- in view of we present industrial condition and the low standard of physical health and vitality prevail among the young folk of we large town -- that physical drill and scout training include ambulance and other work and qualification in _ some _ useful trade might very well be make a part of we general educational system for rich and poor alike say between the age of sixteen and eighteen such a training would to each individual boy be immensely valuable and by provide some rudimentary understanding of military affair and the duty of public service and citizenship would enable he to choose _ how _ he could be helpful to the nation -- provide always he be not force to make he choice in a direction distasteful or repugnant to he in any good cause as in a war of _ defense _ against a foreign enemy it be obvious enough as i have say that there would be plenty of native enthusiasm forthcoming without legal or official pressure however i have enlarged a little on the subject of conscription in a later chapter and will say no more here but the burning and press question be : why should we -- we the enlighten and civilized nation of europe -- get involve in these senseless war at all and surely _ this _ war will of all war force a answer to the question here for the last twenty year have these so-called great power be stand round all profess that they one desire be peace and all meanwhile arm to the tooth each accuse the other of militant intention and all lament that war be inevitable here they have be form they _ entente _ and alliance carry on they diplomatic cabal and intrigue study the map and adjust the balance of power -- all of course with the best intention -- and lo with the present result what nonsense what humbug what a utter bankruptcy of so-called diplomacy when will the people themselves arise and put a stop to this fooling -- the people who give they life and pay the cost of it all if the present-day diplomat and foreign minister have sincerely strive for peace then they utter incapacity and futility have be prove to the hilt and they must be sweep away if they have not sincerely strive for peace but only pretend to so strive then also they must be sweep away for deceit in such a matter be unpardonable and no doubt the latter alternative be the true one there have be a pretence of the government all round -- a pretence of deep concern for humanity and the welfare of the mass-people commit to they charge but the real move power beneath have be _ class _ - interest -- the interest of the great commercial class in each nation with its acolyte and attendant the military or aristocratic it be this class with its greed and vanity and suspicion and jealousy which be the cause of strife the working-mass of the various nation have no desire to quarrel with each other nay they be animated by a very different spirit in a interesting article publish by the german socialist paper _ vorwärts _ on September 27 1914 and reproduce in we press occur the following passage in which the war be trace to its commercial source : germany have enjoy a economical prosperity such as no other country have experience during the last decade that mean with the capitalist class a revival of strong imperialist tendency which have be evident enough this again give rise to mistrust abroad at least in capitalist circle who do they best to communicate they feeling to the great mass and so the german people as a whole have be make responsible for what have be the work of a small class the comrade abroad can be assure that though german workman be ready to defend they country they will above all not forget that they interest be the same as those of the proletariat in other country who also against they will be force into the war and now do they duty they can rest assure that the german people be not less humane than other -- a result to which education through workman 's organization have greatly contribute if german soldier in the excitement of war should commit atrocity it can be say that among we -- and also in other circle -- there will not be a single person to approve of they read this statement -- so infinitely more sensible and human than anything to be find in the ordinary capitalist press of england and germany -- one can not help feeling that there be practically little hope for the future _ until _ the international work mass throughout europe come forward and join hand with each other take charge of the foolish old government -lrb- who represent the remains of the decadent feudal and commercial system -rrb- and shape the western world at last to the heart 's desire of the people that inhabit it the people of the world desire peace say bourtzeff the russian exile -lrb- 20 -rrb- -- and he who have be in many land ought to know but they also -- if they would obtain peace -- must exercise a eternal vigilance lest they fall into the hand of class-schemer and be betray into that which they do _ not _ desire the example of germany -- which we have consider above -- show how easily a good and friendly and pacific people may by mere political inattention and ignorance and by a quasi-scientific philosophy which impose on its political ignorance be lead into a disastrous situation it show how preposterous it be that government generally -- as at present constitute -- should set themselves up as the representative of the mass-people ' wish and as the arbiter of national destiny and it show how vitally necessary it be that the people even the work mass and the peasant should have some sort of political education and understanding in that matter of the political education of the mass america in she united state and canada yield a fine example though not certainly perfect she general standard of education and alertness be infinitely superior to that of the people of the old world and some writer contend that it be just in that -- in she general level and not in she freak of genius -- that america 's claim lie to distinction among the nation of the earth if you consider the people of the old world whether in england scotland or ireland in france spain italy germany austrium russium or farther east and farther south over the earth you will find the great mass on the land or in the workshop still sink in vast ignorance apathy and irresponsibility only here and there among those i have mention and notably among the smaller people of western europe like switzerland holland denmark and sweden be the mass begin to stir as it be towards the daylight it can only be with the final opening of they eye and awaken from slumber that the rule of the class will be at a end but that awaken -- with the enormous spread of literature and locomotion and intercommunication of all kind over the modern world can not now one would say be long delay \* \* \* \* \* meanwhile and until that era arrive we can only insist -lrb- at any rate in we own country -rrb- on a different kind of foreign policy from what we have have -- a policy open and strong not found on spread-eagleism and decidedly not found on commercialism and the interest of the trading class -lrb- as the empire league seem to desire -rrb- but direct towards the real welfare of the mass in we own and other land if we ruler and representative really seek peace here be the obvious way to ensue and secure it -- namely by make political friend of those in all country who _ desire peace _ and be already stretch hand of amity to each other what simpler and more obvious way can there be we hail we working-class comrade of every land say the manifesto of the independent labor party across the roar of gun we send greet to the german socialist they have labor unceasingly to promote good relation with britain as we with germany they be no enemy of ours but faithful friend in force this appalling crime upon the nation it be the ruler the diplomat the militarist who have seal they doom in tear and blood and bitterness the greater democracy will be bear with steadfast faith we greet the future we cause be holy and imperishable and the labor of we hand have not be in vain yes we must have a foreign policy strong and sincere -- and not only so but open and avowed the present diplomatic system be impossible of continuance it have grow up in a automatic way out of antiquated condition and no one in particular can be blame for it but that young man profoundly ignorant of the world and have the very _ borné _ outlook on life which belong to we gilded youth -lrb- 67 per cent of the candidate for the diplomatic corps be draw from eton alone -rrb- have also in high degree that curious want of cosmopolitan sympathy and adaptability which be characteristic of the english wealthy class -lrb- every candidate for the corps must have at least # 400 a year of he own -rrb- -- that such a type should be charge with the representation of the unite kingdom in foreign affair be to-day a hopeless anomaly and indeed a very great danger the recommendation just publish of the royal commission be in the right direction but they need urgent reinforcement and extension by the pressure of public opinion and if in the present-day situation of affair we can not refer every question which arise directly to the nation we must at least do away with the one-man-secretary system and have in he place a large and responsible committee representative not of any one party or class but as far as possible of the whole people -lrb- at this moment for instance as far as we know the term of settlement of the present war may actually be be arrange over we head and yet that may be take place quite apart from the approval and the wish of the most weighty portion of the nation -rrb- another thing that we must look to with some hope for the future be the influence of woman profoundly shock as they be by the senseless folly and monstrous bloodshed of the present conflict it be certain that when this phase be over they will insist on have a voice in the politics of the future the time have go by when the mother and wife and daughter of the race will consent to sit by meek and silent while the man in they madness be blow each other 's brain out and make mountain out of corpse it be hardly to be expect that war will cease from the earth this side of the millennium but woman will surely only condone it when urge by some tremendous need or enthusiasm they will not rejoice -- as man sometimes do -- in the mere lust of domination and violence with they keen perception of the little thing of life and the way in which the big thing be related to these they will see too clearly the cost of war in broken heart and ruin home to allow they man to embark in it short of the direst necessity and through the woman i come back to the elementary cause and root of the present war -- the little fiber in we social life which have feed and be still feed the fatal tree whose fruit be not the healing but the strife of nation in the present day -- though there may be other influence -- it be evident enough that rampant and unmeasured commercial greed concentrate itself in a special class be the main cause the tap-root of the whole business and this equally evidently spring out of the innumerable greed of _ individual _ -- the countless fiber that combine to one result -- the desire of private person to get rich quick at all cost to make they gain out of other ' loss to take advantage of each other to triumph in success regardless of other ' failure and these unworthy motive and inhuman characteristic again spring obviously out of the mean and materialistic ideal of life which still have sway among we -- the ideal of wealth and luxury and display -- of which the horror of war be the sure and certain obverse as long as we foster these thing in we private life so long will they lead in we public life to the embitterment of nation against nation what be the ruling principle of the interior and domestic conduct of each nation to-day -- even within its own border -- but a indecent scramble of class against class of individual against individual to rise to noisy power and influence and to ill-bred wealth and riches by trample other down and profit by they poverty be -- as ruskin long ago tell we -- the real and prevailing motive of we people whatever they profession of christianity may be small wonder then if out of such interior condition there rise to dominance in the great world those very class who exhibit the same vulgarity in they most perfect form and that _ they _ conflict with each other as between nation and nation exhibit to we in the magnify and hideous form of war the same sore which be all the time corrupt we internal economy the brutality and atrocity of modern war be but the reflection of the brutality and inhumanity of we commercial regime and ideal the slaughter of the battlefield may be more obvious but it be less deliberate and it be doubtful whether it be really worse than the daily and yearly slaughter of the railway the mine and the workshop that be so it be no good protest against and be shock at a evil which be we very own creation and to cry out against war-lord be useless when it be _ we _ desire and ambition which set the war-lord in motion let all those who indulge and luxuriate in ill-gotten wealth to-day -lrb- and indeed they name be legion -rrb- as well as all those who meanly and idly groan because they wealth be take from they think long and deeply on these thing truth and simplicity of life be not mere fad they be something more than abstraction and private affair something more than social ornament they be vital matter which lie at the root of national well-being they be thing which in they adoption or in they denial search right through the tissue of public life to live straightforwardly by you own labor be to be at peace with the world to live on the labor of other be not only to render you life false at home but it be to encroach on those around you to invite resistance and hostility and when such a principle of life be favor by a whole people that people will not only be in a state of internal strife but will assuredly raise up external enemy on its border who will seek its destruction the work mass and the peasant whose life be in the great whole honest -- who support themselves -lrb- and a good many other besides -rrb- by they own labor -- _ have no quarrel _ and they be the folk who to-day -- notwithstanding lie and slander galore and much of race-prejudice and ignorance -- stretch hand of amity and peace to each other wellnigh all over the world it be of the modern moneyed class that we may say that they life-principle -lrb- that of take advantage of other and live on they labor -rrb- be essentially false -lrb- 21 -rrb- and these be the class which be distinctively the cause of enmity in the modern world and which as i have explain above be able to make use of the military class in order to carry out they design it can only be with the ending of the commercial and military class as class that peace can come to the world china found on the anti-commercial principle of confucius disband she army a thousand year ago and only quite lately -- under the frantic menace of western civilization -- feel compel to reorganize they she be a thousand year before she time it can only be with the emergence of a new structure of society base on the principle of solidarity and mutual aid among the individual of a nation and so extend to solidarity and mutual aid among nation that peace can come to the western world it be the best hope of the present war that like some frightful illness it mark the work out of deep-seated evil and they expulsion from the social organism and that with its end the old false civilization build on private gain will perish crush by its own destructive force and in its place the new the real culture will arise found on the essential unity of mankind footnote : -lrb- 18 -rrb- reprint by permission from the _ english

commercialism should be false commerce and interchange of goods be of course a perfectly natural and healthy function of social life indeed it be a function which should have a most beneficent influence in bind nation together it be when that function be pervert to private gain that it become false but of course without this perversion there would be no distinctively commercial _ class _ with interest oppose to those of the community vii patriotism and internationalism many socialist and sympathizer with the labor movement over the world belittle patriotism and seem to think that by decry and discourage the love of one 's country one will bring nearer the day of internationalism i do not agree of course we all know there be a lot of sham and false patriotism -- such as for instance pressmonger magnify and make use of in order to sell they papers or such as comfortable well-to-do folk with big dividend do so heartily encourage among the poorer class who can thus be persuade to fight for they we know indeed that there be a good deal of very mean and unworthy patriotism -- the flag-waving variety for instance which we see in the boer war -- exultant over a small nation of farmer defend they home and whip up deliberately by a commercial gang for they own purpose or the narrow-minded lie canting variety which blind a people to its own fault and credit itself with all the moral virtue while at the same time it gloat over every defamation of the enemy there be a good deal of that variety in the present war and it be easy to understand that many people sick of that sort of patriotism would go straight for a ready-made denial of all frontier and boundary still allow to the full all that can be say in the above direction one must admit also that there be such a thing as a true patriotism and i do not see why -- however socialist or cosmopolitan we may be -- we should not recognize what be a obvious fact there be a love of one 's own country -- a genuine attachment to and preference for it -- in spite of all temptation to belong to other nation -- which after all be very natural and on the whole a sound and healthy thing there may be some people whose mind be so lofty that to they all people and race be alike and without preference but one know that the vast multitude of we mortal earth be not make like that if a man love not he brother whom he have see how shall he love god whom he have not see it be certainly easier and more natural to make a effort and a sacrifice for the sake of you own countryman whom you know so well and with whom you be link by a thousand tie than for the sake of foreigner who be little more than a name -- however worthy you may honestly believe the latter to be it be more obvious and instinctive for a man to work for he own family than to give he service to he municipality or he county council charity begin at home and the wider spirit of human love and helpfulness which pass beyond the narrow bound of the family hearth have perhaps to find a intermediate sphere before it can unfold itself and expand in the great field of humanity among all color and race personally i be probably more international by temperament than patriotic i feel a strange kinship and intimacy with all sort of queer and outlandish race -- chinese egyptian mexican or polynesian -- and always a slight but persistent sense of estrangement and misapprehension among my own people flag-waving certainly do not stir I still i feel that whatever one 's country may be the love of it have value and be not to be scoff at the nation be bigger than the parish and to a man of limited outlook it be a means of get he out of he own very narrow and local circle of life to rob he of that in order to jump he into a cosmopolitan attitude -lrb- which to he may be quite empty and arid -rrb- be a mistake it be easy enough to break the shell for the grow chick but if you break it too soon you chick when hatch will be dead if you look at the great majority of those who be enthuse just now about we country and patriotically detest the german you will see that notwithstanding lie and slander and cant galore and much of conceit and vanity they patriotism _ be _ pull they together from one end of britain to another cause they to help each other in a thousand way urge they to make sacrifice for the common good help they to grow the sinew and limb of the body politic and even the wing which will one day transport that body into a bigger world really i think we ought to be very grateful to the german for do all this for we and the german ought to be grateful to we for a exactly similar reason you will see plainly enough that the great majority of those who be at this moment give they thought and life for they countryman and neighbor either in germany or in england could not by any manner of possibility be expect to act with similar self-surrender and enthusiasm in a international cause they be not grow to that point of development yet and it be better that they should learn helpfulness and brotherhood within somewhat narrow bound than perhaps not learn these thing at all in the open and indiscriminate field of universal equality after all to stimulate love and friendship there be nothing like a common enemy it be a old story and a old difficulty there come a time when every institution of social life become rotten and diseased and have to be remove to make way for the new life which be expand behind it broadly speak we may say that the institution of patriotism be _ approach _ this period -- at any rate over western europe the outline of a international life be become clearly visible behind it what we have to do be to help on that international life and spirit to we best and certainly clear out a lot of sham patriotism that stand in its way but this have to be do with discrimination and a certain tact people must be make to see that my country right or wrong be not the genuine article they must be make to understand how easily this sort of slapdash sentiment throw they into the hand of scheming politician and wire-puller for sinister purpose -- how readily it can be make use of directly it have become a mere unreasoning instinct and habit if a war be wanted or conscription or a custom tariff -- it may be merely to suit the coward fear of autocratic ruler or the selfish interest of some group of contractor or concession-hunter -- all that the party concern have to do be to play the patriotic stop and they stand a good chance of get what they want just now there be a good bit of fleece go on in this fashion -- both of the public and the wage-worker even in its more healthy form when delay in too long patriotism easily become morbid and delay also the birth of the larger spirit which be wait behind it the continental socialist complain that they cause have hitherto make little progress in alsace-lorraine and poland for the simple reason that political circumstance have over-accentuate the patriotic devotion in both these region thus we have to push on with discrimination always we have to remember that the wide free sense of equality and kinship which lie at the root of internationalism be the real goal and that the other thing be but a step on the way albeit a necessary step always we have to press on towards that great and final liberation -- the realization of we common humanity the recognition of the same great soul of man slumber under all form in the heart of all race -- the one guarantee and assurance of the advent of world-peace that we be verge rapidly towards some altered perspective i quite believe and the day be come when in the social and political sphere international activity will make excessive patriotism seem somewhat ridiculous -- as in fact it have already do in the sphere of science and industry and art still i also do not see any reason why the two tendency should not work side by side the health of local organ and member in the human body be by no means incompatible with the health of the whole organism and we may understand the great map of humanity all the better for its be differently color in different part viii the psychology of war and recruit _ November _ 1914 i sometimes think the country-folk round about where i live the most sensible people i know they say with regard to the war -- or say at its outset : what be they fight about _ i _ can not make out and nobody seem to know what i have see o ' the german they be a decent enough folk -- much like ourselves if there be get to be fightin ' why do not they as make the quarrel go and fight wus ' each other but kill all they folk that be get no quarrel and burnin ' they house and farm and tramplin ' down all that good corn -- and all they brave man dead what can never live again -- its scandalous i say this at the outset but afterwards when the papers have duly explain that the german be mere barbarian and savage bent on reduce the whole world to military slavery they begin to take side and feel there be good cause for fight meanwhile almost exactly the same thing be happen in germany where england be be represent as a greedy and deceitful power try to boss and crush all the other nation thus each nation do what be perhaps from its own point of view the most sensible thing to do -- persuade itself that it be fight in a just and heroic cause that it be a st george against the dragon a david out to slay goliath the attitude of the peasant however or agriculturist all over the world be the same he do not deal in romantic talk about st george and the dragon he see too clearly the downright fact of life he have no interest in fight and he do not want to fight be the one honest man in the community -- the one man who create not only he own food but the food of other besides and who know the value of he work he perceive without illusion the foolery of war the hideous waste of it the shocking toll of agony and loss which it inflict -- and if leave to himself would as a rule have no hand in it it be only occasionally -- when ground down beyond endurance by the rent-racking class above he or threaten beyond endurance by a enemy from abroad that he turn he reaping-hook into a sword and he muck-fork into a three-pronged bayonet exchange he fowling-piece for a rifle and fight savagely for he home and he bit of a field england curiously enough be almost the only country in the world where the peasant or ordinary field-worker _ have _ no field of he own -lrb- 22 -rrb- and i find that in the village and among the general agricultural population there be even now but little enthusiasm for the present war -- though the raid on we coast at scarborough and other place certainly do something to stimulate it partly this be as i have say because the agricultural worker know that he work be foundational and that nothing else be of importance compare with it -lrb- at this moment for instance there be peasant in belgium and northern france ploughing and sowing and so forth actually close to the trench and between the fighting line -rrb- partly it be because in england alas the countryman _ have _ so little right or direct interest in the soil one wonder sometimes why he _ should _ feel any enthusiasm why should man want to fight for they land when they have no land to fight for -- when the most they can do be to die at the foot of a trespass-board singing briton never never shall be slave if the war be ever finish surely one of the first thing to be insist on afterwards with regard to england must be the settlement of the actual people -lrb- not the parasite -rrb- on the land else how after all that they have go through can it be expect that they will ever again fight for they country but that this vast landless population in the village and country district -- hunger as it be for some sure tenure and interest in the soil -- should actually as now be berate and scold by superior person of the upper class and threaten with conscription if it do not come forward more readily be a spectacle sufficient to gratify the most hardened cynic certainly it be remarkable that such number of the great work mass of this country -lrb- include villager -rrb- should come forward in connexion with the war and join the standard and the rank of fight man -- as they do -- and it be a thing for which one must honor they but in that matter there be not a few consideration to be keep in mind in the first place a large number be not really very enthusiastic but simply join because pressure to do so be put upon they by they master the press-gang of old exist no longer but substitute for they revive in subtler form many large landlord for instance have give notice to a percentage of they gamekeeper gardener park employee and the like to the effect that they service be no longer require but that if they enlist in the rank now they will be reinstate in they master ' service again when the war be over -lrb- if still alive be we presume understand -rrb- large number of manufacturing and other firm have notify they workman and clerk in similar term this mean pretty serious economic pressure a man in the prime of life suddenly oust from he job and with no prospect either of find a similar job elsewhere or of learn any new one be in a pretty fix he only certain refuge lie in the fact that he can be teach to use a rifle in a few week and in a few week perhaps it become clear to he that to accept that offer and the pay that go with it -- poor as it be -- be he only chance there be other again -- perhaps a very large number -- who do not care much about the war in itself and probably have only the vaguest notion of what it be all about but for they to join the rank mean adventure comradeship the open air -- all fascinating thing and they hail the prospect with joy as a escape from intolerable dullness -- from the monotony of the desk and the stuffy office from the dreary round and mechanical routine of the factory bench from the depressing environment of home and domestic squalor i must confess -- though i have no general prejudice in favor of war -- that i have be much strike since the outbreak of the present one by the altered look of crowd of young man whom i personally know -- who be now drill or otherwise prepare for it the gay look on they face the blood in they cheek the upright carriage and quick elate step -- when compare with the hang-dog sallow dull creature i know before -- all testify to the working of some magic influence as i say i do not think that this influence in most case have much to do with enthusiasm for the cause or any mere lust of battle -lrb- happily indeed for the most part they do not for a moment realize what modern battle mean -rrb- it be simply escape from the hateful condition of present-day commercialism and its hideous wage-slavery into something like the normal life of young manhood -- a life in the open under the wide sky blood-stir enterprise risk if you will co-operation and _ camaraderie _ these be the invite beckon thing the thing which swing the balance down -- even though hardship low pay and high chance of injury and death be throw in the opposite scale nevertheless and despite these other consideration there do certainly remain in this as in other war a fair number of man among those who enlist who be _ bonâ fide _ inspire by some ideal which they feel to be worth fight for it may be patriotism or love of they country it may be to put down militarism it may be religion or honor or what not and it be fine that it should be so they may in case be delude or mistake about fact the ideal they fight for may be childish -lrb- as in the mediaeval crusade -rrb- still even so it be fine that people should be willing to give they life for a idea -- that they should be capable of be inspire by a vision humanity have at least advance as far as that i suppose patriotism or love of country -- when it come to its full realization as in the case of invasion by a enemy be the most powerful and tremendous of such ideal sweeping everything before it it represent something ingrain in the blood in that case all the other motive for fight -- economic or what not -- disappear and be swallow up material life and social condition under a german government might externally be as comfortable and prosperous as under we own but for most of we something in the soul would wither and sicken at the thought anyhow whatever the motive may be which urge _ individual _ into war -- whether sheer necessity or patriotism or the prospect of wages or distinction or the love of adventure -- a nation or a people in order to fight _ must _ have a cause to fight for something which its public opinion its leader and its press can appropriate -- some phrase which it can inscribe on its shield : be it country or god or freedom from tyranny or culture _ versus _ barbarism it must have some such cry else obviously it could not fight with any whole-heartedness or any force the thing be a psychological necessity every one when he get into a quarrel justify himself and accuse the other party he put he own conduct in a ideal light and the conduct of he opponent in the reverse doubtless if we be all angel and could impartially enter into all the origin of the quarrel we should not fight because to understand would be to forgive but as we have not reach that stage and as we can not even explain why we be quarrel -- the matter be so complex -- we be fain to adopt a phrase and fight on the strength of that it be useless to call this hypocrisy it be a psychological necessity it be the same necessity which make a mistress dismiss she maid on the score of a broken teapot though really she have no end of secret grievance against she or which make the man of science condense the endless complexity of certain physical phenomenon into a neat but lie formulum which he call a _ law of nature _ he could not possibly give all the real fact and so he use a phrase in war therefore each nation adopt a motto as its reason for fight sometimes the two oppose nation both adopt the same motto i england and germany both inscribe on they banner : culture _ versus _ barbarism each believe in its own good faith and each accuse the other of hypocrisy in a sense this be all right and could not be better it do not so much matter which be really the most culture nation england or germany as that each should really _ believe _ that it be fight in the cause of culture then so fight for what it know to be a good cause the wound and death endure and the national loss and depletion be not such sad and dreadful thing as they at first appear they liberate the soul of the individual they liberate the soul of the nation they be sacrifice make for a ideal and -lrb- provide they be truly such -rrb- the god within be well-pleased and come one step nearer to he incarnation whatever inner thing you make sacrifice for the same will in time appear visibly in you life -- blessing or cursing you therefore beware i and take good care as to what that inner thing really be such be the meaning of the use of a phrase or battle-cry but we have indeed to be on we guard against _ how _ we use it it can so easily become a piece of cant or hypocrisy it can so easily be engineer by rule clique and class for they own purpose -- to persuade and compel the people to fight _ they _ battle the politician get we -lrb- for reason which they do not explain -rrb- into a nice little entanglement -- perhaps with some tribe of savage perhaps with a great european power and before the nation know where it be it find itself commit to a campaign which may develop and become a serious war then there be no alternative but for minister to repair to a certain cabinet where the well-dried formula they need be keep hang and select one for they use it may be woman and child or it may be immoral savage or it may be empire or it may be we word of honor have select the right one and duly display and advertise it they have little difficulty in make the nation rise to the bait and fight whatever battle they desire since the early beginning of the human race we can perceive the same process in operation we can almost guess the grade of advancement reach among primitive tribe by simply take note of they _ totem _ these be emblem of the thing which hold the mind of the tribe as admirable or terrible with which it be proud to identify itself -- the fox for instance or the bear the kangaroo or the eagle to be worthy of _ such ideal _ man fight later every little people every knightly family every group of adventurer adopt a device for its shield a motto for its flag a figure of some kind human or more often animal even the modern nation have not get much farther and we can judge of _ they _ stage of advancement by the beast of prey they flaunt on they banner or the deep-throat curse which resound in they national anthem but surely the time have now come -- even with this world-war -- when the great heart of the people will wake up to the savagery and the folly perpetrate in they name the people who although they enjoy a scrap now and then be essentially peaceful essentially friendly all the world over who in the interval of slaughter offer cigarette to they foe and tenderly dress they enemy ' wound whose worst and age-long sin it be that they allow themselves so easily to be dominate and lead by ambitious and greedy schemer -- surely it be time that they should wake up and throw off these sham government -- these government that be three-quarter class-scheming and fraud and only one-quarter genuine expression of public spirit -- and declare the heart of solidarity that be within they the leader and high priest of the world have use the name of christianity to bless they own nefarious work with till the soul be sick at the very sound of the word but surely the time have come when the people themselves out of they own heart will proclaim the advent of the son of man -- conscious of it indeed as a great light of brotherhood shine within they even amid the cloud of race-enmity and ignorance and will deny once for all the gospel of world-empire and conquest which have so long be foist on they for insidiously selfish end a empire base on brotherhood -- a holy _ human _ empire of the world include all race and color in a common unity and equality -- yes but these shoddy empire base on militarism and commercialism and build up in order to secure the unclean ascendancy of two outworn and effete class over the rest of mankind -- a thousand time no that dispensation thank heaven be past these fatuous empire with they parade of power and they absolute lack of any real policy -- this british lion this russian bear these german french and american eagle -- these bird and beast of prey -- with they barbaric notion of greed and war they impossible armament and they swift financial ruin impending -- will fall and be rent asunder the hollow mask of they will perish and the sooner the better but underneath surely there will be rejoice for it will be find that so after all the real people of the earth have come one degree nearer together -- yes one degree nearer together footnote : -lrb-

force military service it must still be admit that the argument in favor of it retain a certain validity : to the extent namely that every one owe a duty of some kind to he own people that it be mean to accept all the advantage of citizenship -- security protection settle condition of life and so forth -- and still to refuse to make sacrifice for one 's country in a time of distress or danger it be difficult of course for any one to trace all the thread and fiber which have work themselves into he life from he own homeland -- as it be difficult for a child to trace all the quality of blood that it owe to its mother but there they be and though some of these native inheritance and condition may not really be to a man 's liking yet he can hardly refuse to acknowledge they or to confess the debt of gratitude that he owe to the land of he birth grant all this however most fully there still remain a long stretch from this admission to that of forced military service the drawback to this latter be many in the first place compulsion anyhow be bad a voluntary citizen army may be all right but to _ compel _ a man to fight whether he will or not -- in violation perhaps of he conscience of he instinct of he temperament -- be a inexcusable outrage on he rights as a human be in the second place it be gross folly for a man who fight devoid of freewill and against he conscience against he temperament can not possibly make a good fighter a army of such recusant however large would be useless and even a few mixed with the other do as a matter of fact greatly lower the efficiency of the whole force associate with they in the third place compulsion mean compulsion by a government and government at any rate to-day means class-rule force military service mean service under and subjection to a class that mean war carry on abroad to serve the interest often iniquitous enough of the few and military operation enter into at home to suppress popular discontent or to confirm class-power to none of these thing could any high-minded man of democratic temper consent there be other drawback but these will do to begin with on the other hand if we reject enforced

public service to which -lrb- within the limit of individual conscience and capacity -rrb- every one be bind to respond let it be understand that at a certain age say from sixteen to eighteen -lrb- but the period would no doubt be a movable one -rrb- every one boy or girl rich or poor shall go through a course of training fitting he or she for healthy and effective citizenship this would include _ first of all _ bodily exercise and drill -lrb- need by almost all but especially in the present day by town worker -rrb- all sort of scouting-work familiarity with nature camp and outdoor life then all kind of elementary and necessary trade like agriculture in some form or other metal-work wood-work cloth-work tailor bootmaking then such thing as rifle-shooting ambulance-work nursing cookery and so on let it be understand that _ every one _ male or female rich or poor learn or ignorant be expect to qualify -- not in the whole program but first of all and as far as humanly possible in the primary condition of physical health and development and then after that in some one at any rate of the above-mentioned or similar trade -- so that in case of general need or distress he can do _ something _ of use that would at least be a approach to a valuable and reasonable institution as thing be it be appalling to think of the abject futility and _ uselessness _ of vast class in all the modern nation of to-day -- but perhaps especially in we own nation think of the population of we drawing-room of we well-to-do club of we university of we commercial and professional office whose occupation whatever they be be entirely remote from the direct need and meaning of life or again of the vast mass who inhabit the mean street of we great town ignorant ill-grown unskilled and in a chronic state of most precarious and uncertain employment what would these population do in any case of national crisis -- say in a case of serious war or famine or huge bankruptcy of trade or multitudinous invasion by chinese or japanese or of total collapse of credit and industry with a few brilliant exception they would collapse too they could not feed themselves clothe themselves or defend themselves they could not build shelter from the storm or make tool or weapon of any kind for they own use they would be unable to nurse each other in illness or cook for each other in health a tribe of arab or a commando of boer farmer would be far more competent than they but the say deficiency which would be painfully illustrate by a serious crisis be there equally in ordinary humdrum time of peace the cripple and idiotic life which would bring disaster _ then _ be undermine we very existence _ now _ be it not time that a sensible nation should look to it that every one of its member when adult should at least be healthy well-fed and well-grown and that each should not only be decently develop in himself or herself but should be capable of bear a useful part of some kind in the life of the nation be it not time that the nation should place _ first of all _ on its program the creation of capable and healthy citizen can a nation be really effective really strong really secure without this i do not seem to doubt a large _ willingness _ among we people to-day for mutual service and helpfulness -- i believe a vast number of we young woman of the well-to-do type be at this moment deeply regret they inability to do anything except knit superfluous muffler -- but be there ever in the history of the world such huge such wide-flooding _ incompetence _ the willingness of the well-to-do class may be judge from they readiness to come forward with subscription they incompetence from the fact that they have _ nothing else to offer _ : that be that all they can offer be to set _ some one else _ -lrb- by means of they money -rrb- to do useful work in they place they can not themselves nurse wound soldier or make boot for they or build hut or weave blanket they can not help in housing or building scheme or in scheme for the reclaim and cultivation of waste land they can not grow corn or bake bread or cook simple meal for the assistance of the indigent or the aged or the feeble because they understand none of these thing but they can _ pay some one else _ to do they -- that be they can divert some of the money which they have already take from the worker to set the latter toiling again but what use would that be on the day when we monetary system break down -- as it nearly do at the commencement of this war what use would it be on some critical day when a hostile invasion call every competent man and woman to do the work of defense absolutely necessary at the moment what use would it be in the hour when complete commercial dislocation cause downright famine who would look at offer of money then could the nation carry this vast mass of incompetent and idler on its back then and can it reasonably be expect to do so now a terrible and serious crisis as i have already say await we -- even when the war be over -- a crisis probably worse than that which we be pass through now we have to remember the debt that be be pile up if the nation be stagger along now under the enormous load of idler and parasite live on interest how will it be then unless we can reorganize we western society on a real foundation of actual life of practical capacity of honest and square living and of mutual help instead of mutual robbery they will infallibly collapse or pass into strange and alien hand now be the critical moment when with the enormous power of production which we wield it may be possible to make a new start and base the social life of the future on a generous recognition of the fellowship of all how many time have the civilization of the past ignore this salvation go down into the gulf can we find a better hope for we civilization to-day it be clear i think that any nation that want to stand the shock of event in the future and to hold its own in the vast flux of racial and political change which be come on the world will have to find its life not on theory and view or on the shift sand of literature and fashion but on the solid rock of the real _ material _ capability of its citizen and on they willingness they readiness to help each other -- they ingrained instinct of mutual service a conscript army force upon we by a government and become inevitably a tool for the use of a govern class we do not want and we will not have but a nation of capable man and woman who know what life be and be prepare to meet it at all point -- who will in many case make a free gift of they capital and land for such purpose as i have just outline -- we _ must _ have personally i would not even here -- though the need be a cry one -- advocate downright compulsion but i would make these thing a part of the recognize system of education with appropriate regulation and the strongest recommendation and inducement to every individual to fall in and co-operate with they thus in time a urgent public opinion might be form which would brand as disgraceful the conduct of any person who refuse to qualify himself for useful service or who when qualify deliberately refuse to respond to the call for such service if need under such condition the question of military defense would solve itself thousand and thousand of man would of they own free choice at a early age and during a certain period qualify themselves in military matter other thousand man and woman would qualify in nursing or ambulance work other million again would be prepare to aid in transport work or in the production of food clothing shelter and the thousand and one necessaries of life no one would be call upon to do work which he have not choose no one would be force to take up a activity which be hateful to he yet all would feel that what they could do and do do would be helpful to the other rank and range and would be _ solidaire _ with the rest of the nation such a nation would be sane and prosperous in time of peace and absolutely safe and impregnable in the hour of danger x how shall the plague be stay _ christma _ 1914 people ask what new arrangement of diplomacy or revival of christianity -- what alliance _ entente _ league of peace hague tribunal regulation of armament week of prayer or ton of christmas pudding send into the enemy ' camp -- will finally scotch this pestilence of war and there be no answer because the answer be too close at hand for we to see it nothing but the general abandonment of the system of live on the labor of other will avail _ there be no other way _ this whether as between individual or as between nation be -- and have be since the beginning of the world -- the root-cause of war early and primitive war be for this -- to raid crop and cattle to carry off slave on whose toil the conqueror could subsist and the latest war be the same to acquire rubber concession gold-mine diamond-mine where color labor may be exploit to its bitterest extreme to secure colony and outlying land where giant capitalist enterprise -lrb- with either white or color labor -rrb- may make huge dividend out of the raising of mineral and other industrial product to crush any other power which stand in the way of these greedy and inhuman ambition -- such be the object of war to-day and we do not see the cause of the sore because it be so near to we because it be in we blood the whole private life of the commercial and capitalist class -lrb- who stand as the representative of the nation to-day -rrb- be found on the same principle as individual we one object be to find some worker or group of worker whose labor value we can appropriate look at the endless column of stock and share quotation in the daily papers and consider the army of those who scan these list over they breakfast-table with the one view of find some-where a industrial concern whose slave-driven toiler will yield the shareholder 5 6 7 8 10 12 per cent on he capital undisguised and shameless parasitism be the order or disorder of we day the rapacity of beast of prey be in we social life but thinly veil -- thinly veil indeed by a wash of christian sentiment and by a network of philanthropic institution for the suppose benefit of the very victim whom we have rob be it any wonder that this principle of internecine warfare and rapacity which rule in we midst this vulgar greed which load people 's body with jewel and fur and they table with costly food regardless of those from whom these comfort be snatch should eventuate ultimately in rapacity and violence on the vast stage of the drama of nation and in red letter of war and conflict write across the continent it be no good with a pious snuffle to say we be out to put down warfare and militarism and all the time to encourage in we own life and in we church and empire league and other institution the most sordid and selfish commercialism -- which itself be in essence a warfare only a warfare of a far meaner and more cowardly kind than that which be signalize by the shock of troops or the rage of rifle and cannon no there be no other way and only by the general abandonment of we present commercial and capitalist system will the plague of war be stay -lrb- 23 -rrb- footnote : -lrb- 23 -rrb- when these hundred and hundred of thousand of man return home after the war be over do we expect they to go meekly back to the idiotic slavery of dingy office and dirty workshop if we do i trust that we shall be disappoint these man who have fight so nobly for they land and who have taste even under the most try condition something of the largeness and gladness of a free open-air life will i hope refuse to knuckle down again to the old commercialism now at last arise the opportunity for we outworn civilization to make a fresh start now come the chance to establish great self-supporting colony in we own countryside and co-operative concern where real goods may be manufacture and agriculture carry on in free and glad and healthy industry xi commercial prosperity the prosperity of a class the economics of the statement that commercial prosperity mean little more than the prosperity of a _ class _ -lrb- 24 -rrb- may be roughly indicate by the follow consideration : international trade mean division of labor among the nation there be certainly a gain in such division a margin of advantage in production and that gain that margin be secure by the trading class that be all let we take a example and to simplify the problem let we leave out of account those exotic product -- like tea or rubber or raw cotton -- which _ can _ only be produce in one of the exchange country let we take the case of germany and england both produce cutlery and both produce cloth there be no reason why each country should not produce _ both _ article exclusively for its own use and as a matter of fact for a long time they do so but presently it be find that the cost of production of certain kind of cutlery be less in germany and the cost of production of certain kind of cloth less in england merchant and dealer come in and effect the exchange and so a intertrade have spring up the effect of this on the worker in england be simply to transfer a certain amount of employment from the cutlery trade to the cloth trade and on the worker in germany to transfer a equal amount from the cloth trade to the cutlery trade this may mean dislocation of industry but the actual number of person employ or of wages receive in both country may in such a case remain just the same as before there be nothing in the mere fact of exchange to alter those figure there be however a gain there be a marginal advantage in the exchange and that be collar by the merchant and dealer it be in fact _ in order to secure this margin _ that the merchant class arise this be of course a very simple and elementary statement of the problem and the exception to it or modification of it may be supply by the reader but in the main it embody the very obvious truth that trade be create for the advantage of the trader -lrb- who often also in modern time be the manufacturer himself -rrb- what advantage may here and there leak through to the public or to the employee be small and so to speak accidental the mere fact of exchange in itself form no index of general prosperity yet it be often assume that it do if for instance it should happen that the whole production of cutlery as between germany and england be secure by germany and the whole production of cloth be secure by england so that the _ whole _ of these product on each side have to be exchange then doubtless there would be great jubilation -- talk of the immense growth of oversea trade in both country the wonderful increase of export and import the great prosperity and so forth but really and obviously it would only mean the jubilation and the prosperity of the merchant the broker the railway and shipping company of both land there would be a increase in _ they _ riches -lrb- and a increase in the number of they employee -rrb- it would mean more merchant palace in park lane bigger dividend on the share of transport company but after that the general position of the manual worker in both trade the number employ and they rate of wages would be much as before price also as regard the general public would be but little altered it be only because this great trading manufacturing and commercial class have amass such enormous wealth and influence and be able to command the press and social position and vote and representation on public body and in both house of parliament that it succeed in impress the nation generally with the idea that _ its _ welfare be the welfare of the whole people and its prosperity the advantage of every citizen and it be in this very fact that its great moral and social danger to the community lie it must not be think -lrb- but i believe i have say this before -rrb- that in make out that the commercial class be largely to blame for modern war i mean to say that the present war and many previous one have be _ directly _ instigate by commercial folk it be rather that the atmosphere of commercial competition and rivalry automatically lead up to military rivalry and collision which often at the last moment -lrb- though not always -rrb- turn out contrary to the wish of the commercial people themselves also i would repeat that it be not _ commerce _ but the _ class _ interest that be to blame commerce and exchange as we know in a thousand way have the effect of draw people together give they common interest acquaintance and understanding of each other and so make for peace the great jubilation during the latter half of the nineteenth century -- from 1851 onward -- over world-wide trade and industrial exhibition as the herald of the world 's peace and amity -- a jubilation voice in tennyson 's earlier _ locksley hall _ -- be to a certain extent justified there be no doubt that the nation have be draw together by intertrade and learn to know each other bond commercial and personal have grow up between they and be grow up which must inevitably make war more difficult in the future and less desirable and if it have be possible to carry on this intertrade in a spirit of real friendliness and without grasp or greed the result to-day would be incalculably great but unfortunately this latter element come in to a extent quite unforeseen and blighted the prophetic hope the second _ locksley hall _ be a wail of disillusionment the growth of large mercantile class intoxicate with wealth and pursue they own interest _ apart from and indeed largely in opposition to _ those of the mass-people derail the forward movement and lead in some of the way which i have indicate above to more of conflict between the nation and less of peace doubtless the growth of these mercantile class have to a certain extent be inevitable and we must do they the justice to acknowledge that they enterprise and ingenuity -lrb- even set in action for they own private advantage -rrb- have be of considerable benefit to the world and that they growth may represent a necessary stage in affair still we can not help look forward to a time when this stage have be complete and commerce between nation and nation have cease to be handle for mere private profit and advantage the parasitical power in we midst which prey upon the commonweal will disappear the mercantile class will become organic with the community and one great and sinister source of war will also cease footnote : -lrb- 24 -rrb- see p 50 above xii colony and seaport there be another point of economics on which there seem to be some confusion of mind if mere extension of trade be the thing seek for it really do not matter much in these day of swift and international transport whether the outlying land with which the trader deal or the port _ through _ which he deal be the property of he own nation or of some other nation the trade go on all the same england certainly have colony all over the world but with she free trade and open port it often happen that one of she colony take more german or french goods of a certain class than english goods of the same class or that it export more to germany and france than it do to england the bulk for instance of the produce of we west african colony go in normal time to germany german or french trade do not suffer in deal with english colony though english trade may sometimes suffer in deal with french german or other foreign colony on account of the preferential duty they put on in favor of they own goods except for these tariff-wall and bounty system -lrb- which after all on account of they disturbing and crippling effect seem to be gradually go out of fashion -rrb- trade flow over the world regardless of national barrier and will continue so to flow it be all a question of relative efficiency and price german goods owe to they cheapness and they accuracy of construction have of late year be penetrate everywhere and to the german trader as a pure matter of trade it make no difference whether he sell to a foreign nation or a german colony it be the same with seaport holland be delighted to provide passage for germany 's export and import and probably do so at a minimum cost the berlin manufacturer or merchant would be no better off as far as trade condition be concern if germany instead of holland hold the mouth of the rhine the same with a harbor like salonika germany or austrium may covet dreadfully its possession and for strategic or political reason they may be right but for pure trade purpose salonika in the hand of the greek would probably -lrb- except for certain initial expense in the enlargement of dock accommodation -rrb- serve they as well as in they own hand of course there _ be _ other reason which make nation desire colony and port such thing may be useful for offensive or defensive purpose against other nation they feed a jealous sense of importance and imperialism they provide outlet for population and access to land where the institution and custom of the homeland prevail they supply financier with a field for the investment of capital under the protection of they own government they favor the development of a national _ carry _ trade and above all they supply plentiful official and other post and situation for the young man of the middle and commercial class but for the mere extension and development of the nation 's general trade and commerce it be doubtful whether they have anything like the importance commonly credit to they xiii war and the sex impulse _ January _ 1915 it seem that war like all greatest thing -- like passion politics religion and so forth -- be impossible to reckon up it belong to another plane of existence than we ordinary workaday life and break into the latter as violently and unreasonably as a volcano into the cool pasture where cow and sheep be grazing no argument protest proof or explanation be of any avail and those that be advance be confuse contradictory and unconvincing just as people quarrel most violently over politics and religion because in fact those be the two subject which no one really understand so they quarrel in warfare not really know _ why _ but impel by deep inscrutable force spectator even and neutral for the same reason take side and range themselves bitterly if only in argument against each other but logic and moral be of no use on these occasion they be too thin they be only thread in a vast fabric you extract a single thread from the weave of a carpet and note its color and its concatenation but that give you no faintest idea of the pattern of the carpet and then you extract another and another but you be no nearer the design logic and moral be similar thread in the great web of life you may follow they in various direction but without effective result life be so much greater than either and war be a volcanic manifestation of life which give they little or no heed there be a madness of nation as well as of individual people every one who have pay attention to the fluctuation of popular sentiment know how strange how unaccountable these be they seem to suggest the come to the surface from time to time of hidden wave -- groundswell of some deep ocean the temper the temperament the character the policy of a whole nation will change and it be difficult to see why sometimes a passion a fury a veritable mania quite unlike its ordinary self will seize it there be a madness of people which cause they for a while to hate each other with bitter hatred to fight furiously and wound and injure each other and then lo a little while more and they be shake hand and embrace and swearing eternal friendship what do it all mean it be all as mad and unreasonable as love be -- and that be say a good deal in love too people desire to _ hurt _ each other they do not hesitate to wind one another -- wound heart wound body even and hate themselves even while they act so what do it all mean be they try the one to reach the other _ at all cost _ -- if not by embrace at least by injury -- each longing to make he or she personality feel to _ impress _ himself or herself upon the other in such wise as never again to be forget sometimes a man will stab the girl he love if he can not get at she any other way sex itself be a positive battle lust connect itself only too frequently with violence and the spilling of blood be it possible that something the same happen with whole nation and people -- a actual lust and passion of conflict a mad intercourse and ravishment a kind of generation in each other and exchange of life-essence leave the two people thereafter never more the same but each strangely fertilize towards the future be it this that explain the extraordinary ecstasy which man experience on the battlefield even amid all the horror -- a ecstasy so great that it call they again and again to return have you notice say one of we war correspondent -lrb- 25 -rrb- how many of we colonel fall do you know why it be for five minute of _ life _ it be for the joy of ride when the charge sound at the crest of a wave of man be it this that explain the curious fact that war -- notwithstanding all they bitterness and brutishness -- do not infrequently lead to strange amalgamation and generation the spreading of the seed of greek culture over the then known world by alexander 's conquest or the fertilize of europe with the germ of republican and revolutionary idea by the army of napoleon or the immense reaction on the mediaeval christian nation cause by the crusade be commonplace of history and who -- to come to quite modern time -- could have foresee that the boer war would end in the present positive alliance between the dutch and english in south africa or that the russo-japanese conflict would so profoundly modify the idea and outlook of the two people concern in make these remark i do not for a moment say that the gain result from war be worth the suffering cause by it or that the gain be _ not _ worth the suffer the whole subject be too vast and obscure for one to venture to dogmatize on it i only say that if we be to find any order and law -lrb- as we must inevitably _ try _ to do -rrb- in these convulsion of people these tempest of human history it be probably in the direction that i have indicate of course we need not leave out of sight the ordinary theory and explanation that war be simply a part of the general struggle for existence -- culminate explosion of hatred and mutual destruction between people who be compete with each other for the means of subsistence that there be something in this view one can hardly deny and it be one which i have already touch upon still i can not help think that there be something even deeper -- something that connect war with the amatory instinct and that this probably be to be find in the direction of a physiological impact and fusion between the two -lrb- or more -rrb- people concern which fertilize and regenerate they and be perhaps as necessary in the life of nation as the fusion of cell be in the life of protozoan or the phenomenon of sex in the evolution of man and while the nation fight the little mortal who represent they have only the faintest idea of what be really go on of what the warfare mean they _ feel _ the sweep of immense passion ecstasy and horror convulse and dislocate they mind but they do not can not understand and the dear creature in the trench and the firing-line give they life -- equally beautiful equally justified on both side : fascinate rapt beyond and beside themselves as foe hate each other with a deadly hatred seize with hideous furious nerve-racking passion perform heroic magnificent deed suffer untold indescribable wound and pain and lie finally side by side -lrb- as not unfrequently happen -rrb- on the desert battlefield reconcile and redeem and clasp hand of amity even in death footnote : -lrb- 25 -rrb- hm tomlinson in the _ daily news _ xiv the over-population scare some cheerful and rather innocent people insist that because of the over-population difficulty war must go on for ever the population of the world they say -- or at any rate of the civilized country -- be constantly increase and if war do not from time to time reduce the number there would soon be a deadlock they seem to think that the only way to solve the problem be for the man to murder each other this say nothing about the woman who after all be the chief instrument of multiplication it may also be point out that even the barbaric method of slaughter be not practicable although war of extermination may have now and then occur in the past among tribe and small people such war be not consider decent nowadays and the number kill in modern campaign -- horribly scientific and efficient as the method be -- be such a small fraction of the population concern as to have no appreciable result the population of germany be about seventy million and i suppose the wildest anti-teuton could hardly hope that _ more _ than a million german will be actually kill in the present conflict -- less than 1-1\/2 per cent -- a fraction which would probably soon be compensate by the increase uxoriousness of the return troops no war be no solution for the over-population question if that question be a difficulty other means must be employ we ask therefore : -lrb- 1 -rrb- be it a serious difficulty -lrb- 2 -rrb- if so what be the remedy that over-population be in certain locality a serious difficulty few would deny china with she four hundred million be probably over-populated that be with she present resource in production the population press against the margin of subsistence and can only just maintain itself there be evidence to show that in the past the native of some of the pacific island isolate in the great ocean and unable to migrate to other land have suffer from the same trouble britain be often say to be over-populated but here quite other consideration come in though it might be pleasant for many reason to have more land at we immediate command we can not fairly say that we population press against the margin of subsistence for the simple reason that with we immense power of industrial production and the enormous wealth here yearly obtain the total if evenly distribute -lrb- anything like as well for instance as in china -rrb- would yield to every man woman and child in the unite kingdom a ample affluence -lrb- 26 -rrb- the _ appearance _ here of over-population arise from the fact that while the wage-earner actually produce this mass of wealth two-third of it be take by the employer and employ class great portion therefore of the actual producer or produce class _ be _ on the margin of subsistence while the rest of the wealth of the country be absorb by those trading and dividend-consuming class of whom i have speak more than once in previous page there be over-population certainly but it be a over-population -lrb- as any one may see who walk through the west end of london or the corresponding quarter of any of we large town -rrb- of idler and futile people who be a burden to the nation with we extraordinary industrial system -- or want of system -- it commonly happen that the abundance of ill-paid or unemployed worker at one end of the social scale by reduce the rate of wages and so increase the rate of dividend actually create a greater abundance of unemployed rich at the other end but neither excess point in itself to over-population -- only to a diseased state of distribution what we really ought to aim at create be a nation in which every one be capable of do useful or beautiful work of some kind or other and be gladly occupy in do it such a nation would be truly healthy it would be powerful and productive beyond all we present dream but the western nation of to-day with they huge burden of unskilled ill-grown poor and they huge burden of incompetent feeble rich -- it be a wonder that they survive they would not survive a decade or two if the chinese or the japanese in they number be to come into personal and direct competition with they if britain be not really at present over-populated the same be probably even more true of germany for germany with a larger and more fertile area in proportion to she population be safer than we be in the matter of self-support but again in germany the outcry of over-population have arise and have arise from the same cause as here -- namely the rise of the commercial system the division of the nation into extreme of poverty and riches and the consequent _ appearance _ of excess population in both direction and this diseased state of the nation have lead to a fever of expansion and have be -lrb- as already say -rrb- one of the chief cause of the present war as long as the modern nation be such fool as to conduct they industrial affair in the exist way they will not only be full of strife disease and discord in themselves but they will inevitably quarrel with they neighbor all this however do not prove that a genuine over-population difficulty may not occur even now in locality and possibly in some far future time over the whole earth and it may be just as well to consider these possibility dismiss war and disease as solution -- as belong to barbarous and ignorant age of human evolution -- there remain perhaps three rational method of deal with the question : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the organization and improvement of industrial production on exist land so far as to allow the support of a larger population -lrb- 2 -rrb- the transport of excess population to new and undeveloped land -lrb- colonization -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- the limitation of family the first method hardly need discussion here its importance be too obvious it need however more public discussion in england than it have hitherto receive the second method -- operate at present only in a very casual and unsystematic way -- ought one would say to be very systematically consider and deal with by the modern state for a nation to plant out large body of colonist on comparatively unoccupied land as in africa or australium or canada in a deliberate and organized fashion with every facility towards co-operation and success and yet on the principle of leave each colonial unit plenty of freedom and autonomy would not be a very difficult task nor a very expensive one consider the end in view and in such a case there would really be no adequate reason for jealousy between state have colony in the neighborhood of each other if germany -lrb- or any other country -rrb- wish to have a colony in east africa or west africa it be really ridiculous to go to war about such a matter any peaceful arrangement would be less expensive and as a matter of fact a flourishing german -lrb- or other -rrb- colony in the neighborhood of a british settlement would help to bring prosperity to the latter the two colony would benefit each other it be only _ unreasoning jealousy _ which prevent people understand this finally there be the third method of the intentional limitation of family surely the time have come when blind and unlimited propagation among civilized and self-respecting people must come to a end the old text bless be he that have he quiver full of they have cease to have any use or application eugenic and healthy condition of child-rearing and nurture demand small family the well-to-do and educate do already limit they family and for the poorer class to breed and propagate indefinitely be only to play into the hand of the dividend-hunting rich by increase the supply of cheap labor while at the same time the general standard of the population become more and more degrade it be indeed a curious question why in the press and among the official class every effort to spread abroad the knowledge of how in a healthy humane and eugenic way to limit the size of the family be discountenance sometimes one think that this be do partly in order to encourage that say pullulation of worker which be so favourable to the keep down of wages but of course ancient reason of ignorance and religious bias weigh also in the united state the persecution of comstockery be worse than here the aborigine of australium be so ignorant that they do not even know that conception arise from the meeting of the male and female element they think that certain bush and tree be haunt by the spirit of baby which leap unawares into the body of pass woman it can be imagine what evil and delusion spring from such a theory we do not want to return to such a period and yet it would seem that many folk do not want to go forward from we present condition with all _ its _ evil and delusion to something better and more intelligent if the nation have not the sense to be able -lrb- if they wish -rrb- to limit they family -- short of resort to such method as war cannibalism the spread of disease the exposure of infant and the like -- one can only conclude that they must go on fighting and prey upon each other -lrb- industrially and militarily -rrb- till they gain the sense mere unbridled and irrational lust may have lead to war of extermination in the past love and the sacrament of a true and intimate union may come some day with the era of peace footnote : -lrb- 26 -rrb- militate also against the idea of over-population be the fact that so much of we agricultural land be obviously uncared for and neglect xv the friendly and the fighting instinct _ January _ 1915 fighting be certainly a deeply ingrained instinct in the human race -- the masculine portion in the long history of human development it have undoubtedly play a important part it have even -lrb- such be the cussedness and contrariety of nature -rrb- help greatly in the evolution of love and social solidarity there be no greater bond in early stage between the member of a group or tribe than the consciousness that they have a common enemy -lrb- 27 -rrb- it be also obviously still a great _ pleasure _ to a very large proportion of we male population -- as indeed the fact of its be the fulfilment of a deep instinct would lead we to expect it do not follow however from these remark that we expect war in its crudest form to continue for ever there will come a term to this phase of evolution probably the impact and collision between nation -- if require for they impregnation and fecundity -- will come about in some other way if fighting be a ingrained instinct the sociable or friendly instinct be equally ingrain we may indeed suppose it root deeper in the midst of warfare maddest foe will turn and embrace each other in the tale of _ cuchulain of muirthemne _ -lrb- 28 -rrb-

act of grace and tenderness between enemy as well as the quaintest quip and joke and demonstration of sociability between man in oppose trench who ought to have be slaying each other in the russo-japanese war during the winter when military movement be not easy and the enemy line in some case be very near each other the man russian and japanese play game together as a convenient and pleasant way of pass the time and not unfrequently take to snowball each other a friend of mine who be in that war tell I the follow story the japanese troops be attack one of the fort near port arthur with they usual desperate valor they cut _ zig-zag _ trench up the hillside and finally storm and take a russian trench close under the gun of the fort the russian flee leave they dead and wound behind after the _ mêlée _ when night fall five japanese find themselves in that particular trench with seven russian -- all pretty badly wound -- with many other of course dead the rifleman in the fort be in such a nervous state that at the slightest movement in the trench they fire regardless of whom they might hit the whole party remain quiet during the night and most of the next day they be suffer from wound and without food or water but they dare not move they manage however to converse with each other a little -- especially through the japanese lieutenant who know a little russian on the second night the fever for water become severe one of the less wounded russian volunteer to go and fetch some he raise himself from the ground stand up in the darkness but be discern from the fort and shoot a second russian do the same and be shoot a japanese do likewise then the rest lay quiet again finally the darkness have increase and the thirst and the wound be intolerable the japanese lieutenant who have be wound in the leg and could not move about say that if one of the remain russian would take he on he back he would guide the whole party into a place of safety in the japanese line so they do the russian soldier crawl on he belly with the japanese officer lie on he back and the other follow keep close to the ground they reach the japanese quarter and be immediately look after and care for a few day afterwards the five russian come on board the transport on which my friend be engineer they be be take as prisoner to japan but the japanese crew could not do enough for they in the way of tea and cigarette and dress they wound and they make quite a jolly party all together on deck the japanese officer be also on board and he tell my friend the story gallantry towards the enemy have figure largely in the history of war -- sometimes as a individual impulse sometimes as a recognize instruction european record afford we plenty of example the chinese always great stickler for politeness use to insist in early time that a warrior should not take advantage of he enemy when the latter have empty he quiver but wait for he to pick up he arrow before go on with the fight and in one tale of old japan when one daimio be besiege another the besiege party have run short of ammunition request a truce in order to fetch some more -- which the besieger courteously grant the british officer who the other day pick up a wounded german soldier and carry he across into the german line act in quite the same spirit he see that the man have be leave accidentally when the german be clear away they wound and quite simply he walk forward with the object of restore he but it cost he he life for the german not at first perceive he intention fire and hit he in two or three place nevertheless he lift the man and succeed in bear he to the german trench the firing of course cease and the german colonel salute and thank the officer and pin a ribbon to he coat he return to the british line but die shortly after of the wound receive il sont superbe ce brave say a french soldier in hospital to mr haden guest indicate the german wound also there and a

word to-day rise from the lip of the nation -- never again never before certainly have such enormous mass of human being be lock in deadly grip with each other over the earth and never before equally certainly have they warfare be so horrible in its deliberate preparation so hideous so ghastly in its after-effect as to-day the nation stand round paralyse with disgust and despair almost unable to articulate and when they do find voice it be with the word above write how be we to give effect to the cry must we not call upon the worker of all country -- those who be the least responsible for the inception of war and yet who suffer most by they who bear the brunt of the wound the slaughter the disease and the misery which be a necessary part of they -- to rise up and forbid they for ever from the earth let we do so for though few may follow and join with we to-day yet to-morrow and every day in the future and every year as the mass-people come into they own and to the knowledge of what they be and what they desire to be those number will increase till the cry itself be no longer a mere cry but a accomplished fact it be a hopeful sign that not only among bewildered onlooker and outsider but among the soldier themselves -lrb- of the more civilized country -rrb- this cry be be take up who indeed should know better than they what they be talk about the same word be on the lip at this moment of thousand and thousand of french and english and german soldier -lrb- 30 -rrb- and in no faint-hearted or evasive sense but with the conviction and indignation of experience we may hope they will not be forget this time when the war be over the truth be that not only be this particular war bind to come but -lrb- among the civilized people -rrb- the refusal of war be also bind to come two great development be lead to this result on the one hand the soldier themselves the fighter be as a class become infinitely more sensitive more intelligent more capable of humane feeling less stupidly patriotic and prejudice against they enemy than be the soldier of a century ago -- say of the time of wellington on the other hand the horror the hideousness the folly and the waste of war be infinitely greater it be inevitable that these two contradictory movement mount up on opposite side must at last clash the rise conscience of humanity must in the end say to the war-fiend get thee behind I satan never before have there pass over the field of europe army so intelligent so trained so observant so sensitive as those to-day of belgium france england and germany some day or other they will return to they home but when they do it will be with a tale that will give to the western world a understanding of what war mean such as it never have before all the same if the word _ be _ to be never again it must come through the mass themselves -lrb- from whom the fighter be mainly draw -rrb- it must be through they that this consummation must be realize it must be through the banding together and determine and combine effort of the union local national and international and through the weight of the worker ' influence in all they association and in all country to put much reliance in this matter upon the class be rash for though just now the latter be sentimentalize freely over the subject -- have get into nearer touch with it than ever before -- yet when all be settle down and the day arrive once more that _ they _ interest point to war it be only too likely that they -lrb- or the majority of they -rrb- will not hesitate to sacrifice the mass -- unless indeed the power to do so have already depart from they and it be no good for _ we _ to sentimentalize on the subject we must not blink fact and the fact be that it be a long way to _ never again _ the _ cause _ of war must be destroy first and as i have more than once try to make clear the cause ramify through we midst they be like the root pervade the body politic of some fall disease whose outbreak on the surface shock and affright we to dislodge and extirpate these root be a long business but there be this consolation about it -- that it be a business which we can all of we begin at once in we own life probably war will still for many a century continue though less frequent we hope and if the people themselves _ want _ to fight and must fight who be to say they nay in such case we need not be overmuch troubled there be many thing worse than fight and there be many wound and injury which people inflict on each other worse than bodily wound and injury -- only they be not so plain to see but i certainly would say -- as indeed the peasant say in every land -- let those who begin the quarrel do the fighting and let those who have to do the fighting and bear the brunt of it -lrb- include the woman -rrb- decide whether there _ shall _ be fight or not to leave the dread arbitrament of war in the hand of private group and clique who for they own end and interest be willing to see the widespread slaughter of they fellow-countryman and the ruin of innumerable home be hateful beyond word footnote : -lrb- 30 -rrb- see a war-note for democrat by hm tomlinson _ -lrb- english review _ December 1914 -rrb- this war be bind to come and we have get to finish it proper no more of this bloody rot for the kid a ' chance it xvii the tree of life _ February _ 1915 finally and look back on all we have say and especially on the christmas scene and celebration between the trench in this war and the many similar fraternization of the rank and file of oppose army in former war one realize the monstrosity and absurdity of the present conflict -- its anachronism and out-of-dateness in the exist age of human thought and feel the whole european situation resemble a game of marble play by schoolboy it be not much more dignified than that each boy try on the quiet to appropriate some of the marble out of another boy 's bag from time to time in consequence furious scrimmage arise -- generally between two boy -- the other look ' on and laugh know well that they themselves be guilty of the same trick presently in the fortune of the game one boy -- a little more blundering or a little less disguised than the other -- lay himself open to the accusation of the whole crew they all fall upon he and give he a good drubbing and even some of they say they be punish he _ for he good _ when shall we make a end once for all of this murderous nonsense however we tommy atkins have be work up to fight point by fear for the safety of old england or by indignation at atrocity actually observe or distantly report however the german soldier have be affect by similar fear and indignation or the french the same however the political coil have be engineer -lrb- as engineer in such case it always be -rrb- and whatever inducement of pay or patriotism have be put in operation and sentiment circulate by the press -- one thing remain perfectly certain : that leave to themselves these man would never have quarrel never have attack each other one thing be perfectly certain : that such a war as the present be the result of the activity of govern clique and class in the various nation act through what be call diplomatic channel for the most part in secret and unbeknown to they respective mass-people and for motive best know to themselves one would not venture to say that _ all _ war be so engineer for there certainly be occasionally war which be the spontaneous expression of two nation ' natural hostility and hatred but these be rare very rare and the war in which we be concern at present be certainly not one of they also one would not venture to say that though in the present affair the actuate motive have be of class origin and have be work through secret channel the motive so put in action have all be base and mean that would be go too far some of the motive may have be high-minded and generous some may have be mean and other may have be mean and yet _ unconsciously _ so but certainly when one look at the condition of public and political life and the arrangement and concatenation by which influence there be exert and secure and see -lrb- as one must -rrb- the pretty bad corruption which pervade the various party in all the modern state -- the commercial bribery the lie of the press the pose and prevarication of diplomat and minister -- one can not but realize the great probability that the private advantage of individual or class have be -lrb- in the present case -rrb- a prevail instigation the fact that in britain two influential and honorable cabinet minister resign at once on the declaration of war -lrb- a fact upon which the press have be curiously silent -rrb- can not but give one to think one can not but realize that the fight man in all these nation be the pawn and counter of a game which be be play for the benefit -- or suppose benefit -- of certain class that public opinion be a huge millstream which have to be engineer that the press be a channel for its direction and money the secret power which command the situation the fact be sad but it must be face and the face of it lead inevitably to the question how then can healing ever come if -lrb- it will be say -rrb- the origin of war be in the diseased condition of the nation what prospect be there of they ever cease and one see at once that the prospect be not immediate one see at once that peace society and nobel prize and hague tribunal and reform of the diplomatic service and democratic control of foreign secretary and quaker and tolstoyan preachment -- though all these thing may be good in they way -- will never bring we swiftly to the realization of peace the root of the tree of life lie deeper we have see it a dozen time in the foregoing page only when the nation cease to be diseased in themselves will they cease fight with each other and the disease of the modern nation be the disease of disunity -- not as i have already say the mere existence of variety of occupation and habit for that be perfectly natural and healthy but the disease by which one class prey upon another and upon the nation -- the disease of parasitism and selfish domination the health of a people consist in that people 's real _ unity _ the organic life by which each section contribute freely and generously to the welfare of the whole identify itself with that welfare and hold it a dishonor to snatch for itself the life which should belong to all a nation which realize _ that _ kind of life would be powerful and healthy beyond word it would not only be splendidly glad and prosperous and unassailable in itself but it would inevitably infect all other nation with whom it have dealings with the same principle have the tree of life well root within its own garden its leaf and fruit and all its act and expression would be for the healing of the people around but a nation divide against itself by parasitic and self-exalting clique and section could never stand it could never be healthy no armament nor ingenuity of science and organization could save it and even though the form of its institution be democratic if the reality of democracy be not there its peace crusade and prize and sentimental conference and christianity would be of little avail at this juncture then all over europe when the class be fail we and by they underhand machination continually embroil one nation with another it be above all necessary that the mass-people should move and insist upon the representation of they great unitary and communal life and interest it be high time that they should open they eye and see with clear vision what be go on over they head and more than high time that they should refuse to take part in the quarrel of those who -lrb- professionally -rrb- live upon they labor it be indeed astonishing that the awakening have be so long in come but surely it can not be greatly delay now underneath all the ambition of certain individual and group underneath all the greed and chicanery of other underneath the widespread ignorance mother of prejudice which sunder folk of different race or colour-deep down the human heart beat practically the same in all land draw we little mortal together strangely enough -- and yet not strangely -- it beat strongest and clearest often in the simplest the least sophisticated those who live nearest the truth of they own heart be nearest to the heart of other those who have know the reality of the world and what life be close to the earth -- they be the same in all land -- they have at least the key to the understanding of each other the old need of life its destiny and fatality its sorrow and joy its exaltation and depression -- these be the same everywhere and to the manual worker -- the peasant the labourer the sailor the mechanic -- the world-old trade pursuit craft and calling with which they be so familiar supply a kind of freemasonry which ensure they even among stranger a kindly welcome and a easy admittance if you want to travel in foreign land you will find that to be skilled in one or two manual trade be better than a high official passport among such people there be no natural hatred of each other despite all the foam and fury of the press over the present war i doubt whether there be any really violent feeling of the work mass on either side between england and germany there certainly be no great amount in england either among the country-folk or the town artisan and mechanic and if there be much in germany -lrb- which be quite doubtful -rrb- it be fairly obviously due to the _ animus _ which have be arouse and the _ virus _ which have be propagate by political and social schemer we have have enough of hatred and jealousy for a century now commercial rivalry and competition the perfectionment of the engine of war and the science of destruction have sufficiently occupy the nation -- with result only of disaster and distress and ruin to all concerned to-day surely another epoch open before we -- a epoch of intelligent helpfulness and fraternity a epoch even of the simplest common sense we have rejoice to tread and trample the other people underfoot to malign and traduce they to single out and magnify they defect to boast ourselves over they and act thus we have but make the more enemy now surely come a era of recognition and understanding and with it the glad assurance that we have friend in all the end of the earth we -- and i speak of the european nation generally -- have talk loudly of we own glory but have we welcome and acclaimed the glory and beauty of the other people and race around we -- among whom it be we privilege to dwell we have boast to love each we own country but have we care at all for the other country too verily i suspect that it be because we have _ not _ truly love we own country but have betray they for private profit that we have think fit to hate we neighbor and ill-use they for we profit too what a wonderful old globe this be with its jewelled constellation of humanity alfr russel wallace in he _ travel on the amazon _ -lrb- 1853 ch xvii -rrb- say : i do not

denizen of the amazonian forest like the forest itself be unique and not to be forget not long ago i be talk to a shrewd vigorous old english lady who have spend some forty year of she life among the kafir in south africa and know they intimately she say -lrb- not know anything about _ my _ feeling -rrb- : ah you british think a great deal about yourselve you think you be the finest race on earth

the old lady be right -lrb- and one have hear other say much the same -rrb- or whether she be carry away by she enthusiasm the fact remain that here be a people _ capable _ of exciting such enthusiasm and certainly capable of exciting much admiration among all who know they well read the account of the polynesian people at a early period -- before commerce and the missionary have come among they -- as give in the page of captain cook of herman melville or even as adumbrated in they past life in the writings of rl stevenson -- what a picture of health and gaiety and beauty surely never be there a more charming and happy folk -- even if long-pig do occasionally in they feast alternate with wild-pig and yet how strange that the white man with all he science and all he so-called christianity have only come among these three people mention -lrb- and how many more -rrb- to destroy and defile they -- to flog the mild and innocent native of the amazon to death for greed of he rubber to rob the kafir of he free wild land and blast he life with drink and slavery in the diamond mine to degrade and exterminate the pacific islander with all the vice and disease of civilization think of the

32 -rrb- and the verdict of all who know the people well -- in the interior of the country of course -- be the same think of the japanese with they slight and simple but exceedingly artistic and exceedingly heroic type of civilization or again of the east indian people so unfitted as a rule for make the best of this world so passive dreamy subtle unpractical and yet with they marvellous spiritual gift they intuition -lrb- also since the dawn of history -rrb- and conviction of another plane of be than that in which we mostly move and they occasional power of distinctly sense that plane and act on its indication think of they ancient religious philosophy -- they doctrine of world-unity -- absolutely foundational and inexpugnable the corner-stone of all metaphysics science and politics and of the latest most modern democracy and still realize and believe in in indium as nowhere else in the world think of the gentle buddhistic burmese the active social malay the hard-featured hard-lived thibetan and mongolian think of the arabian and moorish and berber race who once the master of the science and comfort of civilization of they own accord -lrb- but in accordance also with they religion -rrb- abandon the worship of all these idol and return to the biblical simplicity of four thousand year ago -- have realize that they already possess something better namely the glory of the sky and the earth the sun and the desert sand and the freedom of love and adventure how strange and yet how natural that sunder only by a narrow strip of sea they even now should look back upon all the laborious feverish and overcrowded wealth of europe and _ see the cost thereof _ should feel for it only contempt for that indeed be actually for the most part the case -- though not of course without exception among certain section of the population or again the million and million of great and little russian peasant big-framed big-hearted patient friendly with a great natural gift for association and co-operation peacefully mind and profoundly religious yet superstitious and capable of rise at any moment _ en masse _ to the call of a great crusade or holy war it might seem that they hold all western europe in the hollow of they hand indeed they constitute not only a hope and promise of deliverance to we modern world but also a considerable danger all depend on how we dispose ourselves towards they should the nation of western europe rouse they hatred by chicanery and mean treatment the result might be fatal if they flood once begin to move no battle array of armament would be of any use -- any more than a revolver against a rise tide -- the flood would flow round and over we but if on the other hand we could really reach the heart of this great people if we could treat they really generously and with understanding we should create a response there and a recognition which would remove all risk to ourselves and possibly help to free russium from the great burden of political servitude and ignorance which have so long oppressed she peasantry or think of the servian -- that hospitable people good lover and good hater with they ancient almost prehistoric system of family community survive down to modern day and blossom out in a perfect genius for co-operative agriculture and raffeisen bank or the finn the swede the norwegian and the dane -lrb- if i may class these together -rrb- what a clear clean-minded healthy people be these so direct in they touch on nature and the human instinct so democratic bold and progressive in

racial characteristic or the dutch so well-based and broad-seated both in body and mind with they ample bowels of compassion and they well-equipped brain so full of tenderness and of sturdy commonsense what a gift have be theirs to europe what a legacy of artistic treasure and of heroic record or the spanish with they beautiful and dignified woman or the french with they fine logical and artistic sense or the hungarian greek and italian have we nothing to do but to prepare engine of death and of slaughter against all these people be we main idea of relation to they one of domination and profit have we no use for they but to gain they riches and in exchange to lose we own soul or shall we like the prussian seek to impose we own standard of so-called culture on they and trim they

and sordid garment of mercenary gain and accept the other frankly as its brother and sister nation all of one family -- that nation will become the healer and redeemer of the world it be interesting to find that accord to the book of revelation the tree of which we have be speak grow with its root in the pure river of the water of life which proceed from the throne of god and the lamb what exactly the author of the book mean by this passage have be much debate it be clear that there be here a veil allusion to the zodiac -- that mysterious belt of constellation which run like a river round the whole starry heaven and rise in the constellation of the ram or he-lamb -- but to debate _ that _ question now would be unprofitable even be one fully competent to do so more to the point be it to see that this remarkable simile have a inner sense applicable to mankind and so far independent of any allusion to the zodiac this tree that be for the healing of the nation have its root in the pure water of life which flow from the great throne we have see in a early chapter where the root of strife between the nation be to be seek for and whence they draw they nourishment they be to be find in the very muddy water of domination and selfishness and greed but the root of the tree of healing be in the pure water of life right down below all the folly and meanness which cloud man 's

in the eye of the child -- aye and even of the animal unclean no doubt will the surface be -- muddy with meanness and self-motive and among those class and current of people who chiefly delight to dwell in the midst of such thing -lrb- who dwell in the float mire of malice and envy and self-assertion and avarice and conceit and deceit and domination and other such refuse -rrb- the water will be

the largest and most important mass of human kind -- be those whose influence and tendency be toward peace and amity it be only the scurry avaricious fever-stricken and for all they wealth poverty-stricken class and clique of the civilization-period who be the source of discord and strife -- and they only for a time in the end it will be find that by every river and stream and tiny
