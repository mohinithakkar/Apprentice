banner of science and to lead she votary from the looser analogy which dress out the imagery of poetry to the stricter one which form the ratiocination of philosophy while they particular design be to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of botany by introduce they to the vestibule of that delightful science and recommend to they attention the immortal work of the swedish naturalist linneus in the first poem or economy of vegetation the physiology of plant be deliver and the operation of the element as far as they may be suppose to affect the growth of vegetable but the publication of this part be defer to another year for the purpose of repeat some experiment on vegetation mention in the note in the second poem or love of the plant which be here present to the reader the sexual system of linneus be explain with the remarkable property of many particular plant the author have withhold this work -lrb- except a few page -rrb- many year from the press accord to the rule of horace hope to have render it more worthy the acceptance of the public -- but find at length that he be less able from disuse to correct the poetry and from want of leizure to amplify the annotation in this second edition the plant amarylli orchi and cannabis be insert with two additional print of flower some alteration be make in gloriosa and tulipa and the description of the salt-mine in poland be remove to the first poem on the economy of vegetation preface linneus have divide the vegetable world into 24 class these class into about 120 order these order contain about 2000 family or genus and these family about 20000 species besides the innumerable variety which the accident of climate or cultivation have add to these species the class be distinguish from each other in this ingenious system by the number situation adhesion or reciprocal proportion of the male in each flower the order in many of these class be distinguish by the number or other circumstance of the female the family or genus be characterize by the analogy of all the part of the flower or fructification the species be distinguish by the foliage of the plant and the variety by any accidental circumstance of color taste or odour the seed of these do not always produce plant similar to the parent as in we numerous fruit-tree and garden flower which be propagate by graft or layer the first eleven class include the plant in whose flower both the sex reside and in which the male or stamen be neither unite nor unequal in height when at maturity and be therefore distinguish from each other simply by the number of male in each flower as be see in the annexed plate copy from the dictionaire botanique of m bulliard in which the number of each division refer to the botanic class class i one male _ monandrium _ include the plant which possess but one stamen in each flower ii two male _ diandrium _ two stamen iii three male _ triandrium _ three stamen iv four male _ tetrandrium

enneandrium _ nine stamen x ten male _ decandrium _ ten stamen xi twelve male _ dodecandrium _ twelve stamen the next two class be distinguish not only by the number of equal and disunited male as in the above eleven class but require a additional circumstance to be attend to _ viz _ whether the male or stamen be situate on the calyx or not xii twenty male _ icosandrium _ twenty stamen insert on the calyx or flower-cup as be well see in the last figure of no xii in the annexed plate xiii many male _ polyandrium _ from 20 to 100 stamen which do not adhere to the calyx as be well see in the first figure of no xiii in the annexed plate in the next two class not only the number of stamen be to be observe but the reciprocal proportion in respect to height xiv two power _ didynamium _ four stamen of which two be lower than the other two as be see in the two first figure of no xiv xv four power _ tetradynamium _ six stamen of which four be taller and the two lower one opposite to each other as be see in the third figure of the upper row in no 15 the five subsequent class be distinguish not by the number of the male or stamen but by they union or adhesion either by they anther or filament or to the female or pistil xvi one brotherhood _ monadelphium _ many stamen unite by they filament into one company as in the second figure below of no xvi xvii two brotherhood _ diadelphium

consist of plant whose flower contain but one of the sex or if some of they contain both sex there be other flower accompany they of but one sex xxi one house _ monoecium _ male flower and female flower separate but on the same plant xxii two house _ dioecia _ male flower and female flower separate on different plant xxiii polygamy _ polygamium _ male and female flower on one or more plant which have at the same time flower of both sex the last class contain the plant whose flower be not discernible xxiv clandestine marriage _ cryptogamium _ the order of the first thirteen class be found on the number of female or pistil and distinguish by the name one female _ monogynium _ two female _ digynia _ three female _ trigynium _ & c as be see in no i which represent a plant of one male one female and in the first figure of no xi which represent a flower with twelve male and three female -lrb- for where the pistil have no apparent style the summit or stigma be to be number -rrb- and in the first figure of no xii which represent a flower with twenty male and many female and in the last figure of the same no which have twenty male and one female and in no xiii which represent a flower with many male and many female the class of two power be divide into two natural order into such as have they seed naked at the bottom of the calyx or flower cup and such as have they seed cover as be see in no xiv fig 3 and 5 the class of four power be divide also into two order in one of these the seed be inclose in a silicule as in _ shepherd 's purse _ no xiv fig 5 in the other they be inclose in a silique as in _ wall-flower _ fig 4 in all the other class except the class confederate male and clandestine marriage as the character of each class be distinguish by the situation of the male the character of the order be mark by the number of they in the class one brotherhood no xvi fig 3 the order of ten male be represent and in the class two brotherhood no xvii fig 2 the order ten male be represent in the class confederate male the order be chiefly distinguish by the fertility or barrenness of the floret of the disk or ray of the compound flower and in the class of clandestine marriage the four order be term fern moss flag and funguss the order be again divide into genus or family which be all natural association and be describe from the general resemblance of the part of fructification in respect to they number form situation and reciprocal proportion these be the calyx or flower-cup as see in no iv fig 1 no x fig 1 and 3 no xiv fig 1 2 3 4 second the

each natural order be create in the beginning and that the intermarriage of these produce one plant of every genus or family and that the intermarriage of these generic or family plant produce all the species : and lastly that the intermarriage of the individual of the species produce the variety in the follow poem the name or number of the class or order of each plant be print in italics as _ two

occasionally attempt a landskip and leave the human figure with the subject of history to abler artist _ b _ it be well to know what subject be within the limit of you pencil many have fail of success from the want of this self-knowledge but pray tell I what be the essential difference between poetry and prose be it solely the melody or measure of the language _ p _ i think not solely for some prose have its melody and even measure and good verse well speak in a language unknown to the hearer be not easily to be distinguish from good prose _ b _ be it the sublimity beauty or novelty of the sentiment _ p _ not so for sublime sentiment be often better express in prose thus when warwick in one of the play of shakespear be leave wound on the field after the loss of the battle and he friend say to he oh could you but fly what can be more sublime than he answer why then i would not fly no measure of verse i imagine could add dignity to this sentiment and it would be easy to select example of the beautiful or new from prose writer which i suppose no measure of verse could improve _ b _ in what then consist the essential difference between poetry and prose _ p _ next to the measure of the language the principal distinction appear to I to consist in this : that poetry admit of but few word expressive of very abstracted idea whereas prose abound with they and as we idea derive from visible object be more distinct than those derive from the object of we other sens the word expressive of these idea belong to vision make up the principal part of poetic language that be the poet write principally to the eye the prose-writer use more abstracted term mr pope have write a bad verse in the windsor forest : and kennet swift for silver eel _ renown would _ the word renown would do not present the idea of a visible object to the mind and be thence prosaic but change this line thus and kennet swift where silver grayling _ play _ and it become poetry because the scenery be then bring before the eye _ b _ this may be do in prose _ p _ and when it be do in a single word it animate the prose so it be more agreeable to read in mr gibbon 's history germany be at this time _ over-shadowed _ with extensive forest than germany be at this time _ full _ of extensive forest but where this mode of expression occur too frequently the prose approach to poetry : and in graver work where we expect to be instruct rather than amuse it become tedious and impertinent some part of mr burke 's eloquent oration become intricate and enervate by superfluity of poetic ornament which quantity of ornament would have be agreeable in a poem where much ornament be expect _ b _ be then the office of poetry only to amuse _ p _ the muse be young lady we expect to see they dress though not like some modern beauty with so much gauze and feather that the lady herself be the least part of she there be however didactic piece of poetry which be much admire as the georgic of virgil mason 's english garden hayley 's epistle nevertheless science be best deliver in prose as its mode of reasoning be from stricter analogy than metaphor or simily _ b _ do not personification and allegory distinguish poetry _ p _ these be other art of bring object before the eye or of express sentiment in the language of vision and be indeed better suit to the pen than the pencil _ b _ that be strange when you have just say they be use to bring they object before the eye _ p _ in poetry the personification or allegoric figure be generally indistinct and therefore do not strike we as forcibly as to make we attend to its improbability but in paint the figure be all much more distinct they improbability become apparent and seize we attention to it thus the person of concealment be very indistinct and therefore do not compel we to attend to its improbability in the follow beautiful line of shakespear : -- she never tell she love but let concealment like a worm i ' th ' bud feed on she damask cheek -- but in these line below the person of reason obtrude itself into we company and become disagreeable by its distinctness and consequent improbability to reason i fly and intreat she aid who pause on my case and each circumstance weigh would then gravely reply would in return to my prayer that hebe be fairest of all that be fair that be a truth reply would i i have no need to be teach i come to you reason to find out a fault if that be all say reason return as you come to find fault with hebe would forfeit my name allegoric figure be on this account in general less manageable in painting and in statuary than in poetry : and can seldom be introduce in the two former art in company with natural figure as be evident from the ridiculous effect of many of the painting of ruben in the luxemburgh gallery and for this reason because they improbability become more striking when there be the figure of real person by they side to compare they with mr angelica kauffman well apprise of this circumstance have introduce no mortal figure amongst she cupid and she grace and the great roubiliac in he unrivalled monument of time and fame struggle for the trophy of general fleming have only hang up a medallion of the head of the hero of the piece there be however some allegoric figure which we have so often hear describe or see delineate that we almost forget that they do not exist in common life and hence view they without astonishment as the figure of the heathen mythology of angel devil death and time and almost believe they to be reality even when they be mix with representation of the natural form of man whence i conclude that a certain degree of probability be necessary to prevent we from revolt with distaste from unnatural image unless we be otherwise so much interested in the contemplation of they as not to perceive they improbability _ b _ be this reasoning about degree of probability just -- when sir joshua reynold who be unequalled both in the theory and practice of he art and who be a great master of the pen as well as the pencil have assert in a discourse deliver to the royal academy December 11 1786 that the higher style of painting like the higher kind of the drama do not aim at any thing like deception or have any expectation that the spectator should think the event there represent be really pass before they and he then accuse mr fielding of bad judgment when he attempt to compliment mr garrick in one of he novel by introduce a ignorant man mistake the representation of a scene in hamlet for a reality and think because he be a ignorant man he be less liable to make such a mistake _ p _ it be a metaphysical question and require more attention than sir joshua have bestow upon it -- you will allow that we be perfectly deceive in we dream and that even in we wake reverie we be often so much absorb in the contemplation of what pass in we imagination that for a while we do not attend to the lapse of time or to we own locality and thus suffer a similar kind of deception as in we dream that be we believe thing present before we eye which be not so there be two circumstance which contribute to this compleat deception in we dream first because in sleep the organ of sense be close or inert and hence the train of idea associate in we imagination be never interrupted or dissevered by the irritation of external object and can not therefore be contrast with we sensation on this account though we be affect with a variety of passion in we dream as anger love joy yet we never experience surprize -- for surprize be only produce when any external irritation suddenly obtrude themselves and dissever we pass train of idea secondly because in sleep there be a total suspension of we voluntary power both over the muscle of we body and the idea of we mind for we neither walk about nor reason in compleat sleep hence as the train of idea be pass in we imagination in dream we can not compare they with we previous knowledge of thing as we do in we wake hour for this be a voluntary exertion and thus we can not perceive they incongruity thus we be deprive in sleep of the only two means by which we can distinguish the train of idea pass in we imagination from those excite by we sensation and be lead by they vivacity to believe they to belong to the latter for the vivacity of these train of idea pass in the imagination be greatly increase by the cause above-mention that be by they not be disturbed or dissevered either by the appuls of external body as in surprize or by we voluntary exertion in compare they with we previous knowledge of thing as in reasoning upon they _ b _ now to apply _ p _ when by the art of the painter or poet a train of idea be suggest to we imagination which interest we so much by the pain or pleasure it afford that we cease to attend to the irritation of common external object and cease also to use any voluntary effort to compare these interesting train of idea with we previous knowledge of thing a compleat reverie be produce : during which time however short if it be but for a moment the object themselves appear to exist before we this i think have be call by a ingenious critic the ideal presence of such object -lrb- element of criticism by lord kaime -rrb- and in respect to the compliment intend by mr fielding to mr garrick it would seem that a ignorant rustic at the play of hamlet who have some previous belief in the appearance of ghost would sooner be liable to fall into reverie and continue in it longer than one who possess more knowledge of the real nature of thing and have a greater facility of exercise he reason _ b _ it must require great art in the painter or poet to produce this kind of deception _ p _ the matter must be interesting from its sublimity beauty or novelty this be the scientific part and the art consist in bring these distinctly before the eye so as to produce -lrb- as above-mentioned -rrb- the ideal presence of the object in which the great shakespear particularly excell _ b _ then it be not of any consequence whether the representation correspond with nature _ p _ not if they so much interest the reader or spectator as to induce the reverie above describe nature may be see in the market-place or at the card-table but we expect something more than this in the play-house or picture-room the further the artist recede from nature the greater novelty he be likely to produce if he rise above nature he produce the sublime and beauty be probably a selection and new combination of she most agreeable part yourself will be sensible of the truth of this doctrine by recollect over in you mind the work of three of we celebrated artist sir joshua reynold have introduce sublimity even into its portrait we admire the representation of person whose reality we should have pass by unnoticed mr angelica kauffman attract we eye with beauty which i suppose no where exist certainly few grecian face be see in this country and the daring pencil of fuselus transport we beyond the boundary of nature and ravish we with the charm of the most interesting novelty and shakespear who excell in all these together so far captivate the spectator as to make he unmindful of every kind of violation of time place or existence as at the first appearance of the ghost of hamlet he ear must be dull as the fat weed which root itself on lethe 's brink who can attend to the improbablity of the exhibition so in many scene of the tempest we perpetually believe the action pass before we eye and relapse with somewhat of distaste into common life at the interval of the representation _ b _ i suppose a poet of less ability would find such great machinery difficult and cumbersome to manage _ p _ just so we should be mock at the apparent improbability as in the garden of a scicilian nobleman describe in mr brydone 's and in mr swinburn 's travels there be say to be six hundred statue of imaginary monster which so disgust the spectator that the state have once a serious design of destroy they and yet the very improbable monster in ovid 's metamorphosis have entertain the world for many century _ b _ the monster in you botanic garden i hope

simile into a kind of short episode _ b _ then a simile should not very accurately resemble the subject _ p _ no it would then become a philosophical analogy it would be ratiocination instead of poetry : it need only so far resemble the subject as poetry itself ought to resemble nature it should have so much sublimity beauty or novelty as to interest the reader and should be express in

disagreeable reverie as from the night-mare and from this may be discover the line of boundary between the tragic and the horrid : which line however will veer a little this way or that accord to the prevail manners of the age or country and the peculiar association of idea or idiosyncracy of mind of individual for instance if a artist should represent the death of a officer in battle by shew a little blood on the bosom of he shirt as if a bullet have there penetrate the die figure would affect the beholder with pity and if fortitude be at the same time express in he countenance admiration would be add to we pity on the contrary if the artist should chuse to represent he thigh as shoot away by a cannon ball and should exhibit the bleeding flesh and shatter bone of the stump the picture would introduce into we mind idea from a butcher 's shop or a surgeon 's operation-room and we should turn from it with disgust so if character be bring upon the stage with they limb disjoint by torture instrument and the floor cover with clot blood and scatter brain we theatric reverie would be destroy by disgust and we should leave the play-house with detestation the painter have be more guilty in this respect than the poet the cruelty of apollo in flay marcia alive be a favorite subject with the antient artist : and the torture of expire martyr have disgrace the modern one it require little genius to exhibit the muscle in convulsive action either by the pencil or the chissel because the interstice be deep and the line strongly define : but those tender gradation of muscular action which constitute the graceful attitude of the body be difficult to conceive or to execute except by a master of nice discernment and cultivate taste _ b _ by what definition would you distinguish the horrid from the tragic _ p _ i suppose the latter consist of distress attend with pity which be say to be ally to love the most agreeable of all we passion and the former in distress accompany with disgust which be ally to hate and be one of we most disagreeable sensation hence when horrid scene of cruelty be represent in picture we wish to disbelieve they existence and voluntarily exert ourselves to escape from the deception : whereas the bitter cup of true tragedy be mingle with some sweet consolatory drop which endear we tear and we continue to contemplate the interesting delusion with a delight which it be not easy to explain _ b _ have not this be explain by lucretius where he describe a shipwreck and say the spectator receive pleasure from feel themselves safe on land and by akenside in he beautiful poem on the pleasure of imagination who ascribe it to we finding object for the due exertion of we passion _ p _ we must not confound we sensation at the contemplation of real misery with those which we experience at the scenical representation of tragedy the spectator of a shipwreck may be attract by the dignity and novelty of the object and from these may be say to receive pleasure but not from the distress of the sufferer a ingenious writer who have criticise this dialogue in the english review for August 1789 add that one great source of we pleasure from scenical distress arise from we at the same time generally contemplate one of the noblest object of nature that of virtue triumphant over every difficulty and oppression or support its votary under every suffering : or where this do not occur that we mind be relieve by the justice of some signal punishment await the delinquent but besides this at the exhibition of a good tragedy we be not only amuse by the dignity and novelty and beauty of the object before we but if any distressful circumstance occur too forcible for we sensibility we can voluntarily exert ourselves and recollect that the scenery be not real : and thus not only the pain which we have receive from the apparent distress be lessen but a new source of pleasure be open to we similar to that which we frequently have feel on awake from a distressful dream we be glad that it be not true we be at the same time unwilling to relinquish the pleasure which we receive from the other interesting circumstance of the drama and on that account quickly permit ourselves to relapse into the delusion and thus alternately believe and disbelieve almost every moment the existence of the object represent before we _ b _ have those two

period of time as the other continent one reason for this opinion be because the great lake perhaps nearly as large as the mediterranean sea consist of fresh water and as the sea-salt seem to have its origin from the destruction of vegetable and animal body wash down by rain and carry by river into lake or sea it would seem that this source of sea-salt have not so long exist in that country there be however a more satisfactory way of explain this circumstance which be that the american lake lie above the level of the ocean and be hence perpetually desalit by the river which run through they

towards the coast of florida and thence into the north-american ocean where it lie very thick on the surface of the sea thus a rapid current pass from the gulf of florida to the ne along the coast of north-america know to seamen by the name of the gulf-stream a chart of this be publish by dr francklin in 1768 from the information principally of capt folger this be confirm by the ingenious experiment of dr blagden publish in 1781 who find that the water of the gulf-stream be from six to eleven degree warmer than the water of the sea through which it run which must have be occasion by its be bring from a hotter climate he ascribe the origin of this current to the power of the trade-wind which blow always in the same direction carry the water of the atlantic ocean to the westward

what be the particulars of they relationship _ poet _ it have be already observe that the principal part of the language of poetry consist of those word which be expressive of the idea which we originally receive by the organ of sight and in this it nearly indeed resemble painting which can express itself in no other way but by exciting the idea or sensation belong to the sense of vision but besides this essential similitude in the language of the poetic pen and pencil these two sister resemble each other if i may so say in many of they habit and manners the painter to produce a strong effect make a few part of he picture large distinct and luminous and keep the remainder in shadow or even beneath its natural size and color to give eminence to the principal figure this be similar to the common manner of poetic composition where the subordinate character be keep down to elevate and give consequence to the hero or heroine of the piece in the south aile of the cathedral church at lichfield there be a antient monument of a recumbent figure the head and neck of which lie on a roll of matting in a kind of niche or cavern in the wall and about five foot distant horizontally in another opening or cavern in the wall be see the foot and ankle with some fold of garment lie also on a matt and though the intermediate space be a solid stone-wall yet the imagination supply the deficiency and the whole figure seem to exist before we eye do not this resemble one of the art both of the painter and the poet the former often show a muscular arm amidst a group of figure or a impassioned face and hide the remainder of the body behind other object leave the imagination to compleat it the latter describe a single feature or attitude in picturesque word produce before the mind a image of the whole i remember see a print in which be represent a shrivel hand stretch through a iron grate in the stone floor of a prison-yard to reach at a mess of porrage which affect I with more horrid idea of the distress of the prisoner in the dungeon below than could have be perhaps produce by a exhibition of the whole person and in the follow beautiful scenery from the midsummer-night 's dream -lrb- in which i have take the liberty to alter the place of a comma -rrb- the description of the swimming step and prominent belly bring the whole figure before we eye with the distinctness of reality when we have laugh have to see the sail conceive and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swim gate follow she womb -lrb- then rich with my young squire -rrb- would imitate and sail upon the land there be a third sister-feature which belong both to the pictorial and poetic art and that be the make sentiment and passion visible as it be to the spectator this be do in both art by describe or portray the effect or change which those sentiment or passion produce upon the body at the end of the unaltered play of lear there be a beautiful example of poetic painting the old king be introduce as die from grief for the loss of cordelium at this crisis shakespear conceive the robe of the king to be hold together by a clasp represent he as only say to a attendant courtier in a faint voice pray sir undo this button -- thank you sir and die thus by the art of the poet the oppression at the bosom of the die king be make visible not describe in word _ b _ what be the feature in which these sister-art do not resemble each other _ p _ the ingenious bishop berkeley in he treatise on vision a work of great ability have evince that the color which we see be only a language suggest to we mind the idea of solidity and extension which we have before receive by the sense of touch thus when we view the trunk of a tree we eye can only acquaint we with the color or shades and from the previous experience of the sense of touch these suggest to we the cylindrical form with the prominent or depressed wrinkle on it from hence it appear that there be the strictest analogy between color and sound as they be both but language which do not represent they correspondent idea but only suggest they to the mind from the habit or association of previous experience it be therefore reasonable to conclude that the more artificial arrangement of these two language by the poet and the painter bear a similar analogy but in one circumstance the pen and the pencil differ widely from each other and that be the quantity of time which they can include in they respective representation the former can unravel a long series of event which may constitute the history of day or year while the latter can exhibit only the action of a moment the poet be happier in describe successive scene the painter in represent stationary one : both have they advantage where the passion be introduce as the poet on one hand have the power gradually to prepare the mind of he reader by previous climacteric circumstance the painter on the other hand can throw stronger illumination and distinctness on the principal moment or catastrophe of the action besides the advantage he have in use a universal language which can be _ read _ in a instant of time thus where a great number of figure be all see together support or contrast each other and contribute to explain or aggrandize the principal effect we view a picture with agreeable surprize and contemplate it with unceasing admiration in the representation of the sacrifice of jephtha 's daughter a print do from a painting of ant coypel at one glance of the eye we read all the interesting passage of the last act of a well-written tragedy so much poetry be there condensed into a moment of time _ b _ will you now oblige I with a account of the relationship between poetry and she other sister music _ p _ in the poetry of we language i do not think we be to look for any thing analogous to the note of the gamut for except perhaps in a few exclamation or interrogation we be at liberty to raise or sink we voice a octave or two at pleasure without alter the sense of the word hence if either poetry or prose be read in melodious tone of voice as be do in recitativo or in chaunt it must depend on the speaker not on the writer : for though word may be select which be less harsh than other that be which have fewer sudden stop or abrupt consonant amongst the vowel or with fewer sibilant letter yet this do not constitute melody which consist of agreeable succession of note referrable to the gamut or harmony which consist of agreeable combination of they if the chinese language have many word of similar articulation which yet signify different idea when speak in a higher or lower musical note as some traveller affirm it must be capable of much finer effect in respect to the audible part of poetry than any language we be acquaint with there be however another affinity in which poetry and music more nearly resemble each other than have generally be understand and that be in they measure or time there be but two kind of time acknowledge in modern music which be call _ triple time _ and _ common time _ the former of these be divide by bar each bar contain three crotchet or a proportional number of they subdivision into quaver and semiquaver this kind of time be analogous to the measure of we heroic or iambic verse thus the two follow couplet be each of they divide into five bar of _ triple time _ each bar consist of two crotchet and two quaver nor can they be divide into bar analogous to _ common time _ without the bar interfere with some of the crotchet so as to divide they _ 3 _ soft-warbling beak ¦ in each bright blo ¦ som move 4 and vo ¦ cal rosebud thrill ¦ the enchanted grove ¦ in these line there be a quaver and a crochet alternately in every bar except in the last in which _ the in _ make two semiquaver the _ e _ be suppose by grammarian to be cut off which any one 's ear will readily determine not to be true _ 3 _ life bud or breathe ¦ from indus to ¦ the pole 4 and the ¦ vast surface kind ¦ les as it roll ¦ in these line there be a quaver and a crotchet alternately in the first bar a quaver two crotchet and a quaver make the second bar in the third bar there be a quaver a crotchet and a rest after the crotchet that be after the word _ pole _ and two quaver begin the next line the fourth bar consist of quaver and crotchet alternately in the last bar there be a quaver and a rest after it viz after the word _ kindle _ and then two quaver and a crotchet you will clearly perceive the truth of this if you prick the musical character above mention under the verse the _ common time _ of musician be divide into bar each of which contain four crotchet or a proportional number of they subdivision into quaver and semiquaver this kind of musical time be analogous to the dactyle verse of we language the most popular instance of which be in mr anstie 's bath-guide in this kind of verse the bar do not begin till after the first or second syllable and where the verse be quite complete and write by a good ear these first syllable add to the last complete the bar exactly in this also correspond with many piece of music _ 2 _ yet ¦ if one may guess by the ¦ size of he calf sir 4 he ¦ weigh about twenty-three ¦ stone and a half sir _ 2 _ master ¦ mamozet 's head be not ¦ finish so soon 4 for it ¦ take up the barber a ¦ whole afternoon in these line each bar consist of a crotchet two quaver another crotchet and two more quaver : which be equal to four crotchet and like many bar of _ common time _ in music may be subdivide into two in beat time without disturb the measure the follow verse from shenftone belong likewise to common time : 2\/4 a | river or a sea | be to he a dish | of tea and a king | dom bread and butter the first and second bar consist each of a crotchet a quaver a crotchet a quaver a crotchet the third bar consist of a quaver two crotchet a quaver a crotchet the last bar be not complete without add the letter a which begin the first line and then it consist of a quaver a crotchet a quaver a crotchet two quaver it must be observe that the crotchet in triple time be in general play by musician slower than those of common time and hence minuet be generally prick in triple time and country dance generally in common time so the verse above related which be analogous to _ triple time _ be generally read slower than those analogous to _ common time _ and be thence generally use for graver composition i suppose all the different kind of verse to be find in we ode which have any measure at all might be arrange under one or other of these two musical time allow a note or two sometimes to precede the commencement of the bar and occasional rest as in musical composition : if this be attend to by those who set poetry to music it be probable the sound and sense would oftener coincide whether these musical time can be apply to the lyric and heroic verse of the greek and latin poet i do not pretend to determine certain it be that the dactyle verse of we language when it be end with a double rhime much resemble the measure of homer and virgil except in the length of the line b then there be no relationship between the other two of these sister - painting and music _ p _ there be at least a mathematical relationship or perhaps i ought rather to have say a metaphysical relationship between they sir isaac newton have observe that the breadth of the seven primary color in the sun 's image refract by a prism be proportional to the seven musical note of the gamut or to the interval of the eight sound contain in a octave that be proportional to the following number : sol la fa sol la mi fa sol red orange yellow green blue indigo violet 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 9 16 10 9 16 16 9 newton 's optics book i part 2 prop 3 and 6 dr smith in he harmonic have a explanatory note upon this happy discovery as he term it of newton sect 4 art 7 from this curious coincidence it have be propose to produce a luminous music confiding of succession or combination of color analogous to a tune in respect to the proportion above mention this might be perform by a strong light make by means of mr argand 's lamp pass through color glass and fall on a define part of a wall with moveable blind before they which might communicate with the key of a harpsichord and thus produce at the same time visible and audible music in unison with each other the execution of this idea be say by mr guyot to have be attempt by father cassel without much success if this should be again attempt there be another curious coincidence between sound and color discover by dr darwin of shrewsbury and explain in a paper on what he call ocular spectrum in the philosophical transaction vol lxxvi which might much facilitate the execution of it in this treatise the doctor have demonstrate that we see certain color not only with greater ease and distinctness but with relief and pleasure after have for some time contemplated other certain color as green after red or red after green orange after blue or blue after orange yellow after violet or violet after yellow this he shew arise from the _ ocular spectrum _ of the color last view coincide with the _ irritation _ of the color now under contemplation now as the pleasure we receive from the sensation of melodious note independent of the previous association of agreeable idea with they must arise from we hear some proportion of sound after other more easily distinctly or agreeably and as there be a coincidence between the proportion of the primary color and the primary sound if they may be so call he argue that the same law must govern the sensation of both in this circumstance therefore consist the sisterhood of music and painting and hence they claim a right to borrow metaphor from each other musician to speak of the brilliancy of sound and the light and shade of a concerto and painter of the harmony of color and the tone of a picture thus it be not quite so absurd as be imagine when the blind man ask if the color scarlet be like the sound of a trumpet as the coincidence or opposition of these _ ocular spectrum _ -lrb- or color which remain in the eye after have for some time contemplate a luminous object -rrb- be more easily and more accurately ascertain now they law have be investigate by dr darwin than the _ relict _ of evanescent sound upon the ear it be to be wish that some ingenious musician would further cultivate this curious field of science : for if visible music can be agreeably produce it would be more easy to add sentiment to it by the representation of grove and cupid and sleep nymph amid the change color than be commonly do by the word of audible music _ b _ you mention the greater length of the verse of homer and virgil have not these poet great advantage in the superiority of they language compare to we own _ p _ it be probable that the introduction of philosophy into a country must gradually affect the language of it as philosophy converse in more appropriate and abstracted term and thus by degree eradicate the abundance of metaphor which be use in the more early age of society otherwise though the greek compound word have more vowel in proportion to they consonant than the english one yet the mode of compound they be less general as may be see by variety of instance give in the preface of the translator prefix to the system of vegetable by the lichfield society which happy property of we own language render that translation of linneus as expressive and as concise perhaps more so than the original and in one respect i believe the english language serve the purpose of poetry better than the antient one i mean in the greater ease of produce personification for as we noun have in general no gender affix to they in prose-composition and in the habit of conversation they become easily personify only by the addition of a masculine or feminine pronoun as pale melancholy sit and round _ she _ throw a death-like silence and a dread repose _ pope 's abelard _ and secondly as most of we noun have the article _ a _ or _ the _ prefix to they in prose-writing and in conversation they in general become personify even by the omission of these article as in the bold figure of shipwreck in miss seward 's elegy on capt cook : but round the steepy rock and dangerous strand roll the white surf and shipwreck guard the land add to this that if the verse in we heroic poetry be shorter than those of the ancient we word likewise be shorter and in respect to they measure or time which have erroneously be call melody and harmony i doubt from what have be say above whether we be so much inferior as be generally believe since many passage which have be steal from antient poet have be translate into we language without lose any thing of the beauty of the versification _ b _ i be glad to hear you acknowledge the theft of the modern poet from the antient one whose work i suppose have be reckon lawful plunder in all age but have not you borrow epithet phrase and even half a line occasionally from modern poem _ p _ it may be difficult to mark the exact boundary of what should be term plagiarism : where the sentiment and expression be both borrow without due acknowledgement there can be no doubt -- single word on the contrary take from other author can not convict a writer of plagiarism they be lawful game wild by nature the property of all who can capture they -- and perhaps a few common flower of speech may be gather as we pass over we

surprising when the circumstance which we shall faithfully relate in this description be consider i must acknowledge that i long doubt the existence of this tree until a stricter enquiry convinced I of my error i shall now only relate simple unadorned fact of which i have be a eye-witness my reader may depend upon the fidelity of this account in the year 1774 i be station at batavium as surgeon in the service of the dutch east-india company during my residence there i receive several different account of the bohon upa and the violent effect of its poison they all then seem incredible to I but raise my curiosity in so high a degree that i resolve to investigate this subject thoroughly and to trust only to _ my own observation _ in consequence of this resolution i apply to the governor-general mr petrus albertus van der parra for a pass to travel through the country : my request be grant and have procure every information i set out on my expedition i have procure a recommendation from a old malayan priest to another priest who live on the nearest inhabitable spot to the tree which be about fifteen or sixteen mile distant the letter prove of great service to I in my undertaking as that priest be appoint by the emperor to reside there in order to prepare for eternity the soul of those who for different crime be sentence to approach the tree and to procure the poison the _ bohon-upas _ be situate in the island of _ java _ about twenty-seven league from _ batavium _ fourteen from _ soura charta _ the seat of the emperor and between eighteen and twenty league from _ tinksor _ the present residence of the sultan of java it be surround on all side by a circle of high hill and mountain and the country round it to the distance of ten or twelve mile from the tree be entirely barren not a tree nor a shrub nor even the least plant or grass be to be see i have make the tour all around this dangerous spot at about eighteen mile distant from the center and i find the aspect of the country on all side equally dreary the easiest ascent of the hill be from that part where the old ecclesiastick dwell from he house the criminal be send for the poison into which the point of all warlike instrument be dip it be of high value and produce a considerable revenue to the emperor _ account of the manner in which the poison it procure _ the poison which be procure from this tree be a gum that issue out between the bark and the tree itself like the _ camphor _ malefactor who for they crime be sentence to die be the only person who fetch the poison and this be the only chance they have of save they life after sentence be pronounced upon they by the judge they be ask in court whether they will die by the hand of the executioner or whether they will go to the upa tree for a box of poison they commonly prefer the latter proposal as there be not only some chance of preserve they life but also a certainty in case of they safe return that a provision will be make for they in future by the emperor they be also permit to ask a favor from the emperor which be generally of a trifling nature and commonly grant they be then provide with a silver or tortoiseshell box in which they be to put the poisonous gum and be properly instruct how to proceed while they be upon they dangerous expedition among other particulars they be always tell to attend to the direction of the wind as they be to go towards the tree before the wind so that the effluvium from the tree be always blow from they they be tell likewise to travel with the utmost dispatch as that be the only method of insure a safe return they be afterwards send to the house of the old priest to which place they be commonly attend by they friend and relation here they generally remain some day in expectation of a favourable breeze during that time the ecclesiastic prepare they for they future fate by prayer and admonition when the hour of they departure arrive the priest put they on a long leather-cap with two glass before they eye which come down as far as they breast and also provide they with a pair of leather-glove they be then conduct by the priest and they friend and relation about two mile on they journey here the priest repeat he instruction and tell they where they be to look for the tree he shew they a hill which they be tell to ascend and that on the other side they will find a rivulet which they be to follow and which will conduct they directly to the upa they now take leave of each other and amidst prayer for they success the delinquent hasten away the worthy old ecclesiastic have assure I that during he residence there for upward of thirty year he have dismiss above seven hundred criminal in the manner which i have describe and that scarcely two out of twenty have return he shew I a catalogue of all the unhappy sufferer with the date of they departure from he house annex and a list of the offence for which they have be condemn : to which be add a list of those who have return in safety i afterwards see another list of these culprit at the jail keeper 's at _ soura-charta _ and find that they perfectly correspond with each other and with the different information which i afterwards obtain i be present at some of these melancholy ceremony and desire different delinquent to bring with they some piece of the wood or a small branch or some leaf of this wonderful tree i have also give they silk cord desire they to measure its thickness i never could procure move than two dry leaf that be pick up by one of they on he return and all i could learn from he concern the tree itself be that it stand on the border of a rivulet as describe by the old priest that it be of a middling size that five or six young tree of the same kind stand close by it but that no other shrub or plant could be see near it and that the ground be of a brownish sand full of stone almost impracticable for travel and cover with dead body after many conversation with the old malayan priest i question he about the first discovery and ask he opinion of this dangerous tree upon which he give I the follow answer : we be tell in we new alcoran that above a hundred year ago the country around the tree be inhabit by a people strongly addict to the sin of sodom and gomorrha when the great prophet mahomet determine not to suffer they to lead such detestable life any longer he apply to god to punish they : upon which god cause this tree to grow out of the earth which destroy they all and render the country for ever uninhabitable such be the malayan opinion i shall not attempt a comment but must observe that all the malayan consider this tree as a holy instrument of the great prophet to punish the sin of mankind and therefore to die of the poison of the upa be generally consider among they as a honorable death for that reason i also observe that the delinquent who be go to the tree be generally dress in they best apparel this however be certain though it may appear incredible that from fifteen to eighteen mile round this tree not only no human creature can exist but that in that space of ground no living animal of any kind have ever be discover i have also be assure by several person of veracity that there be no fish in the water nor have any rat mouse or any other vermin be see there and when any bird fly so near this tree that the effluvium reach they they fall a sacrifice to the effect of the poison this circumstance have be ascertain by different delinquent who in they return have see the bird drop down and have pick they up _ dead _ and bring they to the old ecclesiastick i will here mention a instance which prove they a fact beyond all doubt and which happen during my stay at java in the year 1775 a rebellion break out among the subject of the massay a sovereign prince whose dignity be nearly equal to that of the emperor they refuse to pay a duty impose upon they by they sovereign whom they openly oppose the massay send a body of a thousand troops to disperse the rebel and to drive they with they family out of he dominion thus four hundred family consist of above sixteen hundred soul be oblige to leave they native country neither the emperor nor the sultan would give they protection not only because they be rebel but also through fear of displease they neighbor the massay in this distressful situation they have no other resource than to repair to the uncultivated part round the upa and request permission of the emperor to settle there they request be grant on condition of they fix they abode not more than twelve or fourteen mile from the tree in order not to deprive the inhabitant already settle there at a greater distance of they cultivate land with this they be oblige to comply but the consequence be that in less than two month they number be reduce to about three hundred the chief of those who remain return to the massay inform he of they loss and intreated he pardon which induce he to receive they again as subject think they sufficiently punish for they misconduct i have see and converse with several of those who survive soon after they return they all have the appearance of person taint with a infectious disorder they look pale and weak and from the account which they give of the loss of they comrade of the symptom and circumstance which attend they dissolution such as convulsion and other sign of a violent death i be fully convince that they fall victim to the poison this violent effect of the poison at so great a distance from the tree certainly appear surprising and almost incredible and especially when we consider that it be possible for delinquent who approach the tree to return alive my wonder however in a great measure cease after i have make the follow observation : i have say before that malefactor be instruct to go to the tree with the wind and to return against the wind when the wind continue to blow from the same quarter while the delinquent travels thirty or six and thirty mile if he be of a good constitution he certainly survive but what prove the most destructive be that there be no dependence on the wind in that part of the world for any length of time -- there be no regular land-wind and the sea-wind be not perceive there at all the situation of the tree be at too great a distance and surround by high mountain and uncultivated forest besides the wind there never blow a fresh regular gale but be commonly merely a current of light soft breeze which pass through the different opening of the adjoining mountain it be also frequently difficult to determine from what part of the globe the wind really come as it be divide by various obstruction in its passage which easily change the direction of the wind and often totally destroy its effect i therefore impute the distant effect of the poison in a great measure to the constant gentle wind in those part which have not power enough to disperse the poisonous particle if high wind be more frequent and durable there they would certainly weaken very much and even destroy the obnoxious effluvium of the poison but without they the air remain infested and pregnant with these poisonous vapor i be the more convinced of this as the worthy ecclesiastick assure I that a dead calm be always attend with the greatest danger as there be a continual perspiration issue from the tree which be see to rise and spread in the air like the putrid steam of a marshy cavern _ experiment make with the gum of the upa tree _ in the year 1776 in the month of February i be present at the execution of thirteen of the emperor 's concubine at _ soura-charta _ who be convict of infidelity to the emperor 's bed it be in the forenoon about eleven o'clock when the fair criminal be lead into a open space within the wall of the emperor 's palace there the judge pass sentence upon they by which they be doom to suffer death by a lancet poison with upa after this the alcoran be present to they and they be accord to the law of they great prophet mahomet to acknowledge and to affirm by oath that the charge bring against they together with the sentence and they punishment be fair and equitable this they do by lay they right hand upon the alcoran they leave hand upon they breast and they eye lift towards heaven the judge then hold the alcoran to they lip and they kiss it these ceremony over the executioner proceed on he business in the follow manner : -- thirteen post each about five foot high have be previously erect to these the delinquent be fasten and they breast strip naked in this situation they remain a short time in continual prayer attend by several priest until a signal be give by the judge to the executioner on which the latter produce a instrument much like the spring lancet use by farrier for bleed horse with this instrument it be poison with the gum of the upa the unhappy wretch be lance in the middle of they breast and the operation be perform upon they all in less than two minute my astonishment be raise to the highest degree when i beheld the sudden effect of that poison for in about five minute after they be lance they be take with a _ tremor _ attend with a _ subsultus tendinum _ after which they die in the greatest agony cry out to god and mahomet for mercy in sixteen minute by my watch which i hold in my hand all the criminal be no more some hour after they death i observe they body full of livid spot much like those of the _ petechiæ _ they face swell they color change to a kind of blue they eye look yellow & c & c about a fortnight after this i have a opportunity of see such another execution at samarang seven malayan be execute there with the same instrument and in the same manner and i find the operation of the poison and the spot in they body exactly the same these circumstance make I desirous to try a experiment with some animal in order to be convince of the real effect of this poison and as i have then two young puppy i think they the fittest object for my purpose i accordingly procure with great difficulty some grain of upas i dissolve half a grain of that gum in a small quantity of arrack and dip a lancet into it with this poison instrument i make a incision in the lower muscular part of the belly in one of the puppy three minute after it receive the wound the animal begin to cry out most piteously and run as fast as possible from one corner of the room to the other so it continue during six minute when all its strength be exhaust it fall upon the ground be take with convulsion and die in the eleventh minute i repeat this experiment with two other puppy with a cat and a fowl and find the operation of the poison in all of they the same : none of these animal survive above thirteen minute i think it necessary to try also the effect of the poison give inwardly which i do in the follow manner i dissolve a quarter of a grain of the gum in half a ounce of arrack and make a dog of seven month old drink it in seven minute a retch ensue and i observe at the same time that the animal be delirious as it run up and down the room fall on the ground and tumble about then it rise again cry out very loud and in about half a hour after be seize with convulsion and die i open the body and find the stomach very much inflamed as the intestine be in some part but not so much as the stomach there be a small quantity of coagulate blood in the stomach but i could discover no orifice from which it could have issue and therefore suppose it to have be squeeze out of the lung by the animal 's strain while it be vomit from these experiment i have be convince that the gum of the upa be the most dangerous and most violent of all vegetable poison and i be apt to believe that it greatly contribute to the unhealthiness of that island nor be this the only evil attend it : hundred of the native of java as well as european be yearly destroy and treacherously murder by that poison either internally or externally every man of quality or fashion have he dagger or other arm poison with it and in time of war the malayan poison the spring and other water with it by this treacherous practice the dutch suffer greatly during the last war as it occasion the loss of half they army for this reason they have ever since keep fish in the spring of which they drink the water and sentinel be place near they who inspect the water every hour to see whether the fish be alive if they march with a army or body of troops into a enemy 's country they always carry live fish with they which they throw into the water some hour before they venture to drink it by which mean they have be able to prevent they total destruction this account i flatter myself will satisfy the curiosity of my reader and the few fact which i have relate will be consider as a certain proof of the exigence of this pernicious tree and its penetrate effect if it be ask why we have not yet any more satisfactory account of this tree i can only answer that the object to most traveller to that part of the world consist more in commercial pursuit than in the study of natural history and the advancement of science besides java be so universally repute a unhealthy island that rich traveller seldom make any long stay in it and other want money and generally be too ignorant of the language to travel in order to make enquiry in future those who visit this island will probably now be induce to make it a object of they research and will furnish we with a fuller
