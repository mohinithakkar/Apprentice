coward xi the asperity of the early british reviewer xii the pursuit of fire there be pippin and cheese to come there be pippin and cheese to come in my noonday quest for food if the day be fine it be my habit to shun the nearer place of refreshment i take the air and stretch myself like eve 's serpent i go upright for a bit yet if time press there may be have next door a not unsavory stowage a drinking bar be nearest to the street where its polished brass catch the eye it hold a gilded mirror to such red-faced nature as consort within yet you pass the bar and come upon a range of table at the rear now if you yield to the habit of the place you order a rump of meat gravy lie about it like a moat around a castle and if there be in you the zest for encounter you attack it above these murky water this castle have a pleasant seat you cry and charge upon it with pike advance but if you appetite be one to peck and mince the whiff that breathe upon the place come unwelcome to you nostril in no wise be they like the sweet south upon you sens there be even a suspicion in you -- such be you distemper -- that it be too much a witch 's cauldron in the kitchen eye of newt and toe of frog and you spy and poke upon you food bus boy bear off the crockery as though they be apprentice to a juggler and be only at the beginning of they art waiter bawl strange message to the cook it be a tongue unguessed by learn yet sharp and potent also there come a riot from the kitchen and steam issue from the door as though the devil himself be a partner and conduct here a upper branch like the man in the old comedy you belly may still ring dinner but the tinkle be faint such be you state you choose a daintier place to eat have now set upon a longer journey -- the day be fine and the sidewalk throng -- you pass by a restaurant that be but a few door up the street a fellow in a white coat flop pancake in the window but even though the pancake do a double somersault and there be twenty curious nose press against the glass still you keep you course uptown nor be you lead off because a near-by stairway beckon you to a chinese restaurant up above a golden dragon swing over the door its race have fall since its fire-breathing grandsire guard the fruit of the hesperide be not soy and chou mein and other such treasure of the east lay out above and yet the dragon doze at its post like a sleepy dog no flame leap up its gullet the swish of its tail be still if it wag at all it be but in friendship or because a gust of wind have stir it from its dream i have wonder why chinese restaurant be generally on the second story a casual inquiry attest it i know of one it be true on the ground level yet here i suspect a special economy the place have formerly be a german restaurant with teuton scroll ich dien and heraldry on its wall a frugal brush change the decoration from the heart of a prussian blazonry there flare on you in chinese yellow a recommendation to try we chicken chop soy the quartering of the house of hohenzollern wear a baldric in praise of subgum noodle warmein which it seem they cook to a unusual delicacy even a wall painting of rip van winkle bowling at tenpin in the mountain be now set off with a pigtail but the chair be dutch and remain as such generally however chinese restaurant be on the second story probably there be a ritual from the ancient day of ming ti that chinamen when they eat shall sit as near as possible to the sacred moon but hold a bit in you haste up town to find a place to eat you be miss some of the finer sight upon the way in these window that you pass the merchant have set they choicest wares if there be any commodity of softer gloss than common or one shinier to the eye -- so that you poverty fret you -- it be display here in the window of the haberdasher shirt -- mere torso with not a leg below or head above -- yet disport themselves in gay neckwear despite they dismemberment they be trick to the latest turn of fashion can vanity survive such general amputation then there be hope for immortality but by what sad chance have these blithe fellow be disjoint if a gloomy mood prevail in you -- as might come from a bad turn of the market -- you fancy that the evil daughter of herodia still live around the corner and that she have set out she victim to the general view if there come a hurdy-gurdy on the street and you cock you ear to the tune of it you may still hear the dancing measure of she wicked foot or it be possible that these be the kindred of holoferne and that they have sup guiltily in they tent with a sisterhood of judith or we may conceive -- we thought run now to food -- that these gamesome creature of the haberdasher have dress themselves for a more recent banquet they black-tailed coat and glossy shirt attest a rare occasion it be in holiday mood when they be fresh-combed and perk in they best that they be cut off from life it would appear that jack ketch the headsman get they when they be rub and shine for the feast we 'll not squint upon he writ it be enough that they be apprehend for some rascality when he come thump on he dreadful summons here they be already set fop from shoe to head in the newest whim spoon in hand and bib across they knee -- lest they fleck they careful front -- they wait for the anchovy to come and on a sudden they be cut off from life unfit unseasoned for the passage like the elder hamlet 's brother they be engage upon a act that have no relish of salvation in it you may remember the lamentable child somewhere in dickens who because of a abrupt and distressing accident have a sandwich in its hand but no mouth to put it in or perhaps you recall the cook of the nancy bell and he grievous end the poor fellow be stew in he own stew-pot it be the elderly naval man you recall -- the two of they be the ship 's sole survivor on the desert island and both of they lean with hunger -- it be the elderly naval man -lrb- the villain of the piece -rrb- who up with he heel and smother he squeal in the scum of the boiling broth and yet by look on these torso of the haberdasher one be not bring to thought of sad mortality they joy be so exultant and all the thing that they hold dear -- cane glove silk hat and the newer garment on which fashion make its twaddle -- be within reach of they armless sleeve have they finger they would be smooth themselves before the glass they unbodied head wherever they may be be still smile on the world despite they divorcement they tongue be still ready with a jest they lip still part for the anchovy to come a few day since as i be think -- for so i be pleased to call my muddy stirring -- what manner of essay i might write and how best to sort and lay out the rummage it happen pat to my need that i receive from a friend a book entitle the closet of sir kenelm digby knight open now before it come i have get so far as to select a title indeed i have write the title on seven different sheet of paper each time in the hope that by the run of the word i might leap upon some further think seven time i fail and in the end the sheet go into the waste basket possibly to the confusion of annie we cook who may have mistake they for a reiterate admonishment towards the governance of she kitchen -- at the least a hint of my desire and appetite for cheese and pippin the closet of sir kenelm digby open be a cook book it be due you to know this at once otherwise you thought -- if you nature be vagrant -- would drift towards family skeleton or maybe the domestic trait prevail and you would think of dress-clothes hang in camphorate bag and a row of winter boot upon a shelf i be disqualify to pass upon the merit of a cook book for the reason that i have little discrimination in food it be not that i be totally indifferent to what lie on the platter indeed i have more than a tribal aversion to pork in general while on the other hand i quicken joyfully when noodle be intersperse with bacon i have a tooth for sweet too although i hold it unmanly and deny it as i can i be tell also -- although i resent it -- that my eye light up on the appearance of a tray of french pastry i admit gladly however my love of onion whether they come hiss from the skillet or lie in they first tender whiteness they be at they best when they be place on bread and be eat largely at midnight after society have do its worst a fine dinner be lose within I a quail be but a inferior chicken -- a poor relation outside the exclusive hennery terrapin sit low in my regard even though it have wallow in the most aristocratic marsh through such dinner i hack and see my way without even gain a memory of my progress if ask the course i balk after the recital of the soup indeed i be so forgetful of food even when i dine at home that i can well believe that adam when he be question about the apple be in real confusion he have or he have not it be mix with the pomegranate or the quince that eve have slice and cook on the day before a dinner at its best be bring to a single focus there be one dish to dominate the cloth a single bulk to which all other dish be subordinate if there be turkey it should mount from a central platter its protrude leg out-top the candle all other food be as it be private in caesar 's army they do no more than flank the pageant nor may the pantry hold too many secret within reason everything should be set out at once or at least a gossip of its come should run before otherwise if the stew be savory how shall one reserve a corner for the custard one must partition himself justly -- else by a over-stowage at the end he list and sink i be partial to picnic -- the spreading of the cloth in the wood or beside a stream -- although i be not avid for sandwich unless hunger press I rather let there be a skillet in the company and let a fire be start nor need a picnic consume the day in summer it require but the late afternoon with such borrowing of the night as be necessary for the journey home you leave the street car clank with you bundle like a itinerant tinman you follow a stream which on these lower stretch it be sad to say be already infect with the vice of the city like many a countryman who have come to town it have fall to dissipation it show the mark of the bottle further up its course be cleaner you cross it in the mud be it not christian who fall into the bog because of the burden on he back then you climb a villainously long hill and pop out upon a open platform above the city the height command a prospect to the west below be the smoke of a thousand supper up from the city there come the hum of life now somewhat fall with the traffic of the day -- as though nature already practice the tune for send she creature off to sleep you light a fire the basket disgorge they secret ant and other leviathan think evidently that a circus have come or that bear be in the town the chop and bacon achieve they appoint destiny you throw the last bone across you shoulder it slip and rattle to the river the sun set night like a ancient dame put on she jewel : and now that i have climb and win this height i must tread downward through the sloping shade and travel the bewildered track till night yet for this hour i still may here be stay and see the gold air and the silver fade and the last bird fly into the last light by these confession you will see how unfit i be to comment on the old cook book of sir kenelm digby yet it lie before I it may have escape you memory in the din of other thing that in the time when oliver cromwell still walk the earth there live in england a man by the name of kenelm digby who be renown in astrology and alchemy piracy wit philosophy and fashion it appear that wherever learn wag its bulbous head sir kenelm be of the company it appear also that wherever the mahogany do most groan wherever the posset be spice most delicately to the nose there too do sir kenelm bib and tuck himself with profundity as though he suck wisdom from its lowest depth he spout forth on the transmutation of the baser metal or toss you a phrase from paracelsus or with long instructive finger he dissertate on the celestial universe one would have think that he have stand by on the making of it and that he judgment have prevail in the larger problem yet he do not neglect he trencher and now as time go on the richness of the food do somewhat dominate he person the girth of he wisdom grow no less but he body fatten in a word the good gentleman 's palate come to vie with he intellect less often be he engage upon some dark saying of isidore of seville rather even if he favorite topic astrology be uppermost about the table he eye travel to the pantry on every change of dish he finger too come to curl most delicately on he fork he use it like a epicure poke he viand apart for sharpest scrutiny he nod upon a compote be much esteem now mark he further decline on a occasion -- surely the old rascal 's head be turn -- he would be find in private talk with he hostess the lady of middlesex or with the countess of monmouth not as you might expect on the property of fire or on the mortal disease of man but -- on subject quite remove society we may be sure begin to whisper of these snug parley in the arbor after dinner these shadowed mumbling on the balcony when the moon be up -- and lady digby stiffen into watchfulness it be when they take leave that she see the countess slip a note into she lord 's finger she jealousy break out viper she spit the word and seize she husband 's wrist of course the note be read it prove however that sir kenelm be innocent of all mischief to the disappointment of the gossip who be tune to a spicier anticipation the note be no more than a recipe of the manner that the countess be use to mix she syllabub with instruction that it be the rosemary a little bruised and the limon-peal that do quicken the taste advice also follow in the postscript on the making of tea with counsel that the boiling water should remain upon it just so long as one might say a _ miserere _ a mutual innocence be now establish the lady digby do by way of apology peck the countess on the cheek sir kenelm die in 1665 full of year in that day he fame rest chiefly on he book in physic and chirurgery he most enduring work be still to be publish -- the closet open it be two year after he death that he son come upon a bundle of he father 's papers that have hitherto be overlook i fancy that he go spy in the attic on a rainy day in the darkest corner behind the rock horse -- if such device be know in those distant day -- he come upon a trunk of he father 's papers od 's fish say sir kenelm 's son here be a box of manuscript it be like that they pertain to alchemy or chirurgery he pull out a bundle and hold it to the light -- such light as come through the cobweb of the ancient window here be strange matter he exclaim then he read aloud : my lord of bristol 's scotch collop be thus make : take a leg of fine sweet mutton that to make it tender be keep as long as possible may be without stink in winter seven or eight day -- ho ho cry sir kenelm 's son this be not alchemy he draw out another parchment and read again : my lord of carlile 's sack posset how it be make : take a pottle of cream and boil in it a little whole cinnamon and three or four flake of mace boil it until it simpreth and bubbleth by this time as you may well imagine sir kenelm 's son be work to a excitement it be likely that he inherit he father 's palate and that the juice of he appetite be stir seize a armful of the papers he leap down the attic step three at a time he lady mother thrust a curl and paper head from she door and ask whether the chimney be afire but he do not heed she the cook be waddle in she patten he cry to she to throw wood upon the fire that night the digby household be serve a delicacy red herring broil in the fashion of my lord d'aubigny short and crisp and lay upon a sallet also there be a wheaten flommery as it be make in the west country -- for the cook choose quite at random -- and a slip-coat cheese as master phillip proportion it also against the colic which be ravish the country the cook prepare a metheglin as lady stuart mixed it -- nettle fennel and grumel seed of each two ounce be small-cut and mixed with honey and boil together it be on record that the lady digby smile for the first time since she lord have die and when the grin cook bear in the platter she beat upon the table with she spoon the follow morning sir kenelm 's son post to london bear the recipe with a pistol in the pocket of he great coat against the cross of hounslow heath he go to a printer at the star in little britain whose name be h brome shortly the book appear it be the son who write the preface : there need no rhetoricating floscule to set it off the author as be well know have be a person of eminency for he learning and of exquisite curiosity in he research even that incomparable sir kenelme digbie knight fellow of the royal society and chancellor to the queen mother -lrb- et omen in nomine -rrb- he name do sufficiently auspicate the work the sale of the book be not record it be suppose that the lady middlesex so many of whose recipe have be use direct that she chair be carry to the shop where the book be for sale and that she buy largely of it the countess of dorset buy a copy and spell it out word for word to she cook as for the lady monmouth she buy not a single copy which neglect on come to the digby arouse a coolness to this day it be likely that a last auspicated volume still sit on its shelf with the spice jar in some english country kitchen and that a worn and toothless cook still thumb its leaf if the guest about the table be of a antique mind still will they pledge one another with its honeyed drink still will they pipe and whistle of its virtue still will they -- eat -- a flare sign hang above the sidewalk by this time in we noonday search for food we have come into the thick of the restaurant in the jungle of the city here be the feeding place here come the growl biped for such bone and mess as be throw they the waiter thrust a card beneath my nose nice leg of lamb sir i wave he off hold a bit i cry you 'll fetch I a capon in white broth as my lady monmouth broileth hers put plentiful sack in it and boil it until it simpreth the waiter scratch he head the chicken pie be good he say it be we Wednesday dish varlet i cry -- then soften let it be the chicken pie but if the cook knoweth the manner that lord carlile do mix and pepper it let that manner be follow to the smallest fraction of a pinch on buy old book by some slim chance reader you may be the kind of person who on a visit to a strange city make for a bookshop of course you slight temporal business may detain you in the earlier hour of the day you sit with committee and stroke you profound chin or you spend you talent in the market or run to and fro and wag you tongue in persuasion or if you be on a holiday you strain yourself on the sight of the city against be catch in a omission the bolder feature of a cathedral must be grasp to satisfy a quiz neighbor lest he shame you later on you hearth a building must be stuff inside you memory or you pilgrim foot must wear the pavement of a ancient shrine however these duty be do and the afternoon have not yet decline do you not seek a bookshop to regale yourself doubtless we have meet as you have scrunch against the shelf not to block the passage but with you head throw back to see the title up above you have notice at the corner of you eye -- unless it be one of you blinder moment when you be fix wholly on the shelf -- a man in a slightly fade overcoat of mixed black and white a man just past the nimbleness of youth whose head be pluck of its full commodity of hair it be myself i admit the portrait though modesty have curb I short of justice doubtless we have meet it be you umbrella -- which you hold villainously beneath you arm -- that take I in the rib when you light on a set of fuller 's worthy you recall my sour look but it be because i have myself linger on the volume but cool at the price how you smooth and finger they with what triumph you bear they off i bid you -- for i see you in a slippered state ease and unbutton after dinner -- i bid you turn the page with a slow thumb not to miss the slightest tang of they humor you will of course go first because of its broad fame to the page on shakespeare and ben jonson and they wet-combat at the mermaid but before the night be too far go and while yet you can hold yourself from nod you will please read about captain john smith of virginium and he strange performance the scene whereof be lay at such a distance they be cheaper credit than confute in no proper sense be i a buyer of old book i admit a bookish quirk maybe a love of the shelf a weakness for morocco especially if it be stain with age i will indeed shirk a wedding for a bookshop i 'll go in just to look about a bit to see what the fellow have and on a occasion i pick up a volume but i be innocent of first edition it be a stiff courtesy as become a democrat that i bestow on this form of primogeniture of course i have nose my way with pleasure along aristocratic shelf and flip out volume here and there to ask they price but for the greater part it be the plainer shop that engage I if a rack of book be offer cheap before the door with a fix price upon a card i come at a trot and if a brown dust lie on they i bow and sniff upon the rack as though the past like a ancient fop in peruke and buckle be give I the courtesy of its snuff box if i take the dust in my nostril and chance to sneeze it be the fit and intended observance toward the manners of a former century i have in mind such a bookshop in bath england it present to the street no more than a decent front but open up behind like a swollen bottle there be twenty room at least pile together with such confusion of black passage and wind step that one might think that the owner himself must hold a thread when he visit the remoter room indeed such be the obscurity and dim turning of the place that be the legend of the minotaur but english you might fancy that the creature still live in this labyrinth to nip you between he toothless gum -- for the beast grow old -- at some darker corner there be a story of the place that once a raw clerk have be send to rummage in the basement he candle tip off the shelf he be leave in so complete darkness that he fear overcome he judgment and for two hour he roam and babble among the barrel nor be he absence discover until the end of the day when as be the custom the clerk count nose at the door when they find he he bolt up the step nor do he cease he whimper until he have reach the comforting twilight of the outer world he serve thereafter in the shop a full two year and have a beard come -- so the story run -- before he would again venture beyond the third turning of the passage to the stunting of he scholarship for the deeper book lay in the farther winding or it may appear credible that in age past a jealous builder contrived the place have no learning himself and be at odds with those of better opportunity he twist the pattern of the house such be he evil temper that he set the step at a dangerous hazard in the dark in order that scholar -- whose eye be blear at best -- might risk they leg to the end of time those of strict orthodoxy have even suspect the builder to have be a atheist for they have observe what double joint and step and turning confuse the passage to the devouter book -- the early father in particular be up a wind stair where even the soberest reader might break he neck be these thing as they may leather binding in set of grenadier uniformity ornament the upper and lighter room biography straggle down a hallway with a candle need at the farther end a room of dingy play -- wycherley congreve and they crew -- look out through a area grate it be through even so foul a eye that when alive they look upon the world as for theology except for the before-mentioned father it sit in general and dusty convention on the landing to the basement its snuffy sermon by a sad misplacement -- or be there a ironical intention -- point the way to the eternal abyss below it be in this shop that i inquire whether there be publish a book on piracy in cornwall now i have lately come from tintagel on the cornish coast and as i have climb upon the rock and look down upon the sea i have wonder to myself whether if the knowledge be put out before I i could compose a story of spanish treasure and pirate for i be a prey to such giddy ambition a foul street -- if the building slant and topple -- will set I think delightfully of murder a wharf-end with water lapping underneath and bit of rope about will set I itch for a deep-sea plot or if i go on broader range and see in my fancy a broken castle on a hill i 'll clear its moat and sound trumpet on its wall if there be pepper in my mood i 'll storm its dungeon or in a softer moment i 'll trim its unsubstantial tower with pageantry and rest upon my elbow until i fall asleep so be cast upon the rugged cornish coast whose cliff be so sweep with winter wind that the village sit for comfort in the hollow it be to be expect that my thought would run toward pirate there be one rock especially which i have climb in the rain and fog of early morning a reckless path go across its face with a sharp pitch to the ocean it be so slippery and the wind so tug and pull to throw I off that although i endanger my dignity i play the quadrup on the narrower part but once on top in the open blast of the storm and safe upon the level i thump with desire for a plot in each inlet from the ocean i see a pirate lugger -- such be the please word -- with a keg of rum set up each cranny lead to a cavern with doubloon pile inside the very tempest in my ear be compound out of ship at sea and wreck and pillage i need but a plot a thread of action to string my villain on if this be once contrived i would spice my text with sailor ' oath and such boast talk as might lie in my invention could i but come upon a plot i might yet proclaim myself a author with this guilty secret in I i blush as i ask the question it seem sure that the shopkeeper must guess my purpose i feel myself suspect as though i be a rascal buying pistol to commit a murder indeed i seem to remember have read that even harden criminal have become confuse before a shopkeeper and betray themselves of course dick turpin and jerry abershaw could call for pistol in the same easy tone they order ale but it would take a practiced villainy but i in my innocence want nothing but the meager outline of a pirate 's life which i might fatten to my use but on a less occasion when there be no plot thumping in I i still feel a kind of embarrassment when i ask for a book out of the general demand i feel so like a odd stick this embarrassment apply not to the request for other commodity i will order a collar that be quite outside the fashion in a high-pitched voice so that the whole shop can hear i could bargain for a purple waistcoat -- do my taste run so -- and though the sidewalk listen it would not draw a blush i have trade even for woman 's garment -- though this do strain I -- without a outward twitch finally to top my valor i have buy sheet music of the lighter kind and have pronounce the softest title so that all could hear but if i desire the poem of lovelace or the play of marlowe i sidle close up to the shopkeeper to get he very ear if the book be visible i point my thumb at it without a word it be but the other day -- in order to fill a gap in a paper i be write -- i desire to know the name of a author who be obscure although he work have be translate into nearly all language i want to know a little about the life of the man who write _ mary have a little lamb _ which i be tell be know by child over pretty much all the western world it need only a trip to the public library any attendant would direct I to the proper shelf yet once in the building my courage ooze my question though serious seem too ridiculous to be ask i would sizzle as i meet the attendant 's eye of a consequence i fumble on my own device possibly to the increase of my general knowledge but without gain what i seek they have no book in the bath shop on piracy in cornwall i be offer instead a work in two volume on the notorious highwayman of history and for a moment my plot swerve in that direction but i put it by to pay the fellow for he pain -- for he have dig in barrel to he shoulder and have a smudge across he nose -- i buy a copy of thomson 's castle of indolence and in my more energetic mood i read it and so i come away on leave the shop lest i should be nip in a neglect i visit the roman bath then i take the water in the assembly room it be sam weller you may recall who remark when he be entertain by the select footman that the water taste like warm flat-iron finally i view the crescent around which the shirted winkle run with the valorous dowler breathing on he neck with such distraction as you may well imagine cornish pirate become as naught such mental vibration as i have be now go toward a tale of fashion in the day when queen anne be still alive of a consequence i again seek the bookshop and stifle my timidity i demand such volume as might set I most agreeably to my task i have in mind also a bookshop of small pretension in a town in wale for purely secular delight maybe it be too largely compose of methodist sermon hell fire burn upon its shelf with a warmth to singe so poor a worm as i yet its signboard pop its welcome when i have walk ten mile of sunny road possibly it be the chair rather than the divinity that keep the place in memory the owner be absent on a errand and he daughter who have be clump about the kitchen on my arrival be uninstructed in the price mark so i read and fan myself until he return perhaps my sluggishness toward first edition -- to which i have hint above -- come in part from the acquaintance with a man who in a linguistic outburst as i meet he pronounce himself to be a numismatist and philatelist one only of these name would have satisfy a man of less conceit it be as though the pteranodon should claim also to be the spoon-bill dinosaur it be against modesty that one man should summon all the letter no the numismatist 's head be not cram with the mystery of life and death nor be a philatelist one who be possess with the dimmer secret of eternity rather this man who be so swell with title eke a living by sell coin and stamp and he be on he way to europe to replenish he wares inside he waistcoat just above he liver -- if he own so human a appendage -- he carry a magnifying glass with this when the business fit be on he he count the line and dot upon a stamp the perforation on its edge he catalogue its volute its stipple the frisk and curling of its pattern he have number the very hair on the head of george washington for in such minutiae do the value of the stamp reside do a single hair spring up above the count it would invalidate the issue such value get by circumstance or accident -- rest on a flaw -- found on a speck -- cause no ferment of my desire for the buying of book it be the cheaper shop where i most often prowl there be in london a district around chare cross road where almost every shop have book for sale there be a continuous rack along the sidewalk each title beckon for you attention you recall the class of street-reader of whom charle lamb write -- poor gentry who not have wherewithal to buy or hire a book filch a little learning at the open stall it be on some such street that these folk practice they innocent larceny if one shopkeeper frown at the diligence with which they read clarissa they would continue she distressing adventure across the way by a linger progress up the street sir charle grandison might be nibble down -- by such as have the stomach -- without the outlay of a single penny as for gibbon and the bulbous historian though a whole perusal would outlast the summer and stretch to the colder month yet with patience they could be get through however before the end be come even a hasty reader whose eye be nimble on the page would be blow on he nail and pull he tail between he and the November wind but the habit of reading at the open stall be not only with the poor you will remember that mr brownlow be addict really have not the artful dodger steal he pocket handkerchief as he be thus engage upon he book the whole history of oliver twist must have be quite different and pepy himself samuel pepys fr be guilty to paul 's church yard he write and there look upon the second part of hudibra which i buy not but borrow to read such parsimony be the curse of author to thumb a volume cheaply around a neighborhood be what keep they in they garret it be a less offence to steal peanut from a stand also it be record in the life of beau nash that the person of fashion of he time to pass a tedious morning do divert themselves with reading in the bookseller ' shop we may conceive mr fanciful fopling in the sleepy blink of those early hour before the pleasure of the day have make a start inquire between he yawn what latest novel have come down from london or whether a new part of pamelum be offer yet if the post be in he will prop himself against the shelf and -- unless he glaze and nod -- he will read cheaply for a hour or my lady betty have take the water in the pump-room and lend she ear to such gossip as be abroad so early be now hand to she chair and go round by gregory 's to read a bit she be flounce to the width of the passage indeed until the fashion shall abate those more solid author that be set up in the rear of the shop must remain during she visit in general neglect though she hold herself against the shelf and tilt she hoop it would not be possible to pass she be absorb in a book of the softer sort and she flip its page against she lap-dog 's nose but now behold the student come up the street he be clothe in shine black he be thin of shank as become a scholar he sag with knowledge he hunger after wisdom he come opposite the bookshop it be but coquetry that he eye seek the window of the tobacconist he heart you may be sure look through the button at he back at last he turn he pause on the curb now desire have clutch he he jiggle he trousered shilling he tread the gutter he squint upon the rack he light upon a treasure he pluck it forth he be unresolved whether to buy it or to spend the extra shilling on he dinner now all you cook together to save you business rattle you pan to rouse he if within these ancient building there be onion ready peel -- quick -- throw they in the skillet that the whiff may come beneath he nose chance tremble and cast its vote -- eenie meenie -- down go the shilling -- he have buy the book tonight he will spread it beneath he candle foot may beat a snare of pleasure on the pavement glad cry may pipe across the darkness a fiddle may scratch its invitation -- all the rumble note of midnight traffic will tap in vain they summons upon he window any stick will do to beat a dog reader possibly on one of you country walk you have come upon a man with he back against a hedge torment by a fiend in the likeness of a dog you yourself of course be not a coward you possess that cornerstone of virtue a love for animal if at you heel a dog sniff and growl you humor he mistake you flick he off and proceed with unbroken serenity it be scarcely a interlude to you speculation on the market or if you work upon a sonnet and be in the vein you thought despite the beast run unbroken to a rhyme but pity this other whose heart be less stoutly wrap he have go forth on a holiday to take the country air to thrust himself into the freer wind to poke with he stick for such sign of spring as may be hide in the winter 's leaf have be grind in a office he fling himself on the great round world he have come out to smell the earth or maybe he seek a hilltop for a view of the field that lie below patch in many color as though nature have be sew at she garment and have mend the cloth from she bag of scrap on such a journey this fellow be travel when at a turn of the road he hear the sound of bark as yet there be no dog in sight he pause he listen how shall one know whether the sound come up a wrathful gullet or whether the dog bay at he impersonally as at the distant moon or maybe he vent himself upon a stubborn cow surely it be not a idle tune he practice he hold a victim in he mind there be sour venom on he churlish tooth be it best to go roundabout or forward with such a nice compound of innocence boldness and modesty as shall satisfy the beast if one engross oneself on something that lie to the lee of danger it allay suspicion or if one absorb oneself upon the flora -- a primrose on the river 's brim -- it show he clear and stainless the stupidest dog should see that so close a student can have no evil in he perhaps it would be better to throw away one 's stick lest it make a show of violence or it may be conceal along the outer leg minister of grace defend we what a excitement in the barnyard have virtue no reward shall innocence perish off the earth not one dog but many come run out there have go a rumor about the barn that there be a stranger to be eat and it be likely -- if they keep they clamor -- there will be a bone for each note how the valor ooze from the man of peace observe he sidle gait he skirt pull close he hollow back he head bent across he shoulder he startled eye watch he mince he step lest a linger heel be nip listen to he try the foremost dog with name to gull he to a belief that they have meet before in happier circumstance he appeal mutely to the farmhouse that a recall be sound the window be tightly curtain the heaven be comfortless you remember the fellow in the play who would have love war have they not dig villainous saltpetre from the harmless earth the countryside too in my opinion would be more peaceful of a summer afternoon be it not overrun with dog let I be plain i myself like dog -- sleepy dog blinking in the firelight friendly dog with wag tail young dog in they first puppyhood with they tooth scarce sprout whose jaw have not yet burgeon into danger and old dog too who sun themselves and give forth hollow toothless reassuring sound when a dog assume the cozy habit of the cat without lay off he nobler nature he be my friend a dog of vegetarian aspect please I let he bear a mild eye as though he be nourish on the softer food i would wish every dog to have a full complement of tail it be the sure barometer of he warm regard there be no art to find he mind 's construction in the face and i would have he with not too much curiosity it be a quality that bring he too often to the gate it make he prone to sniff when one sit upon a visit nor do i like dog addict to sudden excitement lethargy become they better let they be without the gallic grace in general i like a dog to whom i have be properly introduce with a exchange of credentials while the dog be by let he master take my hand and address I in softest tone to cement the understanding at bench-show i love the beast although i keep to the middle of the aisle the street be all the safer when so many of the creature be keep within frankly i would enjoy the country more if i know that all the dog be away on visit of course the highroad be quite safe its frequent traffic be its insurance then too the barn be at such a distance it be only a monstrous anger can bring the dog but if you be in need of direction you select a friendly white house with green shutter you swing open the gate and crunch across the pebble to the door to the nearer eye there be a look of dog about the place or maybe you be hot and thirsty and there be a well at the side of the house be it better to gird yourself to danger or to put off you thirst until the crossroads where pop be sell or a lane lead down to the river even at this distance you hear the shallow brawl of water on the stone a path go off across a hill with tree beckon at the top there be a wind above and a wider sweep of cloud surely from the crest of the hill the whole county will lie before you such tune as come up from the world below -- a school-bell a rooster crow child laugh on the road a threshing machine on the lower meadow -- such tune be pitch to a marvellous softness shall we follow the hot pavement or shall we dare those lonely stretch there be a kind of person who be steep too much in valor he will cross a field although there be a dog inside the fence goodness know that i would rather keep to the highroad with such humility as shall not rouse the creature or he will shout and whistle tune that stir the dog for mile he slash he stick against the weed as though in challenge one might think that he go about on unfeeling stalk instead of leg as child walk on stilt or that a former accident have clip he off above the knee and that he be now joint out of wood to a point beyond the bite limit or perhaps the clothes he wear beneath -- the inner mesh and very balbriggan of he attire -- be of so hard a texture that it turn a tooth be these defens as they may note with what bravado he mount the wall one leg dangle as though it be bait and be angle for a bite there be a french village near quebec whose population be chiefly dog it lie along the river in a single street not many mile from the point where wolfe climb to the plain of abraham there be a hundred house flat against the roadway and on the step of each there sit a dog as i go through on foot each of these dog pick I up examine I nasally and pass I on not generously as though i have stand the test but rather in deep suspicion that i be a queer fellow not to be penetrate at first but one who would surely be find out and gobble before come to the end of the street as long as i would eventually furnish forth the common banquet it matter not which dog take the first nip inasmuch as i would at last be garnish for the general tooth it would be better to wait until all be gather around the platter good neighbor dog each seem to say you too sniff upon the rogue if he be honest my old nose be much at fault meantime i padded lightly through the village at first call on the dog by english name but later use such wisp as i have of french aucassin mon pauvre chien voicus tintagile alor donc mon cherie je sui votre ami but with little effect but the dog that one meet in the canadian wood be of the fiercest breed they border on the wolf they be call husky and they be so strong and so fleet of foot that they pull sled for hour across the frozen lake at almost the speed of a run horse it must be confess that they be handsome and if it happen to be you potato peeling and discard fish that they eat they warm into friendliness indeed on these occasion one can make quite a show of bravery by stroke and deal lightly with they but once upon a time in a ignorant moment two other camper and myself follow a lonely railroad track and strike off on a path through the pine in search of a certain trapper on a fur farm the path go on a broken zigzag avoid fall tree and soft hollow conduct itself on the whole with more patience than firmness we walk a quarter of a mile but still we see no cabin the line of the railroad have long since disappear a eagle wheel above we and quarrel at we intrusion presently to test we course and learn whether we be come near the cabin we give a shout immediately out of the deeper wood there come a clamor that freeze we such sound it seem could issue only from bloody and drip jaw in a panic as by a common impulse we turn and run yet we do not run frankly as when the circus lion be loose but in a shamefaced manner -- a attempt at a retreat in good order -- something between a walk and a run at the end of a hundred yard we stop no dog have fall on we danger have not burst its kennel we halloo again to rouse the trapper at last after a minute of suspense come he answering voice the sweetest sound to be imagine whereupon i come down from my high stump which i have climb for a longer view i be convince that i be not alone in my -- shall i say diffidence -- toward dog indeed there be evidence from the oldest time that mankind in its more honest moment have confess to a fear of dog in recognition of this general fear the unmuzzled cerberus be put at the gate of hade it be rightly feel that when the unhappy pilgrim get within he fifty snap head be better than a bolt upon the door it be better for they to endure the ill they have than be nip in the upper passage he also who first speak the ancient proverb _ let sleep dog lie _ do no more than voice the caution of the street and he also who invent the say that the world be go to the bow-wow lodge he deplorable pessimism in fitting word it be daniel who sit with the lion but there be degree of bravery on long street within sight of my window -- just where the street get into its most tangled traffic -- there have hang for many year the paint signboard of a veterinary surgeon its artist be in the first flourish of youth old age have not yet chill he when he mix he gaudy color the surgeon 's name be set up in modest letter but the horse below flame with color what a flare nostril what a eager eye how arch the neck here be a wrath and speed unknown to the quadruped of this present long street such mild-eyed accumbent sharp-ribbed horse as now infest the curb -- mere whittling from a larger age -- hang they head at they degeneracy indeed these horse seem to they owner not to be worth the price of a nostrum if disease settle in they let they lean against a post until the fit be past and of a consequence the doctor 's work have fall off it have become a rare occasion when it be permit he to stroke he chin in contemplation of some inner palsy therefore to give he wisdom scope the doctor some time since announce the cellar of the building to be a hospital for dog must i press the analogy i have see the doctor with bowl and spoon in hand take leave of the cheerful world he open the cellar door a curdling yelp come up the stair in the abyss below there be twenty dog at least all of they sick all dangerous not since orion lead he hunting pack across the heaven have there be so fierce a sound the door close there be a final yelp such as greet a bone doubtless by this time they be munch on the doctor good sir have you live in pre-apostolic day you name would have be line with daniel 's in the hymn i might have spend my earliest treble in you praise but there be other kind of dog gentlest of reader have you ever pass a few day at tunbridge well it lie on one of the road that run from london to the channel and for several hundred year person have go there to take the water against the more fashionable ailment its chief fame be in the day when rich folk to ward off for the season a touch of ancestral gout travel down from london in they coach we may fancy lord

old lady whose husband -- to judge by the black lace cap -- have leave lombard street for heaven at the hotel where i stop which be at the top of the common outside the thicker town i be the only man in the breakfast room two widow each with a tiny dog on a chair beside she sit at the next table this be they conversation : do you hear she last night be it flossie that i hear yes the poor dear be awake all night she get she foot wet yesterday when i let she run upon the grass but after breakfast -- if the day be sunny and the wind sit in a favor quarter -- one by one the widow go forth in they

god of puppy will again be good to she road of morning my grandfather 's farm lay somewhere this side of the sunset so near that its pasture barely miss the splash of color but from the city it be a two hour ' journey by horse and phaeton my grandfather drive i sit next my foot swing clear of the lunchbox my brother have the outside a place deny to I for fear that i might fall across the wheel when we be all set my mother make a last dab at my nose -- a unheeded smudge have escape my vigilance then my grandfather say get up -- twice for the lazy horse choose to regard the first summons as a jest we start the great wheel turn my brother lean across the guard to view the miracle we crunch the gravel we be alive for excitement my brother play we be a steamboat and toot i toot in imitation but higher up as if i be a younger sort of steamboat we hold we hand on a imaginary wheel and steer we scorn grocery cart and all such harbor craft we be on a long cruise street light will guide we sail home of course there be farm to the south of the city and apple may have ripen there to as fine a flavor and to the east also doubtless there be farm it would be ask too much that the west should have all the haystack cherry tree and cheese house if you judgment skim upon the surface you would even have find the advantage with the south it be prettier because more roll it be shaggier the country to the south tip up to the hill so sharply in place that it might have make its living by collect nickel for the slide indeed one might think that a part of the city have come bounce down the slope for now it lay rest at the bottom sprawled somewhat for its ease or it might appear -- if you belief run on discard line -- that the whole flat-bottomed earth have be foul in its celestial course and now lay aslant upon its beam with its cargo shift and spill about the city street that lead to the south which in those day end in lane pop out of sight abruptly at the top of the first ridge and when the earth catch up again with they level already it be dim and purple and tall tree be no more than a roughen hedge but what lay beyond that range of hill -- what town and city -- what ocean and forest -- how beset with adventure -- how fearful after dark -- these thing you could not see even if you climb to some high place and strain yourself on tiptoe and if you walk from breakfast to lunch -- until you gnaw within and be but a hollow drum -- there would still be a higher range against the sky there be misty kingdom on this whirling earth but the way be long and steep the lake lay to the north with no land beyond the city to the east but to the west -- several mile outside the city as it then be and still beyond its clutch the country be cut by a wind river bottom with sharp edge of shale down this valley rocky river come brawl in the spring over-fed and quarrelsome later in the year -- its youthful appetite have catch a indigestion -- it shrink and waste to a shadow by August you could cross it on the stone the uproar of its former flood be mark upon the shale and trunk of tree here and there be wedge but now the river play drowsy tune upon the stone there be scarcely enough movement of water to flick the sunlight a leaf on its idle current be a lazy craft whose skipper nod there be hickory tree on the point above may-apple grow in the deep wood and blackberry along the fence and in the season sober horse plow up and down the field with nod head affirm they belief in the goodness of the soil and they willingness to help in its fruition yet the very core of this valley in day past be a certain depth of water at a turn of the stream there be a clay bank above it and on it small naked boy stand and daub themselves one of they put a band of clay about himself by way of decoration another by a more general smudge make himself a hottentot and thereby give he manners a wider scope and license but by daub yourself entire you become a indian and might vent yourself in hideous yell for it be amazing how the lung grow stouter when the clay be lay on thick then you tap you flatten palm rapidly against you mouth and release a intermittent uproar in order that the valley might he warn of the deviltry to come you circle round and round and beat upon the ground in the likeness of a war dance but at last sate with scalp off you dive into the pool and come up a white man finally you stand on one leg and jounce the water from you ear or pull a bloodsucker from you toe before he sap you life -- for this tiny creature of the rock be credit with the gift of prodigious inflation and might inhale you blood sinew suspenders and all if leave to he ugly purpose farm should not be too precisely located at least this be true of farm which like my grandfather 's hang in a mist of memory i read once of a wonderful spot -- quite inferior doubtless to my grandfather 's farm -- which be locate by evil direction intentionally to throw a seeker off munchausen you will recall in the placing of he magic country be not above this agreeable villainy robinson crusoe be loose and vague in the placing of he island it be say that izaak walton wave a hand obscurely toward the stream where he have make a catch but could not be corner to a nice direction lest he pool be overrun in early youth i myself go on a mischievous hint to explore a remote region which i be tell lay in the dark behind the kindling pile but because i move in a fearful darkness quite beyond the pale light from the furnace room i lose the path it do not lead I to the peak and the roar water but the farm be reach by more open method dolly and the phaeton be the chief instrument first -- if you be so sink in ignorance as not to know the road -- you inquire of everybody for the chew gum factory to be know by its smell of peppermint then you seek the high bridge over the railroad track beyond be kamm 's corner here at a turn of the road be a general store whose shelf sample the produce of this whole fair world and the factory thereof one might have think that the proprietor emulate noah at the flood by bidding two of each create thing to find a place inside beyond kamm 's corner you come to the great valley when almost down the hill you pass a house with broken window and unkept grass this house by report be haunt but you could laugh at such tale while the morning sun be up at the bottom of the hill a bridge cross the river with loose plank that rattle as though the man who make nail be dead beyond the bridge at the first rise of ground the horse stop -- for i assume that you drive a sagacious animal -- by way of hint that every one of sound limb get out and walk to the top of the hill a suspicious horse turn he head now and again and cast he eye upon the buggy to be sure that no one climb in again presently you come to the toll-gate at the top and pay its keeper five cent or whatever large sum he demand then you grandfather -- if by fortunate chance you happen to have one -- ask after he wife and child and have they miss the croup then tell he he corn be look well my grandfather -- for it be time you know he -- live with we because of a railway accident fifteen year before in which one of he leg be cut off just below the knee he have retire from public office several year of broken health have be follow by year that be for the most part free from suffer my own first recollection revert to these better year i recall a tall man -- to my eye a giant for he be taller even than my father -- who come into the nursery as i be be undressed there be a wind in the chimney and the window rattle he put he crutch against the wall then take I in he arm he swing I aloft to he shoulder by a series of somersault i cry this first time but later i come to demand the performance once when i be a little older i come upon one of he discard wooden leg as i be play in the garret of the house it be my first acquaintance with such a contrivance it lay behind a pile of trunk and i be at the time on my way to the center of the earth for the cheerful path dive into darkness behind the chimney you may imagine my surprise i approach it cautiously i view it from all side by such dusty light as fall between the trunk not without fear i touch it it be unmistakably a leg -- but whose be it possible that there be a kind of bluebeard in the family who for he pleasure lop off leg there have be no breath of such a scandal yet if my reading and study be correct such thing have happen in other family not very different from ours not in we own town maybe but in such near-by place as kandahar and serendib -- place which in my warm regard be but as suburb to we street to be gain if you persevere for a hundred lamp-post or could the leg belong to annie the cook she nimbleness with griddle-cake belie the thought : and once when the wind have swish she skirt manifestly she be whole and sound then all at once i know it to be my grandfather 's grown familiar i pull it to the window i try it on but make bad work of walk to the eye my grandfather have two leg all the way down and except for he crutch and a occasional squeak you would not have detect he infirmity evidently the maker do no more than imitate nature although for myself i use to wonder at the poverty of he invention there would be distinction in a leg which in addition to its usual function would also bend forward at the knee or have a surprising sidewise joint -- and there would be profit too if one care to make a show of it the greatest niggard on the street would pay two pin for such a sight as my grandfather be the only old gentleman of my acquaintance a wooden leg seem the natural and suitable accompaniment of old age person it appear in they riper year cast off a leg as tree drop they leaf but my grandmother puzzle I undeniably she retain both of hers yet she hair be just as white and she be almost as old evidently this law of nature work only with man lady it seem be not deciduous but how the amputation be effect in man -- whether by day or night -- how the choice fall between the right and leave -- whether the wooden leg come down the chimney -lrb- a proper entrance -rrb- -- how soon my father would go the way of all masculine flesh and cast he off -- these matter i could not solve the arabian night be silent on the subject aladdin 's uncle apparently have both he leg he be too brisk in villainy to admit a wooden leg but then he be only a uncle if he history run out to the end doubtless he would go with a limp in he riper day the story of the bible -- although it traffic in such veteran as methuselah -- give not a hint abraham die full of year here would have be a proper test -- but the book be silent my grandfather in those day have much leisure time he still keep a office at the rear of the house although he have give up the regular practice of the law but a few old client linger on chiefly woman who carry child in they arm and old man without necktie who come to he for free advice these he guide patiently in they trouble and he would sit a hour to listen to a piteous story in a extremity he give they money or take a well-meant but worthless note often he caller overrun the dinner hour and my mother would have to jingle the dinner bell at the door to rouse they occasionally he would be call on for a public speech and for several day he would be busy at he desk frequently he preside at dinner and would tell a story and sing a song for he have a fine bass voice and be famous for he singing he read much in those last year in science when he be not read trowbridge to he grandchild it be huxley to himself but when he eye grow tired he would on a occasion -- if there be canning in the house -- go into the kitchen where my mother and grandmother work and help pare the fruit seriously as though he be engage upon a game he would cut the skin into thinnest strip unbroken to the end and would hold up the coil for we to see or if he break it in the cut it be a point against he in the contest he diversion rather than he profit be the care and rental of about twenty small house some of which he build to fit he pensioner my brother and myself often make the round with he in the phaeton at most of the house he be affectionately greet as jedge and be hold in long conversation across the fence and to see a irishman be to see a friend they all know he and say good mornin ' as we pass he and they be good democrat together i can see in memory a certain old irishman in a red flannel shirt with he foot upon the hub bend across the wheel and gesticulate in a endless discussion of politics or crop while my brother and i be impatient to be off dolly be of course patient for she have long since pass she fretful youth if by any biological chance it have happen that she have be a old lady instead of a horse she would have be the kind that spend she day in a rocker with she knit any one who give dolly a excuse for standing be she friend there she stand as though she wish the colloquy to last forever it be seldom that dolly lose she restraint she would indeed when she come near the stable somewhat hasten she stride and when we come on we drive to the turn point and at last head about for home dolly would know it and show she knowledge by a quicken of the ear and the quiver of a faint excitement yet dolly lose she patience when there be fly then she throw off all repression and so wave she tail that she regularly get it across the rein this stir my grandfather to something not far short of anger how vigorously would he try to dislodge the rein by pull and jerk dolly only clamp down she tail the harder experience show that the only way be to go slowly and craftily and without heat or temper -- a slacken of the rein -- a distraction of dolly 's attention -- a lean across the dashboard -- a firm grasp of the tail out near the end -- a sudden raise thereof ah it be do we all settle back against the cushion or perhaps a friendly fly would come to we assistance and dolly would have to use she tail in another direction the whip be seldom use generally it stand in its socket it be ornamental like a flagstaff it forget its sterner function but dolly must have know the whip in some former life for even a gesture toward the socket rouse she if it be rattle she mend she pace for a block but if on a rare occasion my grandfather take it in he hand dolly lay one ear back in we direction for she know then he mean business and what a excitement would arise in the phaeton we hold on tight for fear that she might take it into she mild old head to run away but dolly have she moment one sunny summer afternoon while she graze peacefully in the orchard with she rein wind around the whip handle -- the appropriate place on these occasion -- she be evidently sting by a bee my brother be at the time regale himself in a near-by blackberry thicket he look up at a unusual sound without warn dolly have leap to action and be tear around the orchard drag the phaeton behind she she wreck the top on a low hang branch then hit another tree sever thereby all connection between herself and the phaeton and at last gallop down the lane to the farm house with the broken shaft and harness dangle behind she kipling 's dun with the mouth of a bell and the heart of hell and the head of the gallows-tree could hardly have show more spirit it be as though one brief minute of a glorious youth have come back to she it be a last spurting of a old flame before it sink to ash my grandfather give he leisure to he grandchild he carve for we with he knife with a especial knack for willow whistle he show we the color that lay upon the world when we look at it through one of the glass pendant of the parlor chandelier he sit by we when we play duck-on-the-rock he help we with we kite and give a superintendence to we toy it be true that he be superficial with tin-tag and do not know the difference in value between a steam engine tag -- the rarest of they all -- and a common climax but we forgive he as one forgive a friend who be ignorant of persian pottery he employ we as gardener and put a bounty on weed we water the lawn together turn by turn when i be no more than four year old he teach we to play casino with he -- and afterwards bezique how he cry out if he get a royal sequence with what excitement he announce a double bezique or if one of we seem about to score and lack but a single card how intently he contend for the last few trick to thwart we declaration and if we get it despite he lead of ace how gravely he squint on the card against deception with he glass forward on he nose when he take he afternoon nap and lay upon he back on the sofa in the sitting-room we make paper pin-wheel to see whether he breath would stir they this trick have come to he notice by a sudden awakening he sometimes thereafter play to be asleep and snore in such a mighty gust that the wheel spin he be like a dutch tempest against a windmill if a dime museum come to town we make a afternoon of it he take we to all the circus and give we we choice of side-show we walk up and down before the stretch of paint canvas balancing in we desire a sword-swallower against a indian princess most of the fat woman and all the dwarf that i have know come to my acquaintance when in company with my grandfather as a young man it be say he once run away from home to join a circus as a acrobat have acquire the trick of leap upon a run horse i fancy that he knack of throw we to he shoulder by a double somersault be a recollection of he early day you may imagine with what awe we look on he even though he now go on crutch he be the epitome of adventure the very salt of excitement it be better have he than a pirate in the house when the circus have go and life be drab he be we tutor in the art of turn cart-wheel and make hand-stand against the door and once when we be away from he he walk all morning about the garden and in he loneliness he gather into pile the pebble that we have drop i be too young to know my grandfather in he active day when he be prominent in public matter he broader ability be know to other but though more than twenty year have pass since he death i remember he tone of voice he walk he way of handle a crutch all he trick of speech and conduct as though he have just leave the room and i can think of nothing more beautiful than that a useful man who have face the world for seventy year and have do he part should come back in he old age to the nursery and be the playfellow of he grandchild but the best holiday be a trip to the farm this farm -- to which in we slow trot we have be so long a time in come -- lay for a mile on the upper land and its grain field and pasture look down into the valley the building however be set close to the road and fix they interest on such occasional wagon as creak by a switzer occupy the farm who own in addition to the more immediate member of he family a cuckoo clock whose weight hang on long cord which by Saturday night reach almost to the floor when i have sit at he table i have neglect cheese and the lesser food when the hour come near in order not to miss the cuckoo 's pop out and in the duller space when the door be shut i have fancy it sit in the dark and count the minute to itself the switzer 's specialty be the making of a kind of rubber cheese which one could learn to like in time of the process of its composition i can remember nothing except that when it be in the great press the whey run from its side but this may be common to all cheese i be once give a cup of this whey to drink and i brighten for until it be in my mouth i think it be buttermilk beyond be the spring-house with can of milk set in the cool water and with a trickle sound beneath the board from the spring-house there start those mysterious cow-path that lead down into the great gorge that cut the farm here be place so deep that only a bit of the sky show and here the stone be damp it be a place that seem to lie nearer to the confusion when the world be make and rock lay pile as though a first purpose have be break off and to follow a cow-path regardless of where it lead be in those day the essence of hazard though all the while from the pasture up above there come the flat safe tinkling of the bell the apple orchard -- where dolly be sting by the bee -- be set on a fine breezy place at the brow of the hill with the valley in full sight the tree themselves be old and decayed but they be gnarl and crotch for easy climbing and the apple -- in particular a russet -- mount to a delicacy on the other side of the valley a half mile off as a bird would fly be the building of a convent and if you wait you might hear the twilight bell to this day all distant bell come to my ear with a please softness as though they have be cast in a quieter world stone arrow-head be find in a near-by field as often as the farmer turn up the soil in plow and because of this a long finger of land that put off to the valley be call indian point here with a arm for pillow one might lie for a long hour on a sunny morning and watch the shadow of cloud move across the lowland a rooster crow somewhere far off -- surely of all sound the drowsiest a horse in a field below lift up its head and neigh the leaf practice a sleepy tune if one have the fortune to keep awake here he may lie and think the thought that be bear of sun and wind and now although it be not yet noon hunger rage in we the pancake the syrup the toast and the other incident of breakfast have disappear the way the rabbit vanish when the magician wave he hand the horrid polyphemus do not so crave he food and as yet there be no comforting sniff from the kitchen scrubbing and other secular matter engage the farmer 's wife there be as yet not a faintest gurgle in the kettle to divert ourselves we climb three tree and fall out of one be twelve o'clock never to come have time and the hour grow stagnant we eat apple and throw the core at the pig to hear he grunt be the great round sun stick have the day of joshua come again we walk a rail fence be it not yet noon shrewsbury clock itself -- repute by scholar the slowest of all possible clock -- could not so hold off i snag myself -- but it be nothing that show when i sit ah at last my grandfather be call from the house we run back and find that the lunch be ready and be lay upon a table with a red oil-cloth cover we apply ourselves silence the journey home start about five o'clock there be one game we always play each of we have wisely squint at the sky make a reckoning and guess where we would be when the sun set my grandfather might say the high bridge i name the sherman house but my brother be precise judge it to a fraction of a telegraph pole beyond a certain turn -- do we remember -- well it would be exactly sixteen telegraph pole further on what a excitement there be when the sun 's lower rim be already below the horizon we stand on we knee and look through the little window at the back of the phaeton with what suspicion we regard my grandfather 's driving or if dolly lag do it not raise a thought that she too be in the plot against we the sun set we cry out the victor the sky flame with color then deaden in the east the dusk be fall the road grow dark where run the road of night while there be light you can see the course they keep across the country -- the dust of horse ' foot -- a bridge -- a vagrant wind on a hill beyond all day long they be busy with the foot of man and woman and child shout then twilight come and the road lead home to supper and the curl smoke above the roof but at night where run the road it be dark beyond the candle 's flare -- where run the road of night my brother and i have become sleepy we lop over against my grandfather -- we awake with a start there be a gayly light horse-car jingle beside we the street light show we into harbor we be home at last the man of grub street come from he garret i have come to live this winter in new york city and by good fortune i have find room on a pleasant park this park which be but one block in extent be so set off from the thoroughfare that it bear chiefly the traffic that be proper to the place itself grocery cart jog around and throw out they wares laundry wagon be astir a little fat tailor on a occasion carry in a armful of newly press clothing with suspenders hang dog be take out to walk but be hold in leash lest a taste of liberty spoil they for a indoor life the center of the park be lay out with grass and tree and pebbled path and about it be a high iron fence each house have a key to the enclosure such social infection therefore as get inside the gate be of we own breeding in the sunny hour nurse and child air themselves in this grass plot here a gayly paint wooden velocipede be in fashion at this minute there be several pair of fat leg a-straddle this contrivance it be a velocipede as it be first make without pedal beau brummel -- for the velocipede date back to he -- may have walk forth to take the water at tunbridge well on a vehicle not far different but build to he greater stature there be also a trickle of dray and wagon across the park -- a mere leakage from the street as though the near-by traffic in the pressure have burst its pipe but only at morning and night when the city collect or discharge its people be the sidewalk fill then for a half hour the nozzle of the city play a full stream on we the park seem to be freer and more natural than the street outside a man go by gesticulate as though he practice for a speech a woman adjust she stock on the coping below the fence with the freedom of a country road a street sweeper patch to he office tune he slow work to fit the quiet surroundings boy skate by or cut swirl upon the pavement in the privilege of a playground my work -- if anything so pleasant and unforced can carry the name -- be do at a window that overlook this park be it not for several high building in my sight i might fancy that i live in one of the older square of london there be a look of thackeray about the place as though the osborne might be my neighbor a fat man who waddle off he step opposite if he would submit to a change of coat might be jo sedley start for he club to eat he chutney if only there be a crest above my bell-pull i might even expect becky sharp in for tea or occasionally i divert myself with the fancy that i be of a still older day and that i have walk in from lichfield -- i choose the name at hazard -- with a tragedy in my pocket to try my fortune be it not for the fashion of dress in the park below and some remnant of reason in myself i could in a wink moment persuade myself that my room be a garret and my pen a quill on such delusion before i issue on the street to seek my coffee-house i would adjust my wig and dust myself of snuff but for my exercise and recreation -- which for a man of grub street be necessary in the early hour of afternoon when the morning fire have fall -- i go outside the park i have a wide choice for my wanderings i may go into the district to the east and watch the child play against the curb if they pitch penny on the walk i be careful to go about for fear that i distract the throw or if the stone be mark for hop-scotch i squeeze along the wall it be my intention -- from which as yet my diffidence withhold I -- to present to the winner of one of these contest a red apple which i shall select at a corner stand or a ice wagon pause in its round and while the man be go there be a pleasant thieving of bit of ice each dirty cheek be stuff as though a plague of mumps have fall on the street or there may be a game of baseball -- a scamper on the basis a home-run down the gutter -- to engage I for a inning or shinny grip the street but if a street organ come -- not a mournful one-legged box eke out with a monkey but a big machine with a extra man to pull -- the child leave they game it be but the other day that i see six of they together dance on the pavement to the music with skirt and pigtail fly there be such gladness in they face that the musician although he already have he nickel give they a extra tune it be of such persuasive gayety that the number of dancer at once go up to ten and other wiggle to the rhythm and for myself although i be past my sportive day the sound of a street organ if any would inflame I to a fox-trot even a surly tune -- if the handle be quicken -- come from the box with a brisk seduction if a dirge once get inside it would fret until it come out a dancing measure in this part of town on the better street i sometimes study the fashion as i see they in the shop and i compare they with those of uptown store nor be there the difference one might suppose the small round muff that spring up this winter in the smarter shop win by only a week over the cheaper store tan gaiter run a pretty race and i be now witness to a dead heat in a certain kind of fluffy rosebud dress the fabric be probably different but no matter how you deny it they be cut to a common pattern in a poorer part of the city still nearer to the east river where smell of garlic and worse issue from cellarway i come recently on a considerable park it be supply with swing and teeter and draw child on its four front of a consequence the child of many race play together i catch a yiddish answer to a italian question i fancy that a child here could go forth at breakfast wholly a hungarian and come home with a smack of russian or armenian add the general game that merge the smaller group aid in the fusion if this park be not already name -- a small chance for it show the mark of age -- it might properly be call _ the park of the thirty nation _ or my inclination may take I to the lower city like a poor starveling i wander in the haunt of wealth where the building be pile to forty story and i spin out the cipher in my brain in a endeavor to compute the amount that be lay up inside also lest i become discontented with my poverty i note the strain and worry of the face that i meet there be a story of tolstous in which a man be whisper by he god that he may possess such land as he can circle in a day until that time he have be live on a fertile slope of sun and shadow with field ample for he need but when the whisper come at a flash he pelt off across the hill he run all morning but as the day advance he sordid ambition broaden and he turn he course into a wider and still wider circle here a pleasant valley tempt he and he bent he path to bring it inside he mark here a fruitful upland lead he off as the day wear on he run with a greater fierceness because he know he would lose everything if he do not reach he start place before the sun go down the sun be come near the rim of earth when he toil up the last hill he foot be cut by stone he face pinch with agony he stagger toward the goal and fall across it while as yet there be a glint of light but he effort burst he heart do the analogy hold on these narrow street to a few who sit in a inner office mammon have make a promise of wealth and domination these few run breathless to gain a mountain but what have the god whisper to the ten thousand who sit in the outer office that they bend and blink upon they ledger have the god whisper to they the promise of great wealth alas before they there lie only the dust and heat of a level road yet they too be break at the sunset less oppressive be the street where commerce be more apparent here unless you would be smirch it be necessary to walk fast and hold you coat-tail in packing case be go down slide bale be come up in hoist barrel be roll out of wagon crate be be lift in be the exchange never to stop be no warehouse satisfy with what it have english which until now you judge a soft concordant language show here its range and mastery of epithet and all about move and jostle the box be man with hook one might think that in a former day captain cuttle have settle here to live and that he numerous progeny have keep the place often i ride on a bus top like a maharajah on a elephant up near the tusk as it be where the view be unbroken i plan this trip so that i move counter to the procession that go uptown in the late afternoon be there a scene like it in the world the boulevard of pari in time of peace be hardly so gay fifth avenue be block with motor car fashion have go forth to select a feather a ringlet have go awry and must be mend the pomeranian 's health be serve by sunlight the spitz must have a airing fashion have wag its head upon a chinese vase -- have indeed squint at it through a lorgnette against a fleck -- and now loll home to dinner or style have veer a inch and it have be a day of fitting at restaurant window one may see the feeding of the over-fed man sit in club window and still wear they silk hat as though there be no glass between they and the windy world footman in boot and breeches sit as stiffly as though they be toy grow large and have metal spike below to hold they to they box they look like the iron fireman that ride on nursery fire-engine for all these sight the bus top be the best place and although we sit on a modest roof the shopkeeper cater to we for in many of the store be there not a upper tier of window for we use the commodity of this second story be quite as fine as those below and the waxen beauty who display the frock greet we in true democracy with as sweet a simper my friend g -- while ride recently on a bus top meet with a experience for which he still blush there be a young woman sit directly in front of he and when he come to leave a sudden lurch throw he against she when he recover he footing which be a business of some difficulty for the bus pitch upon a broken pavement what be he chagrin to find that a front button of he coat have hook in she back hair luckily g -- be not seize with a panic rather he labor cautiously -- but without result nor could she help in the disentanglement they embarrassment might have be indefinitely prolong -- indeed g -- be several block already down the street -- when he bethink he of he knife and so cut off the button as he pleasantly express it to the young woman he would give she the choice of the button or the coat entire reader be you incline toward ferry boat i can not include those person who journey on they night and morning perfunctorily these person keep they nose in they papers or sit snugly in the cabin if the market be up they can hardly be conscious even that they be cross a river nor do i entirely blame they if one keep shop on a breezy tip of the delectable mountain with all the region of the world lay out below he could not be expect to climb up for the hundredth time with a first exhilaration or to swing he alpenstock as though he be on a rare holiday if one have business across the styx too often -- although the scenery on its bank be repute to be unusual -- he might in time sit below and take to yawn father charon might have to jog he shoulder to rouse he when the boat come between the further pier but be you one of those person who not be under a daily compulsion ride upon a ferry boat for the love of the trip be in this class myself i lay my case the other night before the gateman and ask he advice regard route he at once enter sympathetically into my distemper and give I a plan whereby with but a single change of pier i might at a expense of fourteen cent cross the river four time at different angle it be at the end of day and a light fog rest on the water nothing be entirely lose yet a gray mystery wrap the ship and building if new jersey still exist it be dim and shadowy as though its real life have go and but a ghost remain ferry boat be light in defiance of the murk and dart here and there at reckless angle a ocean liner be put out and several tug have ram they nose against she side there be something engaging about a tug it snort with eagerness it kick and splash it burst itself to lend a hand and how it butt with its nose surely its forward cartilage be of triple strength else in its zest it would jam its nasal passage presently we come opposite lower new york although the fog conceal the outline of the building they light show through this first hour of dark be best before the day 's work be do and while as yet all of the window be light the woolworth tower be suffuse in a soft and shadowy light the other building show like mountain of magic pin-prick it be as though all the constellation of heaven on a general bidding have meet for conference the man of grub street have by this time somewhat dispel the fume of dullness from he head descend from he ferry boat and walk to he quiet park there be a dull roar from the elevated railway on third avenue where the last of the day 's crowd go home the sidewalk be become empty there be a sheen of water on the pavement in the winter murk there be a look of thackeray about the place as though the sedley or the osborne might be he neighbor if there be a crest above he bell-pull he might even expect becky sharp in for tea now that spring be here when the sun set last night it be still winter the person who pass northward in the dusk from the city 's tumult thrust they hand deep into they pocket and walk to a sharp measure but a change come in the night the north wind fall off and a breeze blow up from the south such star as be abroad at dawn leave off they shrill winter piping -- if it be true that star really sing in they course -- and pitch they voice to April tune one star in particular that hung low in the west until the day be up know surely that the spring have come and sing in concert with the earliest bird there be a dull belief that these early bird shake off they sleep to get the worm rather they come forth at this hour to cock they ear upon the general heaven for such new tune as the unfaded star still sing if a ear be turn down to the rummage of worm in the earth -- for to the superficial so do the attitude attest -- it be only that the other ear may be turn upward to catch the celestial harmony for bird know that if there be a untried melody in heaven it will sound first across the clear pasture of the dawn all the chirping and whistle from the field and tree be then but the practice of the hour when the meadowlark sing on a fence-rail she but con she lesson from the star it be on such a bright spring morning that the housewife duster in hand throw open she parlor window and look upon the street a pleasant park be below of the size of a city square and already it stir with the day 's activity the housewife beat she cloth upon the sill and as the dust fly off she hear the cry and noise of the place in a clear tenor she be admonish that there be a expert hereabouts to grind she knife a swarthy baritone on a wagon lift up he voice in praise of radish and carrot he eye rove along the window the crook of a hungry finger will bring he to a stand or a junkman be below upon he business yesterday the bell upon he cart would have sound sour but this morning they rattle agreeably as though a brisker cow than common springtime in she hoof be jangle to she pasture at the sound -- if you be of country training -- you see yourself somewhat misty through the year barefoot in a grassy lane with stick in hand urge the gentle beast there be a subtle persuasion in the junkman 's call in these tone do the magician bawl for old lamp beguile aladdin if there be this morning in my lodge a unrubbed lamp i would toss it from the window for such magic as he might extract from it and if a fair princess should be miss at the noon and she palace be skip from sight it will follow on the rubbing of it the call of red cherry in the park -- as you might guess from its italian source -- be set to a amorous tune what lady smock in morning cambric would not be woo by such a voice the gay fellow tempt she to a purchase it be but a decent caution -- now that spring be here -- that the rascal do not call he wares by moonlight as for early pea this morning it be pan himself who peddle they -- disguise and smirch lest he be catch in the deception -- pan who stamp he foot and shake the thicket -- whose habit be to sing with reedy voice of the green willow that dip in sunny water although he now clatter he tin and basket and cry out like a merchant he thought run to the black earth and the shady hollow and the sound of little stream i have wonder as i have observe the housewife linger at they window -- for my window also look upon the park -- i have wonder that these melodious street cry be not use generally for call the wares of wider sale if a radish can be so proclaimed there might be a lilt devise in praise of other please mercery -- a tripping pizzicato for lace and frippery -- a brave trumpet for some newest cereal and should not the latest book -- if it be a tale of love for these i be tell be best offer to the public in the spring -lrb- sad tale be best for winter -rrb- -- should not a tale of love be herald through the city by the singing of a ballad with a melting tenor in the part in old day a gaudy rogue cry out upon the broader street that juggler have stretch they rope in the market-place but when the bear come to town the news be pipe even to the narrowest lane that house-folk might bring they penny with my thought set on the spring i chance to walk recently where the theater be thickest it be on a Saturday afternoon and the walk be crowd with amusement seeker presently in the press i observe a queer old fellow carry on he back a monstrous pack of umbrella he ring a bell monotonously and profess himself a mender of umbrella he can hardly have expect to find a customer in the crowd even a blinking eye -- and these street merchant be shrewd in these matter -- must have tell he that in all this hurry mass of people the thought of no one run toward umbrella rather i think that he be take a hour from the routine of the day he have tread the profitable side street until truantry have take he but he still make a pretext of work at he job and call he wares to ease he conscience from idleness once when a unusually bright beam of sunlight fall from between the cloud he tilted up he hat to get the warmth and i think he guilty of a skip and syncopation in the ringing of he bell as if he too twitch pleasantly with the spring and he old sap be stir i like these person who ply they trade upon the sidewalk my hatter -- the fellow who clean my straw hat each spring -- be a partner of a bootblack over he head as he putter with he soap and brush there hang a rusty sign proclaim that he be famous for he clean all round the world he be so modest in he look that i have wonder whether he really can read the sign or perhaps like a true merchant he be not squeamish at the praise as i have not previously be aware that any of he profession ever come to general fame except the mad hatter of wonderland i have squint sharply at he to see if by chance it might be he but there be no mark even of a distant kinship he do however bring my hat to a marvellous whiteness and it may be true that he have really tend head that be now go beyond constantinople bootblack have a sense of rhythm unparalleled of this the long rag be they instrument they draw it once or twice across the shoe to set the key and then they go into a swift and pattering melody if there be a unusual genius in the bootblack -- some remnant of ancient greece -- he play such a lively tune that one 's shoulder jig to it if there be a dryad or other such nimble creature on the street she would come leap as though orpheus strum a tune but the dance be too fast for we languid northern foot nowhere be apple redder than on a cart we heart go out to adam in the hour of he temptation i know one lady of otherwise careful appetite who even lean toward date if she may buy they from a cart those dear dirty date she call they but i can not share she liking for they although the cart be a beguiling market date so buy be too dusty to be eat they rank with the apple-john the apple-john be that mysterious leathery fruit sell more often from a stand than from a cart which lean at the rear of the shelf against the peppermint jar for myself although i do not eat apple-john i like to look at they they be so shrivel and so flat as though a banana have catch a consumption or rather in the older world be there not a custom at a death of send fruit to support the lonesome journey if so the apple-john come untasted to the end indeed there be a look of old egypt about the fruit whether my fondness for gaze at apple-john spring from a distant occasion when as a child i once buy and eat one or whether it arise from the fact that falstaff call prince hal a dry apple-john be a unsolved question but i like to linger before a particularly shrivel one and wonder what its youth be like perhaps like many of its betters it remain unheralded and unknown all through its fresher year and not until the come of its wrinkled age be it at last put up to the common view the apple-john set up kinship with a author the day of all fool be wisely put in April the jest of the day reside in the success with which credulity be impose upon and April be the month of easiest credulity let brag traveller come in April and hold we with tale of the anthropopagus if they head be say to grow beneath they shoulder still we will turn a credent ear indeed it be all but sure that baron munchausen come back from he travels in the spring when else could he have get a ear what man can look upon the wonder of the return year -- the first blue sky the soft rain the tender sprouting of green stalk without feeling that there be nothing beyond belief if such miracle can happen before he eye shall not the extreme range even of travel or metaphysics be allow what man who have smell the first fragrance of the earth have hear the bird on they northern flight and have see a April brook upon its course will withhold he credence even though the jest be plain i beg therefore that when you walk upon the street on the next day of April fool that you yield to the occasion if a urchin point he finger at you hat humor he by remove it look sharply at it for a suppose defect he glad shout will be you reward or if you be beg piteously to lift a stand-pipe wrap to the likeness of a bundle even though you sniff the imposture seize upon it with a will it be thus beneath these April sky that you play you part in the pageantry that mark the day the friendly genie do you not confess yourself to be several year past that time of greenest youth when burnt cork hold its greatest charm although not fall to a cripple state be you not now too advanced to smudge you upper lip and stalk agreeably as a villain surely you can no longer frisk lightly in a comedy if you should wheeze and limp in a old man 's part with back hump in mimicry would you not fear that it border on the truth but doubtless there be a time when you range upon these height -- when kazrac the magician be not too heavy for you art in those soar day let we hope that you play the villain with a swagger or be cast in a softer role that you win a pink and fluffy princess before the play be do you earliest practice it may be be in rig the parlor hanging as a curtain with brown string from the pantry and safety pin although you have no show to offer you say ding three time -- as be the ancient custom of the stage when the actor be ready -- and draw they wide apart the cat be the audience who doze with a ear twitch toward you activity a complaint that spring up in youth and be know as snuffle have keep you out of school it have grip you hard at breakfast when you be sink in fear of you lesson but have abate at nine o'clock whether the cure come with a proper healing of the nasal gland or follow merely on the ringing of the school bell must be leave to a cool judgment you theater fill the morning when annie come on she quest for dust you toot once upon you nose just to show that a remnant of you infirmity persist then put you golden convalescence on the making of you curtain but in the early hour of afternoon when the child be once more upon the street you regret you illness here they come troop by three and fours carry they book tie up in strap one would think that they be in fear lest some impish fact might get outside the cover to spoil the afternoon until the morrow let two and two think themselves five at least and let ohio be bound as it will some few child skip rope or step carefully across the crack of the sidewalk for fear they spoil they supper ah -- a bat go by -- a glove -- a ball and now from a vacant lot there come the clamor of choose side be no mention to be make of you -- you molass finger -- the star leave fielder -- the timely batter what would you not give now for a clean bill of health you rub you offend nose upon the glass what matter it with what deep rascality in black mustachio you once strut upon you board what be hecuba to you my own first theater be in the attic a place of squeak and shadow to all except the valiant in it be low dark corner where the night crawl in and sleep but in the open part where the roof be highest there be the theater its wall be make of a red cambric of a flowered pattern that still linger with I and be buy with a clatter of penny on the counter together with nickel that have escape my extravagance at the soda fountain a cousin and i be joint proprietor in the making of it the hammer and nail be mine by right of sex while she stitch in womanish fashion on the fabric she be lead woman and i be either the hero or the villain as fitted to my mood my younger cousin -- although we scorn she for she youth -- be admit to the slighter part she might daub herself with cork but it must be only when we be do nor do we allow she to carry the paper knife -- shape like a dagger -- which figure hugely in we plot if we give she any word to speak it be as taffy to keep she silent about some iniquity that we have work against she in general we judge she to be too green and giddy for the heavy part at the most she might take pin at the door -- for at such a trifle we display we talent -- or play upon the comb as orchestra before the rising of the curtain the usual approach to this theater be the kitchen door and those who come to enjoy the drama sniff at they very entrance the new-baked bread a pan of cookie be set upon a shelf and a row of apple be range along the window sill of the ice-box around the corner not a word lest hunger lead you off as for the cook although she tongue be tart upon a just occasion and although she shoo the child with she apron secretly she like to have they crowd through she kitchen now if you reader -- for i assume you to be one of the gathering audience -- be of the kind careful on scrub day to scrape you foot upon the iron outside and to cross the kitchen on the unwashed part then it be likely that you stand in the good grace of the cook mark you reward as you journey upward you munch upon a cookie and bit scallop in its edge or if a ravenous haste be in you -- as commonly come up in the middle afternoon -- you waive this slower method and cram yourself with a recklessness that bestrew the purlieus of you mouth if you ear lay beyond the muss the stowage be deem decent and in order be there not a story in which child be track by a ogre through the perilous wood by the crumb they drop then let we hope there be no ogre lurk on these back stair for the trail be plain it would be near the top farthest from the friendly kitchen that the attack might come for there the stair yield to the darkness of the attic there it be best to look sharp and to turn the corner wide a brave whistle keep out the other noise it be after aladdin have be in town that the fire burn hottest in we my grandfather and i go together to the matinee he great thumb within my fist we be frequent companion together we have sit on bench in the park and poke the gravel into pattern we go to dime museum although he eye have look longer on the world than mine we seem of a equal age the theater be empty as we enter we carry a bag of candy against a sudden appetite -- colt 's foot a penny to the stick here and there usher be clap down the seat sound to my fancy not unlike the first corn within a popper somewhere aloft there must have be a roof else the day would have spy in on we yet it be lose in the gloom it be as though a thrifty owner have borrow the dusky fabric of the night to make he cover the curtain be indistinct but we know it to be the stratford church and we dimly see its spire now on the opening of a door to the upper gallery there be a scamper to get seat in front speed be whet by a long half hour of wait on the stair ghostly unbodied head like the luminous soul of lose mountaineer -- for this be the kind of fiction get out of the public library that have come last beneath my thumb -- ghostly head look down upon we across the gallery rail and now if you will tip back you head like a paper-hanger -- whose adam 's apple would seem to attest a life of sidereal contemplation -- you will see in the center of the murk above you a single point of light it be the spark that will ignite the great gas chandelier i strain my neck to the point of break my grandfather strain he too for it be a game between we which shall announce the first spurting of the light at last we cry out together the spark catch the vent next to it it run around the circle of glass pendant the whole blaze up the mountaineer come to life they lean forward on they elbow from the wing come the tuning of the violin a flute ripple up and down in a care-free manner as though the villain kazrac be already dead and virtue have come into its own the orchestra emerge from below they calmness be but a pretense have look on such sight as lie behind the curtain have tread such way they should be bubble with excitement yet observe the bass viol how sodden be he eye how sunken be he gaze with what dull routine he draw he bow as though he know naught but sleepy tune if there be any genie in the place as the program say let he first stir this sad fellow from he melancholy we consult we program the first scene be the magician 's cave where he plan he evil scheme the second be the chinese city where he pretend to be aladdin 's uncle and for myself do a friendly old gentleman offer I lollypop and all-day-sucker -- for so do the glittering bauble present themselves across the footlights -- like aladdin i too would not have squint too closely on he claim gladly i would have go off with he on a all-day picnic toward the chinese mountain we see a lonely pass in the hill the cave of jewel -lrb- splendid to the eye of childhood -rrb- where the slave of the lamp first appear and finally the throne-room with aladdin seat safely beside he princess who know how to dip a pen within the twilight who shall trace the figure of the mist the play be do we come out in silence we candy be but a remnant darkness have fall the pavement be wet and shine so that the night might see he face if by chance the old fellow look we way all about there be person hurry home with dinner-pail who by they dull eye seem never to have hear what wonder follow on the rubbing of a lamp but how the fire leap up -- how ambition beat within we -- how we attic theater be work to perfection -- how the play come off and wrack the neighborhood of its pin -- with what grace i myself act aladdin -- these thing must be write by a vain and braggart pen mr pepy sit in the pit when it happen that a man have rise to be a member of parliament the secretary of the british navy and the president of the royal society when he have become the adviser of the king and be moreover the one really bright spot in that king 's reign it be amazing that considerably more than one hundred year after he death when the navy that he nurture dominate the seven sea that he himself on a sudden should be know not for he larger accomplishment but as a kind of tavern crony and pot-companion when he should be stand with fame secure in a solemn though dusty niche in the temple of time it be amazing that he should be remembered chiefly for certain quarrel with he wife and as a frequenter of play and summer garden yet this be the fate of samuel pepy before the return of the stuart he hold a poor clerkship in the navy office and cut he quill obscurely at the common desk at the restoration partly by the boost of influence but chiefly by he substantial merit he mount to several successively higher post the prince of wale become he friend and patron and when he become lord high admiral he take pepy with he in he advancement thus in 1684 pepy become secretary of the navy when later the prince of wale become king jame ii pepy although he office remain the same come to quite a pinnacle of administrative power he be shrewd and capable in the conduct of he position and bring method to the navy office he be a prime factor in the first development of the british navy later victory that be to sweep the sea may be trace in part to he nelson ride upon he shoulder these achievement should have make he fame secure but on a sudden he gain for posterity a less dignified although a more interesting and enduring renown in life samuel pepy walk gravely in majestical robe with full-bottomed wig and with ceremonial lace flap at he wrist every step if he portrait be to be believe be a bit of pageantry such be he fame that if he sword but clack a warning on the pavement it must have bring the apprentice to the window tradesman lay down they wares to get a look at he fat man puff and strain to gain the advantage of a sill fashionable lady peep from brocaded curtain and ogle for he regard or if he go by chair the carrier hold they nose up as though offend by the common air when he speak before the common the gallery be hush he give he day to the signing of stiff parchment -- admiralty order or what not he check the king himself at the council table in short he be not only a great personage but also he be quite well aware of the fact and hold himself accordingly but now many year have pass and time that have so long be at bowl with reputation have acquire a moderate skill in knock they down let we see how it fare with pepy some man who have be roguish in they life have be remember by they higher accomplishment a string of sonnet or a novel or two if it catch the fancy have wipe out a tap-room record the winning of a battle have obliterate a meanly spend youth it be true that for a while a old housewife who once live on the hero 's street will shake a dubious finger on he early prank steal apple or cigarette behind the barn cram she recollection but even a village reputation fade in time the sonnet and glorious battle have the upper place but thing go the other way with pepy rather he fate be like that of zeus who -- if legend be to be trust -- be in he life a person of some importance whose nod stir society on olympus but who be now remember largely for he flirtation and he braggart conduct a not unlike evil have fall on the magnificent mr pepy this fate come to he because -- as the world know -- it happen that for a period of ten year in comparative youth he write a interesting and honest diary he begin this diary in 1659 while he be still a poor clerk living with he wife in a garret and end it in 1669 when although he have emerge from obscurity he greater honor have not yet be set on he all the fact of he life during this period be put down whether good or bad small or large generous or mean he write of he morning spend in work at he office of he consultation with higher official there be much run to and fro of business the dutch war bulk to a proper length parliament sit through a page at a stretch pepy go upon the street in the day of the plague and write the horror of it -- the house mark with red cross and with prayer scratch beneath -- the stench and the carrying of dead body he see the great fire of london from he window on the night it start afterwards st paul 's with its roof fall he be on the fleet that bring charle home from he long travels and afterwards when charle be crown he record the procession and the crowd but also pepy quarrel with he wife and write it out on paper he debauch a servant and make a note of it he describe a supper at a ale-house and how he play on the flute he sing beauty retire a song of he own making and tell how he listener cry it up in consequence of this samuel pepy be now know chiefly for he attention to the pretty actress of drury lane for kiss nell gwynne in she tiring-room for he supper with the jade mr knipp for he love of a tune upon the fiddle for come home from vauxhall by wherry late at night singing merrily down the river or perhaps we recall he best for bury he wine and parmazan cheese in he garden at the time of the fire or for stand to the measure of mr pin the tailor for a camlett cloak with gold button or for sit for he portrait in a indian gown which he hire to be draw in who shall say that this be not the very portrait by which we have fancy he stalk off to common could the apprentice have know in what a borrow majesty he walk would they not have toss they cap in mirth and point they dusky finger at he or we remember that he once live in a garret and that he wife poor wretch be use to make the fire while samuel lay abed and that she wash he foul clothes -- that by degree he come to be wealthy and ride in he own yellow coach -- that he wife go abroad in society in a flowered tabby gown -- that pepy forsake he habit of poverty and exchange he twelve-penny seat in the theater gallery for a place in the pit -- and that on a rare occasion -lrb- doubtless when he be alone and there be but one seat to buy -rrb- he arise to the extravagance of a four-shilling box consequently despite the weightier part of the diary we know pepy chiefly in he hour of ease sitting and consultation be so dry if only the world would run itself decently and in silence even a meeting of the committee for tangier -- when the prince of wale be present and such smaller fry as chancellor -- be dull and be matter for a skip eye if a session of parliament bulk to a fat paragraph and it happen that there be a bit of deviltry just below at the bottom of the page -- maybe no more than a clinking of glass -lrb- or perhaps nell gwynne 's name pop in sight -rrb- -- bless we how the eye will hurry to turn the leaf on the chance of roguery to come who would read through a long discourse on admiralty business if it be know before that pepy be engage with the pretty mr knipp for a trip to bartholomew fair to view the dancing horse and that the start be to be make on the turning of the page or a piece of scandal about lady castlemaine how she nose fall out of joint when mr stuart come to court -- such thing tease one from the sterner business and for these reason we have be incline to underestimate the importance of pepy ' diary franci jeffrey who write long ago about pepy evidently think that he be a idle and unprofitable fellow and that the diary be too much give to mean and petty thing but in reality the diary be a historical mine even when pepy play upon the surface he throw out fact that can be have nowhere else no one would venture to write of restoration life without digging through he page pepy write in a confused shorthand maybe against the eye of he wife from whom he have reason to conceal he offens the papers lay undeciphered until 1825 when a partial publication be make there be addition by subsequent editor until now it appear that the wheatley text of 1893-1899 be final but ever since 1825 the diary have be judge to be of high importance in the understanding of the first decade of the restoration if some of the weightier part be somewhat dry there be place in which a lighter show of personality be coincident with real historical datum foremost be the page where pepy go to the theater more than charle ii be restore in 1660 among many thing of more importance than this worthless king the theater be restore since the close of elizabethan time it have be out of business more than thirty year before puritanism have snuff out its candle and drive its fiddler to the street but puritanism in its turn fall with the return of the stuart pepy be a chief witness as to what kind of theater it be that be set up in london about the year 1660 it be far different from the elizabethan theater it come in from the bankside and the field to the north of the city and lodge itself on the better street and square it no longer pattern itself on the inn-yard but be roof against the rain the time have be when the theater be cousin to the bear-pit they be range together on the bankside and they sweat and smell like congenial neighbor but these day be past let bartholomew fair be as rowdy as it please let acrobat and such loose fellow keep to southwark the theater have rise in the world it have put on a wig as it be it have tie a ribbon to itself and have become fashionable and although it have take on a few extra dissolute habit they be of the genteelest kind and will make it feel at home in the upper circle but also the theater introduce movable scenery there be a attempt toward elaboration of stage effect to the king 's playhouse -- say pepy a good scene of a town on fire woman take part a avalanche of new play descend on it even the old play that have survive be garble to suit a change of taste but if you would really know what kind of theater it be that spring up with the stuart and what the audience look like and how they behave you must read pepy with but a moderate use of fancy you can set out with he in he yellow coach for the king 's house in drury lane perhaps hunger nip you at the start if so you stop as pepy pleasantly put it for a barrel of oyster then have dust yourself of crumb you take the road again presently you come to drury lane other yellow coach be before you there be a show of foppery on the curb and a odor of smoking link a powdered beauty mince to the door once past the doorkeeper you hear the cry of the orange woman go up and down the aisle there be a shuffling of apprentice in the gallery a dandy who loll in a box with a silken leg across the rail scrawl a message to a actress and send it off by orange moll presently castlemaine enter the royal box with the king there be a crane of neck for with she the king openly do discover a great deal of familiarity in other box be other fine lady wear vizard to hold they modesty if the comedy be free a board break in the ceiling of the gallery and dust fall in the man 's hair and the lady ' neck which write pepy make good sport or again a gentleman of good habit sit just before we eat of some fruit in the midst of the play do drop down as dead be choke but with much ado orange moll do thrust she finger down he throat and bring he to life again or perhaps i sit behind in a dark place a lady spit backward upon I by a mistake not see I but after see she to be a very pretty lady i be not trouble at it at all at a change of scene mr knipp spy pepy and come to the pit door he go with she to the tiring-room to the woman 's shift he write where nell be dress herself and be all unready and be very pretty prettier than i thought but to see how nell curse for have so few people in the pit be pretty -- but lord they confidence and how many man do hover about they as soon as they come off the stage and how confident they be in they talk or he be whisper a bit of gossip how castlemaine be much in love with hart a actor of the house then pepy go back into the pit and lay out a sixpence for a orange as the play near its end footman crowd forward at the door the epilogue be speak the fiddle squeak they last there be a bawl outside for coach would it fit you humor ask mr pepy when we have be hand to we seat would it fit you humor if we go around to the rise tavern for some burnt wine and a breast of mutton off the spit it be sure that some brave company will fall in and we can have a tune we 'll not heed the bellman we 'll sit late for it will be a fine light moonshine morning to a unknown reader once in a while i dream that i come upon a person who be read a book that i have write in my pleasant dream these person do not nod sleepily upon my page and sometimes i fall in talk with they although they do not know who i be they praise the book and name I warmly among my betters in such circumstance my happy nightmare mount until i ride foremost with the giant if i could think that this disturbance of my sleep come from my diet and that these agreeable person arise from a lobster or a pie nightly at supper i would ply my fork recklessly among the platter but in a wake state these meeting never come if a article of mine be ever read at all it be read in secret like the bible once indeed in a friend 's house i see my book upon the table but i suspect that it have be dust and lay out for my come i request my hostess that next time for my vanity she lay the book face down upon a chair as though the grocer 's knock intrude or perhaps a huckster 's cart break upon she enjoyment let it be think that a rare bargain -- tender asparagus or the first strawberry of the summer -- tempt she off my page or maybe there be red rhubarb in the cart and the jolly farmer as he journey up the street pitch it to a please melody dear lady i forgive you but let we hope no laundryman lead you off such discord would have mar my book i see once in a public library as i go along the shelf a volume of mine which give evidence to have be really read the record in front show that it have be withdraw one time only the card be blank below -- but once certainly it have be read i hope that the book go out on a Saturday noon when the spirit rise for the holiday to come and that a rainy Sunday follow so that my single reader be keep before he fire a dull patter on the window -- if one sit unbuttoned on the hearth -- give a zest to a languid chapter the rattle of a storm -- if only the room be snug -- fix the attention fast therefore let the rain descend as though the heaven rehearse for a flood let a tempest come out of the west let the chimney roar as it be a lion and if there must be a clearing let it hold off until the late afternoon lest it sow too early a distaste for indoors and read there be scarcely a bookworm who will not slip he glass off he nose if the cloud break at the hour of sunset when the earth and sky be fill with a green and golden light i take the book off the library shelf and timidly glance across my shoulder for fear that some one might catch I i look along the page there be a thumb mark in a margin and presently appear a kindly stickiness on the paper as though a orange have squirt on it surely there have be a human be hereabouts it be as certain as when crusoe find the footprint in the sand ah i think this fellow who sit in the firelight have catch a appetite perhaps he bite a hole and suck the fruit and the skin have burst behind or i wave the theory and now conceive that the volume be read at breakfast if so it be my comfort that in those dim hour it stand prop against he coffee cup but the trail end with the turning of the page there be indeed further on pencil check against one of the paragraph as if here the book have raise a faint excitement but i could not tell whether they spring up in derision or in approval toward the end there be uncut leaf as though even my single reader have fail in he persistence be sweep once beyond a usual caution i lament to my friend f -- of the neglect in which reader hold I to which the above experience in a library be a rare exception f -- offer I such consolation as he could deplore the general taste and the decadence of the time and say that as praise be sweet to everyone he as far as he himself be able offer it anonymously to those who merit it he be stand recently in a picture gallery when a long-haired man who stand before one of the picture be point out to he as the artist who have paint it at once f -- see he opportunity to confer a pleasure but as there be a touch of humor in he he first play off a jest lounge forward he drop he head to one side as artistic folk do when they look at color he make a knot-hole of he finger and squint through next he retreat across the room and stand with he leg apart in the very attitude of wisdom he cast a stern eye upon the picture and gravely tap he chin at last when the artist be fret to a extremity f -- come forward and so cordially praise the picture that the artist be now warm and comfort presently excuse himself in a high excitement and rush away to start another picture while the pleasant spell be on he have i be the artist i would have run from either f -- 's praise or disapproval as a instance i see a friend on a late occasion come from a bookstore with a volume of suspicious color beneath he arm i have be avoid that particular bookstore for a week because my book lay for sale on a forward table and now when my friend appear a sudden panic seize I and i plunge into the first doorway to escape i find myself face a soda fountain for a moment in my blur i could not account for the soda fountain or know quite how it have come into my life presently a interne -- for he be jackett as if he walk a hospital -- ask I what i would have still somewhat daze in my discomposure have no answer ready my startled fancy run among the sign and label of the counter until i recall that a bearded man once unblushing in my presence have order a banana flip i get the fellow 's ear and name it softly whereupon he place a dead-looking banana across a mound of ice-cream pour on color juice as though to mark the fatal wound and offer it to I i eat a few bite of the sickish mixture until the street be safe i do not know to what i can attribute my timidity possibly it arise from the fact that until recently my write meet with uniform rejection and failure for year i write secretly in order that few person might know how miserably i fail i answer upon a question that i have give up the practice that i now have no time for it that i scribble now and then but always burn it all that while i give my rare leisure and my steal afternoon -- the hour that other man give to golf and sleep and sit together -- these hour i give to write on a holiday i be at it early on Saturday when other folk be abroad i sit at my desk it be my grief that i be so poor a borrower of the night that i blink stupidly on my papers if i sit beyond the usual hour writing be my obsession i need no pity for my failure for although i toss my cap upon a rare acceptance my deeper joy be in the write that joy repeat failure could not blunt there be paragraph that now lie yellow in my desk with they former meaning fade that still recall as i think of they the first exaltation when i write they -- feverishly in a hot emotion in those day i think that i have catch the sunlight on my pen and the wind and the moon and the spin earth i think that the valley and the mountain arise from the mist obedient to I if i splashed my pen in my warm regard it be the roar and fury of the sea it be really no more than my youth cry out and alas my thought and my feeling escape I when i try to put they down on paper although i do not know it then perhaps they be too vagrant to be hold and yet these paragraph that might be mournful record of failure fill I with no more than a tender recollection for the boy who write they the worn phrase now beg they way with broken step like shrill and piping minstrel they whine and crack a melody that i still remember in its freshness but perhaps reader we be brother in these regard perhaps you too have fade papers or possibly even on a recent date you sigh you soul into a essay or a sonnet and you now have manuscript which you would like to sell do not mistake I i be not a editor nor be i a agent for these wares rather i speak as a friend who have many such hidden sorrow offer you a word of comfort to a despond hamlet i exclaim ` tis common my lord i have so many friend that have have a unproductive fling toward letter that i think the malady be general so many book be publish and flourish a little while in they bright wrapper but yours and theirs and mine waste away in a single precious copy i be convince that a close inspection of all desk -- a federal matter as though capital be under fire -- would betray thousand of abandon novel there may be a few stern desk that be so clutter with price-sheet and stock-list that they can not offer harborage to a love tale standing desk in particular such as bookkeeper affect be not always chink with these softer plot and rarely there be a desk so smother in learning -- reek so of scholarship -- as not to admit a lighter nook for the tucking of a sea yarn even so it be whisper to I lately that professor b -- whose word shake the continent hold in a lower drawer no fewer than three unpublished historical novel each set up with a full quota of smuggler and red bandit one of these story deal scandalously with the abduction of a heiress but this must be hold in confidence the professor be a stoic before he class but there be blood in the fellow there be therefore little use in you own denial you will recall that once when take to a ruin castle you brood on the dungeon until a plot pop into you head you cram it with quaint phrasing from the chronicler you stuff it with soldier ' oath what ho landlord you write gayly at midnight a foam cup good sir god pity the poor sailor that take the sea this night and on you pelt with you plot to such conflict and hair-breadth escape as lay in you contrivance these thing you have commit good sir we be of a common piece let we salute as brother and therefore as to a comrade i bid you continue in you way and that you may not lack matter for you pen i warmly urge you when by shrewdest computation you have exhaust the plot of adventure and have worn you villain thin that you proceed in quieter vein i urge you to a April mood for the wind of spring be up and daffodil nod across the garden there be black earth in the spring and green hilltop and there be also the breath of flower along the fence and the sound of water for you pen to prattle of a plague of all coward have write lately against the dog several acquaintance have ask I to turn upon the cat and they have be good enough to furnish I with instance of she faithlessness also a lady with whom i recently sit at dinner inquire of I on the passing of the fish whether i have ever properly consider the cow which she esteem a most mischievous animal one of they have moo at she as she cross a pasture and she have hastily climb a fence i get a good many suggestion first and last i be once take to a turkish bath for no other reason -- as i be afterwards tell -- than that it might supply I with a topic odd book have be put in my way a basket of school reader be once lodge with I with a request that i direct my attention to the absurd selection of the poem i have be urge to go against car conductor and custom man on one occasion i receive a paper of tombstone inscription with a note of direction how other might be find in a neighbor churchyard if i be curious a lady in whose company i camped last summer have ask I to give a chapter to it we be abroad upon a lake in the full moon -- we be lose upon a mountain -- twice a canoe upset -- there be the usual jest about cooking these thing might have fill a few page agreeably yet so far they have give I only a paragraph but i be not dispose toward any of these subject least of all the cat upon which i look -- despite the coldness of she nature -- as a harmless and comforting appendage of the hearth-rug i would no more prey upon she moral than i would the moral of the andiron i choose rather to slip to another angle of the question and say a few word about coward among whom i have already confess that i number myself in this year of battle when physical courage sit so high the reader -- if he be sweep off in the general opinion -- will expect under such a title something caustic he will think that i be about to loose against all coward a plague of frog and locust as if old egypt have come again but cowardice be its own punishment it need no frog to nip it even the sharp-toothed locust -- for in the day that border so close upon the mastodon the locust could hardly have fall to the tender greenling we know today -- even the locust that once spoil the egyptian could not now add to the grief of a coward and yet -- really i hesitate i blush my attack will be too intimate for i have confess that i be not the very button on the cap of bravery i have indeed stiffen myself to ride a horse a mightier feat than drive he because of the tallness of the monster and he uneasy movement as though he leg be not well socketed and might fall out on a change of gait i have ride on a camel in a side-show but have find my only comfort in he hump i have stroke the elephant in a solemn hour of night i have go downstairs to face a burglar but i do not run singing to these danger while you really brave fellow be climb a dizzy staircase to the moon -- i write in figure -- i would shake with fear upon a lower platform perhaps you recall mr tipp of the elium essay tipp say he pleasant biographer never mount the box of a stage-coach in he life or lean against the rail of a balcony or walk upon the ridge of a parapet or look down a precipice or let off a gun i can not follow tipp it may be to he extreme tremor -- my hair will not rise to so close a likeness of the fretful porcupine -- yet in a measure we be in agreement we be as it be cousin with the mark of we common family strong on both of we there be person who when in you company on a country walk will steal apple not with a decent caution from a tree along the fence but far afield if there be grape they will not wait for a turn of the road but will pluck they in the open or maybe in you wander you come on a half-built house you climb in through a window to look about here the stair will go the ice-box will be set against this wall but if you companion be one of valor 's minion he will not be satisfy with this safe and agreeable research -- this mild speculation on bath-room -- this innocent placing of a stove he must go aloft he have see a ladder and yearn to climb it the footing on the second story be bad enough if you fall between the joist you will clatter to the basement it be hard to realize that such a open breezy place will ever be cosy and warm with fire and that sleepy folk will here lie snugly a-bed on frosty morning but still the brazen fellow be not content a ladder lead horribly to the roof for myself i will climb until the tip of my nose jut out upon the world -- until it sprout forth to the air from the topmost timber : but i will go no farther but if you companion see a scaffold around a chimney he must perch on it for he a dizzy plank be a pleasant belvedere from which to view the world the bravery of this kind of person be not confine to these few matter if you happen to go drive with he he will -- if the horse be of the kind that distend he nostril -- on a sudden toss you the rein and leave you to guard he while he dispatch a errand if it be a motor car there would be a brake to hold it if it be a boat you might throw out a anchor a butcher 's cart would have a metal drag but here you sit defenseless -- tie to the whim of a horse -- grease for a runaway the beast dobbin turn he head and hold you with he hard eye there be a convulsive movement along he back a preface it may be to a sudden seizure a real friend would have loose the strap that run along the horse 's flank then if any deviltry take he he might go off alone and have it out i have in mind a livery stable in kalamazoo myself and another man of equal equestrianism be send once to bring out a thing call a surrey and a pair of horse do you happen to be acquaint with blat 's horse food if you way lie among the smaller town you must know its merit they be proclaim along the fence and up the telegraph pole drinking-trough speak its virtue horse thrive on blat 's food they neigh for it a flash lithograph be set by way of testament wherever traffic turn or linger do you not recall the picture a great red horse rear himself on he hind leg he forward hoof be extend he be about to trample someone under foot he nostril be wide he be unduly excite it can not be food it must be drink that stir he he be a fearful spectacle there be such a picture on the wall of the stable have you any horse i ask nervously jerk my thumb toward the wall any horse that have be feed on just ordinary food some that be a little tired for i remember how mr winkle once engage horse to take the pickwickian out to manor farm and what mishap befall they on the way ` he do not shy do he ' inquire mr pickwick ` shy sir -- he would not shy if he be to meet a vagginload of monkey with they tail burn off ' but how mr pickwick drop he whip how mr winkle get off he tall horse to pick it up how he try in vain to remount while he horse go round and round how they be all spill out upon the bridge and how finally they walk to manor farm -- these thing be know to everybody with a inch of read ` how far be it to dingley dell ' they ask ` better er seven mile ' ` be it a good road ' ` no t ` ant ' the depressed pickwickian turn moodily away with the tall quadruped for which they all feel the most unmitigated disgust follow slowly at they heel have you any horse i repeat that have not be feed on blat 's food -- horse that be so to speak on a diet in the farthest stall hide from the sunlight and the invigorating infection of the day two beast be find with sunken chest and hollow eye who take we safely to we destination on they hand and knee as you may suspect i do not enjoy ride there be it be true one saddle horse in north carolina that fear I if time still spare he that horse i could ride with content but i would rather trust myself on the top of a wobbly step-ladder than up the side of most horse i be not quite of a mind however with samuel richardson who own a hobby-horse and ride on he hearth-rug in the interval of write pamelum it be likely that when he have rescue she from a adventure of more than usual danger -- perhaps she villainous master have be conceal in she closet -- perhaps he have be hide beneath she bed -- it be likely have bring she safely off the author lock she in the buttery against a fresh attack then he feel good man in need of exercise so while he wait for tea and muffin he leap upon he rocking-horse and prance off as for the hobby-horse itself i have not hear whether it be of the usual nursery type or whether it be build in the likeness of the leather camel of a german steamship i need hardly say that these confession of my cowardice be for you ear alone they must not get abroad to smirch I if on a country walk i have take to my heel you must not twit I with poltroonery if you charge I with such faint-heartedness while other person be present i 'll deny it flat when i sit in the company of lady at dinner i dissemble my true nature as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat if then you taunt I for want of a better escape i shall turn it to a jest i shall engage the table flippantly : hear how preposterously the fellow talk -- he jest to satisfy a grudge in appearance i be whole as the marble found as a rock but really some of we coward be divert person the lady who direct I against the cow be a most delightful woman with whom i hope i shall again sit at dinner a witty lady of my acquaintance shiver when a cat walk in the room a man with whom i pass the time pleasantly and profitably although he will not admit a fear of ghost still will not sleep in a empty house because of possible noise i would rather spend a Saturday evening in the company of the cowardly falstaff than of the bold hotspur if it be not for sack villainous sack and a few spot upon he front you would go far to find a better companion than the fat old knight bob acre be not much for valor and he make a ass of himself when he go to fight a duel yet one could have sit agreeably at mutton with he but these thing be slight it matter little whether or not one can mount a ladder comfortably now that motor have come in horse stand remotely in we life nor be it of great moment whether or not we fear to be out of fashion -- whether we halt in the wear of a wrong-shaped hat or glance fearfully around when we choose from a line of fork superstition rest mostly on the surface and be not deadly in themselves a man can be true of heart even if he will not sit thirteen at table but there be a kind of fear that be disastrous to they that have it it be the fear of the material universe in all its manifestation there be person stout both of chest and limb who fear draft and wet foot a man who be a elephant of valor and who have be feel this long while a gentle contempt for such as myself will cry out if a soft breeze strike against he neck if a foot slip to the gutter and become wet he will dose himself achille do not more carefully nurse he heel for he the lofty dome of air be pack with malignant germ the round world be bottle with contagion a strong man who in he time might have slay the sofus be as fearful of he health as though the plague be up the street calamity beset he the slightest sniffle in he nose be the trumpet for a deep disorder existence be but a move hazard life for he poor fellow be but a room with a window on the night and a storm beating on the casement god know it be better to grow giddy on a ladder than to think that this majestic earth be such a universal pestilence the asperity of the early british reviewer book reviewer nowadays direct they attention for the most part to the worthy book and they habitually neglect those that seem beneath they regard on a rare occasion they assail a unprofitable book but even this be often but a bit of practice they swish a bludgeon to try they hand they only take they anger as it be upon a outing lest with too close housing it grow pallid and shrink in girth or maybe they indulge themselves in humor perhaps they think that they page grow dull and that ridicule will restore the balance they throw it in like a drunken porter to relieve a solemn scene i fancy that editor of this baser sort keep on they shelf one or two volume for they reader ' sport and mirth i read recently a review of a historical romance -- a last falter descendant of the race -- whose author in a endeavor to restore the past have make too free a use of obsolete word with what playfulness be he hold up to scorn mary come up sweet chuck how he quaint phrasing be turn against he what a merry fellow it be who write how sharp and caustic there be pepper on he mood but generally it be say book review be too flattering professor bliss perry be of this opinion offer some time ago a statement that magazine write about current book be for the most part bland complaisant pulpy the pedagogue no longer get a chance at the gifted young rascal who need first and foremost a premonitory whipping the youthful genius simply stay away from school and carry he unwhipped talent into the market place at a somewhat different angle of the same opinion dr crother suggest in a essay that instead of be direct to the best book we need to be warn from the worst he propose to set up a list of the hundred worst book for be it not better he ask to put a lighthouse on a reef than in the channel the open sea do not need a bell-buoy to sound its depth on these hint i have read some of the book criticism of day past to learn whether they too be pulpy -- whether we present silken criticism always wear its glove and perfumed itself or whether it have fall to this smile senility from a sterner youth although i be usually a rusty student yet by diligence i have seek to mend my knowledge that i might lay it out before you lately therefore if you have come within we public library you would have find I in one of these attempt here i go scrimp the other business of the day in order that i might be at my study before the rush set in up town mine be the alcove farthest from the door where be the mustier volume that fit a bookish student so if you quest be the lighter book -- such verse and novel as present fame attest -- you do not find I i be hooped and bow around the corner i be no real scholar but i study on a spurt for a whole week together i may read old play until they jigging style infect my own i have set myself against the lofty history although i tire upon they lower slope and have not yet persist to they upper and windier ridge i have also a pretty knowledge of the queen anne wit and feel that i must have dog and spy upon they while they be yet alive but in general although i be curious in the earlier chapter of learn i lag in the inner winding however for a fortnight i have sit pile about with old review whose leather rot and smell in order that i might study the fading criticism of the past until rather near the end of the eighteenth century those who make they living in england by write be chiefly publisher ' hack fellow of the dunciad suck they quill in garret and sell they labor for a crust for the read public be too small to support they or they find a patron and give he a sugared sonnet for a pittance or strain themselves to the length of a ode for a berth in he household or frequently they support a political party and receive a place in the red tape office but even in politics on account of the smallness of the read public and the politician ' indifference to its approval they service be of slight account too often a political office be grant from a pocket borough in which a restricted electorate could be buy at a trifling expense to gain support inside the house of common be enough the greater public outside could be ignore this attitude change with the come of the french revolution here be a new force unrealized before -- that of a crowd which be unrepresented and with a real grievance could when it like take a club and go after what it want for the first time in many year in england -- such be the whiff of liberty across the channel -- the power of a unrepresented public come to be know it be not that the english crowd have as yet take the club in its hand but there be new thought abroad in the world and there be the possibility to be regard to influence this larger public therefore man who could write come little by little into a larger demand and as writer be comparatively scarce all kind -- whether they write poem or prose -- be press into service it be significant too that it be in the decade subject to the first influence of the french revolution that the english daily paper take its start as a agent to influence public opinion it be therefore rather more than one hundred year ago that writer come to a better prosperity they come out of they garret take room on the second floor polish they brass and become person i can fancy that a writer after spend a morning in the composition of a political article on the whisper of a cabinet minister write a sonnet after lunch and a book review before dinner let we see in what mood they take they advancement let we examine they temper -- but in book review only for that alone concern we in do this we have the advantage of know the final estimate of the book they judge like the witch we have look into the seed of time and we know which grain will grow and which will not in 1802 when the edinburgh review -lrb- which be the first of its line to acquire distinction -rrb- come into be the passion of the time find voice in politics both whig and tory have be alarm by the excess of the french revolution both fear that england be drift the way of france each have a remedy but oppose and violently maintain the tory put the blame of the revolution on the compromise of loui xvi and accordingly they be hostile to any political change the whig on the other hand see the rottenness of england as a cause that would incite she to revolution also and they advocate reform while yet there be time the general fear of a revolution give the government of england to the tory and keep they in power for several decade and england be ripe for trouble the government be but nominally representative no catholic jew dissenter or poor man have a vote or could hold a seat in parliament industrially and economically the country be in the condition of france in the year of arthur young 's journey the poverty be abject the relief futile and the hatred of the poor for the rich be inflammatory george iii slip into feebleness and insanity yet jealous of he unconstitutional power be a vacillate despot quarrel with he common and he minister lord eldon as chancellor but with as nearly the control of a premier as the king would allow be the staunch upholder of all thing that have since be disprove and discard bagehot say of he that he believe in everything which it be impossible to believe in france and napoleon threaten across the narrow channel england still growl at the loss of she american colony it be as yet the england of the old regime the great reform be to come thirty year later -- the catholic emancipation the abolishment of slavery in the colony the suppression of the pocket borough the gross bribery of election the cleaning of the poor law and the court of justice it be in this dark hour of english history that the writer polish they brass and set up as person and if the lead article that they write of morning sting and snap with venom it be natural that the book review on which they spend they afternoon have also some vinegar in they especially if they concern book write by those of the opposition and other writer even if they have no political connection borrow they manners from those who have it be the animosity of party politics that set the general tone billingsgate that have grow along the wharf of the lower river be find to be of service in parliament and give a spice and sparkle even to a book review presently a large part of literary england wear the tag of political preference writer be often as clearly distinguish as be the lady in the earlier day when addison write he paper on party patch there be seat of moral philosophy to be hand out under-secretaryship consular appointment it be not enough to say that franci jeffrey be a reviewer he be as well a whig and be run a review that be whig from the front cover to the back leigh hunt be not merely a poet for he be also a radical and therefore in the opinion of tory a believer in immorality and indecency no matter how innocent a title might appear it be hold in suspicion on the chance that it assail the ministry or endanger the purity of england william gifford be more than merely the editor of the quarterly review for he be as well a tory editor whose duty it be to pry into whiggish roguery lockhart and wilson who write in blackwood 's be tory tooth and nail bite and scratch for party nowadays literature have find the public to be its most profitable patron work hard and even abjectly for its favor although there be defect in the arrangement it must be confess that the divorce of literature from politics contribute to the general peace of the household the edinburgh review be found in 1802 the quarterly review in 1809 blackwood 's magazine in 1817 these three win distinction among other of less importance and from they only i quote in 1802 when tory rule be strongest and lord eldon flourish there be live in edinburgh a group of young man who be for the most part briefless barrister they case be worse because they be whig few case come they way and no office these young man be franci jeffrey franci horner henry brougham and there be also sydney smith who have just come to edinburgh from a english country parish the eldest be thirty-one the youngest twenty-three although all of they have brilliant life before they not one of they have make as yet more than a step toward he accomplishment sydney smith have be but lately a obscure curate bury in the middle of salisbury plain away from all contact with the world franci jeffrey have be a hack writer in london have study medicine have seek unsuccessfully a government position in indium have write poor sonnet and be now lounge with but a scanty occupation in the hall of the law court franci horner have just come to the scottish bar straight from he study henry brougham who in day to come be to be lord chancellor of england and to whose skill in debate the passing of the great reform bill of 1832 be partly due be also just admit to the practice of the law the founding of the review be casual these man be accustom to meet of a evening for general discussion and speculation it happen one night as they sit together -- the place be a garret if legend be to be believe -- that sydney smith lament that they discussion come to nothing for they be all whig all convert to the cause whereas if they could only bring they opinion to the outside public they could stir opinion from so slight a root the review sprout sydney smith be make editor and keep the position until after the appearance of the first number when jeffrey succeed he the review become immediately a power appear quarterly and striking its blow anonymously against a sluggish government lash the tory writer and take its part which be of greater consequence in the promulgation of the whig reform which be to ripen in thirty year and convert the old into modern england in the destruction of outworn thing it be as it be a magazine of whig explosive the quarterly review be the next to come and it be tory john murray the london publisher have be the english distributor of the edinburgh review in 1809 two consideration move he to find in london a review to rival the scotch periodical first the tory party be be hard hit by the edinburgh review and there be need of defense and retaliation in the second place john murray saw that if he publishing house be to flourish it must provide this new form of literature that have become so popular for the very shortness of the essay and article in which extensive condition be summarize for quick digestion have meet with english approval as well as scotch people have become accustomed say bagehot of take they literature in morsel as they take sandwich on a journey murray appeal to george canning then in office for assistance and be introduce to william gifford as a man capable of the undertaking who would also meet the favor of the government party the rise of the quarterly review be not brilliant it do not fill the craving for novelty inasmuch as the edinburgh be already in the field furthermore there be not the opportunity in defense for as conspicuous gallantry as in offensive warfare it be eight year before another endure review be start william blackwood of edinburgh have grow like murray from a bookseller to a publisher and he too look for a means of increase he prestige he have launch a review the year previously in 1816 but it have founder when it be scarcely off the way he second attempt he be determine must be successful he new editor be john g lockhart and john wilson and the new policy although nominally tory be first and last the magazine 's notoriety it hawk its wares into public notice by sensational article and personal vilification wilson be thirty-two and lockhart twenty-three yet they be as mischievous as boy in they page be find the most abominable rave that have ever pass for literary criticism they do not need any party hatred to fire they william blackwood welcome any abuse that take he magazine out of the calm of respectable mediocrity anything that sting or startle be welcome to a place in its page so blackwood 's be publish and edinburgh city we may be sure set up a roar of delight and anger never before have one 's friend be so assail never before have one 's enemy be so grilled how please for a tory fireside be the mud bath with which it defile coleridge who be -- and you have always know it -- little better than a rogue one 's tory dinner be the more toothsome for the hot abuse of the chaldee manuscript what stout tory indeed would doze of a evening on such a sheet there follow of course case of libel the editor even find it safer after the publication of the first number to retire for a time to the country until the city cool i choose now to turn to the page of these three review and set out before you sample of they criticism in order that you may contrast they with we own literary judgment i warn you in fairness that i have be dispose to choose the worst yet there be hundred of other criticism but little better of the three review blackwood 's be the least seriously political in its policy yet its critical vilification be the worst the edinburgh review the most able of the three and the most in earnest in politics be the least vituperative with this introduction let we shake the pepperpot and lay out the strong vinegar of we feast in the judgment of the edinburgh review tom moore who have just publish he ode and epistle but have not yet begin he irish melody be a man who with some brilliancy of fancy and some show of classical erudition may boast if the boast can please he of be the most licentious of modern versifier and the most poetical of those who in we time have devote they talent to the propagation of immorality we regard he book indeed as a public nuisance he sit down to ransact the impure place of he memory for inflammatory image and expression and commit they laboriously in write for the purpose of insinuate pollution into the mind of unknown and unsuspecting reader franci jeffrey write this and moore challenge he to fight the police interfere and as jeffrey put it the affair end amicably we have since breakfast together very lovingly he have express penitence for what he have write and declare that he will never again apply any little talent he may possess to such purpose : and i have say that i shall be happy to praise he whenever i find that he have abjure these objectionable topic it be sydney smith who say of jeffrey he would damn the solar system -- bad light -- planet too distant -- pester with comet feeble contrivance -- could make a better with great ease jeffrey review wordsworth and find in the lyrical ballad vulgarity affectation and silliness he be alarmed moreover lest he childishness conceit and affectation spread to other author he propose a poem to be call elegiac stanza to a suck pig and of alice fall he write that if the publishing of such trash as this be not feel as a insult on the public taste we be afraid it can not be insult when the white doe of rylstone be publish -- no prime favorite i confess of my own -- jeffrey write that it have the merit of be the very worst poem he ever see imprint in a quarto volume it seem to we he write to consist of a happy union of all the fault without any of the beauty which belong to he school of poetry it be just such a work in short as some wicked enemy of that school might be suppose to have devise on purpose to make it ridiculous lord byron on the publication of a early volume be counsel that he do forthwith abandon poetry the mere rhyming of the final syllable even when accompany by the presence of a certain number of foot be not the whole art of poetry we would entreat he to believe continue the reviewer that a certain portion of liveliness somewhat of fancy be necessary to constitute a poem and that a poem in the present day to be read must contain at least one think it be this attack that bring forth byron 's english bard and scotch reviewer as long as jeffrey hope to enlist southey to write for the edinburgh review he treat he with some favor but southey take up with the quarterly the laureate say the edinburgh presently have now be out of song for a long time : but we have comfort ourselves with the supposition that he be only grow fat and lazy the strain however of this publication and indeed of some that go before it make we apprehensive that a worse thing have befall he that the worthy inditer of epic be fall gently into dotage now for the quarterly review if by chance it can show a equal spleen there live in the early day of the nineteenth century a woman by the name of lady morgan who be the author of several novel and book of travel although she record in intelligence and moral be good john croker who regularly review she book accuse she work of licentiousness profligacy irreverence blasphemy libertinism disloyalty and atheism there be twenty-six page of this in one review only and any paragraph would be worth the quote for its ferocity after this attack it be macaulay who say he hate croker like cold boil veal the quarterly review keat ' endymion although the writer naively state at the outset that he have not read the poem not that we have be want in we duty he write far from it -- indeed we have make effort almost as superhuman as the story itself appear to be to get through it but with the fullest stretch of we perseverance we be force to confess that we have not be able to struggle beyond the first of the four book finally he question whether keat be the author 's name for he doubt that any man in he sens would put he real name to such a rhapsody leigh hunt 's riminus the quarterly find to be a ungrammatical unauthorized chaotic jargon such as we believe be never before speak much less write we never conclude the reviewer in so few line see so many clear mark of the vulgar impatience of a low man conscious and ashamed of he wretched vanity and labor with coarse flippancy to scramble over the bound of birth and education and fidget himself into the stout-heartedness of be familiar with a lord in a later review hunt be a propounder of atheism henceforth say the reviewer he may slander a few more eminent character he may go on to deride venerable and holy institution he may stir up more discontent and sedition but he will have no peace of mind within he will live and die unhonoured in he own generation and for he own sake it be to be hope moulder unknown in those which be to follow hazlitt belong to a class of man by whom literature be more than at any period disgrace he style be suit for washerwoman a class of female with whom he and he friend mr hunt particularly delight to associate shelley write the quarterly be one of that industrious knot of author the tendency of whose work we have in we late number expose to the caution of we reader for with perfect deliberation and the steadiest perseverance he pervert all the gift of he nature and do all the injury both public and private which he faculty enable he to perpetrate he poetry be in general a mere jumble of word and heterogeneous idea the cloud be simple nonsense prometheus unbound be a great storehouse of the obscure and unintelligible in the sensitive plant there be no meaning and for shelley himself he be guilty of a great many terrible thing include verbiage impiety immorality and absurdity of blackwood 's magazine the special victim be keat and hunt and coleridge mr coleridge say the reviewer seem to believe that every tongue be wag in he praise -- that every ear be open to imbibe the oracular breathing of he inspiration no sound be so sweet to he as that of he own voice he seem to consider the mighty universe itself as nothing better than a mirror in which with a grinning and idiot self-complacency he may contemplate the physiognomy of samuel taylor coleridge yet insignificant as he assuredly be he can not put pen to paper without a feeling that million of eye be fix upon he leigh hunt say blackwood be a man of extravagant pretension exquisitely bad taste and extremely vulgar mode of think he riminus be so wretchedly write that one feel disgust at its pretense affectation and gaudiness ignorance vulgarity irreverence quackery glittering and rancid obscenity blackwood 's write of the calm settle imperturbable drivelling idiocy of endymion and elsewhere of keat ' prurient and vulgar line evidently mean for some young lady east of temple bar it be a better and a wiser thing it comment to be a starve apothecary than a starve poet so back to the shop mr john back to ` plaster pill and ointment box ' and even when shelley write he adonai on the death of keat blackwood 's meet it with a contemptible parody : weep for my tom cat all ye tabby weep perhaps i have quote enough this be the parentage of we silken and flattering criticism the page of these old review rest yellow on the shelf from they there come a smell of rot leather as though the infection spread the hour grow late like the ghost of the elder hamlet i detect the morning to be near the pursuit of fire reader if by chance you have the habit of write -- whether they be sermon to hurl across you pew or sonnet in the spring -- doubtless you have moment when you sit at you desk bare of thought mother hubbard 's cupboard when she go to seek the bone be not more empty in such plight you chew you pencil as though it be stuff to feed you brain or if you be of delicate taste you fall upon you finger or in the hope that exercise will stir you wit you pace up and down the room and press you nose upon the window if perhaps the grocer 's boy shall rouse you some person draw picture on they pad or put pot-hook on they letter -- for talent vary -- or they roughen up they hair i know one gifted fellow whose shoe presently would cramp he until he kick they off when at once the juice of he intellect would flow genius i be tell sometimes lock its door and if unrestrained peel its outer wrapping or in you poverty you run through the page of a favorite volume with a notebook for a sly theft to start you off in what dejection you have fall it be best that you put on you hat and take you stupid self abroad or maybe you think that you creative fire will blaze if instead of throw in you wet raw thought you feed it a few seasoned bit you open therefore the drawer of you desk where you keep you reject and break fragment -- for you past have not be prosperous -- hopeful against experience that you can recast one of these to you present mood this be mournful business certain paragraph that come from you hot be now patch and shivery they finer meaning have run out between the line as though these space be sluice for the proper drainage of the page you have best put on you hat you will get no comfort from these stale papers one evening lately be in this plight i spread out before I certain odds and end i have dig deeper than usual in the drawer and have bring up a yellow stratum of a considerable age i be pore upon these papers and be wonder whether i could fit they to a newer measure when i hear a slight noise behind I i glance around and see that a man have enter the room and be now seat in a chair before the fire in the common nature of thing this should have be startling for the hour be late -- twelve o'clock have strike across the way -- and i have think that i be quite alone but there be something so friendly and easy in he attitude -- he be a young man little more than a lanky boy -- that instead of be frightened i swing calmly around for a better look he sit with he leg stretch before he and with he chin rest in he hand as though in think by the light that fall on he from the fire i see that he wear a brown check suit and that he be clean and respectable in appearance he face be in shadow good evening i say you startle I i be sorry he reply i beg you pardon i be go by and i see you light i wish to make you acquaintance but i see at once that i be intrude so i sit here you be quite absorb would you mind if i mended the fire without wait for a answer he take the poker and deal the log several blow it do not greatly help the flame but he poke with such enjoyment that i smile i have myself rather a liking for stir a fire he set another log in place then he draw from he pocket a handful of dry orange peel i love to see it burn he say it crackle and spit he range the peel upon the log where the flame would get it and then settle himself in the big chair perhaps you smoke i ask push toward he a box of cigarette he smile i think that you would know my habit i do not smoke so you be go by and come up to see I i ask yes i be not sure that i would know you you be a little older than i think a little -- stouter but dear I how you have lose you hair but you have quite forget I my dear boy i say you have the advantage of I where have i see you there be something familiar about you and i be sure that i have see that brown suit before we have never really known each other the boy reply we meet once but only for a instant but i have think of you since that meet a great many time i lay this afternoon on a hilltop and wonder what you would be like but i hope that sometimes you would think of I perhaps you have forget that i use to collect railway map and time-table do you i reply so do i when i be a little younger than you be perhaps if i might see you face i would know you it be nothing for show he reply and he keep it still in shadow would you mind he say at length if i eat a apple he take one from he pocket and break it in he hand you eat half he say i accept the part he offer I perhaps you would like a knife and plate i say i can find they in the pantry not for I he reply i prefer to eat mine this way he take a envelop bite i myself care nothing for plate i say we eat in silence presently : you have my habit i say of eat everything skin seed and all everything but the stem he reply by this time the orange peel be hiss and explode you be a odd boy i say i use to put orange peel away to dry in order to burn it we seem to be as like as two pea i wonder he say if that be so he turn in he chair and face I although he face be still in shadow doubtless we be far different in many thing do you swallow grape seed hardly i cry i spit they out i be glad of that he pause it be a breezy hilltop where i lay i thought of you all afternoon you be famous of course dear I no oh i be so sorry i have hope you might be i have count on it it be very disappointing i be think about that as i lay on the hill but be not you just on the point of do something that will make you famous by no means dear I i be so sorry do you happen to be marry yes and would you mind tell I she name i oblige he i do not remember to have hear of she i do not think of that name once as i lay upon the hill thing do not turn out as one might expect now i would have think -- but it be no matter for a moment or so he be lose in thought and then he speak again : you be write when i come into the room nothing important the boy run he finger in he hair and throw out he arm impatiently that be what i would like to do i be in college and i try for one of the papers but my stuff come back but this summer in the vacation i be work in a office i run errand and when there be nothing else to do i study a big invoice book so as to get the name of thing that be buy there be a racket of dray and wagon outside the window and along in the middle of the afternoon i get tired and thick in my head but i write Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning the boy stop and fix he eye on I i do not suppose that you happen to be a poet not at all i reply but perhaps you be one tell I about it the boy take a turn at the fire with the poker but it be chiefly in embarrassment presently he return to he chair he stretch he long arm upward above he head no i be not he say and yet sometimes i think that i have a kind of poetry in I only i can not get it into word i lay think about that too on the hillside there be a wind above my head and i think that i could almost put word to the tune but i have never write a single poem yet goodness I what thought i have but they be not real thought -- what you would regularly call thought thing go race and tingle in my head but i can never get they down they be just feeling as he speak the boy gaze intently through the chimney brick out into another world the fireplace be its portal and he seem to wait for the fire to cool before enter into its possession it be several moment before he speak again i do not want you to think I ridiculous but so few understand if only i could master the tool perhaps my thought be old but they come to I with such freshness and they be so unexpected could i only solve the fret and space inside I here i could play what tune i choose but my feeling be cold and stale before i can get they into thought i have no doubt however that they be just as real as those other feeling that in time after much scratch get into final form and become poetry i know of course that a man 's reach should exceed he grasp -- it be hackneyed enough -- but just for once i would like to pull down something when i have be up on tiptoe for a while sometimes i get a impression of pity -- a glance up a dark hallway -- a old woman with a shawl upon she head -- a white face at a window -- a blind fiddler in the street -- but the impression be go in a moment or a touch of beauty get I it may be nothing but a street organ in the spring perhaps you like street organ too i do indeed i cry there be one today outside my window and my foot keep wiggle to it the boy clap he hand i know that you would be like that i hope for it on the hill as for I when i hear one i be so glad that i could cry out in its lilt there be the rhythm of life it move I more than a hillside with its earliest flower be i absurd it be equal to the pipe of bird to shallow water and the sound of wind to stir I to thought of April today as i come downtown i see several merry fellow dance on the curb there be tune too upon the piano that send I off i play a little myself i see you have a piano do you still play a little rather sadly i reply that be too bad but perhaps you sing even worse dear I that be too bad i have rather a voice myself well as i be say when i hear those tune i curl up with the smoke and blow forth from the chimney if i walk upon the street when the wind be up and see a light fleece of smoke come from a chimney top i think that down below someone be listen to music that he like and that he thought ride upon the night like those white streamer of smoke and then i think of castle and mountain and high place and the sound of storm or in fancy i see a tower that taper to the moon with a silver gleam upon it the strange boy lay back and laugh musician think that they be the only one that can hear the finer sound if one of we common fellow cock he ear they think that only the coarser thump get inside and artist think that they alone know the glory of color i be think of that this afternoon and yet i have walk under the blue sky i have see twilight that these man of paint would botch on canvas but both musician and artist have a vision that be greater than they product the soul of a man can hardly be record in black and white key nor can a little pigment which you rub upon you thumb be the measure of a artist so i suppose that be the way also with poet it be not to be expect that they can express themselves fully in word that they have borrow from the kitchen when they genius flame up it be only the lesser spark that fall upon they write pad it console I that a man should be greater than he achievement i who have do so little would otherwise be so forlorn it be odd i say when he have fall into silence that i use to feel exactly as you do it stir a old recollection if i be not mistaken i once write a paper on the subject the boy smile dreamily but if small person like myself he begin can have such frenzy how must it be with those greater person who have amaze the world i have wonder in what kind of exaltation shakespeare write he storm in ` lear ' there must have be a first conception greater even than he accomplishment do he look from he window at a winter tempest and see miserable old man and woman run hard for shelter do a flash of lightning bare he soul to the misery the betrayal and the madness of the world he supreme moment be not when he fling the complete manuscript aside or when he hear the actor mouth he line but in the flash and throb of creation -- in the moment when he know that he have the power in he to write ` lear ' what we read be the cold forge wonderful and enduring but not to be compare to the produce furnace the boy have speak so fast that he be out of breath hold a bit i cry what you have say sound familiar where could i have hear it before there be something almost like a sneer on the boy 's face what a memory you have and perhaps you recall this brown suit too it be ugly enough to be remember now please let I finish what come to I this afternoon on the hill prometheus he continue scale the heaven and bring back fire to mortal and he as the story go clutch at a lightning bolt and catch but a spark and even that glorious mankind properly accredit he with a marvellous achievement it be for this reason that i comfort myself although i have not yet write a single line of verse my dear fellow i say please tell I where i have read something like what you have speak the boy 's answer be irrelevant you first tell I what you do with a brown check suit you once own i never own but one brown suit i reply and that be when i be still in college i think that i give it away before it be wear out the boy once more clap he hand oh i know it i know it i 'll give mine tomorrow to the man who take we ash now will not you please play the piano for I assuredly choose you tune he fumble a bit in the rack and pass some rather good music he hold up a tear and yellow sheet this be what i want he say i have not play it for many year after a false start or so -- for it be villainously set in four sharp for which i have a aversion -- i get through it on a second trial i do better the boy make no comment he have sink down in he chair until he be quite out of sight well i say what next there be no answer i arise from the bench and glance in he direction hello i cry what have become of you the chair be empty i turn on all the light he be nowhere in sight i shake the hanging i look under my desk for perhaps the lad be hide from I in jest it be unlikely that he could have pass I to gain the door but i listen at the sill for any sound upon the stair the hall be silent i call without response somewhat bewildered i come back to the hearth only a few minute before as it seem there have be a brisk fire with a row of orange peel upon the upper log now all trace of the peel be go and the log have fall to a white ash i be stand perplexed when i observe that a little pile of papers lay on the rug just off the end of my desk as by a careless elbow at least i think this impolite fellow have forget some of he possession it will serve he right if it be poetry that he write upon the hilltop i pick up the papers they be yellow and soil and write be scrawl upon they at the top be a date -- but it be twenty year old i turn to the last sheet at least i could learn the boy 's name to my amazement i see at the bottom in a old but familiar write not the boy 's name but my own i gaze at the chimney brick and they substance seem to part before my eye i look into a world beyond -- a fabric of moonlight and hilltop and the hot fret of youth perhaps the boy have only be wait for the fire upon the hearth to cool to enter this other world of he restless ambition and desire reader if by chance you have the habit of write -- let we confine ourselves now to sonnet and such airy matter as ride upon the night -- doubtless you sit sometimes at you desk bare of thought the juice of you intellect be parch and dry in such plight i beg you not to fall upon you finger or to draw picture on you sheet but most vehemently and with such emphasis as i possess i beg you not to rummage among you reject and break fragment in the hope of recast a withered thought to a present mood rather before you sour and curdle it be good to put on you hat and take you stupid self abroad end of the project gutenberg ebook of there be pippin and cheese to come by charle s brook
