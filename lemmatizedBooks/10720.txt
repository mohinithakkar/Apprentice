dream-flower extravagant and superb she have at time these abrupt shifting a need of break away in wild fancy in the midst of the most precise of reproduction she satisfy it at once fall always into this extraordinary efflorescence of such spirit and fancy that it never repeat itself create rose with bleed heart weep tear of sulphur lily like crystal urn flower without any known form even spread out starry ray with corolla float like cloud to-day on a groundwork dash in with a few bold stroke of black crayon it be a rain of pale star a whole shower of infinitely soft petal while in a corner a unknown bloom a bud chastely veil be open another to nail there resume the doctor point to the wall on which there be already a row of strangely curious pastel but what may that represent i ask you she remain very grave draw back a step the better to contemplate she work i know nothing about it it be beautiful at this moment appear martine the only servant become the real mistress of the house after nearly thirty year of service with the doctor although she have pass she sixtieth year she too still retain a youthful air as she go about silent and active in she eternal black gown and white cap that give she the look of a nun with she small white calm face and lusterless eye the light in which seem to have be extinguish without speak she go and sit down on the floor before a easy-chair through a rent in the old covering of which the hair be escape and draw from she pocket a needle and a skein of worst she set to work to mend it for three day past she have be wait for a hour 's time to do this piece of mend which haunt she while you be about it martine say pascal jestingly take between both he hand the mutinous head of clotilde sew I fast too this little noodle which sometimes wander off into the cloud martine raise she pale eye and look at she master with she habitual air of adoration why do monsieur say that because my good girl in very truth i believe it be you who have stuff this good little round clear strong headpiece full of notion of the other world with all you devoutness the two woman exchange a glance of intelligence oh monsieur religion have never do any harm to any one and when people have not the same idea it be certainly better not to talk about they a embarrassed silence follow this be the one difference of opinion which at time bring about disagreement among these three unite being who lead so restricted a life martine be only twenty-nine a year older than the doctor when she enter he house at the time when he make he _ debut _ as a physician at plassan in a bright little house of the new town and thirteen year later when saccard a brother of pascal send he he daughter clotilde aged seven after he wife 's death and at the moment when he be about to marry again it be she who bring up the child take it to church and communicate to it a little of the devout flame with which she have always burn while the doctor who have a broad mind leave they to they joy of believe for he do not feel that he have the right to interdict to any one the happiness of faith he contented himself later on with watch over the young girl 's education and give she clear and sound idea about everything for thirteen year during which the three have live this retired life at la souleiade a small property situate in the outskirts of the town a quarter of a hour 's walk from st saturnin the cathedral he life have flow happily along occupy in secret great work a little troubled however by a ever increase uneasiness -- the collision more and more violent every day between they belief pascal take a few turn gloomily up and down the room then like a man who do not mince he word he say : see my dear all this phantasmagoria of mystery have turn you pretty head you good god have no need of you i should have keep you for myself alone and you would have be all the better for it but clotilde tremble with excitement she clear eye fix boldly upon he hold she ground it be you master who would be all the better if you do not shut yourself up in you eye of flesh that be another thing why do you not wish to see and martine come to she assistance in she own style indeed it be true monsieur that you who be a saint as i say everywhere should accompany we to church assuredly god will save you but at the bare idea that you should not go straight to paradise i tremble all over he pause for he have before he in open revolt those two whom he have be accustom to see submissive at he foot with the tenderness of woman win over by he gaiety and he goodness already he open he mouth and be go to answer roughly when the uselessness of the discussion become apparent to he there let we have peace i would do better to go and work and above all let no one interrupt I with hasty step he gain he chamber where he have install a sort of laboratory and shut himself up in it the prohibition to enter it be formal it be here that he give himself up to special preparation of which he speak to no one almost immediately the slow and regular sound of a pestle grind in a mortar be hear come say clotilde smile there he be at he devil 's cookery as grandmother say and she tranquilly resume she copying of the hollyhock she complete the drawing with mathematical precision she find the exact tone of the violet petal strip with yellow even to the most delicate discoloration of the shades ah murmur martine after a moment again seat on the ground and occupy in mend the chair what a misfortune for a good man like that to lose he soul wilfully for there be no deny it i have know he now for thirty year and in all that time he have never so much as speak a unkind word to any one a real heart of gold who would take the bit from he own mouth and handsome too and always well and always gay a real blessing it be a murder that he do not wish to make he peace with the good god we will force he to do it mademoiselle will we not clotilde surprised at hear she speak so long at one time on the subject give she word with a grave air certainly martine it be a promise we will force he silence reign again break a moment afterward by the ringing of the bell attach to the street door below it have be attach to the door so that they might have notice when any one enter the house too vast for the three person who inhabit it the servant appear surprised and grumble a few word under she breath who could have come in such heat as this she rise open the door and go and lean over the balustrade then she return say : it be mme felicite old mme rougon enter briskly in spite of she eighty year she have mount the stair with the activity of a young girl she be still the brown lean shrill grasshopper of old dress elegantly now in black silk she

visage with they fire and she smile with a engaging smile when she so desire what be it you grandmother cry clotilde go to meet she why this sun be enough to bake one felicite kiss she on the forehead laugh say : oh the sun be my friend then move with short quick step she cross the room and turn the fastening of one of the shutter open the shutter a little it be too gloomy to live in the dark in this way at my house i let the sun come in through the open a jet of hot light a flood of dancing spark enter and under the sky of the violet blue of a conflagration the parched plain could be see stretch away in the distance as if asleep or dead in the overpower furnace-like heat while to the right above the pink roof rise the belfry of st saturnin a gilded tower with arise that in the blinding light look like whitened bone yes continue felicite i think of go shortly to the tulette and i wish to know if charle be here to take he with I he be not here -- i see that -- i will take he another day but while she give this pretext for she visit she ferret-like eye be make the tour of the apartment besides she do not insist speak immediately afterward of she son pascal on hear the

chair shake she head as if to say that she have no mind to disturb she master and there be silence again while clotilde wipe she finger stain with crayon on a cloth and felicite begin to walk about the room with short step look around inquisitively old mme rougon would soon be two year a widow she husband who have grow so corpulent that he could no longer move have succumb to a attack of indigestion on the 3d of September 1870 on the night of the day on which he have learn of the catastrophe of sedan the ruin of the government of which he flatter himself with be one of the founder seem to have crush he thus felicite affect to occupy herself no longer with politics live thenceforward like a dethrone queen the only survive power of a vanish world no one be unaware that the rougon in 1851 have save plassan from anarchy by cause the _ coup d'etat _ of the 2d of December to triumph there and that a few year later they have win it again from the legitimist and republican candidate to give it to a bonapartist deputy up to the time of the war the empire have continue all-powerful in the town so popular that it have obtain there at the plebiscite a overwhelming majority but since the disaster the town have become republican the quarter st marc have return to its secret royalist intrigue while the old quarter and the new town have send to the chamber a liberal representative slightly tinge with orleanism and ready to take side with the republic if it should triumph and therefore it be that felicite like the intelligent woman she be have withdraw she attention from politics and consent to be nothing more than the dethrone queen of a fall government but this be still a exalted position surround by a melancholy poetry for eighteen year she have reign the tradition of she two _ salon _ the yellow _ salon _ in which the _ coup d'etat _ have mature and the green _ salon _ later the neutral ground on which the conquest of plassan be complete embellished itself with the reflection of the vanish past and be for she a glorious history and besides she be very rich then too she have show herself dignified in she fall never utter a regret or a complaint parade with she eighty year so long a succession of fierce appetite of abominable maneuver of inordinate gratification that she become August through they she only happiness now be to enjoy in peace she large fortune and she past royalty and she have but one passion leave -- to defend she past to extend its fame suppress everything that might tarnish it later she pride which live on the double exploit of which the inhabitant still speak watch with jealous care resolve to leave in existence only creditable document those tradition which cause she to be salute like a fall queen when she walk through the

have go too far resume she coaxing manner but my kitten it be not i who say those frightful thing i repeat to you the stupid report they spread so that you may comprehend that pascal be wrong to pay no heed to public opinion he think he have find a new remedy -- nothing could be better and i will even admit that he will be able to cure everybody as he hope only why affect these mysterious way why not speak of the matter openly why above all try it only on the rabble of the old quarter and of the country instead of attempt among the well-to-do people of the town striking cure which would do he honor no my child you see you uncle have never be able to act like other people she have assume a grieved tone lower she voice to display the secret wound of she heart god be thank it be not man of

million and have a part in many a one of the great work which have make pari a new city not to speak at all of you brother maxime so rich so distinguished nor of you cousin octave mouret one of the king of the new commerce nor of we dear abbe mouret who be a saint well then why do pascal who might have follow in the footstep of they all persist in living in he hole like a eccentric old fool and as the young girl be again go to protest she close she mouth with a caress gesture of she hand no no let I finish i know very well that pascal be not a fool that he have write remarkable work that he communication to the academy of medicine have even win for he a reputation among _ savant _ but what do that count for compare to what i have dream of for he yes all the best practice of the town a large fortune the decoration -- honor in short and a position worthy of the family my word i use to say to he when he be a child : ` but where do you come from you be not one of we ' as for I i have sacrifice everything for the family i would let myself be hack to piece that the family might always be great and glorious she straighten she small figure she seem to grow tall with the one passion that have form the joy and pride of she life but as she resume she walk she be startle by suddenly perceive on the floor the copy of the _ temp _ which the doctor have throw there after cut out the

come to she of the quarrel of other day between he and he brother eugene rougon whom he have so often compromise and whom by a ironical turn of event he be perhaps go to protect now that the former minister of the empire be only a simple deputy resign to the single role of standing by he fallen master with the obstinacy with which he mother stand by she family she still obey docilely the order of she eldest son the genius fall though he be but saccard whatever he might do have also a part in she heart from he indomitable determination to succeed and she be also proud of maxime clotilde 's brother who have take up he quarter again after the war in he mansion in the avenue of the bois de boulogne where he be consume the fortune leave he by he wife louise de mareuil become prudent with

house of one to that of another a burden to all she remain silent a moment longer wait for some remark from clotilde some transition by which she might come to the subject she wish to touch upon when she see that the young girl occupy in arrange the papers on she desk be no longer listen she come to a sudden decision after cast a glance at martine who continue mend the chair as if she be deaf and dumb you uncle cut the article out of the _ temp _ then clotilde smile calmly yes master put it away among he papers ah how many note he bury in there birth death the smallest event in life everything go in there and the genealogical tree be there also we famous genealogical tree which he keep up to date the eye of old mme rougon flame she look fixedly at the young girl you know they those papers

should all be dishonor ah those abominable papers she see they at night in she nightmare reveal in letter of fire the true history the physiological blemish of the family all that wrong side of she glory which she would have wish to bury forever with the ancestor already dead she know how it be that the doctor have conceive the idea of collect these document at the beginning of he great study on heredity how he have find himself lead to take he own family as a example strike by the typical case which he see in it and which help to support law discover by he be it not a perfectly natural field of observation close at hand and with which he be thoroughly familiar and with the fine careless justness of the scientist he have be accumulate for the last thirty year the most private datum collect and classify everything raise this genealogical tree of the rougon-macquart of which the voluminous papers cram full of proof be only the commentary ah yes continue mme rougon hotly to the fire to the fire with all those papers that would tarnish we name and as the servant rise to leave the room see the turn the conversation be take she stop she by a quick gesture no no martine stay you be not in the way since you be now one of the family then in a hissing voice : a collection of falsehood of gossip all the lie that we enemy enrage by we triumph hurl against we in former day think a little of that my child against all of we against you father against you mother against you brother all those horror but how do you know they be horror grandmother she be disconcert for a moment oh well i

the past twenty-one year in the madhouse at the tulette if god have grant she the grace of allow she to live to the age of one hundred and four year he have also cruelly afflict she in deprive she of she reason certainly there be no shame in that only what exasperate I -- what must not be -- be that they should say afterward that we be all mad and then regard you grand-uncle macquart too deplorable rumor have be spread macquart have he fault in past day i do not seek to defend he but to-day be he not live very reputably on he little property at the tulette two step away from we unhappy mother over whom he watch like a good son and listen one last example you brother maxime commit a great fault when he have by a servant that poor little charle and it be certain besides that the unhappy child be of unsound mind no matter will it please you if they tell you that you nephew be degenerate that he reproduce from four generation back he great-great-grandmother the dear woman to whom we sometimes take he and with whom he like so much to be no there be no longer any family possible if people begin to lay bare everything -- the nerve of this one the muscle of that it be enough to disgust one with live clotilde standing in she long black blouse have listen to she grandmother attentively she have grow very serious she arm hang by she side she eye be fix upon the ground there be silence for a moment then she say slowly : it be science grandmother science cry felicite trot about again a fine thing they science that go against all that be most sacred in the world when they shall have demolish everything they will have advance greatly they kill respect they kill the family they kill the good god oh do not say that madame interrupted martine in a grieved voice she narrow devoutness wound do not say that m pascal kill the good god yes my poor girl he kill he and look you it be a crime from the religious point of view to let one 's self be damned in that way you do not love he on my word of honor no you do not love he you two who have the happiness of believe since you do nothing to bring he back to the right path ah if i be in you place i would split that press open with a hatchet i would make a famous bonfire with all the insult to the good god which it contain she have plant herself before the immense press and be measure it with she fiery glance as if to take it by assault to sack it to destroy it in spite of the withered and fragile thinness of she eighty year then with a gesture of ironical disdain : if even with he science he could know everything clotilde remain for a moment absorb in think she gaze lose in vacancy then she say in a undertone as if speak to herself : it be true he can not know everything there be always something else below that be what irritate I that be what make we quarrel : for i can not like he put the mystery aside i be trouble by it so much so that i suffer cruelly below what will and act in the shudder darkness all the unknown force -- she voice have gradually become lower and now drop to a indistinct murmur then martine whose face for a moment past have wear a somber expression interrupt in she turn : if it be true however mademoiselle that monsieur would be damned on account of those villainous papers tell I ought we to let it happen for my part look you if he be to tell I to throw myself down from the terrace i would shut my eye and throw myself because i know that he be always right but for he salvation oh if i could i would work for that in spite of he in every way yes i would force he it be too cruel to I to think that he will not be in heaven with we you be quite right my girl say felicite approvingly you at least love you master in a intelligent fashion between the two clotilde still seem irresolute in she belief do not bend to the strict rule of dogma the religious sentiment do not materialize in the hope of a paradise of a place of delight where she be to meet she own again it be in she simply a need of a beyond a certainty that the vast world do not stop short at sensation that there be a whole unknown world besides which must be take into account but she grandmother who be so old this servant who be so devoted shake she in she uneasy affection for she uncle do they not love he better in a more enlighten and more upright fashion they who desire he to be without a stain free from he mania as a scientist pure enough to be among the elect phrase of devotional book recur to she the continual battle wage against the spirit of evil the glory of conversion effect after a violent struggle what if she set herself to this holy task what if after all in spite of himself she should be able to save he and a exaltation gradually gain she spirit naturally incline to adventurous enterprise certainly she say at last i should be very happy if he would not persist in he notion of heap up all those scrap of paper and if he would come to church with we see she about to yield mme rougon cry out that it be necessary to act and martine herself add the weight of all she real authority they both approach the young girl and begin to instruct she lower they voice as if they be engage in a conspiracy whence be to result a miraculous benefit a divine joy with which the whole house would be perfumed what a triumph if they reconcile the doctor with god and what sweetness afterward to live altogether in the celestial communion of the same faith well then what must i do ask clotilde vanquish win over but at this moment the doctor 's pestle be hear in the silence with its continued rhythm and the victorious felicite who be about to speak turn she head uneasily and look for a moment at the door of the adjoining chamber then in a undertone she say : do you know where the key of the press be clotilde answer only with a artless gesture that express all she repugnance to betray she master in this way what a child you be i swear to you that i will take nothing i will not even disturb anything only as we be alone and as pascal never reappear before dinner we might assure ourselves of what there be in there might we not oh nothing but a glance on my word of honor the young girl stand motionless unwilling still to give she consent and then it may be that i be mistaken no doubt there be none of those bad thing there that i have tell you of this be decisive she run to take the key from the drawer and she herself open wide the press there grandmother the papers be up there martine have go without a word to station herself at the door of the doctor 's chamber she ear on the alert listen to the pestle while felicite as if rivet to the spot by emotion regard the papers at last there they be those terrible document the nightmare that have poison she life she see they she be go to touch they to carry they away and she reach up strain she little leg in the eagerness of she desire it be too high my kitten she say help I give

able to touch the envelope of strong blue paper with the tip of she finger and she finger travel over they contract nervously scratch like claw suddenly there be a crash -- it be a geological specimen a fragment of marble that have be on a lower shelf and that she have just throw down instantly the pestle stop and martine say in a stifled voice : take care here he come but felicite grown desperate

arm still in the air while martine have withdraw to one side and clotilde very pale stand wait without turn she head when he comprehend the scene he himself become as white as a sheet a terrible anger

adopt to avoid a explanation which he feel must be cruel and which he have always fear he know she he be willing to pardon she everything in he broad tolerance as a scientist who make allowance for heredity environment and circumstance and then be she not he mother that ought to have suffice for in spite of the frightful blow which he research inflict upon the family he preserve a great affection for those belong to he when he mother be no longer there he anger burst forth and fall upon clotilde he have turn he eye away from martine and fix they on the young girl who do not turn hers away however with a courage which accept the responsibility of she act you you he say at last he seize she arm and press it until she cry but she continue to look he full in the face without quail

my heart and of my brain ah yes i should have keep you entirely for myself and not have allow you stupid good god to take the best part of you oh monsieur you blaspheme cry martine who have approach he in order to draw upon herself a part of he anger but he do not even see she only clotilde exist for he and he be as if transfigure stir up by so great a passion that he handsome face crown by he white hair frame by he white beard flame with youthful passion with a immense tenderness that have be wound and exasperate you you he repeat in a tremble voice yes i why then master should i not love you better than you love I and why if i believe you to be in peril should i not try to save you you be greatly concern about what i think you would like well to make I think as you do she have never before defy he in this way but you be a little girl you know nothing no i be a soul and you know no more about soul than i do he release she arm and wave he hand vaguely toward heaven and then a great silence fall -- a silence full of grave meaning of the uselessness of the discussion which he do not wish to enter upon thrust she aside rudely he cross over to the middle window and open the blind for the sun be decline and the room be grow dark then he return but she feel a need of air and space go to the open window the burning rain of spark have cease and there fall now from on high only the last shiver of the overheate and pale sky and from the still burn earth ascend warm odor with the freer respiration of evening at the foot of the terrace be the railroad with the outlying dependency of the station of which the building be to be see in the distance then cross the vast arid plain a line of tree mark the course of the viorne beyond which rise the hill of sainte-marthe red field plant with olive tree support on terrace by wall of uncemented stone and crown by somber pine wood -- broad amphitheater bare and desolate corrode by the heat of summer of the color of old baked brick which this fringe of dark verdure stand out against the background of the sky border above to the left open the gorge of the seille great yellow stone that have break away from the soil and lay in the midst of blood-colored field dominate by a immense band of rock like the wall of a gigantic fortress while to the right at the very entrance to the valley through which flow the viorne rise one above another the discolor pink-tiled roof of the town of plassan the compact and confused mass of a old town pierce by the top of ancient elm and dominate by the high tower of st saturnin solitary and serene at this hour in the limpid gold of sunset ah my god say clotilde slowly one must be arrogant indeed to imagine that one can take everything in one 's hand and know everything pascal have just mount on the chair to assure himself that not one of he package be miss then he take up the fragment of marble and replace it on the shelf and when he have again lock the press with a vigorous turn of the hand he put the key into he pocket yes he reply try not to know everything and above all try not to bewilder you brain about what we do not know what we shall doubtless never know martine again approach clotilde to lend she she support to show she that they both have a common cause and now the doctor perceive she also and feel that they be both unite in the same desire for conquest after year of secret attempt it be at last open war the _ savant _ see he household turn against he opinion and menace they with destruction there be no worse torture than to have treason in one 's own home around one to be trap dispossessed crush by those whom you love and who love you suddenly this frightful idea present itself to he and yet both of you love I he cry he see they eye grow dim with tear he be fill with a infinite sadness on this tranquil close of a beautiful day all he gaiety all he kindness of heart which come from he intense love of life be shake by it ah my dear and you my poor girl he say you be do this for my happiness be you not but alas how unhappy we be go to be ii on the follow morning clotilde be awake at six o'clock she have go to bed angry with pascal they be at variance with each other and she first feeling be one of uneasiness of secret distress a instant need of make she peace so that she might no longer have upon she heart the heavy weight that lay there now spring quickly out of bed she go and half open the shutter of both window the sun already high send he light across the chamber in two golden bar into this drowsy room that exhale a sweet odor of youth the bright morning bring with it fresh cheerful air but the young girl go back and sit down on the edge of the bed in a thoughtful attitude clothe only in she scant nightdress which make she look still more slender with she long taper limb she strong slender body with its round throat round neck round and supple arm and she adorable neck and throat of a milky whiteness have the exquisite softness and smoothness of white satin for a long time at the ungraceful age between twelve and eighteen she have look awkwardly tall climb tree like a boy then from the ungainly hoyden have be evolve this charming delicate and lovely creature with absent gaze she sit look at the wall of the chamber although la souleiade date from the last century it must have be refurnish under the first empire for it be hang with a old-fashioned print calico with a pattern represent bust of the sphinx and garland of oak leave originally of a bright red this calico have fade to a pink -- a undecided pink incline to orange the curtain of the two window and of the bed be still in existence but it have be necessary to clean they and this have make they still paler and this fade purple this dawnlike tint so delicately soft be in truth exquisite as for the bed cover with the same stuff it have come down from so remote a antiquity that it have be replace by another bed find in a adjoining room another empire bed low and very broad of massive mahogany ornament with brass its four square pillar adorn also with bust of the sphinx like those on the wall the rest of the furniture match however -- a press with whole door and pillar a chest of drawer with a marble top surround by a railing a tall and massive cheval-glass a large lounge with straight foot and seat with straight lyre-shaped back but a coverlet make of a old loui xv silk skirt brighten the majestic bed that occupy the middle of the wall front the window a heap of cushion make the lounge soft and there be besides two _ etagere _ and a table also cover with old flowered silk at the further end of the room clotilde at last put on she stocking and slip on a morning gown of white _ pique _ and thrust the tip of she foot into she gray canvas slipper she run into she dressing-room a back room look out on the rear of the house she have have it hang plainly with a _ ecru _ drill with blue stripe and it contain only furniture of varnished pine -- the toilette table two press and two chair it reveal however a natural and delicate coquetry which be very feminine this have grow with she at the same time with she beauty headstrong and boyish though she still be at time she have become a submissive and affectionate woman desire to be love above everything the truth be that she have grow up in freedom without have learn anything more than to read and write have acquire by herself later while assist she uncle a vast fund of information but there have be no plan settle upon between they he have not wish to make she a prodigy she have merely conceive a passion for natural history which reveal to she the mystery of life and she have keep she innocence unsully like a fruit which no hand have touch thanks no doubt to she unconscious and religious wait for the come of love -- that profound feminine feeling which make she reserve the gift of she whole be for the man whom she should love she push back she hair and bath she face then yield to she impatience she again softly open the door of she chamber and venture to cross the vast workroom noiselessly and on tiptoe the shutter be still close but she could see clearly enough not to stumble against the furniture when she be at the other end before the door of the doctor 's room she bent forward hold she breath be he already up what could he be do she hear he plainly walk about with short step dress himself no doubt she never enter this chamber in which he choose to hide certain labor and which thus remain close like a tabernacle one fear have take possession of she that of be discover here by he if he should open the door and the agitation produce by the struggle between she rebellious pride and a desire to show she submission cause she to grow hot and cold by turn with sensation until now unknown to she for a instant she desire for reconciliation be so strong that she be on the point of knock then as footstep approach she run precipitately away until eight o'clock clotilde be agitate by a ever-increasing impatience at every instant she look at the clock on the mantelpiece of she room a empire clock of gilded bronze represent love lean against a pillar contemplate time asleep eight be the hour at which she generally descend to the dining-room to breakfast with the doctor and while wait she make a careful toilette arrange she hair and put on another morning gown of white muslin with red spot then have still a quarter of a hour on she hand she satisfy a old desire and sit down to sew a piece of narrow lace a imitation of chantilly on she working blouse that black blouse which she have begin to find too boyish not feminine enough but on the stroke of eight she lay down she work and go downstairs quickly you be go to breakfast entirely alone say martine tranquilly to she when she enter the dining-room how be that yes the doctor call I and i pass he in he egg through the half-open door there he be again at he mortar and he filter we will not see he now before noon clotilde turn pale with disappointment she drink she milk stand take she roll in she hand and follow the servant into the kitchen there be on the ground floor besides this kitchen and the dining-room only a uninhabited room in which the potato be store and which have formerly be use as a office by the doctor when he receive he patient in he house -- the desk and the armchair have year ago be take up to he chamber -- and another small room which open into the kitchen the old servant 's room scrupulously clean and furnished with a walnut chest of drawer and a bed like a nun 's with white hanging do you think he have begin to make he liquor again ask clotilde well it can be only that you know that he think of neither eat nor drink when that take possession of he then all the young girl 's vexation be exhale in a low plaint : ah my god my god and while martine go to make up she room she take a umbrella from the hall stand and go disconsolately to eat she roll in the garden not know now how she should occupy she time until midday it be now almost seventeen year since dr pascal have resolve to leave he little house in the new town have buy la souleiade for twenty thousand franc in order to live there in seclusion and also to give more space and more happiness to the little girl send he by he brother saccard from pari this souleiade situate outside the town gate on a plateau dominate the plain be part of a large estate whose once vast grounds be reduce to less than two hectare in consequence of successive sale without count that the construction of the railroad have take away the last arable field the house itself have be half destroy by a conflagration and only one of the two building remain -- a quadrangular wing of four wall as they say in provence with five front window and roof with large pink tile and the doctor who have buy it completely furnish have contented himself with repair it and finish the boundary wall so as to be undisturbed in he house generally clotilde loved this solitude passionately this narrow kingdom which she could go over in ten minute and which still retain remnant of its past grandeur but this morning she bring there something like a nervous disquietude she walk for a few moment along the terrace at the two extremity of which stand two secular cypress like two enormous funeral taper which could be see three league off the slope then descend to the railroad wall of uncemented stone support the red earth in which the last vine be dead and on these giant step grow only row of olive and almond tree with sickly foliage the heat be already overpower she see the little lizard run about on the disjointed flag among the hairy tuft of caper bush then as if irritated by the vast horizon she cross the orchard and the kitchen garden which martine still persist in cultivate in spite of she age call in a man only twice a week for the heavier labor and she ascend to a little pine wood on the right all that remain of the superb pine which have formerly cover the plateau but here too she be ill at ease the pine needle crackle under she foot a resinous stifle odor descend from the branch and walk along the boundary wall past the entrance gate which open on the road to les fenouilleres three hundred meter from the first house of plassan she emerge at last on the threshing-yard a immense yard fifteen meter in radius which would of itself have suffice to prove the former importance of the domain ah this antique area pave with small round stone as in the day of the roman this species of vast esplanade cover with short dry grass of the color of gold as with a thick woolen carpet how joyously she have play there in other day run about roll on the grass lie for hour on she back watch the star come out one by one in the depths of the illimitable sky she open she umbrella again and cross the yard with slower step now she be on the left of the terrace she have make the tour of the estate so that she have return by the back of the house through the clump of enormous plane tree that on this side cast a thick shade this be the side on which open the two window of the doctor 's room and she raise she eye to they for she have approach only in the sudden hope of at last see he but the window remain closed and she be wound by this as by a unkindness to herself then only do she perceive that she still hold in she hand she roll which she have forget to eat and she plunge among the tree bite it impatiently with she fine young tooth it be a delicious retreat this old quincunx of plane tree another remnant of the past splendor of la souleiade under these giant tree with they monstrous trunk there be only a dim light a greenish light exquisitely cool even on the hottest day of summer formerly a french garden have be lay out here of which only the box border remain bush which have habituate themselves to the shade no doubt for they grow vigorously as tall as tree and the charm of this shady nook be a fountain a simple leaden pipe fix in the shaft of a column whence flow perpetually even in the greatest drought a thread of water as thick as the little finger which supply a large mossy basin the greenish stone of which be clean only once in three or four year when all the well of the neighborhood be dry la souleiade still keep its spring of which the great plane tree be assuredly the secular child night and day for century past this slender thread of water unvarying and continuous have sing the same pure song with crystal sound clotilde after wander awhile among the bush of box which reach to she shoulder go back to the house for a piece of embroidery and return with it sit down at a stone table beside the fountain some garden chair have be place around it and they often take coffee here and after this she affect not to look up again from she work as if she be completely absorb in it now and then while seem to look between the trunk of tree toward the sultry distance toward the yard on which the sun blaze fiercely and which glow like a brazier she steal a glance from under she long lash up to the doctor 's window nothing appear not a shadow and a feeling of sadness of resentment arise within she at this neglect this contempt in which he seem to hold she after they quarrel of the day before she who have get up with so great a desire to make peace at once he be in no hurry however he do not love she then since he could be satisfy to live at variance with she and gradually a feeling of gloom take possession of she she rebellious thought return and she resolve anew to yield in nothing at eleven o'clock before set she breakfast on the fire martine come to she for a moment the eternal stock in she hand which she be always knit even while walk when she be not occupy in the affair of the house do you know that he be still shut up there like a wolf in he hole at he villainous cookery clotilde shrug she shoulder without lift she eye from she embroidery and then mademoiselle if you only know what they say mme felicite be right yesterday when she say that it be really enough to make one blush they throw it in my face that he have kill old boutin that poor old man you know who have the fall sickness and who die on the road to believe those woman of the faubourg every one into whom he inject he remedy get the true cholera from it without count that they accuse he of have take the devil into partnership a short silence follow then as the young girl become more gloomy than before the servant resume move she finger still more rapidly : as for I i know nothing about the matter but what he be make there enrage I and you mademoiselle do you approve of that cookery at last clotilde raise she head quickly yield to the flood of passion that sweep over she listen i wish to know no more about it than you do but i think that he be on a very dangerous path he no longer love we oh yes mademoiselle he love we no no not as we love he if he love we he would be here with we instead of endanger he soul and he happiness and ours up there in he desire to save everybody and the two woman look at each other for a moment with eye burn with affection in they jealous anger then they resume they work in silence envelop in shadow above in he room dr pascal be work with the serenity of perfect joy he have practice he profession for only about a dozen year from he return to pari up to the time when he have retire to la souleiade satisfy with the hundred and odd thousand franc which he have earn and which he have invest prudently he devote himself almost exclusively to he favorite study retain only a practice among friend never refuse to go to the bedside of a patient but never send in he account when he be pay he throw the money into a drawer in he write desk regard this as pocket-money for he experiment and caprice apart from he income which suffice for he want and he laugh at the bad reputation for eccentricity which he way of life have gain he he be happy only when in the midst of he research on the subject for which he have a passion it be matter for surprise to many that this scientist whose intellectual gift have be spoil by a too lively imagination should have remain at plassan this out-of-the-way town where it seem as if every requirement for he study must be want but he explain very well the advantage which he have discover here in the first place a utterly peaceful retreat in which he might live the secluded life he desire then a unsuspected field for continuous research in the light of the fact of heredity which be he passion in this little town where he know every family and where he could follow the phenomenon keep most secret through two or three generation and then he be near the seashore he go there almost every summer to study the swarm life that be bear and propagate itself in the depths of the vast water and there be finally at the hospital in plassan a dissect room to which he be almost the only visitor a large bright quiet room in which for more than twenty year every unclaimed body have pass under he scalpel a modest man besides of a timidity that have long since become shyness it have be sufficient for he to maintain a correspondence with he old professor and he new friend concern the very remarkable papers which he from time to time send to the academy of medicine he be altogether want in militant ambition ah this heredity what a subject of endless meditation it be for he the strangest the most wonderful part of it all be it not that the resemblance between parent and child should not be perfect mathematically exact he have in the beginning make a genealogical tree of he family logically trace in which the influence from generation to generation be distribute equally -- the father 's part and the mother 's part but the living reality contradict the theory almost at every point heredity instead of be resemblance be a effort toward resemblance thwart by circumstance and environment and he have arrive at what he call the hypothesis of the abortion of cell life be only motion and heredity be a communicate motion it happen that the cell in they multiplication from one another jostle one another press one another make room for themselves put forth each one the hereditary effort so that if during this struggle the weaker cell succumb considerable disturbance take place with the final result of organ totally different do not variation the constant invention of nature which clash with he theory come from this do not he himself differ from he parent only in consequence of similar accident or even as the effect of larvated heredity in which he have for a time believe for every genealogical tree have root which extend as far back into humanity as the first man one can not proceed from a single ancestor one may always resemble a still older unknown ancestor he doubt atavism however it seem to he in spite of a remarkable example take from he own family that resemblance at the end of two or three generation must disappear by reason of accident of interference of a thousand possible combination there be then a perpetual become a constant transformation in this communicate effort this transmitted power this shock which breathe into matter the breath of life and which be life itself and a multiplicity of question present themselves to he be there a physical and intellectual progress through the age do the brain grow with the growth of the science with which it occupy itself might one hope in time for a larger sum of reason and of happiness then there be special problem one among other the mystery of which have for a long time irritated he that of sex would science never be able to predict or at least to explain the sex of the embryo be he have write a very curious paper cram full of fact on this subject but which leave it in the end in the complete ignorance in which the most exhaustive research have leave it doubtless the question of heredity fascinate he as it do only because it remain obscure vast and unfathomable like all the infant science where imagination hold sway finally a long study which he have make on the heredity of phthisis revive in he the waver faith of the healer arouse in he the noble and wild hope of regenerate humanity in short dr pascal have only one belief -- the belief in life life be the only divine manifestation life be god the grand motor the soul of the universe and life have no other instrument than heredity heredity make the world so that if its law could be know and direct the world could be make to one 's will in he to whom sickness suffering and death have be a familiar sight the militant pity of the physician awake ah to have no more sickness no more suffer as little death as possible he dream end in this thought -- that universal happiness the future community of perfection and of felicity could be hasten by intervention by give health to all when all should be healthy strong and intelligent there would be only a superior race infinitely wise and happy in indium be not a brahmin develop from a soudra in seven generation thus raise experimentally the lowest of being to the highest type of humanity and as in he study of consumption he have arrive at the conclusion that it be not hereditary but that every child of a consumptive carry within he a degenerate soil in which consumption develop with extraordinary facility at the slightest contagion he have come to think only of invigorating this soil impoverish by heredity to give it the strength to resist the parasite or rather the destructive leaven which he have suspect to exist in the organism long before the microbe theory to give strength -- the whole problem be there and to give strength be also to give will to enlarge the brain by fortify the other organ about this time the doctor read a old medical book of the fifteenth century be greatly strike by a method of treat disease call signature to cure a diseased organ it be only necessary to take from a sheep or a ox the corresponding organ in sound condition boil it and give the soup to the patient to drink the theory be to cure like by like and in disease of the liver especially the old work state that the cure be numberless this set the doctor 's vivid imagination work why not make the trial if he wish to regenerate those enfeebled by hereditary influence he have only to give they the normal and healthy nerve substance the method of the soup however seem to he childish and he invent in its stead that of grind in a mortar the brain of a sheep moisten it with distilled water and then decant and filter the liquor thus obtain he try this liquor then mix with malaga wine on he patient without obtain any appreciable result suddenly as he be begin to grow discourage he have a inspiration one day when he be give a lady suffering from hepatic colic a injection of morphine with the little syringe of pravaz what if he be to try hypodermic injection with he liquor and as soon as he return home he try the experiment on himself make a injection in he side which he repeat night and morning the first dose of a gram only be without effect but have double and then triple the dose he be enchanted one morning on get up to find that he limb have all the vigor of twenty he go on increase the dose up to five gram and then he respiration become deeper and above all he work with a clearness of mind a ease which he have not know for year a great flood of happiness of joy in live inundate he be from this time after he have have a syringe make at paris capable of contain five gram he be surprise at the happy result which he obtain with he patient whom he have on they foot again in a few day full of energy and activity as if endow with new life he method be still tentative and rude and he divine in it all sort of danger and especially that of induce embolism if the liquor be not perfectly pure then he suspect that the strength of he patient come in part from the fever he treatment produce in they but he be only a pioneer the method would improve later be it not already a miracle to make the ataxic walk to bring consumptive back to life as it be even to give hour of lucidity to the insane and at the thought of this discovery of the alchemy of the twentieth century a immense hope open up before he he believe he have discover the universal panacea the elixir of life which be to combat human debility the one real cause of every ill a veritable scientific fountain of youth which in give vigor health and will would create a altogether new and superior humanity this particular morning in he chamber a room with a northern aspect and somewhat dark owe to the vicinity of the plane tree furnished simply with a iron bedstead a mahogany write desk and a large write table on which be a mortar and a microscope he be complete with infinite care the preparation of a vial of he liquor since the day before after pound the nerve substance of a sheep in distilled water he have be decant and filter it and he have at last obtain a small bottle of a turbid opaline liquid irise by bluish gleam which he regard for a long time in the light as if he hold in he hand the regenerate blood and symbol of the world but a few light knock at the door and a urgent voice draw he from he dream why what be the matter monsieur it be a quarter-past twelve do not you intend to come to breakfast for downstairs breakfast have be wait for some time past in the large cool dining-room the blind be close with the exception of one which have just be half open it be a cheerful room with pearl gray panel relieve by blue moulding the table the sideboard and the chair must have form part of the set of empire furniture in the bedroom and the old mahogany of a deep red stand out in strong relief against the light background a hang lamp of polished brass always shine gleam like a sun while on the four wall bloom four large bouquet in pastel of gillyflower carnation hyacinth and rose joyous radiant dr pascal enter ah the deuce i have forget i want to finish look at this quite fresh and perfectly pure this time something to work miracle with and he show the vial which he have bring down in he enthusiasm but he eye fall on clotilde standing erect and silent with a serious air the secret vexation cause by wait have bring back all she hostility and she who have burn to throw herself on he neck in the morning remain motionless as if chill and repel by he good he resume without lose anything of he gaiety we be still at odds it seem that be something very ugly so you do not admire my sorcerer 's liquor which resuscitate the dead he seat himself at the table and the young girl sit down opposite he be oblige at last to answer : you know well master that i admire everything belong to you only my most ardent desire be that other also should admire you and there be the death of poor old boutin -- oh he cry without let she finish a epileptic who succumb to a congestive attack see since you be in a bad humor let we talk no more about that -- you would grieve I and that would spoil my day there be soft boil egg cutlet and cream silence reign for a few moment during which in spite of she ill-humor she eat heartily with a good appetite which she have not the coquetry to conceal then he resume laughing : what reassure I be to see that you stomach be in good order martine hand mademoiselle the bread the servant wait on they as she be accustom to do watch they eat with she quiet air of familiarity sometimes she even chat with they monsieur she say when she have cut the bread the butcher have bring he bill be he to be pay he look up at she in surprise why do you ask I that he say do you not always pay he without consult I it be in effect martine who keep the purse the amount deposit with m grandguillot notary at plassan produce a round sum of six thousand franc income every three month the fifteen hundred franc be remit to the servant and she dispose of they to the best interest of the house buy and pay for everything with the strictest economy for she be of so save a disposition that they banter she about it continually clotilde who spend very little have never think of ask a separate purse for herself as for the doctor he take what he require for he experiment and he pocket money from the three or four thousand franc which he still earn every year and which he keep lie in the drawer of he write desk so that there be quite a little treasure there in gold and bank bill of which he never know the exact amount undoubtedly monsieur i pay when it be i who have buy the thing but this time the bill be so large on account of the brain which the butcher have furnish you -- the doctor interrupt she brusquely : ah come so you too be go to set yourself against I be you no no both of you -- that would be too much yesterday you pained I greatly and i be angry but this must cease i will not have the house turn into a hell two woman against I and they the only one who love I at all do you know i would sooner quit the house at once he do not speak angrily he even smile but the disquietude of he heart be perceptible in the tremble of he voice and he add with he indulgent cheerful air : if you be afraid for the end of the month my girl tell the butcher to send my bill apart and do not fear you be not go to be ask for any of you money to settle it with you sous may lie sleep this be a allusion to martine 's little personal fortune in thirty year with four hundred franc wages she have earn twelve thousand franc from which she have take only what be strictly necessary for she want and increase almost treble by the interest she savings amount now to thirty thousand franc which through a caprice a desire to have she money apart she have not choose to place with m grandguillot they be elsewhere safely invest in the fund sous that lie sleep be honest sous she say gravely but monsieur be right i will tell the butcher to send a bill apart as all the brain be for monsieur 's cookery and not for mine this explanation bring a smile to the face of clotilde who be always amuse by the jest about martine 's avarice and the breakfast end more cheerfully the doctor desire to take the coffee under the plane tree say that he feel the need of air after be shut up all the morning the coffee be serve then on the stone table beside the fountain and how pleasant it be there in the shade listen to the cool murmur of the water while around the pine wood the court the whole place be glowing in the early afternoon sun the doctor have complacently bring with he the vial of nerve substance which he look at as it stand on the table so then mademoiselle he resume with a air of brusque pleasantry you do not believe in my elixir of resurrection and you believe in miracle master respond clotilde i believe that we do not know everything he make a gesture of impatience but we must know everything understand then obstinate little girl that not a single deviation from the invariable law which govern the universe have ever be scientifically prove up to this day there have be no proof of the existence of any intelligence other than the human i defy you to find any real will any reasoning force outside of life and everything be there there be in the world no other will than this force which impel everything to life to a life ever broader and higher he rise with a wave of the hand animated by so firm a faith that she regard he in surprise notice how youthful he look in spite of he white hair do you wish I to repeat my ` credo ' for you since you accuse I of not want yours i believe that the future of humanity be in the progress of reason through science i believe that the pursuit of truth through science be the divine ideal which man should propose to himself i believe that all be illusion and vanity outside the treasure of truth slowly accumulate and which will never again be lose i believe that the sum of these truth always increase will at last confer on man incalculable power and peace if not happiness yes i believe in the final triumph of life and with a broader sweep of the hand that take in the vast horizon as if call on these burn plain in which ferment the sap of all existence to bear he witness he add : but the continual miracle my child be life only open you eye and look she shake she head it be in vain that i open my eye i can not see everything it be you master who be blind since you do not wish to admit that there be beyond a unknown realm which you will never enter oh i know you be too intelligent to be ignorant of that only you do not wish to take it into account you put the unknown aside because it would embarrass you in you research it be in vain that you tell I to put aside the mysterious to start from the know for the conquest of the unknown i can not the mysterious at once call I back and disturb I he listen to she smile glad to see she become animated while he smooth she fair curl with he hand yes yes i know you be like the rest you do not wish to live without illusion and without lie well there there we understand each other still even so keep well that be the half of wisdom and of happiness then change the conversation : come you will accompany I notwithstanding and help I in my round of miracle this be Thursday my visit day when the heat shall have abate a little we will go out together she refuse at first in order not to seem to yield but she at last consent see the pain she give he she be accustom to accompany he on he round of visit they remain for some time longer under the plane tree until the doctor go upstairs to dress when he come down again correctly attire in a close-fitting coat and wear a broad-brimmed silk hat he speak of harness bonhomme the horse that for a quarter of a century have take he on he visit through the street and the environs of plassan but the poor old beast be grow blind and through gratitude for he past service and affection for himself they now rarely disturbed he on this afternoon he be very drowsy he gaze wander he leg be stiff with rheumatism so that the doctor and the young girl when they go to the stable to see he give he a hearty kiss on either side of he nose tell he to rest on a bundle of fresh hay which the servant have bring and they decide to walk clotilde keep on she spotted white muslin merely tie on over she curl a large straw hat adorn with a bunch of lilac and she look charming with she large eye and she complexion of milk-and-rose under the shadow of its broad brim when she go out thus on pascal 's arm she tall slender and youthful he radiant he face illuminate so to say by the whiteness of he beard with a vigor that make he still lift she across the rivulet people smile as they pass and turn around to look at they again they seem so innocent and so happy on this day as they leave the road to les fenouilleres to enter plassan a group of gossip stop short in they talk it remind one of one of those ancient king one see in picture one of those powerful and gentle king who never grow old rest he hand on the shoulder of a girl beautiful as the day whose docile and dazzling youth lend he its support they be turn into the cour sauvair to gain the rue de la banne when a tall dark young man of about thirty stop they ah master you have forget I i be still wait for you note on consumption it be dr ramond a young physician who have settle two

weather and she agree gaily not sulky now but press close to he happy to hang on he arm it be five o'clock the set sun spread over the field a great sheet of gold but as soon as they leave plassan they be oblige to cross the corner of the vast arid plain which extend to the right of the viorne the new canal whose irrigating water be soon to transform the face of the country parch with thirst do not yet water this quarter and red field and yellow field stretch away into the distance under the melancholy and blighting glare of the sun plant only with puny almond tree and dwarf olive constantly cut down and prune whose branch twist and writhe in attitude of suffering and revolt in the distance on the bare hillside be to be see only like pale patch the country house flank by the regulation cypress the vast barren expanse however with broad belt of desolate field of hard and distinct coloring have classic line of a severe grandeur and on the road the dust lay twenty centimeter thick a dust like snow that the slightest breath of wind raise in broad fly cloud and that cover with white powder the fig tree and the bramble on either side clotilde who amuse herself like a child listen to

who would bring he back in the morning but when he learn that maxime wish positively to go away again by the nine o'clock train without remain over night another idea occur to he he would send to the livery stable for a landau and all four would go to see charle at uncle macquart 's it would even be a delightful drive it be not quite three league from plassan to the tulette -- a hour to go and a hour to return and they would still have almost two hour to remain there if they wish to be back by seven martine would get dinner and maxime would have time enough to dine and catch he train but felicite object visibly disquiet by this visit to macquart oh no indeed if you think i be go down there in this frightful weather you be mistaken it be much simpler to send some one to bring charle to we pascal shake he head charle be not always to be bring back when one wish he be a boy without reason who sometimes if the whim seize he would gallop off like a untame animal and old mme rougon overrule and furious at have be unable to make any preparation be at last oblige to yield in the necessity in which she find herself of leave the matter to chance well be it as you wish then good heaven how unfortunately thing have turn out martine hurry away to order the landau and before three o'clock have strike the horse be on the nice road descend the declivity which slope down to the bridge over the viorne then they turn to the left and follow the wooded bank of the river for about two mile after this the road enter the gorge of the seille a narrow pass between two giant wall of rock scorch by the ardent ray of the summer sun pine tree push they way through the cleft clump of tree scarcely thicker at the root than tuft of grass fringe the crest and hang over the abyss it be a chaos a blast landscape a mouth of hell with its wild turn its dropping of blood-colored earth slide down from every cut its desolate solitude invade only by the eagle ' flight felicite do not open she lip she brain be at work and she seem completely absorb in she thought the atmosphere be oppressive the sun send he burning ray from behind a veil of great livid cloud pascal be almost the only one who talk in he passionate love for this scorched land -- a love which he endeavor to make he nephew share but it be in vain that he utter enthusiastic exclamation in vain that he call he attention to the persistence of the olive the fig tree and the thorn bush in push through the rock the life of the rock itself that colossal and puissant frame of the earth from which they could almost fancy they hear a sound of breathing arise maxime remain cold fill with a secret anguish in presence of those block of savage majesty whose mass seem to crush he and he prefer to turn he eye toward he sister who be seat in front of he he be become more and more charm with she she look so healthy and so happy with she pretty round head with its straight well-molded forehead now and then they glance meet and she give he a affectionate smile which console he but the wildness of the gorge be begin to soften the two wall of rock to grow lower they pass between two peaceful hill with gentle slope cover with thyme and lavender it be the desert still there be still bare space green or violet hue from which the faintest breeze bring a pungent perfume then abruptly after a last turn they descend to the valley of the tulette which be refresh by spring in the distance stretch meadow dot by large tree the village be seat midway on the slope among olive tree and the country house of uncle macquart stand a little apart on the left full in view the landau turn into the road which lead to the insane asylum whose white wall they could see before they in the distance felicite 's silence have grow somber for she be not fond of exhibit uncle macquart another whom the family would be well rid of the day when he should take he departure for the credit of every one he ought to have be sleep long ago under the sod but he persist in live he carry he eighty-three year well like a old drunkard saturate with liquor whom the alcohol seem to preserve at plassan he have leave a terrible reputation as a do-nothing and a scoundrel and the old man whisper the execrable story of the corpse that lay between he and the rougon a act of treachery in the troublous day of December 1851 a ambuscade in which he have leave comrade with they belly rip open lie on the bloody pavement later when he have return to france he have prefer to the good place of which he have obtain the promise this little domain of the tulette which felicite have buy for he and he have live comfortably here ever since he have no longer any other ambition than that of enlarge it look out once more for the good chance and he have even find the means of obtain a field which he have long covet by make himself useful to he sister-in-law at the time when the latter again reconquer plassan from the legitimist -- another frightful story that be whisper also of a madman secretly let loose from the asylum run in the night to avenge himself set fire to he house in which four person be burn but these be old story and macquart settle down now be no longer the redoubtable scoundrel who have make all the family tremble he lead a perfectly correct life he be a wily diplomat and he have retain nothing of he air of jeer at the world but he banter smile uncle be at home say pascal as they approach the house this be one of those provencal structure of a single story with discolor tile and four wall wash with a bright yellow before the facade extend a narrow terrace shaded by ancient mulberry tree whose thick gnarled branch droop down form a arbor it be here that uncle macquart smoke he pipe in the cool shade in summer and on hear the sound of the carriage he come and stand at the edge of the terrace straighten he tall form neatly clothe in blue cloth he head cover with the eternal fur cap which he wear from one year 's end to the other as soon as he recognize he visitor he call out with a sneer : oh here come some fine company how kind of you you be out for a airing but the presence of maxime puzzle he who be he whom have he come to see they mention he name to he and he immediately cut short the explanation they be add to enable he to straighten out the tangled skein of relationship the father of charle -- i know i know the son of my nephew saccard _ pardus _ the one who make a fine marriage and whose wife die -- he stare at maxime seem happy to find he already wrinkle at thirty-two with he hair and beard sprinkle with snow ah well he add we be all grow old but i at least have no great reason to complain i be solid and he plant himself firmly on he leg with he air of ferocious mockery while he fiery red face seem to flame and burn for a long time past ordinary brandy have seem to he like pure water only spirit of 36 degree tickle he blunt palate and he take such draught of it that he be full of it -- he flesh saturate with it -- like a sponge he perspire alcohol at the slightest breath whenever he speak he exhale from he mouth a vapor of alcohol yes truly you be solid uncle say pascal amaze and you have do nothing to make you so you have good reason to ridicule we only there be one thing i be afraid of look you that some day in light you pipe you may set yourself on fire -- like a bowl of punch macquart flattered give a sneering laugh have you jest have you jest my boy a glass of cognac be worth more than all you filthy drug and you will all touch glass with I hey so that it may be say truly that you uncle be a credit to you all as for I i laugh at evil tongue i have corn and olive tree i have almond tree and vine and land like any _ bourgeois _ in summer i smoke my pipe under the shade of my mulberry tree in winter i go to smoke it against my wall there in the sunshine one have no need to blush for a uncle like that hey clotilde i have syrup if you would like some and you felicite my dear i know that you prefer anisette there be everything here i tell you there be everything here he wave he arm as if to take possession of the comfort he enjoy now that from a old sinner he have become a hermit while felicite whom he have disturb a moment before by the enumeration of he riches do not take she eye from he face wait to interrupt he thank you macquart we will take nothing we be in a hurry where be charle charle very good presently i understand papa have come to see he boy but that be not go to prevent you take a glass and as they positively refuse he become offended and say with he malicious laugh : charle be not here he be at the asylum with the old woman then take maxime to the end of the terrace he point out to he the great white building whose inner garden resemble prison yard look nephew you see those three tree in front of you well beyond the one to the leave there be a fountain in a court follow the ground floor and the fifth window to the right be aunt dide 's and that be where the boy be yes i take he there a little while ago this be a indulgence of the director in the twenty year that she have be in the asylum the old woman have not give a moment 's uneasiness to she keeper very quiet very gentle she pass the day motionless in she easy-chair look straight before she and as the boy like to be with she and as she herself seem to take a interest in he they shut they eye to this infraction of the rule and leave he there sometimes for two or three hour at a time busily occupy in cut out picture but this new disappointment put the finish stroke to felicite 's ill-humor she grow angry when macquart propose that all five should go in a body in search of the boy what a idea go you alone and come back quickly we have no time to lose she suppress rage seem to amuse uncle macquart and perceive how disagreeable he proposition be to she he insist with he sneer laugh : but my child we should at the same time have a opportunity of see the old mother the mother of we all there be no use in talk you know that we be all descend from she and it would hardly be polite not to go wish she a good-day when my grandnephew who have come from such a distance have perhaps never before have a good look at she i 'll not disown she may the devil take I if i do to be sure she be mad but all the same old mother who have pass they hundredth year be not often to be see and she well deserve that we should show ourselves a little kind to she there be silence for a moment a little shiver have run through every one and it be clotilde silent until now who first declare in a voice full of feeling : you be right uncle we will all go felicite herself be oblige to consent they re-enter the landau macquart take the seat beside the coachman a feeling of disquietude have give a sallow look to maxime 's worn face and during the short drive he question pascal concern charle with a air of paternal

most cherish dream be to cure the mad by he treatment of hypodermic injection since in they case it be the brain that be in danger why should not hypodermic injection of nerve substance give they strength and will repair the breach make in the organ so that for a moment he have dream of try the treatment with the old mother then he begin to have scruple he feel a sort of awe without count that madness at that age be total irreparable ruin so that he have choose another subject -- a hatter name sarteur who have be for a year past in the asylum to which he have come himself to beg they to shut he up to prevent he from commit a crime in he paroxysm so strong a impulse to kill seize he that he would have throw himself upon the first passer-by he be of small stature very dark with a retreat forehead a aquiline face with a large nose and a very short chin and he left cheek be noticeably larger than he right and the doctor have obtain miraculous result with this victim of emotional

say gently : no no master you can not make life anew there come we be the last it be true the other have already go macquart on the threshold follow felicite and maxime with he mock glance as they go away aunt dide the forget one sit motionless appalling in she leanness she eye again fix upon charle with he white worn face frame in he royal lock the drive back be full of constraint in the heat which exhale from the earth the landau roll on heavily to the measure trot of the horse the stormy sky take on a ashen copper-colored hue in the deepen twilight at first a few indifferent word be exchange but from the moment in which they enter the gorge of the seille all conversation cease as if they feel oppress by the menacing wall of giant rock that seem closing in upon they be not this the end of the earth and be they not go to roll into the unknown over the edge of some abyss a eagle soar by utter a shrill cry willow appear again and the carriage be roll lightly along the bank of the viorne when felicite begin without transition as if she be resume a conversation already commence you have no refusal to fear from the mother she love charle dearly but she be a very sensible woman and she understand perfectly that it be to the boy 's advantage that you should take he with you and i must tell you too that the poor boy be not very happy with she since naturally the husband prefer he own son and daughter for you ought to know everything and she go on in this strain hope no doubt to persuade maxime and draw a formal promise from he she talk until they reach plassan then suddenly as the landau roll over the pavement of the faubourg she say : but look there be he mother that stout blond at the door there at the threshold of a harness-maker 's shop hang round with horse trappings and halter justine sit knit a stock take the air while the little girl and boy be play on the ground at she foot and behind they in the shadow of the shop be to be see thoma a stout dark man occupy in repair a saddle maxime lean forward without emotion simply curious he be greatly surprise at sight of this robust woman of thirty-two with so sensible and so commonplace a air in whom there be not a trace of the wild little girl with whom he have be in love when both of the same age be enter they seventeenth year perhaps a pang shot through he heart to see she plump and tranquil and bloom while he be ill and already aged i should never have recognize she he say and the landau still roll on turn into the rue de rome justine have disappear this vision of the past -- a past so different from the present -- have sink into the shadowy twilight with thoma the child and the shop at la souleiade the table be set martine have a eel from the viorne a _ saut _ rabbit and a leg of

rheumatism pascal shrug he shoulder and put a finger to he lip he go into the dining-room where felicite and maxime be seat the dinner be very friendly the sudden disquietude which have spring up in clotilde 's heart make she still more affectionate to she brother who sit beside she she attend to he want gayly force he to take the most delicate morsel twice she call back martine who be pass the dish too quickly and maxime be more and more enchant by this sister who be so good so healthy so sensible whose charm envelop he like a caress so greatly be he captivate by she that gradually a project vague at first take definite shape within he since little charle he son terrify he so greatly with he deathlike beauty he royal air of sickly imbecility why should he not take he sister clotilde to live with he the idea of have a woman in he house alarm he indeed for he be afraid of all woman have have too much experience of they in he youth but this one seem to he truly maternal and then too a good woman in he house would make a change in it which would be a desirable thing he would at least be leave no longer at the mercy of he father whom he suspect of desire he death so that he might get possession of he money at once he hatred and terror of he father decide he do not you think of marry then he ask wish to try the ground the young girl laugh oh there be no hurry she answer then suddenly look at pascal who have raise he head she add : how can i tell oh i shall never marry but felicite protest when she see she so attach to the doctor she often wish for a marriage that would separate she from he that would leave she son alone in a desert home where she herself might become all powerful mistress of everything therefore she appeal to he be it not true that a woman ought to marry that it be against nature to remain a old maid and he gravely assent without take he eye from clotilde 's face yes yes she must marry she be too sensible not to marry bah interrupted maxime would it be really sensible in she to marry in order to be unhappy perhaps there be so many ill-assorted marriage and come to a resolution he add : do not you know what you ought to

he see he sister at he bedside like a sister of charity if she consent to remain unmarried he would willingly leave she he fortune so that he father might not have it the dread which he have of solitude the need in which he should perhaps stand of have a sick-nurse make he very pathetic it would be very kind on you part and you should have no cause to repent it martine who be serve the mutton stop short in surprise and the proposition cause the same surprise at the table felicite be the first to approve feeling that the girl 's departure would further she plan she look at clotilde who be still silent and stunned as it be while dr pascal wait with a pale face oh brother brother stammer the young girl unable at first to think of anything else to say then she grandmother cry : be that all you have to say why the proposition you brother have just make you be a very advantageous one if he be afraid of take charle now why you can go with he and later on you can send for the child come come that can be very well arrange you brother make a appeal to you heart be it not true pascal that she owe he a favorable answer the doctor by a effort recover he self-possession the chill that have seize he make itself feel however in the slowness with which he speak the offer in effect be very kind clotilde as i say before be very sensible and she will accept it if it be right that she should do so the young girl greatly agitate rebel at this do you wish to send I away then master maxime be very good and i thank he from the bottom of my heart but to leave everything my god to leave all that love I all that i have love until now she make a despairing gesture indicate the place and the people take in all la souleiade but respond pascal look at she fixedly what if maxime should need you what if you have a duty to fulfil toward he she eye grow moist and she remain for a moment tremble and desperate for she alone understand the cruel vision again arise before she -- maxime helpless drive about in a little carriage by a servant like the neighbor whom she use to pity have she indeed any duty toward a brother who for fifteen year have be a stranger to she do not she duty lie where she heart be nevertheless she distress of mind continue she still suffer in the struggle listen maxime she say at last give I also time to reflect i will see be assure that i be very grateful to you and if you should one day really have need of I well i should no doubt decide to go this be all they could make she promise felicite with she usual vehemence exhaust all she effort in vain while the doctor now affect to say that she have give she word martine bring a cream without thinking of hide she joy to take away mademoiselle what a idea in order that monsieur might die of grief at find himself all alone and the dinner be delay too by this unexpected incident they be still at the dessert when half-past eight strike then maxime grow restless tap the floor with he foot and declare that he must go at the station whither they all accompany he he kiss he sister a last time say : remember do not be afraid declare felicite we be here to remind she of she promise the doctor smile and all three as soon as the train be in motion wave they handkerchief on this day after accompany the grandmother to she door dr pascal and clotilde return peacefully to la souleiade and spend a delightful evening there the constraint of the past few week the secret antagonism which have separate they seem to have vanish never have it seem so sweet to they to feel so united inseparable doubtless it be only this first pang of uneasiness suffer by they affection this threaten separation the postponement of which delighted they it be for they like a return to health after a illness a new hope of life they remain for long time in the warm night under the plane tree listen to the crystal murmur of the fountain and they do not even speak so profoundly do they enjoy the happiness of be together iv ten day later the household have fall back into its former state of unhappiness pascal and clotilde remain entire afternoon without exchange a word and there be continual outburst of ill-humor even martine be constantly out of temper the home of these three have again become a hell then suddenly the condition of affair be still further aggravate a capuchin monk of great sanctity such as often pass through the town of the south come to plassan to conduct a mission the pulpit of st saturnin resound with he burst of eloquence he be a sort of apostle a popular and fiery orator a florid speaker much give to the use of metaphor and he preach on the nothingness of modern science with a extraordinary mystical exaltation deny the reality of this world and disclose the unknown the mystery of the beyond all the devout woman of the town be full of excitement about he preach on the very first evening on which clotilde accompany by martine attend the sermon pascal notice she feverish excitement when she return on the follow day she excitement increase and she return home later have remain to pray for a hour in a dark corner of a chapel from this time she be never absent from the service return languid and with the luminous eye of a seer and the capuchin 's burning word haunt she certain of he image stir she to ecstasy she grow irritable and she seem to have conceive a feeling of anger and contempt for every one and everything around she pascal fill with uneasiness determine to have a explanation with martine he come down early one morning as she be sweep the dining-room you know that i leave you and clotilde free to go to church if that please you he say i do not believe in oppress any one 's conscience but i do not wish that you should make she sick the servant without stop in she work say in a low voice : perhaps the sick people be those who do not think that they be sick she say this with such a air of conviction that he smile yes he return i be the sick soul whose conversion you pray for while both of you be in possession of health and of perfect wisdom martine if you continue to torment I and to torment yourselve as you be do i shall grow angry he speak in so furious and so harsh a voice that the servant stop suddenly in she sweeping and look he full in the face a infinite tenderness a immense desolation pass over the face of the old maid cloister in he service and tear fill she eye and she hurry out of the room stammer : ah monsieur you do not love we then pascal fill with a overwhelming sadness give up the contest he remorse increase for have show so much tolerance for not have exercise he authority as master in direct clotilde 's education and bring up in he belief that tree grow straight if they be not interfere with he have allow she to grow up in she own way after teach she merely to read and write it be without any preconceived plan while aid he in make he research and correct he manuscript and simply by the force of circumstance that she have read everything and acquire a fondness for the natural science how bitterly he now regret he indifference what a powerful impulse he might have give to this clear mind so eager for knowledge instead of allow it to go astray and waste itself in that desire for the beyond which grandmother felicite and the good martine favor while he have occupy himself with fact endeavor to keep from go beyond the phenomenon and succeed in do so through he scientific discipline he have see she give all she thought to the unknown the mysterious it be with she a obsession a instinctive curiosity which amount to torture when she could not satisfy it there be in she a longing which nothing could appease a irresistible call toward the unattainable the unknowable even when she be a child and still more later when she grow up she go straight to the why and the how of thing she demand ultimate cause if he show she a flower she ask why this flower produce a seed why this seed would germinate then it would be the mystery of birth and death and the unknown force and god and all thing in half a dozen question she would drive he into a corner oblige he each time to acknowledge he fatal ignorance and when he no longer know what to answer she when he would get rid of she with a gesture of comic fury she would give a gay laugh of triumph and go to lose herself again in she dream in the limitless vision of all that we do not know and all that we may believe often she astounded he by she explanation she mind nourish on science start from prove truth but with such a impetus that she bound at once straight into the heaven of the legend all sort of mediator pass there angel and saint and supernatural inspiration modify matter endow it with life or again it be only one single force the soul of the world work to fuse thing and being in a final kiss of love in fifty century more she have calculate the number of they she say for the rest pascal have never before see she so excited for the past week during which she have attend the capuchin 's mission in the cathedral she have spend the day visibly in the expectation of the sermon of the evening and she go to hear it with the rapt exaltation of a girl who be go to she first rendezvous of love then on the follow day everything about she declare she detachment from the exterior life from she accustomed existence as if the visible world the necessary action of every moment be but a snare and a folly she retire within herself in the vision of what be not thus she have almost completely give up she habitual occupation abandon herself to a sort of unconquerable indolence remain for hour at a time with she hand in she lap she gaze lose in vacancy rapt in the contemplation of some far-off vision now she who have be so active so early a riser rise late appear barely in time for the second breakfast and it could not have be at she toilet that she spend these long hour for she forget she feminine coquetry and would come down with she hair scarcely comb negligently attire in a gown button awry but even thus adorable thanks to she triumphant youth the morning walk through la souleiade that she have be so fond of the race from the top to the bottom of the terrace plant with olive and almond tree the visit to the pine grove balmy with the odor of resin the long sun bath in the hot threshing yard she indulge in no more she prefer to remain shut up in she darkened room from which not a movement be to be hear then in the afternoon in the work room she would drag herself about languidly from chair to chair do nothing tired and disgusted with everything that have formerly interested she pascal be oblige to renounce she assistance a paper which he give she to copy remain three day untouch on she desk she no longer classify anything she would not have stoop down to pick up a paper from the floor more than all she abandon the pastel copy of flower from nature that she have be make to serve as plate to a work on artificial fecundation some large red mallow of a new and singular color fade in they vase before she have finish copy they and yet for a whole afternoon she work enthusiastically at a fantastic design of dream flower a extraordinary efflorescence bloom in the light of a miraculous sun a burst of golden spike-shaped ray in the center of large purple corolla resemble open heart whence shot for pistil a shower of star myriad of world streaming into the sky like a milky way ah my poor girl say the doctor to she on this day how can you lose you time in such conceit and i wait for the copy of those mallow that you have leave to die there and you will make yourself ill there be no health nor beauty even possible outside reality often now she do not answer intrench herself behind she fierce conviction not wish to dispute but doubtless he have this time touch she belief to the quick there be no reality she answer sharply the doctor amuse by this bold philosophy from this big child laugh yes i know he say we sens be fallible we know this world only through we sens consequently it be possible that the world do not exist let we open the door to madness then let we accept as possible the most absurd chimera let we live in the realm of nightmare outside of law and fact for do you not see that there be no longer any law if you suppress nature and that the only thing that give life any interest be to believe in life to love it and to put all the force of we intelligence to the better understanding of it she make a gesture of mingled indifference and bravado and the conversation drop now she be lay large stroke of blue crayon on the pastel bring out its flaming splendor in strong relief on the background of a clear summer night but two day later in consequence of a fresh discussion matter go still further amiss in the evening on leave the table pascal go up to the study to write while she remain out of door sit on the terrace hour pass by and he be surprised and uneasy when midnight strike that he have not yet hear she return to she room she would have have to pass through the study and he be very certain that she have not pass unnoticed by he go downstairs he find that martine be asleep the vestibule door be not lock and clotilde must have remain outside oblivious of the flight of time this often happen to she on these warm night but she have never before remain out so late the doctor 's uneasiness increase when he perceive on the terrace the chair now vacant in which the young girl have be sit he have expect to find she asleep in it since she be not there why have she not come in where could she have go at such a hour the night be beautiful : a September night still warm with a wide sky whose dark velvety expanse be stud with star and from the depths of this moonless sky the star shine so large and bright that they light the earth with a pale mysterious radiance he lean over the balustrade of the terrace and examine the slope and the stone step which lead down to the railroad but there be not a movement he see nothing but the round motionless top of the little olive tree the idea then occur to he that she must certainly be under the plane tree beside the fountain whose murmur water make perpetual coolness around he hurry there and find himself envelop in such thick darkness that he who know every tree be oblige to walk with outstretched hand to avoid stumbling then he grope he way through the dark pine grove still without meet any one and at last he call in a muffle voice : clotilde clotilde the darkness remain silent and impenetrable clotilde clotilde he cry again in a louder voice not a sound not a breath the very echo seem asleep he cry be drown in the infinitely soft lake of blue shadow and then he call she with all the force of he lung he return to the plane tree he go back to the pine grove beside himself with fright scour the entire domain then suddenly he find himself in the threshing yard at this cool and tranquil hour the immense yard the vast circular paved court sleep too it be so many year since grain have be thresh here that grass have spring up among the stone quickly scorch a russet brown by the sun resemble the long thread of a woolen carpet and under the tuft of this feeble vegetation the ancient pavement do not cool during the whole summer smoking from sunset exhale in the night the heat store up from so many sultry noon the yard stretch around bare and desert in the cooling atmosphere under the infinite calm of the sky and pascal be cross it to hurry to the orchard when he almost fall over a form that he have not before observe extend at full length upon the ground he utter a frightened cry what be you here clotilde do not deign even to answer she be lie on she back she hand clasp under the back of she neck she face turn toward the sky and in she pale countenance only she large shine eye be visible and here i have be torment myself and call you for a hour past do you not hear I shout she at last unclosed she lip yes then that be very senseless why do you not answer I but she fall back into she former silence refuse all explanation and with a stubborn brow keep she gaze fix steadily on the sky there come in and go to bed naughty child you will tell I to-morrow she do not stir however he beg she ten time over to go into the house but she would not move he end by sit down beside she on the short grass through which penetrate the warmth of the pavement beneath but you can not sleep out of door at least answer I what be you do here i be look and from she large eye fix and motionless she gaze seem to mount up among the star she seem wholly absorb in the contemplation of the pure starry depths of the summer sky ah master she continue in a low monotone how narrow and limited be all that you know compare to what there be surely up there yes if i do not answer you it be because i be think of you and i be fill with grief you must not think I bad in she voice there be a thrill of such tenderness that it move he profoundly he stretch himself on the grass beside she so that they elbow touch and they go on talk i greatly fear my dear that you grief be not rational it give you pain to think of I why so oh because of thing that i should find it hard to explain to you i be not a _ savante _ you have teach I much however and i have learn more myself be with you besides they be thing that i feel perhaps i might try to tell they to you as we be all alone here and the night be so beautiful she full heart overflow after hour of meditation in the peaceful confidence of the beautiful night he do not speak fear to disturb she but await she confidence in silence when i be a little girl and you use to talk to I about science it seem to I that you be speak to I of god you word burn so with faith and hope nothing seem impossible to you with science you be go to penetrate the secret of the world and make the perfect happiness of humanity a reality accord to you we be progress with giant stride each day bring its discovery its certainty ten fifty a hundred year more perhaps and the heaven would open and we should see truth face to face well the year pass and nothing open and truth recede you be a impatient girl he answer simply if ten century more be necessary we must only wait for they to pass it be true i can not wait i need to know i need to be happy at once and to know everything at once and to be perfectly and forever happy oh that be what make I suffer not to be able to reach at a bind complete knowledge not to be able to rest in perfect felicity free from scruple and doubt be it live to advance with tortoiselike pace in the darkness not to be able to enjoy a hour 's tranquillity without tremble at the thought of the come anguish no no all knowledge and all happiness in a single day science have promise they to we and if she do not give they to we then she fail in she engagement then he too begin to grow heated but what you be say be folly little girl science be not revelation it march at its human pace its very effort be its glory and then it be not true that science have promise happiness she interrupt he hastily how not true open you book up there then you know that i have read they do they not overflow with promise to read they one would think we be march on to the conquest of earth and heaven they demolish everything and they swear to replace everything -- and that by pure reason with stability and wisdom doubtless i be like the child when i be promise anything i wish that it shall be give I at once my imagination set to work and the object must be very beautiful to satisfy I but it would have be easy not to have promise anything and above all at this hour in view of my eager and painful longing it would be very ill do to tell I that nothing have be promise I he make a gesture a simple gesture of protestation and impatience in the serene and silent night in any case she continue science have sweep away all we past belief the earth be bare the heaven be empty and what do you wish that i should become even if you acquit science of have inspire the hope i have conceive for i can not live without belief and without happiness on what solid ground shall i build my house when science shall have demolish the old world and while she be wait to construct the new all the ancient city have fall to piece in this catastrophe of examination and analysis and all that remain of it be a mad population vainly seek a shelter among its ruin while anxiously look for a solid and permanent refuge where they may begin life anew you must not be surprised then at we discouragement and we impatience we can wait no longer since tardy science have fail in she promise we prefer to fall back on the old belief which for century have suffice for the happiness of the world ah that be just it he respond in a low voice we be just at the turn point at the end of the century fatigue and exhaust with the appalling accumulation of knowledge which it have set move and it be the eternal need for falsehood the eternal need for illusion which distract humanity and throw it back upon the delusive charm of the unknown since we can never know all what be the use of try to know more than we know already since the truth when we have attain it do not confer immediate and certain happiness why not be satisfy with ignorance the darkened cradle in which humanity sleep the deep sleep of infancy yes this be the aggressive return of the mysterious it be the reaction against a century of experimental research and this have to be desertion be to be expect since every need could not be satisfy at once but this be only a halt the onward march will continue up there beyond we view in the illimitable field of space for a moment they remain silent still motionless on they back they gaze lose among the myriad of world shine in the dark sky a fall star shot across the constellation of cassiopeium like a flaming arrow and the luminous universe above turn slowly on its axis in solemn splendor while from the dark earth around they arise only a faint breath like the soft warm breath of a sleep woman tell I he say in he good-natured voice do you capuchin turn you head this evening then yes she answer frankly he say from the pulpit thing that disturb I he preach against everything you have teach I and it be as if the knowledge which i owe to you transform into a poison be consume I my god what be go to become of I my poor child it be terrible that you should torture yourself in this way and yet i have be quite tranquil about you for you have a well-balanced mind -- you have a good little round clear solid headpiece as i have often tell you you will soon calm down but what confusion in the brain of other at the end of the century if you who be so sane be trouble have you not faith then she answer only by a heavy sigh assuredly view from the standpoint of happiness faith be a strong staff for the traveler to lean upon and the march become easy and tranquil when one be fortunate enough to possess it oh i no longer know whether i believe or not she cry there be day when i believe and there be other day when i side with you and with you book it be you who have disturb I it be through you i suffer and perhaps all my suffering spring from this from my revolt against you whom i love no no tell I nothing do not tell I that i shall soon calm down at this moment that would only irritate I still more i know well that you deny the supernatural the mysterious for you be only the inexplicable even you concede that we shall never know all and therefore you consider that the only interest life can have be the continual conquest over the unknown the eternal effort to know more ah i know too much already to believe you have already succeed but too well in shake my faith and there be time when it seem to I that this will kill I he take she hand that lay on the still warm grass and press it hard no no it be life that frighten you little girl and how right you be in say that happiness consist in continual effort for from this time forward tranquil ignorance be impossible there be no halt to be look for no tranquillity in renunciation and wilful blindness we must go on go on in any case with life which go on always everything that be propose a return to the past to dead religion patch up religion arrange to suit new want be a snare learn to know life then to love it live it as it ought to be live -- that be the only wisdom but she shake off he hand angrily and she voice tremble with vexation life be horrible how do you wish I to live it tranquil and happy it be a terrible light that you science throw upon the world you analysis open up all the wound of humanity to display they horror you tell everything you speak too plainly you leave we nothing but disgust for people and for thing without any possible consolation he interrupt she with a cry of ardent conviction we tell everything ah yes in order to know everything and to remedy everything she anger rise and she sit erect if even equality and justice exist in you nature -- but you acknowledge it yourself life be for the strongest the weak infallibly perish because he be weak -- there be no two being equal either in health in beauty or intelligence everything be leave to haphazard meeting to the chance of selection and everything fall into ruin when grand and sacred justice cease to exist it be true he say in a undertone as if speak to himself there be no such thing as equality no society base upon it could continue to exist for century man think to remedy evil by character but that idea be be explode and now they propose justice be nature just i think she logical rather logic be perhaps a natural and higher justice go straight to the sum of the common labor to the grand final labor then it be justice she cry that crush the individual for the happiness of the race that destroy a enfeebled species to fatten the victorious species no no that be crime there be in that only foulness and murder he be right this evening in the church the earth be corrupt science only serve to show its rottenness it be on high that we must all seek a refuge oh master i entreat you let I save myself let I save you she burst into tear and the sound of she sob rise despairingly on the stillness of the night he try in vain to soothe she she voice dominate he listen to I master you know that i love you for you be everything to I and it be you who be the cause of all my suffering i can scarcely endure it when i think that we be not in accord that we should be separate forever if we be both to die to-morrow why will you not believe he still try to reason with she come do not be foolish my dear -- but she throw herself on she knee she seize he by the hand she cling to he with a feverish force and she sob louder and louder in such a clamor of despair that the dark field afar off be startle by it listen to I he say it in the church you must change you life and do penance you must burn everything belong to you past error -- you book you papers you manuscript make this sacrifice master i entreat it of you on my knee and you will see the delightful existence we shall lead together at last he rebel no this be too much be silent if you listen to I master you will do what i wish i assure you that i be horribly unhappy even in loving you as i love you there be something want in we affection so far it have be profound but unavailing and i have a irresistible longing to fill it oh with all that be divine and eternal what can be want to we but god kneel down and pray with I with a abrupt movement he release himself angry in he turn be silent you be talk nonsense i have leave you free leave I free master master it be we happiness that i desire i will take you far far away we will go to some solitude to live there in god be silent no never then they remain for a moment confront each other mute and menacing around they stretch la souleiade in the deep silence of the night with the light shadow of its olive tree the darkness of its pine and plane tree in which the saddened voice of the fountain be singing and above they head it seem as if the spacious sky stud with star shudder and grow pale although the dawn be still far off clotilde raise she arm as if to point to this infinite shudder sky but with a quick gesture pascal seize she hand and draw it down toward the earth in he and no word further be speak they be beside themselves with rage and hate the quarrel be fierce and bitter she draw she hand away abruptly and spring backward like some proud untamable animal rearing then she rush quickly through the darkness toward the house he hear the patter of she little boot on the stone of the yard deaden afterward by the sand of the walk he on he side already grieve and uneasy call she back in urgent tone but she run on without answer without hear alarmed and with a heavy heart he hurry after she and round the clump of plane tree just in time to see she rush into the house like a whirlwind he dart in after she run up the stair and strike against the door of she room which she violently bolt and here he stop and grow calm by a strong effort resist the desire to cry out to call she again to break in the door so as to see she once more to convince she to have she all to himself for a moment he remain motionless chill by the deathlike silence of the room from which not the faintest sound issue doubtless she have throw herself on the bed and be stifle she cry and she sob in the pillow he determine at last to go downstairs again and close the hall door and then he return softly and listen wait for some sound of moan and day be break when he go disconsolately to bed choke back he tear thenceforward it be war without mercy pascal feel himself spy upon trap menaced he be no longer master of he house he have no longer any home the enemy be always there force he to be constantly on he guard to lock up everything one after the other two vial of nerve-substance which he have compound be find in fragment and he be oblige to barricade himself in he room where he could be hear pound for day together without show himself even at mealtime he no longer take clotilde with he on he visit day because she discourage he patient by she attitude of aggressive incredulity but from the moment he leave the house the doctor have only one desire -- to return to it quickly for he tremble lest he should find he lock force and he drawer rifle on he return he no longer employ the young girl to classify and copy he note for several of they have disappear as if they have be carry away by the wind he do not even venture to employ she to correct he proof have ascertain that she have cut out of a article a entire passage the sentiment of which offend she catholic belief and thus she remain idle prowl about the room and have a abundance of time to watch for a occasion which would put in she possession the key of the large press this be she dream the plan which she revolve in she mind during she long silence while she eye shine and she hand burn with fever -- to have the key to open the press to take and burn everything in a _ auto da fe _ which would be please to god a few page of manuscript forget by he on a corner of the table while he go to wash he hand and put on he coat have disappear leave behind only a little heap of ash in the fireplace he could no longer leave a scrap of paper about he carry away everything he hide everything one evening when he have remain late with a patient as he be return home in the dusk a wild terror seize he at the faubourg at sight of a thick black smoke rise up in cloud that darken the heaven be it not la souleiade that be burn down set on fire by the bonfire make with he papers he run toward the house and be reassure only on see in a neighboring field a fire of root burn slowly but how terrible be the torture of the scientist who feel himself menace in this way in the labor of he intellect the discovery which he have make the writings which he have count upon leave behind he these be he pride they be creature of he blood -- he child -- and whoever destroy whoever burn they burn a part of himself especially in this perpetual lie in wait for the creature of he brain be pascal tortured by the thought that the enemy be in he house install in he very heart and that he love she in spite of everything this creature whom he have make what she be he be leave disarm without possible defense not wish to act and have no other resource than to watch with vigilance on all side the investment be close around he he fancy he feel the little pilfering hand steal into he pocket he have no longer any tranquillity even with the door close for he fear that he be be rob through the crevice but unhappy child he cry one day i love but you in the world and you be kill I and yet you love I too you act in this way because you love I and it be abominable it would be better to have do with it all at once and throw ourselves into the river with a stone tie around we neck she do not answer but she dauntless eye say ardently that she would willingly die on the instant if it be with he and if i should suddenly die to-night what would happen to-morrow you would empty the press you would empty the drawer you would make a great heap of all my work and burn they you would would you not do you know that that would be a real murder as much as if you assassinate some one and what abominable cowardice to kill the thought no she say at last in a low voice to kill evil to prevent it from spread and spring up again all they explanation only serve to kindle anew they anger and they have terrible one and one evening when old mme rougon have chance in on one of these quarrel she remain alone with pascal after clotilde have flee to hide herself in she room there be silence for a moment in spite of the heartbroken air which she have assume a wicked joy shone in the depths of she sparkling eye but you unhappy house be a hell she cry at last the doctor avoid a answer by a gesture he have always feel that he mother back the young girl inflame she religious faith utilize this ferment of revolt to bring trouble into he house he be not deceive he know perfectly well that the two woman have see each other during the day and that he owe to this meeting to a skilful embittering of clotilde 's mind the frightful scene at which he still tremble doubtless he mother have come to learn what mischief have be work and to see if the _ denouement _ be not at last at hand thing can not go on in this way she resume why do you not separate since you can no longer agree you ought to send she to she brother maxime he write to I not long since ask she again he straighten himself pale and determine to part angry with each other ah no no that would be a eternal remorse a incurable wound if she must one day go away i wish that we may be able to love each other at a distance but why go away neither of we complain of the other felicite feel that she have be too hasty therefore she assume she hypocritical conciliate air of course if it please you both to quarrel no one have anything to say in the matter only my poor friend permit I in that case to say that i think clotilde be not altogether in the wrong you force I to confess that i see she a little while ago yes it be better that you should know notwithstanding my promise to be silent well she be not happy she make a great many complaint and you may imagine that i scold she and preach complete submission to she but that do not prevent I from be unable to understand you myself and from think that you do everything you can to make yourself unhappy she sit down in a corner of the room and oblige he to sit down with she seeming delighted to have he here alone at she mercy she have already more than once before try to force he to a explanation in this way but he have always avoid it although she have tortured he for year past and he know she thoroughly he yet remain a deferential son he have swear never to abandon this stubbornly respectful attitude thus the moment she touch certain subject he take refuge in absolute silence come she continue i can understand that you should not wish to yield to clotilde but to I how if i be to entreat you to make I the sacrifice of all those abominable papers which be there in the press consider for a instant if you should die suddenly and those papers should fall into strange hand we should all be disgrace you would not wish that would you what be you object then why do you persist in so dangerous a game promise I that you will burn they he remain silent for a time but at last he answer : mother i have already beg of you never to speak on that subject i can not do what you ask but at least she cry give I a reason any one would think we family be as indifferent to you as that drive of ox pass below there yet you belong to it oh i know you do all you can not to belong to it i myself be sometimes astonish at you i ask myself where you can have come from but for all that it be very wicked of you to run this risk without stop to think of the grief you be cause to I you mother it be simply wicked he grow still paler and yield for a instant to he desire to defend himself in spite of he determination to keep silent he say : you be hard you be wrong i have always believe in the necessity the absolute efficacy of truth it be true that i tell the truth about other and about myself and it be because i believe firmly that in tell the truth i do the only good possible in the first place those papers be not intend for the public they be only personal note which it would be painful to I to part with and then i know well that you would not burn only they -- all my other work would also be throw into the fire would they not and that be what i do not wish do you understand never while i live shall a line of my write be destroy here but he already regret have say so much for he see that she be urge he lead he on to the cruel explanation she desire then finish and tell I what it be that you reproach we with yes I for instance what do you reproach I with not with have bring you up with so much difficulty ah fortune be slow to win if we enjoy a little happiness now we have earn it hard since you have see everything and since you put down everything in you papers you can testify with truth that the family have render greater service to other than it have ever receive on two occasion but for we plassan would have be in a fine pickle and it be perfectly natural that we should have reap only ingratitude and envy to the extent that even to-day the whole town would be enchant with a scandal that should bespatter we with mud you can not wish that and i be sure that you will do justice to the dignity of my attitude since the fall of the empire and the misfortune from which france will no doubt never recover let france rest mother he say speaking again for she have touch the spot where she know he be most sensitive france be tenacious of life and i think she be go to astonish the world by the rapidity of she convalescence true she have many element of corruption i have not seek to hide they i have rather perhaps expose they to view but you greatly misunderstand I if you imagine that i believe in she final dissolution because i point out she wound and she lesion i believe in the life which ceaselessly eliminate hurtful substance which make new flesh to fill the hole eat away by gangrene which infallibly advance toward health toward constant renovation amid impurity and death he be grow excited and he be conscious of it and make a angry gesture he speak no more he mother have recourse to tear a few little tear which come with difficulty and which be quickly dry and the fear which sadden she old age return to she and she entreat he to make he peace with god if only out of regard for the family have she not give a example of courage ever since the downfall of the empire do not all plassan the quarter of st marc the old quarter and the new town render homage to the noble attitude she maintain in she fall all she ask be to be help she demand from all she child a effort like she own thus she cite the example of eugene the great man who have fall from so lofty a height and who resign himself to be a simple deputy defend until he latest breath the fall government from which he have derive he glory she be also full of eulogy of aristide who have never lose hope who have reconquer under the new government a exalted position in spite of the terrible and unjust catastrophe which have for a moment bury he under the ruin of the union universelle and would he pascal hold himself aloof would he do nothing that she might die in peace in the joy of the final triumph of the rougon he who be so intelligent so affectionate so good he would go to mass would he not next Sunday and he would burn all those vile papers only to think of which make she ill she entreat command threaten but he no longer answer she calm and invincible in he attitude of perfect deference he wish to have no discussion he know she too well either to hope to convince she or to venture to discuss the past with she why she cry when she see that he be not to be move you do not belong to we i have always say so you be a disgrace to we he bent he head and say : mother when you reflect you will forgive I on this day felicite be beside herself with rage when she go away and when she meet martine at the door of the house in front of the plane tree she unburden she mind to she without know that pascal who have just go into he room hear all she give vent to she resentment vow in spite of everything that she would in the end succeed in obtain possession of the papers and destroy they since he do not wish to make the sacrifice but what turn the doctor cold be the manner in which martine in a subdue voice soothe she she be evidently she accomplice she repeat that it be necessary to wait not to do anything hastily that mademoiselle and she have take a vow to get the better of monsieur by not leave he a hour 's peace they have swear it they would reconcile he with the good god because it be not possible that a upright man like monsieur should remain without religion and the voice of the two woman become lower and lower until they finally sink to a whisper a indistinct murmur of gossip and plot of which he catch only a word here and there order give measure to be take a invasion of he personal liberty when he mother at last depart with she light step and slender youthful figure he see that she go away very well satisfied then come a moment of weakness of utter despair pascal drop into a chair and ask himself what be the use of struggle since the only being he love ally themselves against he martine who would have throw herself into the fire at a word from he betray he in this way for he good and clotilde league with this servant plot with she against he in hole and corner seek she aid to set trap for he now he be indeed alone he have around he only traitress who poison the very air he breathe but these two still love he he might perhaps have succeed in soften they but when he know that he mother urge they on he understand they fierce persistence and he give up the hope of win they back with the timidity of a man who have spend he life in study aloof from woman notwithstanding he secret passion the thought that they be there to oppose he to attempt to bend he to they will overwhelm he he feel that some one of they be always behind he even when he shut himself up in he room he fancy that they be on the other side of the wall and he be constantly haunt by the idea that they would rob he of he thought if they could perceive it in he brain before he should have formulate it this be assuredly the period in he life in which dr pascal be most unhappy to live constantly on the defensive as he be oblige to do crushed he and it seem to he as if the ground on which he house stand be no longer he as if it be recede from beneath he foot he now regret keenly that he have not marry and that he have no child have not he himself be afraid of life and have he not be well punish for he selfishness this regret for not have child now never leave he he eye now fill with tear whenever he meet on the road bright-eyed little girl who smile at he true clotilde be there but he affection for she be of a different kind -- cross at present by storm -- not a calm infinitely sweet affection like that for a child with which he might have soothe he lacerated heart and then no doubt what he desire in he isolation feeling that he day be draw to a end be above all continuance in a child he would survive he would live forever the more he suffer the greater the consolation he would have find in bequeath this suffering in the faith which he still have in life he consider himself indemnify for the physiological defect of he family but even the thought that heredity sometimes pass over a generation and that the disorder of he ancestor might reappear in a child of he do not deter he and this unknown child in spite of the old corrupt stock in spite of the long succession of execrable relation he desire ardently at certain time : as one desire unexpected gain rare happiness the stroke of fortune which be to console and enrich forever in the shock which he other affection have receive he heart bleed because it be too late one sultry night toward the end of September pascal find himself unable to sleep he open one of the window of he room the sky be dark some storm must be pass in the distance for there be a continuous rumble of thunder he could distinguish vaguely the dark mass of the plane tree which occasional flash of lightning detach in a dull green from the darkness he soul be full of anguish he live over again the last unhappy day day of fresh quarrel of torture cause by act of treachery by suspicion which grow stronger every day when a sudden recollection make he start in he fear of be rob he have finally adopt the plan of carry the key of the large press in he pocket but this afternoon oppress by the heat he have take off he jacket and he remember have see clotilde hang it up on a nail in the study a sudden pang of terror shot through he sharp and cold as a steel point if she have feel the key in the pocket she have steal it he hasten to search the jacket which he have a little before throw upon a chair the key be not here at this very moment he be be rob he have the clear conviction of it two o'clock strike he do not again dress himself but remain in he trousers only with he bare foot thrust into slipper he chest bare under he unfastened nightshirt he hastily push open the door and rush into the workroom he candle in he hand ah i know it he cry thief assassin it be true clotilde be there undress like himself she bare foot cover by canvas slipper she leg bare she arm bare she shoulder bare clothe only in she chemise and a short skirt through caution she have not bring a candle she have contented herself with open one of the window shutter and the continual lightning flash of the storm which be pass southward in the dark sky suffice she bathing everything in a livid phosphorescence the old press with its broad side be wide open already she have empty the top shelf take down the papers in armful and throw they on the long table in the middle of the room where they lay in a confused heap and with feverish haste fear lest she should not have the time to burn they she be make they up into bundle intend to hide they and send they afterward to she grandmother when the sudden flare of the candle lighting up the room cause she to stop short in a attitude of surprise and resistance you rob I you assassinate I repeat pascal furiously she still hold one of the bundle in she bare arm he wish to take it away from she but she press it to she with all she strength obstinately resolve upon she work of destruction without show confusion or repentance like a combatant who have right upon he side then madly blindly he throw himself upon she and they struggle together he clutch she bare flesh so that he hurt she kill I she gasp kill I or i shall destroy everything he hold she close to he with so rough a grasp that she could scarcely breathe cry : when a child steal it be punish a few drop of blood appear and trickle down she round shoulder where a abrasion have cut the delicate satin skin and on the instant see she so breathless so divine in she virginal slender height with she taper limb she supple arm she slim body with its slender firm throat he release she by a last effort he tear the package from she and you shall help I to put they all up there again by heaven come here : begin by arrange they on the table obey I do you hear yes master she approach and help he to arrange the papers subjugate crush by this masculine grasp which have enter into she flesh as it be the candle which flare up in the heavy night air light they and the distant rolling of the thunder still continue the window face the storm seem on fire v for a instant pascal look at the papers the heap of which seem enormous lie thus in disorder on the long table that stand in the middle of the room in the confusion several of the blue paper envelope have burst open and they contents have fall out -- letter newspaper clipping document on stamped paper and manuscript note he be already mechanically begin to seek out the name write on the envelope in large character to classify the package again when with a abrupt gesture he emerge from the somber meditation into which he have fall and turn to clotilde who stand wait pale silent and erect he say : listen to I i have always forbid you to read these papers and i know that you have obey I yes i have scruple of delicacy it be not that you be a ignorant girl like so many other for i have allow you to learn everything concern man and woman which be assuredly bad only for bad nature but to what end disclose to you too early these terrible truth of human life i have therefore spare you the history of we family which be the history of every family of all humanity a great deal of evil and a great deal of good he pause as if to confirm himself in he resolution and then resume quite calmly and with supreme energy : you be twenty-five year old you ought to know and then the life we be lead be no longer possible you live and you make I live in a constant nightmare with you ecstatic dream i prefer to show you the reality however execrable it may be perhaps the blow which it will inflict upon you will make of you the woman you ought to be we will classify these papers again together and read they and learn from they a terrible lesson of life then as she still continue motionless he resume : come we must be able to see well light those other two candle there he be seize by a desire for light a flood of light he would have desire the blinding light of the sun and think that the light of the three candle be not sufficient he go into he room for a pair of three-branched candelabrum which be there the nine candle be blaze yet neither of they in they disorder -- he with he chest bare she with she left shoulder stain with blood she throat and arm bare -- see the other it be past two o'clock but neither of they have any consciousness of the hour they be go to spend the night in this eager desire for knowledge without feel the need of sleep outside time and space the muttering of the storm which through the open window they could see gathering grow louder and louder clotilde have never before see in pascal 's eye the feverish light which burn in they now he have be overwork himself for some time past and he mental suffering make he at time abrupt in spite of he good-natured complacency but it seem as if a infinite tenderness tremble with fraternal pity awake within he now that he be about to plunge into the painful truth of existence and it be something emanate from himself something very great and very good which be to render innocuous the terrible avalanche of fact which be impend he be determine that he would reveal everything since it be necessary that he should do so in order to remedy everything be not this a unanswerable a final argument for evolution the story of these being who be so near to they such be life and it must be live doubtless she would emerge from it like the steel temper by the fire full of tolerance and courage they be set you against I he resume they be make you commit abominable act and i wish to restore you conscience to you when you know you will judge and you will act come here and read with I she obey but these papers about which she grandmother have speak so angrily frighten she a little while a curiosity that grow with every moment awake within she and then dominate though she be by the virile authority which have just constrain and subjugate she she do not yet yield but might she not listen to he read with he do she not retain the right to refuse or to give herself afterward he speak at last will you come yes master i will he show she first the genealogical tree of the rougon-macquart he do not usually lock it in the press but keep it in the desk in he room from which he have take it when he go there for the candelabrum for more than twenty year past he have keep it up to date inscribe the birth death marriage and other important event that have take place in the family make brief note in each case in accordance with he theory of heredity it be a large sheet of paper yellow with age with fold cut by wear on which be draw boldly a symbolical tree whose branch spread and subdivide into five row of broad leaf and each leaf bear a name and contain in minute handwriting a biography a hereditary case a scientist 's joy take possession of the doctor at sight of this labor of twenty year in which the law of heredity establish by he be so clearly and so completely apply look child you know enough about the matter you have copy enough of my note to understand be it not beautiful a document so complete so conclusive in which there be not a gap it be like a experiment make in the laboratory a problem state and solve on the blackboard you see below the trunk the common stock aunt dide then the three branch issue from it the legitimate branch pierre rougon and the two illegitimate branch ursule macquart and antoine macquart then new branch arise and ramify on one side maxime clotilde and victor the three child of saccard and angelique the daughter of sidonie rougon on the other pauline the daughter of lisa macquart and claude jacque etienne and anna the four child of gervaise she sister there at the extremity be jean they brother and here in the middle you see what i call the knot the legitimate issue and the illegitimate issue unite in marthe rougon and she cousin francoi mouret to give rise to three new branch octave serge and desiree mouret while there be also the issue of ursule and the hatter mouret silvere whose tragic death you know helene and she daughter jean finally at the top be the latest offshoot we poor charle you brother maxime 's son and two other child who be dead jacque loui the son of claude lantier and louiset the son of anna coupeau in all five generation a human tree which for five spring already five springtide of humanity have send forth shoot at the impulse of the sap of eternal life he become more and more animated point out each case on the sheet of old yellow paper as if it be a anatomical chart and as i have already say everything be here you see in direct heredity the differentiation that of the mother silvere lisa desiree jacques louiset yourself that of the father sidonie francoi gervaise octave jacque loui then there be the three case of cross : by conjugation ursule aristide anna victor by dissemination maxime serge etienne by fusion antoine eugene claude i even note a fourth case a very remarkable one a even cross pierre and pauline and variety be establish the differentiation of the mother for example often accord with the physical resemblance of the father or it be the contrary which take place so that in the cross the physical and mental predominance remain with one parent or the other accord to circumstance then here be indirect heredity that of the collateral branch i have but one well establish example of this the striking personal resemblance of octave mouret to he uncle eugene rougon i have also but one example of transmission by influence anna the daughter of gervaise and coupeau who bear a striking resemblance especially in she childhood to lantier she mother 's first lover but what i be very rich in be in example of reversion to the original stock -- the three finest case marthe jeanne and charle resemble aunt dide the resemblance thus pass over one two and three generation this be certainly exceptional for i scarcely believe in atavism it seem to I that the new element bring by the partner accident and the infinite variety of crossing must rapidly efface particular characteristic so as to bring back the individual to the general type and there remain variation -- helene jean angelique this be the combination the chemical mixture in which the physical and mental characteristic of the parent be blended without any of they trait seem to reappear in the new be there be silence for a moment clotilde have listen to

open window a delicious odor of moist earth in the calm air the candle be burn out with a tall tranquil flame ah say clotilde simply with a gesture of discouragement what be we to become finally she have declare it to herself one night in the threshing yard life be horrible how could one live peaceful and happy it be a terrible light that science throw on the world analysis search every wound of humanity in order to expose its horror and now he have speak still more bluntly he have increase the disgust which she have for person and thing pitilessly dissect she family the muddy torrent have roll on before she for nearly three hour and she have hear the most dreadful revelation the harsh and terrible truth about she people she people who be so dear to she whom it be she duty to love she

blossoming of the human tree the blow have be so rude that she could not yet recover from it stun as she be by the revelation of she whole family history make to she in this way at a stroke and yet the lesson be render innocuous so to say by something great and good a breath of profound humanity which have bear she through it nothing bad have come to she from it she feel herself beat by a sharp sea wind the storm wind which strengthen and expand the lung he have reveal everything speak freely even of he mother without judge she continue to preserve toward she he deferential attitude as a scientist who do not judge event to tell everything in order to know everything in order to remedy everything be not this the cry which he have utter on that beautiful summer night and by the very excess of what he have just reveal to she she remain shake blind by this too strong light but understand he at last and confess to herself that he be attempt in this a immense work in spite of everything it be a cry of health of hope in the future he speak as a benefactor who since heredity make the world wish to fix its law in order to control it and to make a new and happy world be there then only mud in this overflow stream whose sluice he have open how much gold have pass mingled with the grass and the flower on its border hundred of being be still fly swiftly before she and she be haunt by good and charming face delicate girlish profile by the serene beauty of woman all passion bleed there heart swell with every tender rapture they be numerous the jeanne the angelique the pauline the marthe the gervaise the helene they and other even those who be least good even terrible man the worst of the band show a brotherhood with humanity and it be precisely this breath which she have feel pass this broad current of sympathy that he have introduce naturally into he exact scientific lesson he do not seem to be move he preserve the impersonal and correct attitude of the demonstrator but within he what tender suffer what a fever of devotion what a give up of he whole be to the happiness of other he entire work construct with such mathematical precision be steep in this fraternal suffering even in its most cruel irony have he not just speak of the animal like a elder brother of the wretched living being that suffer suffer exasperate he he wrath be because of he too lofty dream and he have become harsh only in he hatred of the factitious and the transitory dream of work not for the polite society of a time but for all humanity in the gravest hour of its history perhaps even it be this revolt against the vulgarity of the time which have make he throw himself in bold defiance into theory and they application and the work remain human overflow as it be with a infinite pity for being and thing besides be it not life there be no absolute evil most often a virtue present itself side by side with a defect no man be bad to every one each man make the happiness of some one so that when one do not view thing from a single standpoint only one recognize in the end the utility of every human be those who believe in god should say to themselves that if they god do not strike the wicked dead it be because he see he work in its totality and that he can not descend to the individual labor end to begin anew the living as a whole continue in spite of everything admirable in they courage and they industry and love of life prevail over all this giant labor of man this obstinacy in living be they excuse be redemption and then from a great height the eye see only this continual struggle and a great deal of good in spite of everything even though there might be a great deal of evil one share the general indulgence one pardon one have only a infinite pity and a ardent charity the haven be surely there wait those who have lose faith in dogma who wish to understand the meaning of they life in the midst of the apparent iniquity of the world one must live for the effort of live for the stone to be carry to the distant and unknown work and the only possible peace in the world be in the joy of make this effort another hour pass the entire night have fly by in this terrible lesson of life without either pascal or clotilde be conscious of where they be or of the flight of time and he overwork for some time past and worn out by the life

moment face to face look at each other day be break a dawn of exquisite purity far off in the vast clear sky wash by the storm not a cloud now stain the pale azure tinge with rose color all the cheerful sound of awaken life in the rain-drenched field come in through the window while the candle burn down to the socket pale in the grow light answer be you with I altogether with I for a moment he think she be go to throw herself on he neck and burst into tear a sudden impulse seem to impel she but they see each other in they semi-nudity she who have not notice it before be now conscious that she be only half dress that she arm be bare she shoulder bare cover only by the scatter lock of she unbound hair and on she right shoulder near the armpit on lower she eye she perceive again the few drop of blood of the bruise which he have give she when he have grasp she roughly in struggle to master she then a extraordinary confusion take possession of she a certainty that she be go to be vanquish as if by this grasp he have become she master and forever this sensation be prolonged she be seize and draw on without the consent of she will by a irresistible impulse to submit abruptly clotilde straighten herself struggle with herself wish to reflect and to recover herself she press she bare arm against she naked throat all the blood in she body rush to she skin in a rosy blush of shame then in she divine and slender grace she turn to flee master master let I go -- i will see -- with the swiftness of alarmed maidenhood she take refuge in she chamber as she have do once before he hear she lock the door hastily with a double turn of the key he remain alone and he ask himself suddenly seize by infinite discouragement and sadness if he have do right in speak if the truth would germinate in this dear and adore creature and bear one day a harvest of happiness vi the day wear on October begin with magnificent weather -- a sultry autumn in which the fervid heat of summer be prolong with a cloudless sky then the weather change fierce wind begin to blow and a last storm channel gully in the hillside and to the melancholy household at la souleiade the approach of winter seem to have bring a infinite sadness it be a new hell there be no more violent quarrel between pascal and clotilde the door be no longer slam voice raise in dispute no longer oblige martine to go continually upstairs to listen outside the door they scarcely speak to each other now and not a single word have be exchange between they regard the midnight scene although week have pass since it have take place he through a inexplicable scruple a strange delicacy of which he be not himself conscious do not wish to renew the conversation and to demand the answer which he expect -- a promise of faith in he and of submission she after the great moral shock which have completely transform she still reflect hesitated struggle fight against herself put off she decision in order not to surrender in she instinctive rebelliousness and the misunderstanding continue in the midst of the mournful silence of the miserable house where there be no longer any happiness during all this time pascal suffer terribly without make any complaint he have sink into a dull distrust imagine that he be still be watch and that if they seem to leave he at peace it be only in order to concoct in secret the darkest plot he uneasiness increase even and he expect every day some catastrophe to happen -- the earth suddenly to open and swallow up he papers la souleiade itself to be raze to the ground carry away bodily scatter to the wind the persecution against he thought against he moral and intellectual life in thus hide itself and so render he helpless to defend himself become so intolerable to he that he go to bed every night in a fever he would often start and turn round suddenly think he be go to surprise the enemy behind he engage in some piece of treachery to find nothing there but the shadow of he own fear at other time seize by some suspicion he would remain on the watch for hour together hide behind he blind or lie in wait in a passage but not a soul stir he hear nothing but the violent beating of he heart he fear keep he in a state of constant agitation he never go to bed at night without visit every room he no longer sleep or if he do he would waken with a start at the slightest noise ready to defend himself and what still further aggravate pascal 's suffering be the constant the ever more bitter thought that the wound be inflict upon he by the only creature he love in the world the adore clotilde whom for twenty year he have see grow in beauty and in grace whose life have hitherto bloom like a beautiful flower perfume he she great god for whom he heart be full of affection whom he have never analyze she who have become he joy he courage he hope in whose young life he live over again when she pass by with she delicate neck so round so fresh he be invigorated bath in health and joy as at the come of spring he whole life besides explain this invasion this subjugation of he be by the young girl who have enter into he heart while she be still a little child and who as she grow up have gradually take possession of the whole place since he have settle at plassan he have lead a blest existence wrap up in he book far from woman the only passion he be ever know to have have be he love for the lady who have die whose finger tip he have never kiss he have not live he have within he a reserve of youthfulness of vigor whose surge flood now clamor rebelliously at the menace of approach age he would have become attach to a animal a stray dog that he have chance to pick up in the street and that have lick he hand and it be this child whom he love all at once become a adorable woman who now distract he who tortured he by she hostility pascal so gay so kind now become insupportably gloomy and harsh he grow angry at the slightest word he would push aside the astonished martine who would look up at he with the submissive eye of a beaten animal from morning till night he go about the gloomy house carry he misery about with he with so forbid a countenance that no one venture to speak to he he never take clotilde with he now on he visit but go alone and thus it be that he return home one afternoon he mind distract because of a accident which have happen have on he conscience as a physician the death of a man he have go to give a hypodermic injection to lafouasse the tavern keeper whose ataxia have within a short time make such rapid progress that he regard he as doom but notwithstanding pascal still fight obstinately against the disease continue the treatment and as ill luck would have it on this day the little syringe have catch up at the bottom of the vial a impure particle which have escape the filter immediately a drop of blood appear to complete he misfortune he have puncture a vein he be at once alarmed see the tavern keeper turn pale and gasp for breath while large drop of cold perspiration break out upon he face then he understand death come as if by a stroke of lightning the lip turn blue the face black it be a embolism he have nothing to blame but the insufficiency of he preparation he still rude method no doubt lafouasse have be doom he could not perhaps have live six month longer and that in the midst of atrocious suffering but the brutal fact of this terrible death be none the less there and what despair regret what rage against impotent and murderous science and what a shock to he faith he return home livid and do not make he appearance again until the follow day after have remain sixteen hour shut up in he room lie in a semi-stupor on the bed across which he have throw himself dress as he be on the afternoon of this day clotilde who be sit beside he in the study sew venture to break the oppressive silence she look up and see he turn over the leaf of a book wearily search for some information which he be unable to find master be you ill why do you not tell I if you be i would take care of you he keep he eye bent upon the book and mutter : what do it matter to you whether i be ill or not i need no one to take care of I she resume in a conciliate voice : if you have trouble and can tell they to I it would perhaps be a relief to you to do so yesterday you come in look so sad you must not allow yourself to be cast down in that way i have spend a very anxious night i come to you door three time to listen torment by the idea that you be suffer gently as she speak she word be like the cut of a whip in he weak and nervous condition a sudden access of rage make he push away the book and rise up tremble so you spy upon I then i can not even retire to my room without people come to glue they ear to the wall yes you listen even to the beating of my heart you watch for my death to pillage and burn everything here he voice rise and all he unjust suffering vent itself in complaint and threat i forbid you to occupy yourself about I be there nothing else that you have to say to I have you reflect can you put you hand in mine loyally and say to I that we be in accord she do not answer she only continue to look at he with she large clear eye frankly declare that she would not surrender yet while he exasperate more and more by this attitude lose all self-control go away go away he stammer point to the door i do not wish you to remain near I i do not wish to have enemy near I i do not wish you to remain near I to drive I mad she rise very pale and go at once out of the room without look behind carry she work with she during the month which follow pascal take refuge in furious and incessant work he now remain obstinately for whole day at a time alone in the study sometimes pass even the night there go over old document to revise all he work on heredity it seem as if a sort of frenzy have seize he to assure himself of the legitimacy of he hope to force science to give he the certainty that humanity could be remake -- make a higher a healthy humanity he no longer leave the house he abandon he patient even and live among he papers without air or exercise and after a month of this overwork which exhaust he without appease he domestic torment he fall into such a state of nervous exhaustion that illness for some time latent declare itself at last with alarming violence pascal when he rise in the morning feel wear out with fatigue wearier and less refresh than he have be on go to bed the night before he constantly have pain all over he body he limb fail he after five minute ' walk the slightest exertion tire he the least movement cause he intense pain at time the floor seem suddenly to sway beneath he foot he have a constant buzz in he ear flash of light dazzle he eye he take a loathing for wine he have no longer any appetite and he digestion be seriously impaired then in the midst of the apathy of he constantly increase idleness he would have sudden fit of aimless activity the equilibrium be destroy he have at time outbreak of nervous irritability without any cause the slightest emotion bring tear to he eye finally he would shut himself up in he room and give way to paroxysm of despair so violent that he would sob for hour at a time without any immediate cause of grief overwhelm simply by the immense sadness of thing in the early part of December pascal have a severe attack of neuralgia violent pain in the bone of the skull make he feel at time as if he head must split old mme rougon who have be inform of he illness come to inquire after she son but she go straight to the kitchen wish to have a talk with martine first the latter with a heart-broken and terrify air say to she that monsieur must certainly be go mad and she tell she of he singular behavior the continual tramp about in he room the lock of all the drawer the round which he make from the top to the bottom of the house until two o'clock in the morning tear fill she eye and she at last hazard the opinion that monsieur must be possess with a devil and that it would be well to notify the cure of st saturnin so good a man she say a man for whom one would let one 's self be cut in piece how unfortunate it be that one can not get he to go to church for that would certainly cure he at once clotilde who have hear she grandmother 's voice enter at this moment she too wander through the empty room spend most of she time in the desert apartment on the ground floor she do not speak however but only listen with she thoughtful and expectant air ah goodday it be you my dear martine tell I that pascal be possess with a devil that be indeed my opinion also only the devil be call pride he think that he know everything he be pope and emperor in one and naturally it exasperate he when people do not agree with he she shrug she shoulder with supreme disdain as for I all that would only make I laugh if it be not so sad a fellow who know nothing about anything who have always be wrap up in he book who have not live put he in a drawing-room and he would know as little how to act as a new-born babe and as for woman he do not even know what they be forget to whom she be speak a young girl and a servant she lower she voice and say confidentially : well one pay for be too sensible too neither a wife nor a sweetheart nor anything that be what have finally turn he brain clotilde do not move she only lower she eyelid slowly over she large thoughtful eye then she raise they again maintain she impenetrable countenance unwilling unable perhaps to give expression to what be pass within she this be no doubt all still confuse a complete evolution a great change which be take place and which she herself do not clearly understand he be upstairs be he not resume felicite i have come to see he for this must end it be too stupid and she go upstairs while martine return to she saucepan and clotilde go to wander again through the empty house upstairs in the study pascal sit seemingly in a stupor he face bent over a large open book he could no longer read the word dance before he eye convey no meaning to he mind but he persist for it be death to he to lose he faculty for work hitherto so powerful he mother at once begin to scold he snatch the book from he and fling it upon a distant table cry that when one be sick one should take care of one 's self he rise with a quick angry movement about to order she away as he have order clotilde then by a last effort of the will he become again deferential mother you know that i have never wish to dispute with you leave I i beg of you she do not heed he but begin instead to take he to task about he continual distrust it be he himself who have give himself a fever always fancy that he be surround by enemy who be set trap for he and watch he to rob he be there any common sense in imagine that people be persecute he in that way and then she accuse he of allow he head to be turn by he discovery he famous remedy for cure every disease that be as much as to think himself equal to the good god which only make it all the more cruel when he find out how mistaken he be and she mention lafouasse the man whom he have kill -- naturally she could understand that that have not be very pleasant for he indeed there be cause enough in it to make he take to he bed pascal still control himself very pale and with eye cast on the ground contented himself with repeat : mother leave I i beg of you no i will not leave you she cry with the impetuosity which be natural to she and which she great age have in no wise diminish i have come precisely to stir you up a little to rid you of this fever which be consume you no this can not continue i do not wish that we should again become the talk of the whole town on you account i wish you to take care of yourself he shrug he shoulder and say in a low voice as if speak to himself with a uneasy look half of conviction half of doubt : i be not ill but felicite beside herself burst out gesticulate violently : not ill not ill truly there be no one like a physician for not be able to see himself why my poor boy every one that come near you be shock by you appearance you be become insane through pride and fear this time pascal raise he head quickly and look she straight in the eye while she continue : this be what i have to tell you since it seem that no one else would undertake the task you be old enough to know what you ought to do you should make a effort to shake off all this you should think of something else you should not let a fixed idea take possession of you especially when you belong to a family like ours you know it have sense and take care of yourself he grow paler than before look fixedly at she still as if he be sound she to know what there be of she in he and he contented himself with answering : you be right mother i thank you when he be again alone he drop into he seat before the table and try once more to read he book but he could not succeed any more than before in fix he attention sufficiently to understand the word whose letter mingled confusedly together before he eye and he mother 's word buzz in he ear a vague terror which have some time before spring up within he grow and take shape haunt he now as a immediate and clearly define danger he who two month before have boast triumphantly of not belong to the family be he about to receive the most terrible of contradiction ah this egotistic joy this intense joy of not belong to it be it to give place to the terrible anguish of be strike in he turn be he to have the humiliation of see the taint revive in he be he to be drag down to the horror of feeling himself in the clutch of the monster of heredity the sublime idea the lofty certitude which he have of abolish suffering of strengthen man 's will of make a new and a higher humanity a healthy humanity be assuredly only the beginning of the monomania of vanity and in he bitter complaint of be watch in he desire to watch the enemy who he think be obstinately bent on he destruction be easily to be recognize the symptom of the monomania of suspicion so then all the disease of the race be to end in this terrible case -- madness within a brief space then general paralysis and a dreadful death from this day forth pascal be as if possess the state of nervous exhaustion into which overwork and anxiety have throw he leave he a unresisting prey to this haunting fear of madness and death all the morbid sensation which he feel he excessive fatigue on rise the buzz in he ear the flash of light before he eye even he attack of indigestion and he paroxysm of tear be so many infallible symptom of the near insanity with which he believe himself threaten he have completely lose in he own case the keen power of diagnosis of the observant physician and if he still continue to reason about it it be only to confound and pervert symptom under the influence of the moral and physical depression into which he have fall he be no longer master of himself he be mad so to say to convince himself hour by hour that he must become so all the day of this pale December be spend by he in go deeper and deeper into he malady every morning he try to escape from the haunting subject but he invariably end by shut himself in the study to take up again in spite of himself the tangled skein of the day before the long study which he have make of heredity he important research he work complete the poisoning of he peace furnish he with ever renew cause of disquietude to the question which he put to himself continually as to he own hereditary case the document be there to answer it by all possible combination they be so numerous that he lose himself among they now if he have deceive himself if he could not set himself apart as a remarkable case of variation should he place himself under the head of reversional heredity pass over one two or even three generation or be he case rather a manifestation of larvated heredity which would bring anew proof to the support of he theory of the germ plasm or be it simply a singular case of hereditary resemblance the sudden apparition of some unknown ancestor at the very decline of life from this moment he never rest give himself up completely to the investigation of he case search he note reread he book and he study himself watch the least of he sensation to deduce from they the fact on which he might judge himself on the day when he mind be most sluggish or when he think he experience particular phenomenon of vision he incline to a predominance of the original nervous lesion while if he feel that he limb be affect he foot heavy and painful he imagine he be suffer the indirect influence of some ancestor come from outside everything become confuse until at last he could recognize himself no longer in the midst of the imaginary trouble which agitate he disturbed organism and every evening the conclusion be the same the same knell sound in he brain -- heredity appalling heredity the fear of become mad in the early part of January clotilde be a involuntary spectator of a scene which wring she heart she be sit before one of the window of the study reading conceal by the high back of she chair when she see pascal who have be shut up in he room since the day before enter he hold open before he eye with both hand a sheet of yellow paper in which she recognize the genealogical tree he be so completely absorb he gaze be so fix that she might have come forward without he observe she he spread the tree upon the table continue to look at it for a long time with the terrify expression of interrogation which have become habitual to he which gradually change to one of supplication the tear course down he cheek why great god would not the tree answer he and tell he what ancestor he resemble in order that he might inscribe he case on he own leaf beside the other if he be to become mad why do not the tree tell he so clearly which would have calm he for he believe that he suffering come only from he uncertainty tear cloud he vision yet still he look he exhaust himself in this longing to know in which he reason must finally give way clotilde hastily conceal herself as she see he walk over to the press which he open wide he seize the envelope throw they on the table and search among they feverishly it be the scene of the terrible night of the storm that be begin over again the gallop of nightmare the procession of phantom rise at he call from this heap of old papers as they pass by he address to each of they a question a ardent prayer demand the origin of he malady hope for a word a whisper which should set he doubt at rest first it be only a indistinct murmur then come word and fragment of phrase be it you -- be it you -- be it you -- oh old mother the mother of we all -- who be to give I you madness be it you inebriate uncle old scoundrel of a uncle whose drunkenness i be to pay for be it you ataxic nephew or you mystic nephew or yet you idiot niece who be to reveal to I the truth show I one of the form of the lesion from which i suffer or be it rather you second cousin who hang yourself or you second cousin who commit murder or you second cousin who die of rottenness whose tragic end announce to I mine -- death in a cell the horrible decomposition of be and the gallop continue they rise and pass by with the speed of the wind the papers become animate incarnate they jostle one another they trample on one another in a wild rush of suffer humanity ah who will tell I who will tell I who will tell I -- be it he who die mad he who be carry off by phthisis he who be kill by paralysis she whose constitutional feebleness cause she to die in early youth -- whose be the poison of which i be to die what be it hysteria alcoholism tuberculosis scrofula and what be it go to make of I a ataxic or a madman a madman who be it say a madman they all say it -- a madman a madman a madman sob choke pascal he let he dejected head fall among the papers he weep endlessly shake by shudder sob and clotilde seize by a sort of awe feel the presence of the fate which rule over race leave the room softly hold she breath for she know that it would mortify he exceedingly if he know that she have be present long period of prostration follow January be very cold but the sky remain wonderfully clear a brilliant sun shone in the limpid blue and at la souleiade the window of the study face south form a sort of hothouse preserving there a delightfully mild temperature they do not even light a fire for the room be always fill with a flood of sunshine in which the fly that have survive the winter fly about lazily the only sound to be hear be the buzz of they wing it be a close and drowsy warmth like a breath of spring that have linger in the old house baked by the heat of summer pascal still gloomy drag through the day there and it be there too that he overhear one day the closing word of a conversation which aggravate he suffering as he never leave he room now before breakfast clotilde have receive dr ramond this morning in the study and they be talk there together in a undertone sit beside each other in the bright sunshine it be the third visit which ramond have make during the last week personal reason the necessity especially of establish definitely he position as a physician at plassan make it expedient for he not to defer he marriage much longer : and he wish to obtain from clotilde a decisive answer on each of he former visit the presence of a third person have prevent he from speak as he desire to receive she answer from herself directly he have resolve to declare himself to she in a frank conversation they intimate friendship and the discretion and good sense of both justified he in take this step and he end smile look into she eye : i assure you clotilde that it be the most reasonable of _ denouement _ you know that i have love you for a long time i have a profound affection and esteem for you that alone might perhaps not be sufficient but in addition we understand each other perfectly and we should be very happy together i be convince of it she do not cast down she eye she too look at he frankly with a friendly smile he be in truth very handsome in he vigorous young manhood why do you not marry mlle leveque the lawyer 's daughter she ask she be prettier and richer than i be and i know that she would gladly accept you my dear friend i fear that you be commit a folly in choose I he do not grow impatient seem still convinced of the wisdom of he determination but i do not love mlle leveque and i do love you besides i have consider everything and i repeat that i know very well what i be about say yes you can take no better course then she grow very serious and a shadow pass over she face the shadow of those reflection of those almost unconscious inward struggle which keep she silent for day at a time she do not see clearly yet she still struggle against herself and she wish to wait well my friend since you be really serious do not ask I to give you a answer to-day grant I a few week longer master be indeed very ill i be greatly trouble about he and you would not like to owe my consent to a hasty impulse i assure you for my part that i have a great deal of affection for you but it would be wrong to decide at this moment the house be too unhappy it be agree be it not i will not make you wait long and to change the conversation she add : yes i be uneasy about master i wish to see you in order to tell you so the other day i surprise he weep violently and i be certain the fear of become mad haunt he the day before yesterday when you be talk to he i see that you be examine he tell I frankly what do you think of he condition be he in any danger not the slightest exclaimed dr ramond he system be a little out of order that be all how can a man of he ability who have make so close a study of nervous disease deceive himself to such a extent it be discourage indeed if the clearest and most vigorous mind can go so far astray in he case he own discovery of hypodermic injection would be excellent why do he not use they with himself and as the young girl reply with a despairing gesture that he would not listen to she that he would not even allow she to speak to he now ramond say : well then i will speak to he it be at this moment that pascal come out of he room attract by the sound of voice but on see they both so close to each other so animated so youthful and so handsome in the sunshine -- clothe with sunshine as it be -- he stand still in the doorway he look fixedly at they and he pale face altered ramond have a moment before take clotilde 's hand and he be hold it in he it be a promise be it not i should like the marriage to take place this summer you know how much i love you and i shall eagerly await you answer very well she answer before a month all will be settle a sudden giddiness make pascal stagger here now be this boy he friend he pupil who have introduce himself into he house to rob he of he treasure he ought to have expect this _ denouement _ yet the sudden news of a possible marriage surprise he overwhelm he like a unforeseen catastrophe that have forever ruin he life this girl whom he have fashion whom he have believe he own she would leave he then without regret she would leave he to die alone in he solitude only the day before she have make he suffer so intensely that he have ask himself whether he should not part from she and send she to she brother who be always write for she for a instant he have even decide on this separation for the good of both yet to find she here suddenly with this man to hear she promise to give he a answer to think that she would marry that she would soon leave he this stab he to the heart at the sound of he heavy step as he come forward the two young people turn round in some embarrassment why master we be just talk about you say ramond gaily yes to be frank with you we be conspire come why do you not take care of yourself there be nothing serious the matter with you you would be on you foot again in a fortnight if you do pascal who have drop into a chair continue to look at they he have still the power to control himself and he countenance give no evidence of the wound which he have just receive he would assuredly die of it and no one would suspect the malady which have carry he off but it be a relief to he to be able to give vent to he feeling and he declare violently that he would not take even so much as a glass of tisane take care of myself he cry what for be it not all over with my old carcass ramond insist with a good-tempered smile you be sounder than any of we this be a trifling disturbance and you know that you have the remedy in you own hand use you hypodermic injection pascal do not allow he to finish this fill the measure of he rage he angrily ask if they wish he to kill himself as he have kill lafouasse he injection a pretty invention of which he have good reason to be proud he abjure medicine and he swear that he would never again go near a patient when people be no longer good for anything they ought to die that would be the best thing for everybody and that be what he be go to try to do so as to have do with it all bah bah say ramond at last resolve to take he leave through fear of exciting he still further i will leave you with clotilde i be not at all uneasy clotilde will take care of you but pascal have on this morning receive the final blow he take to he bed toward evening and remain for two whole day without open the door of he room it be in vain that clotilde at last become alarmed knock loudly at the door there be no answer martine go in she turn and beg monsieur through the keyhole at least to tell she if he need anything a deathlike silence reign the room seem to be empty then on the morning of the third day as the young girl by chance turn the knob the door yield perhaps it have be unlock for hour and she might enter freely this room in which she have never set foot : a large room render cold by its northern exposure in which she see a small iron bed without curtain a shower bath in a corner a long black wooden table a few chair and on the table on the floor along the wall a array of chemical apparatus mortar furnace machine instrument case pascal up and dress be sit on the edge of he bed in try to arrange which he have exhaust himself do not you want I to nurse you then she ask with anxious tenderness without venture to advance into the room oh you can come in he say with a dejected gesture i will not beat you i have not the strength to do that now and from this day on he tolerate she about he and allow she to wait on he but he have caprice still he would not let she enter the room when he be in bed possess by a sort of morbid shame then he make she send he martine but he seldom remain in bed drag himself about from chair to chair in he utter inability to do any kind of work he malady continue to grow worse until at last he be reduce to utter despair tortured by sick headache and without the strength as he say to put one foot before the other convinced every morning that he would spend the night at the tulette a rave maniac he grow thin he face under its crown of white hair -- which he still care for through a last remnant of vanity -- acquire a look of suffering of tragic beauty and although he allow himself to be wait on he refuse roughly all remedy in the distrust of medicine into which he have fall clotilde now devoted herself to he entirely she give up everything else at first she attend low mass then she leave off go to church altogether in she impatience for some certain happiness she feel as if she be take a step toward that end by thus devote all she moment to the service of a beloved be whom she wish to see once more well and happy she make a complete sacrifice of herself she seek to find happiness in the happiness of another and all this unconsciously solely at the impulse of she woman 's heart in the midst of the crisis through which she be still pass and which be modify she character profoundly without she knowledge she remain silent regard the disagreement which separate they the idea do not again occur to she to throw herself on he neck cry that she be he that he might return to life since she give herself to he in she thought she grieve to see he suffer she be only a affectionate girl who take care of he as any female relative would have do and she attention be very pure very delicate occupy she life so completely that she day now pass swiftly exempt from torment thought of the beyond fill with the one wish of cure he but where she have a hard battle to fight be in prevail upon he to use he hypodermic injection upon himself he fly into a passion disown he discovery and call himself a imbecile she too cry out it be she now who have faith in science who grow indignant at see he doubt he own genius he resist for a long time then yield to the empire which she have acquire over he he consent simply to avoid the affectionate dispute which she renew with he every morning from the very first he experience great relief from the injection although he refuse to acknowledge it he mind become clearer and he gradually gain strength then she be exultant fill with enthusiastic pride in he she vaunted he treatment and become indignant because he do not admire himself as a example of the miracle which he be able to work he smile he be now begin to see clearly into he own condition ramond have speak truly he illness have be nothing but nervous exhaustion perhaps he would get over it after all ah it be you who be cure I little girl he would say not wish to confess he hope medicine you see act accord to the hand that give they the convalescence be slow last through the whole of February the weather remain clear and cold there be not a single day in which the study be not flood with warm pale sunshine there be hour of relapse however hour of the blackest melancholy in which all the patient 's terror return when he guardian disconsolate be oblige to sit at the other end of the room in order not to irritate he still more he despair anew of he recovery he become again bitter and aggressively ironical it be on one of those bad day that pascal approach a window see he neighbor m bellombre the retired professor make the round of he garden to see if he fruit tree be well cover with blossom the sight of the old man so neat and so erect with the fine placidity of the egoist on whom illness have apparently never lay hold suddenly put pascal beside himself ah he growl there be one who will never overwork himself who will never endanger he health by worry and he launch forth into a ironical eulogy on selfishness to be alone in the world not to have a friend to have neither wife nor child what happiness that hard-hearted miser who for forty year have have only other people 's child to cuff who live aloof from the world without even a dog with a deaf and dumb gardener older than himself be he not a example of the greatest happiness possible on earth without a responsibility without a duty without a anxiety other than that of take care of he dear health he be a wise man he would live a hundred year ah the fear of life that be cowardice which be truly the best wisdom to think that i should ever have regret not have a child of my own have any one a right to bring miserable creature into the world bad heredity should be end life should be end the only honest man be that old coward there m bellombre continue peacefully make the round of he pear tree in the march sunshine he do not risk a too hasty movement he economize he fresh old age if he meet a stone in he path he push it aside with the end of he cane and then walk tranquilly on look at he be he not well preserve be he not handsome have not all the blessing of heaven be shower down upon he he be the happiest man i know clotilde who have listen in silence suffer from the irony of pascal the full bitterness of which she divine she who usually take m bellombre 's part feel a protest rise up within she tear come to she eye and she answer simply in a low voice : yes but he be not love these word put a sudden end to the painful scene pascal as if he have receive a electric shock turn and look at she a sudden rush of tenderness bring tear to he eye also and he leave the room to keep from weep the day wear on in the midst of these alternation of good and bad hour he recover he strength but slowly and what put he in despair be that whenever he attempt to work he be seize by a profuse perspiration if he have persist he would assuredly have faint so long as he do not work he feel that he convalescence be make little progress he begin to take a interest again however in he accustomed investigation he read over again the last page that he have write and with this reawaken of the scientist in he he former anxiety return at one time he fall into a state of such depression that the house and all it contain cease to exist for he he might have be rob everything he possess might have be take and destroy without he even be conscious of the disaster now he become again watchful from time to time he would feel he pocket to assure himself that the key of the press be there but one morning when he have oversleep himself and do not leave he room until eleven o'clock he see clotilde

terrace but that of the two secular cypress plant at its two extremity like two enormous green taper which could be see three league away at time they descend the slope for the pleasure of ascend the giant step and climb the low wall of uncemented stone which support the plantation to see if the stunt olive tree and the puny almond be bud more often there be delightful walk under the delicate needle of the pine wood steep in sunshine and exhale a strong odor of resin endless walk along the wall of inclosure from behind which the only sound they could hear be at rare interval the grating noise of some cart jolting along the narrow road to les fenouillere and they spend delightful hour in the old threshing yard where they could see the whole horizon and where they love to stretch themselves tenderly remember they former tear when loving each other unconsciously to themselves they have quarrel under the star but they favorite retreat where they always end by lose themselves be the quincunx of tall plane tree whose branch now of a tender green look like lacework below the enormous box tree the old border of the french garden of which now scarcely a trace remain form a sort of labyrinth of which they could never find the end and the slender stream of the fountain with its eternal crystalline murmur seem to sing within they heart they would sit hand in hand beside the mossy basin while the twilight fall around they they form gradually fading into the shadow of the tree while the water which they could no longer see sing its flutelike song up to the middle of may

so lively a gratitude that he kiss he savior 's hand the doctor could not help be greatly affect by all this and he dismiss the man kindly advise he to return to he life of labor which be the best hygiene physical and moral then he recover he calmness and sit down to table talk gaily of other matter clotilde look at he with astonishment and even with a little indignation what be the matter master she say you be no longer satisfy with yourself oh with myself i be never satisfy he answer jestingly and with medicine you know -- it be accord to the day it be on this night that they have they first quarrel she be angry with he because he no longer have any pride in he profession she return to she complaint of the afternoon reproach he for not take more credit to himself for the cure of sarteur and even for the prolongation of valentin 's life it be she who now have a passion for he fame she remind he of he cure have he not cure himself could he deny the efficacy of he treatment a thrill run through he as he recall the great dream which he have once cherish -- to combat debility the sole cause of disease to cure suffer humanity to make a higher and healthy humanity to hasten the come of happiness the future kingdom of perfection and felicity by intervene and give health to all and he possess the liquor of life the universal panacea which open up this immense hope pascal be silent for a moment then he murmur : it be true i cure myself i have cure other and i still think that my injection be efficacious in many case i do not deny medicine remorse for a deplorable accident like that of lafouasse do not render I unjust besides work have be my passion it be in work that i have up to this time spend my energy it be in wish to prove to myself the possibility of make decrepit humanity one day strong and intelligent that i come near die lately yes a dream a beautiful dream no no a reality the reality of you genius master then lower he voice almost to a whisper he breathe this confession : listen i be go to say to you what i would say to no one else in the world what i would not say to myself aloud to correct nature to interfere in order to modify it and thwart it in its purpose be this a laudable task to cure the individual to retard he death for he personal pleasure to prolong he existence doubtless to the injury of the species be not this to defeat the aim of nature and have we the right to desire a stronger a healthier humanity model after we idea of health and strength what have we to do in the matter why should we interfere in this work of life neither the means nor the end of which be know to we perhaps everything be as it ought to be perhaps we should risk kill love genius life itself remember i make the confession to you alone but doubt have take possession of I i tremble at the thought of my twentieth century alchemy i have come to believe that it be greater and wiser to allow evolution to take its course he pause then he add so softly that she could scarcely hear he : do you know that instead of nerve-substance i often use only water with my patient you no longer hear I grind for day at a time i tell you that i have some of the liquor in reserve water soothe they this be no doubt simply a mechanical effect ah to soothe to prevent suffering -- that indeed i still desire it be perhaps my greatest weakness but i can not bear to see any one suffer suffer put I beside myself it seem a monstrous and useless cruelty of nature i practice now only to prevent suffer then master she ask in the same indistinct murmur if you no longer desire to cure do you still think everything must be tell for the frightful necessity of display the wound of humanity have no other excuse than the hope of cure they yes yes it be necessary to know in every case and to conceal nothing to tell everything regard thing and individual happiness be no longer possible in ignorance certainty alone make life tranquil when people know more they will doubtless accept everything do you not comprehend that to desire to cure everything to regenerate everything be a false ambition inspire by we egotism a revolt against life which we declare to be bad because we judge it from the point of view of self-interest i know that i be more tranquil that my intellect have broaden and deepen ever since i have hold evolution in respect it be my love of life which triumph even to the extent of not question its purpose to the extent of confide absolutely in it of lose myself in it without wish to remake it accord to my own conception of good and evil life alone be sovereign life alone know its aim and its end i can only try to know it in order to live it as it should be live and this i have understand only since i have possess you love before i possess it i seek the truth elsewhere i struggle with the fix idea of save the world you have come and life be full the world be save every hour by love by the immense and incessant labor of all that live and love throughout space impeccable life omnipotent life immortal life they continue to talk together in low tone for some time longer plan a idyllic life a calm and healthful existence in the country it be in this simple prescription of a invigorating environment that the experiment of the physician end he exclaim against city people could be well and happy only in the country in the sunshine on the condition of renounce money ambition even the proud excess of intellectual labor they should do nothing but live and love cultivate the soil and bring up they child ix dr pascal then resume he professional visit in the town and the surrounding country and he be generally accompany by clotilde who go with he into the house of the poor where she too bring health and cheerfulness but as he have one night confess to she in secret he visit be now only visit of relief and consolation if he have before practice with repugnance it be because he have feel how vain be medical science empiricism dishearten he from the moment that medicine cease to be a experimental science and become a art he be fill with disquiet at the thought of the infinite variety of disease and of they remedy accord to the constitution of the patient treatment change with every new hypothesis how many people then must the method now abandon have kill the perspicacity of the physician become everything the healer be only a happily endowed diviner himself grope in the dark and effect cure through he fortunate endowment and this explain why he have give up he patient almost altogether after a dozen year of practice to devote himself entirely to study then when he great labor on heredity have restore to he for a time the hope of intervene and cure disease by he hypodermic injection he have become again enthusiastic until the day when he faith in life after have impel he to aid its action in this way by restore the vital force become still broader and give he the higher conviction that life be self-sufficing that it be the only giver of health and strength in spite of everything and he continue to visit with he tranquil smile only those of he patient who clamor for he loudly and who find themselves miraculously relieve when he inject into they only pure water clotilde now sometimes allow herself to jest about these hypodermic injection she be still at heart however a fervent worshiper of he skill and she say jestingly that if he perform miracle as he do it be because he have in himself the godlike power to do so then he would reply jestingly attribute to she the efficacy of they common visit say that he cure no one now when she be absent that it be she who bring the breath of life the unknown and necessary force from the beyond so that the rich people the _ bourgeois _ whose house she do not enter continue to groan without he be able to relieve they and this affectionate dispute divert they they set out each time as if for new discovery they exchange glance of kindly intelligence with the sick ah this wretched suffering which revolt they and which be now all they go to combat how happy they be when they think it vanquish they be divinely recompense when they see the cold sweat disappear the moan lip become still the deathlike face recover animation it be assuredly the love which they bring to this humble suffering humanity that produce the alleviation to die

learn for herself what he condition really be and as she be go back to the station she go out of she way in order to stop at macquart 's house the day be superb -- a warm and brilliant summer day on either side of the path which she have take she see the field that she have give he in former day -- all this fertile land the price of he secrecy and he good behavior before she appear the house with its pink tile and its bright yellow wall look gay in the sunshine under the ancient mulberry tree on the terrace she enjoy the delightful coolness and the beautiful view what a pleasant and safe retreat what a happy solitude be this for a old man to end in joy and peace a long and well-spent life but she do not see he she do not hear he the silence be profound the only sound to be hear be the humming of the bee circle around the tall marshmallow and on the terrace there be nothing to be see but a little yellow dog stretch at full length on the bare ground seek the coolness of the shade he raise he head growl about to bark but recognize the visitor he lay down again quietly then in this peaceful and sunny solitude she be seize with a strange chill and she call : macquart macquart the door of the house under the mulberry tree stand wide open but she do not dare to go in this empty house with its wide open door give she a vague uneasiness and she call again : macquart macquart not a sound not a breath profound silence reign again but the humming of the bee circle around the tall marshmallow sound louder than before at last felicite ashamed of she fear summon courage to enter the door on the left of the hall opening into the kitchen where uncle macquart generally sit be close she push it open but she could distinguish nothing at first as the blind have be close probably in order to shut out the heat she first sensation be one of choke cause by a overpowering odor of alcohol which fill the room every article of furniture seem to exude this odor the whole house be impregnate with it at last when she eye have become accustomed to the semi-obscurity she perceive macquart he be seat at the table on which be a glass and a bottle of spirit of thirty-six degree completely empty settle in he chair he be sleep profoundly dead drunk this spectacle revive she anger and contempt come macquart she cry be it not vile and senseless to put one 's self in such a state wake up i say this be shameful he sleep be so profound that she could not even hear he breathing in vain she raise she voice and slap he smartly on the hand macquart macquart macquart ah faugh you be disgust my dear then she leave he troubling herself no further about he and walk around the room evidently seek something come down the dusky road from the asylum she have be seize with a consuming thirst and she wish to get a glass of water she glove embarrass she and she take they off and put they on a corner of the table then she succeed in find the jug and she wash a glass and fill it to the brim and be about to empty it when she see a extraordinary sight -- a sight which agitate she so greatly that she set the glass down again beside she glove without drinking by degree she have begin to see object more clearly in the room which be light dimly by a few stray sunbeam that filter through the crack of the old shutter she now see uncle macquart distinctly neatly dress in a blue cloth suit as usual and on he head the eternal fur cap which he wear from one year 's end to the other he have grow stout during the last five or six year and he look like a veritable mountain of flesh overlaid with roll of fat and she notice that he must have fall asleep while smoking for he pipe -- a short black pipe -- have fall into he lap then she stand still stupefy with amazement -- the burning tobacco have be scatter in the fall and the cloth of the trousers have catch fire and through a hole in the stuff as large already as a hundred-sous piece she see the bare thigh whence issue a little blue flame at first felicite have think that it be linen -- the drawer or the shirt -- that be burn but soon doubt be no longer possible she see distinctly the bare flesh and the little blue flame issue from it lightly dance like a flame wander over the surface of a vessel of light alcohol it be as yet scarcely higher than the flame of a night light pale and soft and so unstable that the slightest breath of air cause it to change its place but it increase and spread rapidly and the skin crack and the fat begin to melt a involuntary cry escape from felicite 's throat macquart macquart but still he do not stir he insensibility must have be complete intoxication must have produce a sort of coma in which there be a absolute paralysis of sensation for he be live he breast could be see rise and fall in slow and even respiration macquart macquart now the fat be run through the crack of the skin feed the flame which be invade the abdomen and felicite comprehend vaguely that uncle macquart be burn before she like a sponge soak with brandy he have indeed be saturate with it for year past and of the strongest and most inflammable kind he would no doubt soon be blaze from head to foot like a bowl of punch then she cease to try to awaken he since he be sleep so soundly for a full minute she have the courage to look at he awe-stricken but gradually come to a determination she hand however begin to tremble with a little shiver which she could not control she be choke and take up the glass of water again with both hand she empty it at a draught and she be go away on tiptoe when she remember she glove she go back grope for they anxiously on the table and as she think pick they both up then she leave the room close the door behind she carefully and as gently as if she be afraid of disturb some one when she find herself once more on the terrace in the cheerful sunshine and the pure air in face of the vast horizon bath in light she heave a sigh of relief the country be desert no one could have see she enter or leave the house only the yellow dog be still stretch there and he do not even deign to look up and she go away with she quick short step she youthful figure lightly sway a hundred step away a irresistible impulse compel she to turn round to give a last look at the house so tranquil and so cheerful on the hillside in the decline light of the beautiful day only when she be in the train and go to put on she glove do she perceive that one of they be miss but she suppose that it have fall on the platform at the station as she be get into the car she believe herself to be quite calm but she remain with one hand gloved and one hand bare which with she could only be the result of great agitation on the follow day pascal and clotilde take the three o'clock train to go to the tulette the mother of charle the harness-maker 's wife have bring the boy to they as they have offer to take he to uncle macquart 's where he be to remain for the rest of the week fresh quarrel have disturb the peace of the household the husband have resolve to tolerate no longer in he house another man 's child that do-nothing imbecile prince 's son as it be grandmother rougon who have dress he he be indeed dress on this day again in black velvet trim with gold braid like a young lord a page of former time go to court and during the quarter of a hour which the journey last clotilde amuse herself in the compartment in which they be alone by take off he cap and smooth he beautiful blond lock he royal hair that fall in curl over he shoulder she have a ring on she finger and as she pass she hand over he neck she be startle to perceive that she caress have leave behind it a trace of blood one could not touch the boy 's skin without the red dew exude from it the tissue have become so lax through extreme degeneration that the slightest scratch bring on a hemorrhage the doctor become at once uneasy and ask he if he still bleed at the nose as frequently as formerly charle hardly know what to answer first say no then recollect himself he say that he have bleed a great deal the other day he seem indeed weaker he grow more childish as he grow older he intelligence which have never develop have become clouded this tall boy of fifteen so beautiful so girlish-looking with the color of a flower that have grow in the shade do not look ten at the tulette pascal decide that they would first take the boy to uncle macquart 's they ascend the steep road in the distance the little house look gay in the sunshine as it have look on the day before with its yellow wall and its green mulberry tree extend they twisted branch and cover the terrace with a thick leafy roof a delightful sense of peace pervade this solitary spot this sage 's retreat where the only sound to be hear be the humming of the bee circle round the tall marshmallow ah that rascal of a uncle say pascal smile how i envy he but he be surprise not to have already see he stand at the edge of the terrace and as charle have run off drag clotilde with he to see the rabbit as he say the doctor continue the ascent alone and be astonish when he reach the top to see no one the blind be close the hill door yawn wide open only the yellow dog be at the threshold he leg stiff he hair bristle howl with a low and continuous moan when he see the visitor whom he no doubt recognize approach he stop howl for a instant and go and stand further off then he begin again to whine softly pascal fill with apprehension could not keep back the uneasy cry that rise to he lip : macquart macquart no one answer a deathlike silence reign over the house with its door yawn wide open like the mouth of a cavern the dog continue to howl then pascal grow impatient and cry more loudly macquart macquart there be not a stir the bee hum the sky look down serenely on the peaceful scene then he hesitate no longer perhaps macquart be asleep but the instant he push open the door of the kitchen on the left of the hall a horrible odor escape from it a odor of burn flesh and bone when he enter the room he could hardly breathe so fill be it by a thick vapor a stagnant and nauseous cloud which choke and blind he the sunbeam that filter through the crack make only a dim light he hurry to the fireplace think that perhaps there have be a fire but the fireplace be empty and the article of furniture around appear to be uninjured bewildered and feeling himself grow faint in the poison atmosphere he run to the window and throw the shutter wide open a flood of light enter then the scene present to the doctor 's view fill he with amazement everything be in its place the glass and the empty bottle of spirit be on the table only the chair in which uncle macquart must have be sit bear trace of fire the front leg be blacken and the straw be partially consume what have become of macquart where could he have disappear in front of the chair on the brick floor which be saturate with grease there be a little heap of ash beside which lay the pipe -- a black pipe which have not even break in fall all of uncle macquart be there in this handful of fine ash and he be in the red cloud also which float through the open window in the layer of soot which carpet the entire kitchen the horrible grease of burnt flesh envelop everything sticky and foul to the touch it be the finest case of spontaneous combustion physician have ever see the doctor have indeed read in medical papers of surprising case among other that of a shoemaker 's wife a drunken woman who have fall asleep over she foot warmer and of whom they have find only a hand and foot he have until now put little faith in these case unwilling to admit like the ancient that a body impregnate with alcohol could disengage a unknown gas capable of take fire spontaneously and consume the flesh and the bone but he deny the truth of they no longer besides everything become clear to he as he reconstruct the scene -- the coma of drunkenness produce absolute insensibility the pipe fall on the clothes which have take fire the flesh saturate with liquor burning and crack the fat melting part of it run over the ground and part of it aid the combustion and all at last -- muscle organ and bone -- consume in a general blaze uncle macquart be all there with he blue cloth suit and he fur cap which he wear from one year 's end to the other doubtless as soon as he have begin to burn like a bonfire he have fall forward which would account for the chair be only blacken and nothing of he be leave not a bone not a tooth not a nail nothing but this little heap of gray dust which the draught of air from the door threaten at every moment to sweep away clotilde have meanwhile enter charle remain outside he attention attract by the continued howling of the dog good heaven what a smell she cry what be the matter when pascal explain to she the extraordinary catastrophe that have take place she shudder she take up the bottle to examine it but she put it down again with horror feeling it moist and sticky with uncle macquart 's flesh nothing could be touch the smallest object be coat as it be with this yellowish grease which stick to the hand a shudder of mingled awe and disgust pass through she and she burst into tear falter : what a sad death what a horrible death pascal have recover from he first shock and he be almost smile why horrible he be eighty-four year old he do not suffer as for I i think it a superb death for that old rascal of a uncle who it may be now say do not lead a very exemplary life you remember he envelope he have some very terrible and vile thing upon he conscience which do not prevent he however from settle down later and grow old surround by every comfort like a old humbug receive the recompense of virtue which he do not possess and here he lie like the prince of drunkard burn up of himself consume on the burning funeral pile of he own body and the doctor wave he hand in admiration just think of it to be drunk to the point of not feel that one be on fire to set one 's self aflame like a bonfire on st john 's day to disappear in smoke to the last bone think of uncle macquart start on he journey through space first diffuse through the four corner of the room dissolve in air and float about bathing all that belong to he then escape in a cloud of dust through the window when i open it for he soar up into the sky fill the horizon why that be a admirable death to disappear to leave nothing of himself behind but a little heap of ash and a pipe beside it and he pick up the pipe to keep it as he say as a relic of uncle macquart while clotilde who think she perceive a touch of bitter mockery in he eulogistic rhapsody shudder anew with horror and disgust but suddenly she perceive something under the table -- part of the remains perhaps look at that fragment there he stoop down and pick up with surprise a woman 's glove a yellow glove why she cry it be grandmother 's glove the glove that be miss last evening they look at each other by a common impulse the same explanation rise to they lip felicite be certainly there yesterday and a sudden conviction force itself on the doctor 's mind -- the conviction that he mother have see uncle macquart burning and that she have not quench he various indication point to this -- the state of complete coolness in which he find the room the number of hour which he calculate to have be necessary for the combustion of the body he see clearly the same thought dawn in the terrify eye of he companion but as it seem impossible that they should ever know the truth he fabricate aloud the simplest explanation : no doubt you grandmother come in yesterday on she way back from the asylum to say good day to uncle macquart before he have begin drink let we go away let we go away cry clotilde i be stifle here i can not remain here pascal too wish to go and give information of the death he go out after she shut up the house and put the key in he pocket outside they hear the little yellow dog still howl he have take refuge between charle ' leg and the boy amuse himself push he with he foot and listen to he whine without comprehend the doctor go at once to the house of m maurin the notary at the tulette who be also mayor of the commune a widower for ten year past and live with he daughter who be a childless widow he have maintain neighborly relation with old macquart and have occasionally keep little charle with he for several day at a time he daughter have become interested in the boy who be so handsome and so much to be pity m maurin horrify at the news go at once with the doctor to draw up a statement of the accident and promise to make out the death certificate in due form as for religious ceremony funeral obsequy they seem scarcely possible when they enter the kitchen the draught from the door scatter the ash about and when they piously attempt to collect they again they succeed only in gather together the scrapings of the flag a collection of accumulate dirt in which there could be but little of uncle macquart what then could they bury it be better to give up the idea so they give it up besides uncle macquart have be hardly a devout catholic and the family contented themselves with cause mass to be say later on for the repose of he soul the notary meantime have immediately declare that there exist a will which have be deposit with he and he ask pascal to meet he at he house on the next day but one for the reading for he think he might tell the doctor at once that uncle macquart have choose he as he executor and he end by offer like a kindhearted man to keep charle with he until then comprehend how greatly the boy who be so unwelcome at he mother 's would be in the way in the midst of all these occurrence charle seem enchanted and he remain at the tulette it be not until very late until seven o'clock that clotilde and pascal be able to take the train to return to plassan after the doctor have at last visit the two patient whom he have to see but when they return together to the notary 's on the day appoint for the meeting they have the disagreeable surprise of find old mme rougon install there she have naturally learn of macquart 's death and have hurry there on the follow day full of excitement and make a great show of grief and she have just make she appearance again to-day have hear the famous testament speak of the reading of the will however be a simple matter unmarked by any incident macquart have leave all the fortune that he could dispose of for the purpose of erect a superb marble monument to himself with two angel with fold wing weep it be he own idea a reminiscence of a similar tomb which he have see abroad -- in germany perhaps -- when he be a soldier and he have charge he nephew pascal to superintend the erection of the monument as he be the only one of the family he say who have any taste during the reading of the will clotilde have remain in the notary 's garden sit on a bench under the shade of a ancient chestnut tree when pascal and felicite again appear there be a moment of great embarrassment for they have not speak to one another for some month past the old lady however affect to be perfectly at she ease make no allusion whatever to the new situation and give it to be understand that they might very well meet and appear unite before the world without for that reason enter into a explanation or become reconcile but she commit the mistake of lay too much stress on the great grief which macquart 's death have cause she pascal who suspect the overflow joy the unbounded delight which it give she to think that this family ulcer be to be at last heal that this abominable uncle be at last out of the way become gradually possess by a impatience a indignation which he could not control he eye fasten themselves involuntarily on he mother 's glove which be black just then she be express she grief in lowered tone : but how imprudent it be at he age to persist in living alone -- like a wolf in he lair if he have only have a servant in the house with he then the doctor hardly conscious of what he be say terrify at hear himself say the word but impel by a irresistible force say : but mother since you be there why do you not quench he old mme rougon turn frightfully pale how could she son have know she look at he for a instant in open-mouthed amazement while clotilde grow as pale as she in the certainty of the crime which be now evident it be a avowal this terrify silence which have fall between the mother the son and the granddaughter -- the shudder silence in which family bury they domestic tragedy the doctor in despair at have speak he who avoid so carefully all disagreeable and useless explanation be try desperately to retract he word when a new catastrophe extricate he from he terrible embarrassment felicite desire to take charle away with she in order not to trespass on the notary 's kind hospitality and as the latter have send the boy after breakfast to spend a hour or two with aunt dide he have send the maid servant to the asylum with order to bring he back immediately it be at this juncture that the servant whom they be wait for in the garden make she appearance cover with perspiration out of breath and greatly excited cry from a distance : my god my god come quickly master charle be bath in blood fill with consternation all three set off for the asylum this day chance to be one of aunt dide 's good day very calm and gentle she sit erect in the armchair in which she have spend the hour the long hour for twenty-two year past look straight before she into vacancy she seem to have grow still thinner all the flesh have disappear she limb be now only bone cover with parchment-like skin and she keeper the stout fair-haired girl carry she feed she take she up and lay she down as if she have be a bundle the ancestress the forget one tall bony ghastly remain motionless she eye only seem to have life she eye shine clear as spring water in she thin withered face but on this morning again a sudden rush of tear have stream down she cheek and she have begin to stammer word without any connection which seem to prove that in the midst of she senile exhaustion and the incurable torpor of madness the slow induration of the brain and the limb be not yet complete there still be memory store away gleam of intelligence still be possible then she face have resume its vacant expression she seem indifferent to every one and everything laughing sometimes at a accident at a fall but most often see nothing and hearing nothing gaze fixedly into vacancy when charle have be bring to she the keeper have immediately install he before the little table in front of he great-great-grandmother the girl keep a package of picture for he -- soldier captain king clothe in purple and gold and she give they to he with a pair of scissors say : there amuse yourself quietly and behave well you see that to-day grandmother be very good you must be good too the boy raise he eye to the madwoman 's face and both look at each other at this moment the resemblance between they be extraordinary they eye especially they vacant and limpid eye seem to lose themselves in one another to be identical then it be the physiognomy the whole face the worn feature of the centenarian that pass over three generation to this delicate child 's face it too worn already as it be and age by the wear of the race neither smile they regard each other intently with a air of grave imbecility well continue the keeper who have acquire the habit of talk to herself to cheer herself when with she mad charge you can not deny each other the same hand make you both you be the very spit-down of each other come laugh a bit amuse yourselve since you like to be together but to fix he attention for any length of time fatigued charle and he be the first to lower he eye he seem to be interested in he picture while aunt dide who have a astonishing power of fix she attention as if she have be turn into stone continue to look at he fixedly without even wink a eyelid the keeper busy herself for a few moment in the little sunny room make gay by its light blue-flowered paper she make the bed which she have be air she arrange the linen on the shelf of the press but she generally profit by the presence of the boy to take a little relaxation she have order never to leave she charge alone and now that he be here she venture to trust she with he listen to I well she go on i have to go out for a little and if she stir if she should need I ring for I call I at once do you hear you understand you be a big enough boy to be able to call one he have look up again and make a sign that he have understand and that he would call she and when he find himself alone with aunt dide he return to he picture quietly this last for a quarter of a hour amid the profound silence of the asylum break only at interval by some prison sound -- a stealthy step the jingle of a bunch of key and occasionally a loud cry immediately silence but the boy must have be tire by the excessive heat of the day for sleep gradually steal over he soon he head fair as a lily droop and as if weigh down by the too heavy casque of he royal lock he let it sink gently on the picture and fall asleep with he cheek rest on the gold and purple king the lash of he closed eyelid cast a shadow on he delicate skin with its small blue vein through which life pulsed feebly he be beautiful as a angel but with the indefinable corruption of a whole race spread over he countenance and aunt dide look at he with she vacant stare in which there be neither pleasure nor pain the stare of eternity contemplate thing earthly at the end of a few moment however a expression of interest seem to dawn in the clear eye something have just happen a drop of blood be form on the edge of the left nostril of the boy this drop fall and another form and follow it it be the blood the dew of blood exude this time without a scratch without a bruise which issue and flow of itself in the laxity of the degenerate tissue the drop become a slender thread which flow over the gold of the picture a little pool cover they and make its way to a corner of the table then the drop begin again splash dully one by one upon the floor and he still sleep with the divinely calm look of a cherub not even conscious of the life that be escape from he and the madwoman continue to look at he with a air of increase interest but without terror amuse rather she attention engage by this as by the flight of the big fly which she gaze often follow for hour several minute more pass the slender thread have grow larger the drop follow one another more rapidly fall on the floor with a monotonous and persistent drip and charle at one moment stir open he eye and perceive that he be cover with blood but he be not frighten he be accustom to this bloody spring which issue from he at the slightest cause he merely give a sigh of weariness instinct however must have warn he for he moan more loudly than before and call confusedly in stammer accent : mamma mamma he weakness be no doubt already excessive for a irresistible stupor once more take possession of he he head drop he eye close and he seem to fall asleep again continue he plaint as if in a dream moan in fainter and fainter accent : mamma mamma now the picture be inundate the black velvet jacket and trousers braid with gold be stain with long streak of blood and the little red stream begin again to flow persistently from he left nostril without stop cross the red pool on the table and fall upon the ground where it at last form a veritable lake a loud cry from the madwoman a terrify call would have suffice but she do not cry she do not call motionless rigid emaciated sit there forget of the world she gaze with the fix look of the ancestress who see the destiny of she race be accomplish she sit there as if dry up bind she limb and she tongue tie by she hundred year she brain ossify by madness incapable of willing or of act and yet the sight of the little red stream begin to stir some feeling in she a tremor pass over she deathlike countenance a flush mount to she cheek finally a last plaint rouse she completely : mamma mamma then it be evident that a terrible struggle be take place in aunt dide she carry she skeleton-like hand to she forehead as if she feel she brain burst she mouth be wide open but no sound issue from it the dreadful tumult that have arise within she have no doubt paralyze she tongue she try to rise to run but she have no longer any muscle she remain fasten to she seat all she poor body tremble in the superhuman effort which she be make to cry for help without be able to break the bond of old age and madness which hold she prisoner she face be distort with terror memory gradually awaken she must have comprehend everything and it be a slow and gentle agony of which the spectacle last for several minute more charles silent now as if he have again fall asleep be lose the last drop of blood that have remain in he vein which be empty themselves softly he lily-like whiteness increase until it become a deathlike pallor he lip lose they rosy color become a pale pink then white and as he be about to expire he open he large eye and fix they on he great-great-grandmother who watch the light die in they all the waxen face be already dead the eye only be still live they still keep they limpidity they brightness all at once they become vacant the light in they be extinguish this be the end -- the death of the eye and charle have die without a struggle exhaust like a fountain from which all the water have run out life no longer pulse through the vein of he delicate skin there be now only the shadow of its wing on he white face but he remain divinely beautiful he face lie in blood surround by he royal blond lock like one of those little bloodless dauphin who unable to bear the execrable heritage of they race die of decrepitude and imbecility at sixteen the boy exhale he latest breath as dr pascal enter the room follow by felicite and clotilde and when he see the quantity of blood that inundate the floor he cry : ah my god it be as i fear a hemorrhage from the nose the poor darling no one be with he and it be all over but all three be strike with terror at the extraordinary spectacle that now meet they gaze aunt dide who seem to have grow taller in the superhuman effort she be make have almost succeed in raise herself up and she eye fix on the dead boy so fair and so gentle and on the red sea of blood beginning to congeal that be lie around he kindle with a think after a long sleep of twenty-two year this final lesion of madness this irremediable darkness of the mind be evidently not so complete but that some memory of the past lie hide there might awaken suddenly under the terrible blow which have strike she and the ancestress the forget one live again emerge from she oblivion rigid and waste like a specter of terror and grief for a instant she remain panting then with a shudder which make she tooth chatter she stammer a single phrase : the _ gendarme _ the _ gendarme _ pascal and felicite and clotilde understand they look at one another involuntarily turn very pale the whole dreadful history of the old mother -- of the mother of they all -- rise before they the ardent love of she youth the long suffering of she mature age already two moral shock have shake she terribly -- the first when she be in she ardent prime when a _ gendarme _ shoot down she lover macquart the smuggler like a dog the second year ago when another _ gendarme _ shatter with a pistol shoot the skull of she grandson silvere the insurgent the victim of the hatred and the sanguinary strife of the family blood have always bespatter she and a third moral shock finish she blood bespatter she again the impoverished blood of she race which she have just beheld flow slowly and which lay upon the ground while the fair royal child he vein and he heart empty sleep three time -- face to face with she past life she life red with passion and suffer haunt by the image of expiation -- she stammer : the _ gendarme _ the _ gendarme _ the _ gendarme _ then she sink back into she armchair they think she be dead kill by the shock but the keeper at this moment at last appear endeavor to excuse herself fear that she would be dismiss when aid by she dr pascal have place aunt dide on the bed he find that the old mother be still alive she be not to die until the follow day at the age of one hundred and five year three month and seven day of congestion of the brain cause by the last shock she have receive pascal turn to he mother say : she will not live twenty-four hour to-morrow she will be dead ah uncle macquart then she and this poor boy one after another how much misery and grief he pause and add in a lower tone : the family be thin out the old tree fall and the young die stand felicite must have think this another allusion she be sincerely shock by the tragic death of little charle but notwithstanding above the horror which she feel there arise a sense of immense relief next week when they should have cease to weep what a rest to be able to say to herself that all this abomination of the tulette be at a end that the family might at last rise and shine in history then she remember that she have not answer the involuntary accusation make against she by she son at the notary 's and she speak again of macquart through bravado : you see now that servant be of no use there be one here and yet she prevent nothing it would have be useless for uncle macquart to have have one to take care of he he would be in ash now all the same she sigh and then continue in a broken voice : well well neither we own fate nor that of other be in we hand thing happen as they will these be great blow that have fall upon we we must only trust to god for the preservation and the prosperity of we family dr pascal bow with he habitual air of deference and say : you be right mother clotilde kneel down she former fervent catholic faith have revive in this chamber of blood of madness and of death tear stream down she cheek and with clasped hand she be pray fervently for the dear one who be no more she pray that god would grant that they suffering might indeed be end they fault pardon and that they might live again in another life a life of unending happiness and she pray with the utmost fervor in she terror of a hell which after this miserable life would make suffer eternal from this day pascal and clotilde go to visit they sick side by side fill with greater pity than ever perhaps with pascal the feeling of he powerlessness against inevitable disease be even stronger than before the only wisdom be to let nature take its course to eliminate dangerous element and to labor only in the supreme work of give health and strength but the suffering and the death of those who be dear to we awaken in we a hatred of disease a irresistible desire to combat and to vanquish it and the doctor never taste so great a joy as when he succeed with he hypodermic injection in soothing a paroxysm of pain in see the groan patient grow tranquil and fall asleep clotilde in return adore he proud of they love as if it be a consolation which they carry like the viaticum to the poor x martine one morning obtain from dr pascal as she do every three month he receipt for fifteen hundred franc to take it to the notary grandguillot to get from he what she call they income the doctor seem surprised that the payment should have fall due again so soon he have never be so indifferent as he be now about money matter leave to martine the care of settle everything and he and clotilde be under the plane tree absorb in the joy that fill they life lull by the ceaseless song of the fountain when the servant return with a frightened face and in a state of extraordinary agitation she be so breathless with excitement that for a moment she could not speak oh my god oh my god she cry at last m grandguillot have go away pascal do not at first comprehend well my girl there be no hurry he say you can go back another day no no he have go away do not you hear he have go away forever -- and as the water rush forth in the bursting of a dam she emotion vent itself in a torrent of word i reach the street and i see from a distance a crowd gather before the door a chill run through I i feel that some misfortune have happen the door close and not a blind open as if there be somebody dead in the house they tell I when i get there that he have run away that he have not leave a sou behind he that many family would be ruin she lay the receipt on the stone table there there be you paper it be all over with we we have not a sou leave we be go to die of starvation and she sob aloud in the anguish of she miserly heart distract by this loss of a fortune and tremble at the prospect of impending want clotilde sit stunned and speechless she eye fix on pascal whose predominate feeling at first seem to be one of incredulity he endeavor to calm martine why why it would not do to give up in this way if all she know of the affair be what she have hear from the people in the street it might be only gossip after all which always exaggerate everything m grandguillot a fugitive m grandguillot a thief that be monstrous impossible a man of such probity a house like and respect by all plassan for more than a century past why people think money safer there than in the bank of france consider martine this would not have come all of a sudden like a thunderclap there would have be some rumor of it beforehand the deuce a old reputation do not fall to piece in that way in a night at this she make a gesture of despair ah monsieur that be what most afflict I because you see it throw some of the responsibility on I for week past i have be hear story on all side as for you two naturally you hear nothing you do not even know whether you be alive or dead neither pascal nor clotilde could refrain from smile for it be indeed true that they love lift they so far above the earth that none of the common sound of existence reach they but the story i hear be so ugly that i do not like to worry you with they i think they be lie she be silent for a moment and then add that while some people merely accuse m grandguillot of have speculate on the bourse there be other who accuse he of still worse practise and she burst into fresh sob my god my god what be go to become of we we be all go to die of starvation shake then move by see clotilde 's eye too fill with tear pascal make a effort to remember to see clearly into the past year ago when he have be practise in plassan he have deposit at different time with m grandguillot the twenty thousand franc on the interest of which he have live comfortably for the past sixteen year and on each occasion the notary have give he a receipt for the sum deposit this would no doubt enable he to establish he position as a personal creditor then a vague recollection awake in he memory he remember without be able to fix the date that at the request of the notary and in consequence of certain representation make by he which pascal have forget he have give the lawyer a power of attorney for the purpose of invest the whole or a part of he money in mortgage and he be even certain that in this power the name of the attorney have be leave in blank but he be ignorant as to whether this document have ever be use or not he have never take the trouble to inquire how he money have be invest a fresh pang of miserly anguish make martine cry out : ah monsieur you be well punish for you sin be that a way to abandon one 's money for my part i know almost to a sou how my account stand every quarter i have every figure and every document at my finger ' end in the midst of she distress a unconscious smile break over she face light it all up she long cherish passion have be gratify she four hundred franc wages save almost intact put out at interest for thirty year at last amount to the enormous sum of twenty thousand franc and this treasure be put away in a safe place which no one know she beam with delight at the recollection and she say no more but who say that we money be lose cry pascal m grandguillot have a private fortune he have not take away with he he house and he land i suppose they will look into the affair they will make a investigation i can not make up my mind to believe he a common thief the only trouble be the delay : a liquidation drag on so long he speak in this way in order to reassure clotilde whose grow anxiety he observe she look at he and she look around she at la souleiade she only care he happiness she most ardent desire to live here always as she have live in the past to love he always in this beloved solitude and he wish to tranquilize she recover he fine indifference never have live for money he do not imagine that one could suffer from the want of it but i have some money he cry at last what do martine mean by say that we have not a sou leave and that we be go to die of starvation and he rise gaily and make they both follow he say : come come i be go to show you some money and i will give some of it to martine that she may make we a good dinner this evening upstairs in he room he triumphantly open he desk before they it be in a drawer of this desk that for year past he have throw the money which he later patient have bring he of they own accord for he have never send they a account nor have he ever know the exact amount of he little treasure of the gold and bank bill mingle together in confusion from which he take the sum he require for he pocket money he experiment he present and he alms during the last few month he have make frequent visit to he desk make deep inroad into its contents but he have be so accustomed to find there the sum he require after year of economy during which he have spend scarcely anything that he have come to believe he savings inexhaustible he give a satisfied laugh then as he open the drawer cry : now you shall see now you shall see and he be confound when after search among the heap of note and bill he succeed in collect only a sum of 615 franc -- two note of 100 franc each 400 franc in gold and 15 franc in change he shake out the papers he feel in every corner of the drawer cry : but it can not be there be always money here before there be a heap of money here a few day ago it must have be all those old bill that mislead I i assure you that last week i see a great deal of money i have it in my hand he speak with such amusing good faith he childlike surprise be so sincere that clotilde could not keep from smile ah the poor master what a wretched business man he be then as she observe martine 's look of anguish she utter despair at sight of this insignificant sum which be now all there be for the maintenance of all three she be seize with a feeling of despair she eye fill with tear and she murmur : my god it be for I that you have spend everything if we have nothing now if we be ruin it be i who be the cause of it pascal have already forget the money he have take for the present evidently that be where it have go the explanation tranquilize he and as she begin to speak in she grief of return everything to the dealer he grow angry give back what i have give you you would give a piece of my heart with it then no i would rather die of hunger i tell you then he confidence already restore see a future of unlimited possibility open out before he he say : besides we be not go to die of hunger to-night be we martine there be enough here to keep we for a long time martine shake she head she would undertake to manage with it for two month for two and a half perhaps if people have sense but not longer formerly the drawer be replenish there be always some money come in but now that monsieur have give up he patient they have absolutely no income they must not count on any help from outside then and she end by say : give I the two one-hundred-franc bill i 'll try and make they last for a month then we shall see but be very prudent do not touch the four hundred franc in gold lock the drawer and do not open it again oh as to that cry the doctor you may make you mind easy i would rather cut off my right hand and thus it be settle martine be to have entire control of this last purse and they might trust to she economy they be sure that she would save the centime as for clotilde who have never have a private purse she would not even feel the want of money pascal only would suffer from no longer have he inexhaustible treasure to draw upon but he have give he promise to allow the servant to buy everything there that be a good piece of work he say relieve as happy as if he have just settle some important affair which would assure they a living for a long time to come a week pass during which nothing seem to have change at la souleiade in the midst of they tender rapture neither pascal nor clotilde think any more of the want which be impending and one morning during the absence of the latter who have go with martine to market the doctor receive a visit which fill he at first with a sort of terror it be from the woman who have sell he the beautiful corsage of old point d'alencon he first present to clotilde he feel himself so weak against a possible temptation that he tremble even before the woman have utter a word he have already begin to defend himself -- no no he neither could nor would buy anything and with outstretched hand he prevent she from take anything out of she little bag declare to himself that he would look at nothing the dealer however a fat amiable woman smile certain of victory in a insinuate voice she begin to tell he a long story of how a lady whom she be not at liberty to name one of the most distinguished lady in plassan who have suddenly meet with a reverse of fortune have be oblige to part with one of she jewel and she then enlarged on the splendid chance -- a piece of jewelry that have cost twelve hundred franc and she be willing to let it go for five hundred she open she bag slowly in spite of the terrify and ever-louder protestation of the doctor and take from it a slender gold necklace set simply with seven pearl in front but the pearl be of wonderful brilliancy -- flawless and perfect in shape the ornament be simple chaste and of exquisite delicacy and instantly he see in fancy the necklace on clotilde 's beautiful neck as its natural adornment any other jewel would have be a useless ornament these pearl would be the fitting symbol of she youth and he take the necklace in he tremble finger experience a mortal anguish at the idea of return it he defend himself still however he declare that he have not five hundred franc while the dealer continue in she smooth voice to push the advantage she have gain after another quarter a hour when she think she have he secure she suddenly offer he the necklace for three hundred franc and he yield he mania for give he desire to please he idol to adorn she conquer when he go to the desk to take the fifteen gold piece to count they out to the dealer he feel convinced that the notary 's affair would be arrange and that they would soon have plenty of money when pascal find himself once more alone with the ornament in he pocket he be seize with a childish delight and he plan he little surprise while wait excited and impatient for clotilde 's return the moment she make she appearance he heart begin to beat violently she be very warm for a August sun be blaze in the sky and she lay aside she thing quickly please with she walk tell he laughing of the good bargain martine have make -- two pigeon for eighteen sous while she be speak he pretend to notice something on she neck why what have you on you neck let I see he have the necklace in he hand and he succeed in put it around she neck while feign to pass he finger over it to assure himself that there be nothing there but she resist say gaily : do not there be nothing on my neck here what be you do what have you in you hand that be tickle I he catch hold of she and draw she before the long mirror in which she have a full view of herself on she neck the slender chain show like a thread of gold and the seven pearl like seven milky star shine with soft luster against she satin skin she look charmingly childlike suddenly she give a delighted laugh like the cooing of a dive swell out its throat proudly oh master master how good you be do you think of nothing but I then how happy you make I and the joy which shine in she eye the joy of the woman and the lover happy to be beautiful and to be adore recompense he divinely for he folly she draw back she head radiant and hold up she mouth to he he bent over and kiss she be you happy oh yes master happy happy pearl be so sweet so pure and these be so become to I for a instant longer she admire herself in the glass innocently vain of she fair flower-like skin under the nacre drop of the pearl then yield to a desire to show herself hear the servant move about outside she run out cry : martine martine see what master have just give I say be i not beautiful but all at once see the old maid 's severe face that have suddenly turn a ashen hue she become confused and all she pleasure be spoil perhaps she have a consciousness of the jealous pang which she brilliant youth cause this poor creature wear out in the dumb resignation of she servitude in adoration of she master this however be only a momentary feeling unconscious in the one hardly suspect by the other and what remain be the evident disapprobation of the economical servant condemn the present with she sidelong glance clotilde be seize with a little chill only she murmur master have rummage he desk again pearl be very dear be they not pascal embarrassed too protest volubly tell they of the splendid opportunity present by the dealer 's visit a incredibly good stroke of business -- it be impossible to avoid buy the necklace how much ask the young girl with real anxiety three hundred franc martine who have not yet open she lip but who look terrible in she silence could not restrain a cry good god enough to live upon for six week and we have not bread large tear well from clotilde 's eye she would have tear the necklace from she neck if pascal have not prevent she she wish to give it to he on the instant and she falter in heart-broken tone : it be true martine be right master be mad and i be mad too to keep this for a instant in the situation in which we be it would burn my flesh let I take it back i beg of you never would he consent to this he say now he eye too be moist he join in they grief cry that he be incorrigible that they ought to have take all the money away from he and run to the desk he take the hundred franc that be leave and force martine to take they say : i tell you that i will not keep another sou i should spend this too take it martine you be the only one of we who have any sense you will make the money last i be very certain until we affair be settle and you dear keep that do not grieve I nothing more be say about this incident but clotilde keep the necklace wear it under she gown and there be a sort of delightful mystery in feeling on she neck unknown to every one this simple pretty ornament sometimes when they be alone she would smile at pascal and draw the pearl from she dress quickly and show they to he without a word and as quickly she would replace they again on she warm neck fill with delightful emotion it be they fond folly which she thus recall to he with a confused gratitude a vivid and radiant joy -- a joy which nevermore leave she a straitened existence sweet in spite of everything now begin for they martine make a exact inventory of the resource of the house and it be not reassure the provision of potato only promise to be of any importance as ill luck would have it the jar of oil be almost out and the last cask of wine be also nearly empty la souleiade have neither vine nor olive tree produce only a few vegetable and some fruit -- pear not yet ripe and trellis grape which be to be they only delicacy and meat and bread have to be buy every day so that from the first day the servant put pascal and clotilde on ration suppress the former sweet cream and pastry and reduce the food to the quantity barely necessary to sustain life she resume all she former authority treat they like child who be not to be consult even with regard to they wish or they taste it be she who arrange the menu who know better than themselves what they want but all this like a mother surround they with unceasing care perform the miracle of enable they to live still with comfort on they scanty resource occasionally severe with they for they own good as one be severe with a child when it refuse to eat its food and it seem as if this maternal care this last immolation the illusory peace with which she surround they love give she too a little happiness and draw she out of the dumb despair into which she have fall since she have thus watch over they she have begin to look like she old self with she little white face the face of a nun vow to chastity she calm ash-colored eye which express the resignation of she thirty year of servitude when after the eternal potato and the little cutlet at four sous undistinguishable among the vegetable she be able on certain day without compromise she budget to give they pancake she be triumphant she laugh to see they laugh pascal and clotilde think everything she do be right which do not prevent they however from jest about she when she be not present the old jest about she avarice be repeat over and over again they say that she count the grain of pepper so many grain for each dish in she passion for economy when the potato have too little oil when the cutlet be reduce to a mouthful they would exchange a quick glance stifle they laughter in they napkin until she have leave the room everything be a source of amusement to they and they laugh innocently at they misery at the end of the first month pascal thought of martine 's wages usually she take she forty franc herself from the common purse which she keep my poor girl he say to she one evening what be you go to do for you wages now that we have no more money she remain for a moment with she eye fix on the ground with a air of consternation then she say : well monsieur i must only wait but he see that she have not say all that be in she mind that she have think of some arrangement which she do not know how to propose to he so he encourage she well then if monsieur would consent to it i should like monsieur to sign I a paper how a paper yes a paper in which monsieur should say every month that he owe I forty franc pascal at once make out the paper for she and this make she quite happy she put it away as carefully as if it have be real money this evidently tranquilize she but the paper become a new subject of wonder amusement to the doctor and he companion in what do the extraordinary power consist which money have on certain nature this old maid who would serve he on bended knee who adore he above everything to the extent of have devote to he she whole life to ask for this silly guarantee this scrap of paper which be of no value if he should be unable to pay she so far neither pascal nor clotilde have any great merit in preserve they serenity in misfortune for they do not feel it they live high above it in the rich and happy realm of they love at table they do not know what they be eat they might fancy they be partaking of a princely banquet serve on silver dish they be unconscious of the increase destitution around they of the hunger of the servant who live upon the crumb from they table and they walk through the empty house as through a palace hang with silk and fill with riches this be undoubtedly the happiest period of they love the workroom have pleasant memory of the past and they spend whole day there wrap luxuriously in the joy of have live so long in it together then out of door in every corner of la souleiade royal summer have set up he blue tent dazzling with gold in the morning in the embalsamed walk on the pine grove at noon under the dark shadow of the plane tree lull by the murmur of the fountain in the evening on the cool terrace or in the still warm threshing yard bath in the faint blue radiance of the first star they live with rapture they straitened life they only ambition to live always together indifferent to all else the earth be theirs with all its riches its pomp and its dominion since they love each other toward the end of August however matter grow bad again at time they have rude awakening in the midst of this life without tie without duty without work this life which be so sweet but which it would be impossible hurtful they know to lead always one evening martine tell they that she have only fifty franc leave and that they would have difficulty in manage for two week longer even give up wine in addition to this the news be very serious the notary grandguillot be beyond a doubt insolvent so that not even the personal creditor would receive anything in the begin they have rely on the house and the two farm which the fugitive notary have leave perforce behind he but it be now certain that this property be in he wife 's name and while he be enjoy in switzerland as it be say the beauty of the mountain she live on one of the farm which she cultivate quietly away from the annoyance of the liquidation in short it be infamous -- a hundred family ruin leave without bread a assignee have indeed be appoint but he have serve only to confirm the disaster since not a centime of asset have be discover and pascal with he usual indifference neglect even to go and see he to speak to he about he own case think that he already know all that there be to be know about it and that it be useless to stir up this ugly business since there be neither honor nor profit to be derive from it then indeed the future look threaten at la souleiade black want stare they in the face and clotilde who in reality have a great deal of good sense be the first to take alarm she maintain she cheerfulness while pascal be present but more prescient than he in she womanly tenderness she fall into a state of absolute terror if he leave she for a instant ask herself what be to become of he at he age with so heavy a burden upon he shoulder for several day she cherish in secret a project -- to work and earn money a great deal of money with she pastel people have so often praise she extraordinary and original talent that take martine into she confidence she send she one fine morning to offer some of she fantastic bouquet to the color dealer of the cours sauvaire who be a relation it be say of a parisian artist it be with the express condition that nothing be to be exhibit in plassan that everything be to be send to a distance but the result be disastrous the merchant be frighten by the strangeness of the design and by the fantastic boldness of the execution and he declare that they would never sell this throw she into despair great tear well she eye of what use be she it be a grief and a humiliation to be good for nothing and the servant be oblige to console she say that no doubt all woman be not bear for work that some grow like the flower in the garden for the sake of they fragrance while other be the wheat of the field that be ground up and use for food martine meantime cherish another project it be to urge the doctor to resume he practice at last she mention it to clotilde who at once point out to she the difficulty the impossibility almost of such a attempt she and pascal have be talk about he do so only the day before he too be anxious and have think of work as the only chance of salvation the idea of open a office again be naturally the first that have present itself to he but he have be for so long a time the physician of the poor how could he venture now to ask payment when it be so many year since he have leave off do so besides be it not too late at he age to recommence a career not to speak of the absurd rumor that have be circulate about he the name which they have give he of a crack-brained genius he would not find a single patient now it would be a useless cruelty to force he to make a attempt which would assuredly result only in a lacerated heart and empty hand clotilde on the contrary have use all she influence to turn he from the idea martine comprehend the reasonableness of these objection and she too declare that he must be prevent from run the risk of so great a chagrin but while she be speak a new idea occur to she as she suddenly remember a old register which she have meet with in a press and in which she have in former time enter the doctor 's visit for a long time it be she who have keep the account there be so many patient who have never pay that a list of they fill three of the large page of the register why then now that they have fall into misfortune should they not ask from these people the money which they justly owe it might be do without say anything to monsieur who have never be willing to appeal to the law and this time clotilde approve of she idea it be a perfect conspiracy clotilde consult the register and make out the bill and the servant present they but nowhere do she receive a sou they tell she at every door that they would look over the account that they would stop in and see the doctor himself ten day pass no one come and there be now only six franc in the house barely enough to live upon for two or three day longer martine when she return with empty hand on the follow day from a new application to a old patient take clotilde aside and tell she that she have just be talk with mme felicite at the corner of the rue de la banne the latter have undoubtedly be watch for she she have not again set foot in la souleiade not even the misfortune which have befall she son -- the sudden loss of he money of which the whole town be talk -- have bring she to he she still continue stern and indignant but she wait in tremble excitement she maintain she attitude as a offended mother only in the certainty that she would at last have pascal at she foot shrewdly calculate that he would sooner or later be compel to appeal to she for assistance when he have not a sou leave when he knock at she door then she would dictate she term he should marry clotilde or better still she would demand the departure of the latter but the day pass and he do not come and this be why she have stop martine assume a pity air ask what news there be and seem to be surprise that they have not have recourse to she purse while give it to be understand that she dignity forbid she to take the first step you should speak to monsieur and persuade he end the servant and indeed why should he not appeal to he mother that would be entirely natural oh never would i undertake such a commission cry clotilde master would be angry and with reason i truly believe he would die of starvation before he would eat grandmother 's bread but on the evening of the second day after this at dinner as martine be put on the table a piece of boil beef leave over from the day before she give they notice i have no more money monsieur and to-morrow there will be only potato

confidence and she venture to tell he of she anxiety on he account on she own on that of the whole house what be go to become of they when all they resource should be exhaust for a moment she think of speak to he of he mother but she be afraid and she contented herself with confess to he what she and martine have do -- the old register examine the bill make out and send the money ask everywhere in vain in other circumstance he would have be greatly annoyed and very angry at this confession offend that they should have act without he knowledge and contrary to the attitude he have maintain during he whole professional life he remain for a long tine silent strongly agitate and this would have suffice to prove how great must be he secret anguish at time under he apparent indifference to poverty then he forgive clotilde clasp she wildly to he breast and finally he say that she have do right that they could not continue to live much longer as they be live in a destitution which increase every day then they fall into silence each try to think of a means of procure the money necessary for they daily want each suffer keenly she desperate at the thought of the torture that await he he unable to accustom himself to the idea of see she want bread be they happiness forever end then be poverty go to blight they spring with its chill breath at breakfast on the follow day they eat only fruit

show at last that he be a man then as before in they hour of happiness old king david as pascal jestingly call himself leave the house lean on abishag 's arm neither of they be yet in rag he still wear he tightly button overcoat she have on she pretty linen gown with red spot but doubtless the consciousness of they poverty lower they in they own estimation make they feel that they be now only two poor people who occupy a very insignificant place in the world for they walk along by the house shun observation the sunny street be almost desert a few curious glance embarrass they they do not hasten they step however only they heart be oppress at the thought of the visit they be about to make pascal resolve to begin with a old magistrate whom he have treat for a affection of the liver he enter the house leave clotilde sit on the bench in the cour sauvaire but he be greatly relieve when the magistrate anticipate he demand tell he that he do not receive he rent until October and that he would pay he then at the house of a old lady of seventy a paralytic the rebuff be of a different kind she be offend because she account have be send to she through a servant who have be impolite so that he hasten to offer she he excuse give she all the time she desire then he climb up three flight of stair to the apartment of a clerk in the tax collector 's office whom he find still ill and so poor that he do not even venture to make he demand then follow a mercer a lawyer 's wife a oil merchant a baker -- all well-to-do people and all turn he away some with excuse other by deny he admittance a few even pretend not to know what he mean there remain the marquise de valqueyras the sole representative of a very ancient family a widow with a girl of ten who be very rich and whose avarice be notorious he have leave she for the last for he be greatly afraid of she finally he knock at the door of she ancient mansion at the foot of the cour sauvaire a massive structure of the time of mazarin he remain so long in the house that clotilde who be walk under the tree at last become uneasy when he finally make he appearance at the end of a full half hour she say jestingly greatly relieved : why what be the matter have she no money but here too he have be unsuccessful she complain that she tenant do not pay she imagine he continue in explanation of he long absence the little girl be ill i be afraid that it be the beginning of a gastric fever so she wish I to see the child and i examine she a smile which she could not suppress come to clotilde 's lip and you prescribe for she of course could i do otherwise she take he arm again deeply affect and he feel she press it against she heart for a time they walk on aimlessly it be all over they have knock at every debtor 's door and nothing now remain for they to do but to return home with empty hand but this pascal refuse to do determine that clotilde should have something more than the potato and water which await they when they ascend the cours sauvaire they turn to the leave to the new town drift now whither cruel fate lead they listen say pascal at last i have a idea if i be to speak to ramond he would willingly lend we a thousand franc which we could return to he when we affair be arrange she do not answer at once ramond whom she have reject who be now marry and settle in a house in the new town in a fair way to become the fashionable physician of the place and to make a fortune she know indeed that he have a magnanimous soul and a kind heart if he have not visit they again it have be undoubtedly

have throw open to the young physician he house he purse and he heart no no she answer quickly there have never be anything between we but affection and frankness i think i give he a great deal of pain but he have forgive I you be right we have no other friend it be to ramond that we must apply ill luck pursue they however ramond be absent from home attend a consultation at marseille and he

notwithstanding but the doctor naturally do not prefer he request and contented himself with say in explanation of he visit that he have miss ramond when they be in the street again pascal and clotilde feel themselves once more abandon and alone where now should they turn what new effort should they make and they walk on again aimlessly i do not tell you master clotilde at last venture to

its cour sauvaire its rue de rome and its rue de la banne divide it into three quarter this plassan with its window always close this sun-baked town dead in appearance but which conceal under this sleep surface a whole nocturnal life of the clubhouse and the gaming table they walk through it three time more with slacken pace on this clear calm close of a glowing August day in the yard of the coach office a few old stage-coach which still ply between the town and the mountain village be stand unharnessed and under the thick shade of the plane tree at the door of the cafe the customer who be to be see from seven o'clock in the morning look after they smile in the new town too the servant come and stand at the door of the wealthy house they meet with less sympathy here than in the desert street of the quartier st marc whose antique house maintain a friendly silence they return to the heart of the old quarter where they be most like they go as far as st saturnin the cathedral whose apse be shaded by the garden of the chapter a sweet and peaceful solitude from which a beggar drive they by himself ask a alms from they they be build rapidly in the neighborhood of the railway station a new quarter be grow up there and they bent they step in that direction then they return a last time to the place de la sous-prefecture with a sudden reawaken of hope thinking that they might meet some one who would offer they money but they be follow only by the indulgent smile of the town at see they so united and so beautiful only one woman have tear in she eye foresee perhaps the suffering that await they the stone of the viorne the little sharp paving stone wound they foot and they have at last to return to la souleiade without have succeed in obtain anything the old

potato be on the fire we can take they up very well ourselves the servant who be feverish and out of humor yield she mutter some indistinct word -- when people have eat up everything what be the use of sit down to table then before shut herself into she room she add : monsieur there be no more hay for bonhomme i think he be look badly a little while ago monsieur ought to go and see he pascal and clotilde fill with uneasiness go to the stable the old horse be in fact lie on the straw in the somnolence of expire old age they have not take he out for six month past for he leg stiff with rheumatism refuse to support he and he have become completely blind no one could understand why the doctor keep the old beast even martine have at last say that he ought to be slaughter if only through pity but pascal and clotilde cry out at this as much excite as if it have be propose to they to put a end to some aged relative who be not die fast enough no no he have serve they for more than a quarter of a century he should die comfortably with they like the worthy fellow he have always be and to-night the doctor do not scorn to examine he as if he have never attend any other patient than animal he lift up he hoof look at he gum and listen to the beating of he heart no there be nothing the matter with he he say at last it be simply old age ah my poor old fellow i think indeed we shall never again travel the road together the idea that there be no more hay distressed clotilde but pascal reassure she -- a animal of that age that no longer move about need so little she stoop down and take a few handful of grass from a heap which the servant have leave there and both be rejoice when bonhomme deign solely and simply through friendship as it seem to eat the grass out of she hand oh she say laugh so you still have a appetite you can not be very sick then you must not try to work upon we feeling good night and sleep well and they leave he to he slumber after have each give he as usual a hearty kiss on either side of he nose night fall and a idea occur to they in order not to remain downstairs in the empty house -- to close up everything and eat they dinner upstairs clotilde quickly take up the dish of potato the salt-cellar and a fine decanter of water while pascal take charge of a basket of grape the first which they have yet gather from a early vine at the foot of the terrace they close the door and lay the cloth on a little table put the potato in the middle between the salt-cellar and the decanter and the basket of grape on a chair beside they and it be a wonderful feast which remind they of the delicious breakfast they have make on the morning on which martine have obstinately shut herself up in she room and refuse to answer they they experience the same delight as then at be alone at wait upon themselves at eat from the same plate sit close beside each other this evening which they have anticipate with so much dread have in store for they the most delightful hour of they existence as soon as they find themselves at home in the large friendly room as far remove from the town which they have just be scour as if they have be a hundred league away from it all uneasiness and all sadness vanish -- even to the recollection of the wretched afternoon waste in useless wanderings they be once more indifferent to all that be not they affection they no longer remember that they have lose they fortune that they might have to hunt up a friend on the morrow in order to be able to dine in the evening why torture themselves with fear of come want when all they require to enjoy the greatest possible happiness be to be together but pascal feel a sudden terror my god and we dread this evening so greatly be it wise to be happy in this way who know what to-morrow may have in store for we but she put she little hand over he mouth she desire that he should have one more evening of perfect happiness no no to-morrow we shall love each other as we love each other to-day love I with all you strength as i love you and never have they eat with more relish she display the appetite of a healthy young girl with a good digestion she eat the potato with a hearty appetite laugh think they delicious better than the most vaunted delicacy he too recover the appetite of he youthful day they drink with delight deep draught of pure water then the grape for dessert fill they with admiration these grape so fresh this blood of the earth which the sun have touch with gold they eat to excess they become drunk on water and fruit and more than all on gaiety they do not remember ever before to have enjoy such a feast together even the famous breakfast they have make with its luxury of cutlet and bread and wine have not give they this intoxication this joy in live when to be together be happiness enough change the china to dish of gold and the miserable food to celestial fare such as not even the god enjoy it be now quite dark but they do not light the lamp through the wide open window they could see the vast summer sky the night breeze enter still warm and laden with a faint odor of lavender the moon have just rise above the horizon large and round flooding the room with a silvery light in which they see each other as in a dream light infinitely bright and sweet xi but on the follow day they disquietude all return they be now oblige to go in debt martine obtain on credit bread wine and a little meat much to she shame be it say force as she be to maneuver and tell lie for no one be ignorant of the ruin that have overtake the house the doctor have indeed think of mortgage la souleiade but only as a last resource all he now possess be this property which be worth twenty thousand franc but for which he would perhaps not get fifteen thousand if he should sell it and when these should be spend black want would be before they the street without even a stone of they own on which to lay they head clotilde therefore beg pascal to wait and not to take any irrevocable step so long as thing be not utterly desperate three or four day pass it be the beginning of September and the weather unfortunately change terrible storm ravage the entire country a part of the garden wall be blow down and as pascal be unable to rebuild it the yawning breach remain already they be begin to be rude at the baker 's and one morning the old servant come home with the meat from the butcher 's in tear say that he have give she the refuse a few day more and they would be unable to obtain anything on credit it have become absolutely necessary to consider how they should find the money for they small daily expense one Monday morning the beginning of another week of torture clotilde be very restless a struggle seem to be go on within she and it be only when she see pascal refuse at breakfast he share of a piece of beef which have be leave over from the day before that she at last come to a decision then with a calm and resolute air she go out after breakfast with martine after quietly put into the basket of the latter a little package -- some article of dress which she be give she she say when she return two hour later she be very pale but she large eye so clear and frank be shine she go up to the doctor at once and make she confession i must ask you forgiveness master for i have just be disobey you and i know that i be go to pain you greatly why what have you be do he ask uneasily not understand what she mean slowly without remove she eye from he she draw from she pocket a envelope from which she take some bank-note a sudden intuition enlighten he and he cry : ah my god the jewel the present i give you and he who be usually so good-tempered and gentle be convulse with grief and anger he seize she hand in he crush with almost brutal force the finger which hold the note my god what have you do unhappy girl it be my heart that you have sell both we heart that have enter into those jewel which you have give with they for money the jewel which i give you the souvenir of we divinest hour you property yours only how can you wish I to take they back to turn they to my profit can it be possible -- have you think of the anguish that this would give I and you master she answer gently do you think that i could consent to we remain in the unhappy situation in which we be in want of everything while i have these ring and necklace and earring lay away in the bottom of a drawer why my whole be would rise in protest i should think myself a miser a selfish wretch if i have keep they any longer and although it be a grief for I to part with they -- ah yes i confess it so great a grief that i could hardly find the courage to do it -- i be certain that i have only do what i ought to have do as a obedient and loving woman and as he still grasp she hand tear come to she eye and she add in the same gentle voice and with a faint smile : do not press so hard you hurt I then repentant and deeply move pascal too weep i be a brute to get angry in this way you act rightly you could not do otherwise but forgive I it be hard for I to see you despoil yourself give I you hand you poor hand and let I kiss away the mark of my stupid violence he take she hand again in he tenderly he cover they with kiss he think they inestimably precious so delicate and bare thus strip of they ring console now and joyous she tell he of she escapade -- how she have take martine into she confidence and how both have go to the dealer who have sell he the corsage of point d'alencon and how after interminable examine and bargaining the woman have give six thousand franc for all the jewel again he repress a gesture of despair -- six thousand franc when the jewel have cost he more than three time that amount -- twenty thousand franc at the very least listen he say to she at last i will take this money since in the goodness of you heart you have bring it to I but it be clearly understand that it be yours i swear to you that i will for the future be more miserly than martine herself i will give she only the few sous that be absolutely necessary for we maintenance and you will find in the desk all that may be leave of this sum if i should never be able to complete it and give it back to you entire he clasp she in a embrace that still tremble with emotion presently lower he voice to a whisper he say : and do you sell everything absolutely everything without speak she disengage herself a little from he embrace and put she finger to she throat with she pretty gesture smile and blush finally she draw out the slender chain on which shine the seven pearl like milky star then she put it back again out of sight he too blush and a great joy fill he heart he embrace she passionately ah he cry how good you be and how i love you but from this time forth the recollection of the jewel which have be sell rest like a weight upon he heart and he could not look at the money in he desk without pain he be haunt by the thought of approach want inevitable want and by a still more bitter thought -- the thought of he age of he sixty year which render he useless incapable of earn a comfortable live for a wife he have be suddenly and rudely awaken from he illusory dream of eternal love to the disquieting reality he have fall unexpectedly into poverty and he feel himself very old -- this terrify he and fill he with a sort of remorse of desperate rage against himself as if he have be guilty of a crime and this embittered he every hour if through momentary forgetfulness he permit himself to indulge in a little gaiety he distress soon return with greater poignancy than ever bring with it a sudden and inexplicable sadness he do not dare to question himself and he dissatisfaction with himself and he suffering increase every day then a frightful revelation come to he one morning when he be alone he receive a letter bear the plassan postmark the superscription on which he examine with surprise not recognize the write this letter be not sign and after read a few line he make a angry movement as if to tear it up and throw it away but he sit down tremble instead and read it to the end the style be perfectly courteous the long phrase roll on measure and carefully word like diplomatic phrase whose only aim be to convince it be demonstrate to he with a superabundance of argument that the scandal of la souleiade have last too long already if passion up to a certain point explain the fault yet a man of he age and in he situation be render himself contemptible by persist in wreck the happiness of the young relative whose trustfulness he abuse no one be ignorant of the ascendency which he have acquire over she it be admit that she glory in sacrifice herself for he but ought he not on he side to comprehend that it be impossible that she should love a old man that what she feel be merely pity and gratitude and that it be high time to deliver she from this senile love which would finally leave she with a dishonored name since he could not even assure she a small fortune the writer hope he would act like a honorable man and have the strength to separate from she through consideration for she happiness if it be not yet too late and the letter conclude with the reflection that evil conduct be always punish in the end from the first sentence pascal feel that this anonymous letter come from he mother old mme rougon must have dictate it he could hear in it the very inflection of she voice but after have begin the letter angry and indignant he finish it pale and tremble seize by the shiver which now pass through he continually and without apparent cause the letter be right it enlighten he cruelly regard the source of he mental distress show he that it be remorse for keep clotilde with he old and poor as he be he get up and walk over to a mirror before which he stand for a long time he eye gradually fill with tear of despair at sight of he wrinkle and he white beard the feeling of terror which arise within he the mortal chill which invade he heart be cause by the thought that separation have become necessary inevitable he repel the thought he feel that he would never have the strength for a separation but it still return he would never now pass a single day without be assail by it without be tear by the struggle between he love and he reason until the terrible day when he should become resign he strength and he tear exhaust in he present weakness he tremble merely at the thought of one day have this courage and all be indeed over the irrevocable have begin he be fill with fear for clotilde so young and so beautiful and all there be leave he now be the duty of save she from himself then haunt by every word by every phrase of the letter he tortured himself at first by try to persuade himself that she do not love he that all she feel for he be pity and gratitude it would make the rupture more easy to he he think if he be once convince that she sacrifice herself and that in keep she with he longer he be only gratify he monstrous selfishness but it be in vain that he study she that he subject she to proof she remain as tender and devote as ever make the dreaded decision still more difficult then he ponder over all the cause that vaguely but ceaselessly urge they separation the life which they have be lead for month past this life without tie or duty without work of any sort be not good he think no longer of himself he consider himself good for nothing now but to go away and bury himself out of sight in some remote corner but for she be it not a injurious life a life which would deteriorate she character and weaken she will and suddenly he see himself in fancy die leave she alone to perish of hunger in the street no no this would be a crime he could not for the sake of the happiness of he few remain day bequeath to she this heritage of shame and misery one morning clotilde go for a walk in the neighborhood from which she return greatly agitate pale and tremble and as soon as she be upstairs in the workroom she almost faint in pascal 's arm falter : oh my god oh my god those woman terrify he press she with question come tell I what have happen a flush mount to she face she fling she arm around he neck and hide she head on he shoulder it be those woman reach a shady spot i be close my parasol and i have

find nothing to say to she he kiss she wildly weep like herself he picture to himself the whole scene he see she pursued hoot at reviled presently he falter : it be my fault it be through I you suffer listen we will go away from here far far away where we shall not be know where you will be honor where you will be happy but see he weep she recover she calmness by a violent effort and dry she tear she say : ah i have behave like a coward in tell you all this after promising myself that i would say nothing of it to you but when i find myself at home again my anguish be so great that it all come out but you see now it be all over do not grieve about it i love you she smile and put she arm about he she kiss he in she turn try to soothe he despair i love you i love you so dearly that it will console I for everything there be only you in the world what matter anything that be not you you be so good you make I so happy but he continue to weep and she too begin to weep again and there be a moment of infinite sadness of anguish in which they mingle they kiss and they tear pascal when she leave he alone for a instant thought himself a wretch he could no longer be the cause of misfortune to this child whom he adore and on the evening of the same day a event take place which bring about the solution hitherto seek in vain with the fear of find it after dinner martine beckon he aside and give he a letter with all sort of precaution say : i meet mme felicite and she charge I to give you this letter monsieur and she tell I to tell you that she would have bring it to you herself only

toward he she would have no reason to repent it and end by remind the young girl of the promise she have make he at the time of he visit to plassan to come to he if the day ever arrive when he really need she pascal turn cold he read the four page over again here a opportunity to separate present itself acceptable to he and advantageous for clotilde so easy and so natural that they ought to accept it at once yet in spite of all he reasoning he feel so weak so irresolute still that he limb tremble under he and he be oblige to sit down for a moment but he wish to be heroic and controlling himself he call to he companion here he say read this letter which you grandmother have send I clotilde read the letter attentively to the end without a word without a sign then she say simply : well you be

happiness so intense inundate he be that he let she have she way the joy of keep she with he deprive he even of he power of reasoning but that very night what remorse do he not feel for have be so cowardly he have again yield to he longing for happiness a deathlike sweat break out upon he when he see she in imagination far away himself alone without she without that caressing and subtle essence that pervade the atmosphere when she be near she breath she brightness she courageous rectitude and the dear presence physical and mental which have now become as necessary to he life as the light of day itself she must leave he and he must find the strength to die of it he despise himself for he want of courage he judge the situation with terrible clear-sightedness all be end a honorable existence and a fortune await she with she brother he could not carry he senile selfishness so far as to keep she any longer in the misery in which he be to be scorn and despise and faint at the thought of all he be lose he swear to himself that he would be strong that he would not accept the sacrifice of this child that he would restore she to happiness and to life in she own despite and now the struggle of self-abnegation begin some day pass he have demonstrate to she so clearly the rudeness of she i refuse on maxime 's letter that she have write a long letter to she grandmother explain to she the reason for she refusal but still she would not leave la souleiade as pascal have grow extremely parsimonious in he desire to trench as little as possible on the money obtain by the sale of the jewel she surpass herself eat she dry bread with merry laughter one morning he surprise she give lesson of economy to martine twenty time a day she would look at he intently and then throw herself on he neck and cover he face with kiss to combat the dreadful idea of a separation which she see always in he eye then she have another argument one evening after dinner he be seize with a palpitation of the heart and almost faint this surprised he he have never suffer from the heart and he believe it to be simply a return of he old nervous trouble since he great happiness he have feel less strong

they be ill one stay with they to take care of they the struggle thus become a daily a hourly one it be a continual assault make by affection by devotion by self-abnegation in the one desire for another 's happiness but while she kindness and tenderness make the thought of she departure only the more cruel for pascal he feel every day more and more strongly the necessity for it he resolution be now take but he remain at bay tremble and hesitate as to the means of persuade she he picture to himself she despair she tear what should he do how should he tell she how could they bring themselves to give each other a last embrace never to see each other again and the day pass and he could think of nothing and he begin once more to accuse himself of cowardice sometimes she would say jestingly with a touch of affectionate malice : master you be too kind-hearted not to keep I but this vex he he grow excited and with gloomy despair answer : no no do not talk of my kindness if i be really kind you would have be long ago with you brother lead a easy and honorable life with a bright and tranquil future before you instead of obstinately remain here despise poor and without any prospect to be the sad companion of a old fool like I no i be nothing but a coward and a dishonorable man she hastily stop he and it be in truth he kindness of heart above all that bleed that immense kindness of heart which spring from he love of life which he diffuse over person and thing in he continual care for the happiness of every one and everything to be kind be not this to love she to make she happy at the price of he own happiness this be the kindness which it be necessary for he to exercise and which he feel that he would one day exercise heroic and decisive but like the wretch who have resolve upon suicide he wait for the opportunity the hour and the means to carry out he design early one morning on go into the workroom clotilde be surprise to see dr pascal seat at he table it be many week since he have either open a book or touch a pen why you be work she say without raise he head he answer absently : yes this be the genealogical tree that i have not even bring up to date she stand behind he for a few moment look at he write he be complete the notice of aunt dide of uncle macquart and of little charle write the date of they death then as he do not stir seem not to know that she be there wait for the kiss and the smile of other morning she walk idly over to the window and back again so you be in earnest she say you be really work certainly you see i ought to have note down these death last month and i have a heap of work wait there for I she look at he fixedly with that steady inquire gaze with which she seek to read he thought very well let we work if you have papers to examine or note to copy give they to I and from this day forth he affect to give himself up entirely to work besides it be one of he theory that absolute rest be unprofitable that it should never be prescribe even to the overworked as the fish live in the water so a man live only in the external medium which surround he the sensation which he receive from it transform themselves in he into impulse thought and act so that if there be absolute rest if he continue to receive sensation without give they out again digest and transform a engorgement would result a _ malaise _ a inevitable loss of equilibrium for himself he have always find work to be the best regulator of he existence even on the morning when he feel ill if he set to work he recover he equipoise he never feel better than when he be engage on some long work methodically plan out beforehand so many page to so many hour every morning and he compare this work to a balancing-pole which enable he to maintain he equilibrium in the midst of daily misery weakness and mistake so that he attribute entirely to the idleness in which he have be live for some week past the palpitation which at time make he feel as if he be go to suffocate if he wish to recover he health he have only to take up again he great work and pascal spend hour develop and explain these theory to clotilde with a feverish and exaggerated enthusiasm he seem to be once more possess by the love of knowledge and study in which up to the time of he sudden passion for she he have spend he life exclusively he repeat to she that he could not leave he work unfinished that he have still a great deal to do if he desire to leave a lasting monument behind he he anxiety about the envelope seem to have take possession of he again he open the large press twenty time a day take they down from the upper shelf and enrich they by new note he idea on heredity be already undergo a transformation he would have like to review the whole to recast the whole to deduce from the family history natural and social a vast synthesis a resume in broad stroke of all humanity then besides he review he method of treatment by hypodermic injection with the purpose of amplify it -- a confused vision of a new therapeutics a vague and remote theory base on he conviction and he personal experience of the beneficent dynamic influence of work now every morning when he seat himself at he table he would lament : i shall not live long enough life be too short he seem to feel that he must not lose another hour and one morning he look up abruptly and say to he companion who be copy a manuscript at he side : listen well clotilde if i should die -- what a idea she protest terrify if i should die he resume listen to I well -- close all the door immediately you be to keep the envelope you you only and when you have collect all my other manuscript send they to ramond these be my last wish do you hear but she refuse to listen to he no no she cry hastily you talk nonsense clotilde swear to I that you will keep the envelope and that you will send all my other papers to ramond at last now very serious and she eye fill with tear she give he the promise he desire he catch she in he arm he too deeply move and lavish caress upon she as if he heart have all at once reopen to she presently he recover he calmness and speak of he fear since he have be try to work they seem to have return he keep constant watch upon the press pretend to have observe martine prowl about it might they not work upon the fanaticism of this girl and urge she to a bad action persuade she that she be secure she master 's eternal welfare he have suffer so much from suspicion in the dread of approach solitude he former torture return -- the torture of the scientist who be menace and persecute by he own at he own fireside in he very flesh in the work of he brain one evening when he be again discuss this subject with clotilde he say unthinkingly : you know that when you be no longer here -- she turn very pale and as he stop with a start she cry : oh master master you have not give up that dreadful idea then i can see in you eye that you be hide something from I that you have a thought which you no longer share with I but if i go away and you should die who will be here then to protect you work think that she have become reconcile to the idea of she departure he have the strength to answer gaily : do you suppose that i would allow myself to die without see you once more i will write to you of course you must come back to close my eye now she burst out sob and sink into a chair my god can it be you wish that to-morrow we should be together no longer we who have never be separate from this day forth pascal seem more engrossed than ever in he work he would sit for four or five hour at a time whole morning and afternoon without once raise he head he overact he zeal he would allow no one to disturb he by so much as a word and when clotilde would leave the room on tiptoe to give a order downstairs or to go on some errand he would assure himself by a furtive glance that she be go and then let he head drop on the table with a air of profound dejection it be a painful relief from the extraordinary effort which he compel himself to make when she be present to remain at he table instead of go over and take she in he arm and cover she face with sweet kiss ah work how ardently he call on it as he only refuge from torture thought but for the most part he be unable to work he be oblige to feign attention keep he eye fix upon the page he sorrowful eye that grow dim with tear while he mind confuse distract fill always with one image suffer the pang of death be he then doom to see work fail now its effect he who have always consider it of sovereign power the creator and ruler of the world must he then throw away he pen renounce action and do nothing in future but exist and tear would flow down he white beard and if he hear clotilde come upstairs again he would seize he pen quickly in order that she might find he as she have leave he bury seemingly in profound meditation when he mind be now only a ache void it be now the middle of September two week that have seem interminable have pass in this distressing condition of thing without bring any solution when one morning clotilde be greatly surprise by see she grandmother felicite enter pascal have meet he mother the day before in the rue de la banne and impatient to consummate the sacrifice and not finding in himself the strength to make the rupture he have confide in she in spite of he repugnance and beg she to come on the follow day as it happen she have just receive another letter from maxime a despairing and implore letter she begin by explain she presence yes it be i my dear and you can understand that only very weighty reason could have induce I to set my foot here again but indeed you be get crazy i can not allow you to ruin you life in

painful therefore he request a decide answer from he sister hope still that she would come and tremble at the thought of be compel to seek another nurse this be what he would be oblige to do however if they abandon he in he sad condition and when she have finish read the letter she hint that it would be a great pity to let maxime 's fortune pass into the hand of stranger but above all she speak of duty of the assistance one owe to a relation she too affect to believe that a formal promise have be give come my dear call upon you memory you tell he that if he should ever need you you would go

the life they be lead what future could they hope for now that they have be overtake by poverty it be stupid and cruel to persist longer in she obstinate refusal clotilde standing erect and with a impenetrable countenance remain silent refusing even to discuss the question but as she grandmother torment she to give a answer she say at last : once more i have no duty whatever toward my brother

you wife and i will stay here a wife do not leave she husband but he answer only by a gesture as if he fear that he voice would betray he and that he should accept in a cry of gratitude the eternal bond which she have propose to he he gesture might signify a hesitation a refusal what be the good of this marriage _ in extremis _ when everything be fall to piece those be very fine sentiment no doubt return felicite you have settle it all in you own little head but marriage will not give you a income and meantime you be a great expense to he you be the heaviest of he burden the effect which these word have upon clotilde be extraordinary she turn violently to pascal she cheek crimson she eye fill with tear master master be what grandmother have just say true have it come to this that you regret the money i cost you here pascal grow still paler he remain motionless in a attitude of utter dejection but in a far-away voice as if he be talk to himself he murmur : i have so much work to do

case as if some subtle breath emanate from he have warn she of it and you be send I away forever you will not permit I to come back to-morrow but he hold out bravely with another smile he seem to answer that when one go away like this it be not to come back again on the follow day she be now completely bewilder she know not what to think it might be possible that he have choose work sincerely that the man of science have gain the victory over the lover she grow still paler and she wait a little longer in the terrible silence then slowly with she air of tender and absolute submission she say : very well master i will go away whenever you wish and i will not return until you send for I the die be cast the irrevocable be accomplish each feel that neither would attempt to recall the decision that have be make and from this instant every minute that pass would bring nearer the separation felicite surprise at not be oblige to say more at once desire to fix the time for clotilde 's

the door if they be leave open for a moment through forgetfulness slam to with a noise like the report of a cannon they might have fancy they be sustain a siege so great be the noise and the discomfort it be in this melancholy house shake by the storm that pascal on the follow day help clotilde to make she preparation for she departure old mme rougon be not to return until Sunday to say good-by when martine be inform of the approach separation she stand still in dumb amazement and a flash quickly extinguish light she eye and as they send she out of the room say that they would not require she assistance in pack the trunk she return to the kitchen and busy herself in she usual occupation seem to ignore the catastrophe which be about to revolutionize they household of three but at pascal 's slightest call she would run so promptly and with such alacrity she face so bright and so cheerful in she zeal to serve he that she seem like a young girl pascal do not leave clotilde for a moment help she desire to assure himself that she be take with she everything she could need two large trunk stand open in the middle of the disorder room bundle and article of clothing lay about everywhere twenty time the drawer and the press have be visit and in this work this anxiety to forget nothing the painful sinking of the heart which they both feel be in some measure lessen they forget for a instant -- he watch carefully to see that no space be lose utilize the hat-case for the smaller article of clothing slip box in between the fold of the linen while she take down the gown fold they on the bed wait to put they last in the top tray then when a little tired they stand up and find themselves again face to face they would smile at each other at first then choke back the sudden tear that start at the recollection of the impending and inevitable misfortune but though they heart bleed they remain firm good god be it then true that they be to be no longer together and then they hear the wind the terrible wind which threaten to blow down the house how many time during this last day do they not go over to the window attract by the storm wish that it would sweep away the world during these squall the sun do not cease to shine the sky remain constantly blue but a livid blue windswept and dusty and the sun be a yellow sun pale and cold they see in the distance the vast white cloud rise from the road the tree bend before the blast look as if they be fly all in the same direction at the same rate of speed the whole country parch and exhaust by the unvarying violence of the wind that blow ceaselessly with a roar like thunder branch be snap and whirl out of sight roof be lift up and carry so far away that they be never afterward find why could not the mistral take they all up together and carry they off to some unknown land where they might be happy the trunk be almost pack when pascal go to open one of the shutter that the wind have blow to but so fierce a gust sweep in through the half open window that clotilde have to go to he assistance lean with all they weight they be able at last to turn the catch the article of clothing in the room be

pillow to stifle he sob he get out of bed and try to finish dress himself but a fresh attack seize he and he head giddy and he heart palpitate to suffocation recover from a momentary faintness he falter in agonized tone : no no i can not i suffer too much i would rather die die now -- he recognize martine and abandon himself to he grief he strength totally go he make he confession to she : my poor girl i suffer too much my heart be break she be take away my heart with she she be take away my whole be i can not live without she i almost die last night i would be glad to die before she

pale as wax and a hard and bitter look come into she face for a moment she watch he clutch the bedclothes convulsively utter hoarse cry of despair he face press against the coverlet then by a violent effort she seem to make up she mind but monsieur there be no sense in make trouble for yourself in this way it be ridiculous since that be how it be and you can not do without mademoiselle i shall go and tell she what a state you have let yourself get into at these word he get up hastily stagger still and lean for support on the back of a chair he cry : i positively forbid you to do so martine a

we but he catch she angrily by the arm and hold she fast i command you to keep quiet do you hear or you shall go with she why do you come in it be this wind that make I ill that concern no one then yield to a good-natured impulse with he usual kindness of heart he smile my poor girl see how you vex I let I act as i ought for the happiness of other and not another word you would pain I greatly martine 's eye too fill with tear it be just in time that they make peace for clotilde enter almost immediately she have rise early eager to see pascal hope doubtless up to the last moment that he would keep she she own eyelid be heavy from want of sleep and she look at he steadily as she enter with she inquire air but he be still so discompose that she begin to grow uneasy no indeed i assure you i would even have sleep well but for the mistral i be just tell you so martine be i not the servant confirm he word by a affirmative nod and clotilde too submit say nothing of the night of anguish and mental conflict she have spend while he on he side have be suffer the pang of death both of the woman now docilely obey and aid he in he heroic self-abnegation what he continue open he desk i have something here for you there there be seven hundred franc in that envelope and in spite of she exclamation and protestation he persist in render she a account of the six thousand franc obtain by the sale of the jewel two hundred only have be spend and he have keep one hundred to last till the end of the month with the strict economy the penuriousness which he now display afterward he would no doubt sell la souleiade he would work he would be able to extricate himself from he difficulty but he would not touch the five thousand franc which remain for they be she property she own and she would find they again in the drawer master master you be give I a great deal of pain -- i wish it he interrupt and it be you who be try to break my heart come it be half-past seven i will go and cord you trunk since they be lock when martine and clotilde be alone and face to face they look at each other for a moment in silence ever since the commencement of the new situation they have be fully conscious of they secret antagonism the open triumph of the young mistress the half conceal jealousy of the old servant about she adored master now it seem that the victory remain with the servant but in this final moment they common emotion draw they together martine you must not let he eat like a poor man you promise I that he shall have wine and meat every day have no fear mademoiselle and the five thousand franc lie there you know belong to he you be not go to let yourselve starve to death i suppose with those there i want you to treat he very well i tell you that i will make it my

martine oh mademoiselle very gladly they be in each other 's arm when pascal reenter the room he pretend not to see they doubtless afraid of give way to he emotion in a unnaturally loud voice he speak of the final preparation for clotilde 's departure like a man who have a great deal on he hand and be afraid that the train might be miss he have cord the trunk a man have take they away in a little wagon and they would find they at the station but it be only eight o'clock and they have still two long hour before they two hour of mortal anguish spend in unoccupied and weary wait during which they taste a hundred time over the bitterness of parting the breakfast take hardly a quarter of a hour then they get up to sit down again they eye never leave the clock the minute seem long as those of a death watch throughout the mournful house how the wind blow say clotilde as a sudden gust make all the door creak pascal go over to the window and watch the wild flight of the storm-blown tree it have increase since morning he say presently i must see to the roof for some of the tile have be blow away already they have cease to be one household they listen in silence to the furious wind sweeping everything before it carry with it they life finally pascal look for a last time at the clock and say simply : it be time clotilde she rise from the chair on which she have be sit she have for a instant forget that she be go away and all at once the dreadful reality come back to she once more she look at he but he do not open he arm to keep she it be over she hope be dead and from this moment she face be like that of one strike with death at first they exchange the usual commonplace you will write to I will you not certainly and you must let I hear from you as often as possible above all if you should fall ill send for I at once i promise you that i will do so but there be no danger i be very strong then when the moment come in which she be to leave this dear house clotilde look around with unsteady gaze then she throw herself on pascal 's breast she hold he for a instant in she arm falter : i wish to embrace you here i wish to thank you master it be you who have make I what i be as you have often tell I you have correct my heredity what should i have become amid the surroundings in which maxime have grow up yes if i be worth anything it be to you alone i owe it you who transplant I into this abode of kindness and affection where you have bring I up worthy of you now after have take I and overwhelm I with benefit you send I away be it as you will you be my master and i will obey you i love you in spite of all and i shall always love you he press she to he heart answering : i desire only you good i be complete my work when they reach the station clotilde vow to herself that she would one day come back old mme rougon be there very gay and very brisk in spite of she eighty-and-odd year she be triumphant now she think she would have she son pascal at she mercy when she see they both stupefy with grief she take charge of everything get the ticket register the baggage and install the traveler in a compartment in which there be only lady then she speak for a long time about maxime give instruction and ask to be keep inform of everything but the train do not start there be still five cruel minute during which they remain face to face without speak to each other then come the end there be embrace a great noise of wheel and wave of handkerchief suddenly pascal become aware that he be stand alone upon the platform while the train be disappear around a bend in the road then without listen to he mother he run furiously up the slope spring up the stone step like a young man and find himself in three minute on the terrace of la souleiade the mistral be rage there -- a fierce squall which bent the secular cypress like straw in the colorless sky the sun seem weary of the violence of the wind which for six day have be sweep over its face and like the wind-blown tree pascal stand firm he garment flap like banner he beard and hair blow about and lash by the storm he breath catch by the wind he hand press upon he heart to quiet its throbbing he see the train fly in the distance across the bare plain a little train which the mistral seem to sweep before it like a dry branch xii from the day follow clotilde 's departure pascal shut himself up in the great empty house he do not leave it again cease entirely the rare professional visit which he have still continue to make live there with door and window close in absolute silence and solitude martine have receive formal order to admit no one under any pretext whatever but you mother monsieur mme felicite my mother less than any one else i have my reason tell she that i be work that i require to concentrate my thought and that i request she to excuse I three time in succession old mme rougon have present herself she would storm at the hall door he would hear she voice rise in anger as she try in vain to force she way in then the noise would be still and there would be only a whisper of complaint and plot between she and the servant but not once do he yield not once do he lean over the banister and call to she to come up one day martine venture to say to he : it be very hard all the same monsieur to refuse admittance to one 's mother the more so as mme felicite come with good intention for she know the strait that monsieur be in and she insist only in order to offer she service money he cry exasperated i want no money do you hear and from she less than anybody i will work i will earn my own living why should i not the question of money however begin to grow press he obstinately refuse to take another sou from the five thousand franc lock up in the desk now that he be alone he be completely indifferent to material thing he would have be satisfy to live on bread and water and every time the servant ask he for money to buy wine meat or sweet he shrug he shoulder -- what be the use there remain a crust from the day before be not that sufficient but in she affection for she master whom she feel to be suffer the old servant be heart-broken at this miserliness which exceed she own this utter destitution to which he abandon himself and the whole house the workman of the faubourg live better thus it be that for a whole day a terrible conflict go on within she she doglike love struggle with she love for she money amass sou by sou hide away make more as she say she would rather have part with a piece of she flesh so long as she master have not suffer alone the idea of touch she treasure have not even occur to she and she display extraordinary heroism the morning when drive to extremity see she stove cold and the larder empty she disappear for a hour and then return with provision and the change of a hundred-franc note pascal who just then chance to come downstairs ask she in astonishment where the money have come from furious already and prepare to throw it all into the street imagine she have apply to he mother why no why no monsieur she stammer it be not that at all and she tell he the story that she have prepare imagine m grandguillot 's affair be go to be settle -- or at least i think so it occur to I this morning to go to the assignee 's to inquire and he tell I that you would undoubtedly recover something and that i might have a hundred franc now yes he be even satisfy with a receipt from I he know I and you can make it all right afterward pascal seem scarcely surprised she have calculate correctly that he would not go out to verify she account she be relieved however to see with what easy indifference he accept she story ah so much the better he say you see now that one must never despair that will give I time to settle my affair he affair be the sale of la souleiade about which he have be think vaguely but what a grief to leave this house in which clotilde have grow up where they have live together for nearly eighteen year he have take two or three week already to reflect over the matter now that he have the hope of get back a little of the money he have lose through the notary 's failure he cease to think any more about it he relapse into he former indifference eat whatever martine serve he not even notice the comfort with which she once more surround he in humble adoration heart-broken at give she money but very happy to support he now without he suspect that he sustenance come from she but pascal reward she very ill afterward he would be sorry and regret he outburst but in the state of feverish desperation in which he live this do not prevent he from again fly into a passion with she at the slightest cause of dissatisfaction one evening after he have be listen to he mother talk for a interminable time with she in the kitchen he cry in sudden fury : martine i do not wish she to enter la souleiade again do you hear if you ever let she into the house again i will turn you out she listen to he in surprise never during the thirty-two year in which she have be in he service have he threaten to dismiss she in this way big tear come to she eye oh monsieur you would not have the courage to do it and i would not go i would lie down across the threshold first he already regret he anger and he say more gently : the thing be that i know perfectly well what be go on she come to indoctrinate you to put you against I be it not so yes she be watch my papers she wish to steal and destroy everything up there in the press i know she when she want anything she never give up until she get it well you can tell she that i be on my guard that while i be alive she shall never even come near the press and the key be here in my pocket in effect all he former terror -- the terror of the scientist who feel himself surround by secret enemy have return ever since he have be live alone in the desert house he have have a feeling of return danger of be constantly watch in secret the circle have narrow and if he show such anger at these attempt at invasion if he repulse he mother 's assault it be because he do not deceive himself as to she real plan and he be afraid that he might yield if she be there she would gradually take possession of he until she have subjugate he completely therefore he former torture return and he pass the day watch he shut up the house himself in the evening and he would often rise during the night to assure himself that the lock be not be force what he fear be that the servant win over by he mother and believe she be secure he eternal welfare would open the door to mme felicite in fancy he see the papers blaze in the fireplace he keep constant guard over they seize again by a morbid love a torture affection for this icy heap of papers these cold page of manuscript to which he have sacrifice the love of woman and which he try to love sufficiently to be able to forget everything else for they pascal now that clotilde be no longer there throw himself eagerly into work try to submerge himself in it to lose himself in it if he seclude himself if he do not set foot even in the garden if he have have the strength one day when martine come up to announce dr ramond to answer that he would not receive he he have in this bitter desire for solitude no other aim than to kill think by incessant labor that poor ramond how gladly he would have embrace he for he divine clearly the delicacy of feeling that have make he hasten to console he old master but why lose a hour why risk emotion and tear which would leave he so weak from daylight he be at he table he spend at it he morning and he afternoon extend often into the evening after the lamp be light and far into the night he wish to put he old project into execution -- to revise he whole theory of heredity employ the document furnish by he own family to establish the law accord to which in a certain group of human being life be distribute and conduct with mathematical precision from one to another take into account the environment -- a vast bible the genesis of family of society of all humanity he hope that the vastness of such a plan the effort necessary to develop so colossal a idea would take complete possession of he restore to he he health he faith he pride in the supreme joy of the accomplished work but it be in vain that he throw himself passionately persistently without reserve into he work he succeed only in fatigue he body and he mind without even be able to fix he thought or to put he heart into he work every day sicker and more despairing have work then finally lose its power he whose life have be spend in work who have regard it as the sole motor the benefactor and the consoler must he then conclude that to love and to be love be beyond all else in the world occasionally he would have great thought he continue to sketch out he new theory of the equilibrium of force demonstrate that what man receive in sensation he should return in action how natural full and happy would life be if it could be live entire perform its function like a well-ordered machine give back in power what be consume in fuel maintain itself in vigor and in beauty by the simultaneous and logical play of all its organ he believe physical and intellectual labor feeling and reasoning should be in equal proportion and never excessive for excess mean disturbance of the equilibrium and consequently disease yes yes to begin life over again and to know how to live it to dig the earth to study man to love woman to attain to human perfection the future city of universal happiness through the harmonious working of the entire be what a beautiful legacy for a philosophical physician to leave behind he would this be and this dream of the future this theory confusedly perceive fill he with bitterness at the thought that now he life be a force waste and lose at the very bottom of he grief pascal have the dominate feeling that for he life be end regret for clotilde sorrow at have she no longer beside he the certainty that he would never see she again fill he with overwhelming grief work have lose its power and he would sometimes let he head drop on the page he be write and weep for hour together unable to summon courage to take up the pen again he passion for work he day of voluntary fatigue lead to terrible night night of feverish sleeplessness in which he would stuff the bedclothes into he mouth to keep from cry out clotilde 's name she be everywhere in this mournful house in which he seclude himself he see she again walk through the room sit on the chair stand behind the door downstairs in the dining-room he could not sit at table without see she opposite he in the workroom upstairs she be still he constant companion for she too have live so long secluded in it that she image seem reflect from everything he feel she constantly beside he he could fancy he see she standing before she desk straight and slender -- she delicate face bent over a pastel and if he do not leave the house to escape from the dear and torture memory it be because he have the certainty that he should find she everywhere in the garden too : dream on the terrace walk with slow step through the alley in the pine grove sit under the shade of the plane tree lull by the eternal song of the fountain lie in the threshing yard at twilight she gaze fix on space wait for the star to come out but above all there exist for he a sacred sanctuary which he could not enter without tremble -- the chamber where she have confess she love he keep the key of it he have not move a single object from its place since the sorrowful morning of she departure and a skirt which she have forget lay still upon she armchair he open he arm wildly to clasp she shade float in the soft half light of the room with its closed shutter and its wall hang with the old fade pink calico of a dawnlike tint in the midst of he unremitting toil pascal have another melancholy pleasure -- clotilde 's letter she write to he regularly twice a week long letter of eight or ten page in which she describe to he all she daily life she do not seem to lead a very happy life in paris maxime who do not now leave he sick chair evidently tortured she with the exaction of a spoil child and a invalid she speak as if she live in complete retirement always wait on he so that she could not even go over to the window to look out on the avenue along which roll the fashionable stream of the promenader of the boi and from certain of she expression it could be divine that she brother after have entreat she so urgently to go to he suspect she already and have begin to regard she with hatred and distrust as he do every one who approach he in he continual fear of be make use of and rob he do not give she the key treat she like a servant to whom he find it difficult to accustom himself twice she have see she father who be as always very gay and overwhelmed with business he have be convert to the republic and be at the height of political and financial success saccard have even take she aside to sympathize with she say that poor maxime be really insupportable and that she would be truly courageous if she consent to be make he victim as she could not do everything he have even have the kindness to send she on the follow day the niece of he hairdresser a fair-haired innocent-looking girl of eighteen name rise who be assist she now to take care of the invalid but clotilde make no complaint she affect on the contrary to be perfectly tranquil contented and resign to everything she letter be full of courage show neither anger nor sorrow at the cruel separation make no desperate appeal to pascal 's affection to recall she but between the line he could perceive that she tremble with rebellious anger that she whole be yearn for he that she be ready to commit the folly of return to he immediately at he lightest word and this be the one word that pascal would not write everything would be arrange in time maxime would become accustomed to he sister the sacrifice must be complete now that it have be begin a single line write by he in a moment of weakness and all the advantage of the effort he have make would be lose and they misery would begin again never have pascal have greater need of courage than when he be answer clotilde 's letter at night burn with fever he would toss about call on she wildly then he would get up and write to she to come back at once but when day come and he have exhaust himself with weep he fever abate and he answer be always very short almost cold he study every sentence begin the letter over again when he think he have forget himself but what a torture these dreadful letter so short so icy in which he go against he heart solely in order to wean she from he gradually to take upon himself all the blame and to make she believe that she could forget he since he forget she they leave he cover with perspiration and as exhaust as if he have just perform some great act of heroism one morning toward the end of October a month after clotilde 's departure pascal have a sudden attack of suffocation he have have several time already slight attack which he attribute to overwork but this time the symptom be so plain that he could not mistake they -- a sharp pain in the region of the heart extend over the whole chest and along the left arm and a dreadful sensation of oppression and distress while cold perspiration break out upon he it be a attack of angina pectori it last hardly more than a minute and he be at first more surprised than frighten with that blindness which physician often show where they own health be concern he never suspect that he heart might be affect as he be recover he breath martine come up to say that dr ramond be downstairs and again beg the doctor to see he and pascal yielding perhaps to a unconscious desire to know the truth cry : well let he come up since he insist upon it i will be glad to see he the two man embrace each other and no other allusion be make to the absent one to she whose departure have leave the house empty than a energetic and sad hand clasp you do not know why i have come cry ramond immediately it be about a question of money yes my father-in-law m leveque the advocate whom you know speak to I yesterday again about the fund which you have with the notary grandguillot and he advise you strongly to take some action in the matter for some person have succeed he say in recover something yes i know that that business be be settle say pascal martine have already get two hundred franc out of it i believe martine say ramond look greatly surprised how could she do that without you intervention however will you authorize my father-in-law to undertake you case he will see the assignee and sift the whole affair since you have neither the time nor the inclination to attend to it certainly i authorize m leveque to do so and tell he that i thank he a thousand time then this matter be settle the young man remark the doctor 's pallor and question he as to its cause pascal answer with a smile : imagine my friend i have just have a attack of angina pectoris oh it be not imagination all the symptom be there and stay since you be here you shall sound I at first ramond refuse affect to turn the consultation into a jest could a raw recruit like he venture to pronounce judgment on he general but he examine he notwithstanding see that he face look draw and pained with a singular look of fright in the eye he end by auscultate he carefully keep he ear press closely to he chest for a considerable time several minute pass in profound silence well ask pascal when the young physician stand up the latter do not answer at once he feel the doctor 's eye look straight into he and as the question have be put to he with quiet courage he answer in the same way : well it be true i think there be some sclerosis ah it be kind of you not to attempt to deceive I return the doctor smile i fear for a instant that you would tell I a untruth and that would have hurt I ramond listen again say in a undertone : yes the beat be strong the first sound be dull while the second on the contrary be sharp it be evident that the apex have descend and be turn toward the armpit there be some sclerosis at least it be very probable one may live twenty year with that he end straighten himself no doubt sometimes say pascal at least unless one chance to die of a sudden attack they talk for some time longer discuss a remarkable case of sclerosis of the heart which they have see at the hospital at plassan and when the young physician go away he say that he would return as soon as he should have news of the grandguillot liquidation but when he be alone pascal feel that he be lose everything be now explain : he palpitation for some week past he attack of vertigo and suffocation above all that weakness of the organ of he poor heart overtask by feeling and by work that sense of intense fatigue and impending death regard which he could no longer deceive himself it be not as yet fear that he experience however he first thought be that he too would have to pay for he heredity that sclerosis be the species of degeneration which be to be he share of the physiological misery the inevitable inheritance bequeath he by he terrible ancestry in other the neurosis the original lesion have turn to vice or virtue genius crime drunkenness sanctity other again have die of consumption of epilepsy of ataxia he have live in he feeling and he would die of a affection of the heart and he tremble no longer he rebel no longer against this manifest heredity fate and inevitable no doubt on the contrary a feeling of humility take possession of he the idea that all revolt against natural law be bad that wisdom do not consist in hold one 's self apart but in resign one 's self to be only a member of the whole great body why then be he so unwilling to belong to he family that it fill he with triumph that he heart beat with joy when he believe himself different from they without any community with they nothing could be less philosophical only monster grow apart and to belong to he family seem to he in the end as good and as fine as to belong to any other family for do not all family in the main resemble one another be not humanity everywhere identical with the same amount of good and evil he come at last humbly and gently even in the face of impend suffering and death to accept everything life have to give he from this time pascal live with the thought that he might die at any moment and this help to perfect he character to elevate he to a complete forgetfulness of self he do not cease to work but he have never understand so well how much effort must seek its reward in itself the work be always transitory and remain of necessity incomplete one evening at dinner martine inform he that sarteur the journeyman hatter the former inmate of the asylum at the tulette have just hang himself all the evening he think of this strange case of this man whom he have believe he have cure of homicidal mania by he treatment of hypodermic injection and who seize by a fresh attack have evidently have sufficient lucidity to hang himself instead of spring at the throat of some passer-by he again see he so gentle so reasonable kiss he hand while he be advise he to return to he life of healthful labor what then be this destructive and transform force the desire to murder change to suicide death perform its task in spite of everything with the death of this man he last vestige of pride as a healer disappear and each day when he return to he work he feel as if he be only a learner spelling out he task constantly seek the truth which as constantly recede from he assume ever more formidable proportion but in the midst of he resignation one thought still trouble he -- what would become of bonhomme he old horse if he himself should die before he the poor brute completely blind and he limb paralyze do not now leave he litter when he master go to see he however he turn he head he could feel the two hearty kiss which be press on he nose all the neighbor shrug they shoulder and joke about this old relation whom the doctor would not allow to be slaughter be he then to be the first to go with the thought that the knacker would be call in on the follow day but one morning when he enter the stable bonhomme do not hear he do not raise he head he be dead he lay there with a peaceful expression as if relieve that death have come to he so gently he master kneel beside he and kiss he again and bid he farewell while two big tear roll down he cheek it be on this day that pascal see he neighbor m bellombre for the last time go over to the window he perceive he in he garden in the pale sunshine of early November take he accustomed walk and the sight of the old professor live so completely happy in he solitude fill he at first with astonishment he could never have imagine such a thing possible as that a man of sixty-nine should live thus without wife or child or even a dog derive he selfish happiness from the joy of live outside of life then he recall he fit of anger against this man he sarcasm about he fear of life the catastrophe which he have wish might happen to he the hope that punishment would come to he in the shape of some housekeeper or some female relation drop down on he unexpectedly but no he be still as fresh as ever and pascal be sure that for a long time to come he would continue to grow old like this hard avaricious useless and happy and yet he no longer execrate he he could even have find it in he heart to pity he so ridiculous and miserable do he think he for not be love pascal who suffer the pang of death because he be alone he whose heart be break because he be too full of other rather suffer suffer only than this selfishness this death of all there be in we of live and human in the night which follow pascal have another attack of angina pectori it last for five minute and he think that he would suffocate without have the strength to call martine then when he recover he breath he do not disturb himself prefer to speak to no one of this aggravation of he malady but he have the certainty that it be all over with he that he might not perhaps live a month longer he first thought be clotilde should he then never see she again and so sharp a pang seize he that he believe another attack be come on why should he not write to she to come to he he have receive a letter from she the day before he would answer it this morning then the thought of the envelope occur to he if he should die suddenly he mother would be the mistress and she would destroy they and not only the envelope but he manuscript all he papers thirty year of he intelligence and he labor thus the crime which he have so greatly dread would be consummate the crime of which the fear alone during he night of fever have make he get up out of bed tremble he ear on the stretch listen to hear if they be force open the press the perspiration break out upon he he see himself dispossess outrage the ash of he work throw to the four wind and when he thought revert to clotilde he tell himself that everything would be satisfactorily arrange that he have only to call she back -- she would be here she would close he eye she would defend he memory and he sit down to write at once to she so that the letter might go by the morning mail but when pascal be seat before the white paper with the pen between he finger a grow doubt a feeling of dissatisfaction with himself take possession of he be not this idea of he papers this fine project of provide a guardian for they and save they a suggestion of he weakness a excuse which he give himself to bring back clotilde and see she again selfishness be at the bottom of it he be think of himself not of she he see she return to this poor house condemn to nurse a sick old man and he see she above all in she grief in she awful agony when he should terrify she some day by drop down dead at she side no no this be the dreadful moment which he must spare she those day of cruel adieus and want afterward a sad legacy which he could not leave she without think himself a criminal she tranquillity she happiness only be of any consequence the rest do not matter he would die in he hole then abandon happy to think she happy to spare she the cruel blow of he death as for save he manuscript he would perhaps find a means of do so he would try to have the strength to part from they and give they to ramond but even if all he papers be to perish this be less of a sacrifice than to resign himself not to see she again and he accept it and he be willing that nothing of he should survive not even he thought provide only that nothing of he should henceforth trouble she dear existence pascal accordingly proceed to write one of he usual answer which by a great effort he purposely make colorless and almost cold clotilde in she last letter without complain of maxime have give it to be understand that she brother have lose he interest in she prefer the society of rise the niece of saccard 's hairdresser the fair-haired young girl with the innocent look and he suspect strongly some maneuver of the father : a cunning plan to obtain possession of the inheritance of the sick man whose vice so precocious formerly gain new force as he last hour approach but in spite of he uneasiness he give clotilde very good advice tell she that she must make allowance for maxime 's suffering that he have undoubtedly a great deal of affection and gratitude for she in short that it be she duty to devote herself to he to the end when he sign the letter tear dim he sight it be he death warrant -- a death like that of a old and solitary brute a death without a kiss without the touch of a friendly hand -- that he be sign never again would he embrace she then doubt assail he be he do right in leave she amid such evil surroundings where he feel that she be in continual contact with every species of wickedness the postman bring the letter and newspaper to la souleiade every morning at about nine o'clock and pascal when he write to clotilde be accustom to watch for he to give he he letter so as to be certain that he correspondence be not intercept but on this morning when he go downstairs to give he the letter he have just write he be surprise to receive one from he from clotilde although it be not the usual day for she letter he allow he own to go however then he go upstairs resume he seat at he table and tear open the envelope the letter be short but its contents fill pascal with a great joy \* \* \* \* \* but the sound of footstep make he control himself he turn round and see martine who be say : dr ramond be downstairs ah let he come up let he come up he say it be another piece of good fortune that have come to he ramond cry gaily from the door : victory master i have bring you you money -- not all but a good sum and he tell the story -- a unexpected piece of good luck which he father-in-law m leveque have bring to light the receipt for the hundred and twenty thousand franc which constitute pascal the personal creditor of grandguillot be valueless since the latter be insolvent salvation be to come from the power of attorney which the doctor have send he year before at he request that he might invest all or part of he money in mortgage as the name of the proxy be in blank in the document the notary as be sometimes do have make use of the name of one of he clerk and eighty thousand franc which have be invest in good mortgage have thus be recover through the agency of a worthy man who be not in the secret of he employer if pascal have take action in the matter if he have go to the public prosecutor 's office and the chamber of notary he would have disentangle the matter long before however he have recover a sure income of four thousand franc he seize the young man 's hand and press they smile he eye still moist with tear ah my friend if you know how happy i be this letter of clotilde 's have bring I a great happiness yes i be go to send for she but the thought of my poverty of the privation she would have to endure here spoil for I the joy of she return and now fortune have come back at least enough to set up my little establishment again in the expansion of he feeling he hold out the letter to ramond and force he to read it then when the young man give it back to he smile comprehend the doctor 's emotion and profoundly touch by it yield to a overpowering need of affection he catch he in he arm like a comrade a brother the two man kiss each other vigorously on either cheek come since good fortune have send you i be go to ask another service from you you know i distrust every one around I even my old housekeeper will you take my despatch to the telegraph office he sit down again at the table and write simply i await you start to-night let I see he say to-day be the 6th of November be it not it be now near ten o'clock she will have my despatch at noon that will give she time enough to pack she trunk and to take the eight o'clock express this evening which will bring she to marseille in time for breakfast but as there be no train which connect with it she can not be here until to-morrow the 7th at five o'clock after folding the despatch he rise : my god at five o'clock to-morrow how long to wait still what shall i do with myself until then then a sudden recollection fill he with anxiety and he become grave ramond my comrade will you give I a great proof of you friendship by be perfectly frank with I how so master ah you understand I very well the other day you examine I do you think i can live another year he fix he eye on the young man as he speak compelling he to look at he ramond evade a direct answer however with a jest -- be it really a physician who put such a question let we be serious ramond i beg of you then ramond answer in all sincerity that in he opinion the doctor might very justly entertain the hope of live another year he give he reason -- the comparatively slight progress which the sclerosis have make and the absolute soundness of the other organ of course they must make allowance for what they do not and could not know for a sudden accident be always possible and the two man discuss the case as if they be in consultation at the bedside of a patient weigh the pro and con each state he view and prognosticate a fatal termination in accordance with the symptom as define by the best authority pascal as if it be some one else who be in question have recover all he composure and he heroic self-forgetfulness yes he murmur at last you be right a year of life be still possible ah my friend how i wish i might live two year a mad wish no doubt a eternity of joy and yet two year that would not be impossible i have a very curious case once a wheelwright of the faubourg who live for four year give the lie to all my prognostication two year two year i will live two year i must live two year ramond sit with bent head without answer he be begin to be uneasy fear that he have show himself too optimistic and the doctor 's joy disquiet and grieve he as if this very exaltation this disturbance of a once strong brain warn he of a secret and imminent danger do you not wish to send that despatch at once he say yes yes go quickly my good ramond and come back again to see we the day after to-morrow she will be here then and i want you to come and embrace we the day be long and the follow morning at about four o'clock shortly after pascal have fall asleep after a happy vigil fill with hope and dream he be waken by a dreadful attack he feel as if a enormous weight as if the whole house have fall down upon he chest so that the thorax flatten down touch the back he could not breathe the pain reach the shoulder then the neck and paralyze the left arm but he be perfectly conscious he have the feeling that he heart be about to stop that life be about to leave he in the dreadful oppression like that of a vise which be suffocate he before the attack reach its height he have the strength to rise and to knock on the floor with a stick for martine then he fall back on he bed unable to speak or to move and cover with a cold sweat martine fortunately in the profound silence of the empty house hear the knock she dress herself wrap a shawl about she and go upstairs carry she candle the darkness be still profound dawn be about to break and when she perceive she master whose eye alone seem live look at she with lock jaw speechless he face distort by pain she be awed and terrify and she could only rush toward the bed cry : my god my god what be the matter monsieur answer I monsieur you frighten I for a full minute pascal struggle in vain to recover he breath then the viselike pressure on he chest relax slowly he murmur in a faint voice : the five thousand franc in the desk be clotilde 's tell she that the affair of the notary be settle that she will recover from it enough to live upon then martine who have listen to he in open-mouthed wonder confess the falsehood she have tell he ignorant of the good news that have be bring by ramond monsieur you must forgive I i tell you a untruth but it would be wrong to deceive you longer when i see you alone and so unhappy i take some of my own money my poor girl you do that oh i have some hope that monsieur would return it to I one day by this time the attack have pass off and he be able to turn he head and look at she he be amaze and move what be pass in the heart of this avaricious old maid who for thirty year have be save up she treasure painfully who have never take a sou from it either for herself or for any one else he do not yet comprehend but he wish to show himself kind and grateful you be a good woman martine all that will be return to you i truly think i be go to die -- she do not allow he to finish she whole be rise up in rebellious protest die you monsieur die before I i do not wish it i will not let you die she throw herself on she knee beside the bed she catch he wildly in she arm feel he to see if he suffer hold he as if she think that death would not dare to take he from she you must tell I what be the matter with you i will take care of you i will save you if it be necessary to give my life for you i would give it monsieur i will sit up day and night with you i be strong still i will be stronger than the disease you shall see to die to die oh no it can not be the good god can not wish so great a injustice i have pray so much in my life that he ought to listen to I a little now and he will grant my prayer monsieur he will save you pascal look at she listen to she and a sudden light break in upon he mind she love he this miserable woman she have always love he he think of she thirty year of blind devotion she mute adoration when she have wait upon he on she knee as it be when she be young she secret jealousy of clotilde later what she must have secretly suffer all that time and she be here on she knee now again beside he deathb she hair gray she eye the color of ash in she pale nun-like face dull by she solitary life and he feel that she be unconscious of it all that she do not even know with what sort of love she love he love he only for the happiness of loving he : of be with he and of wait on he tear rise to pascal 's eye a dolorous pity and a infinite human tenderness flow from he poor half-broken heart my poor girl he say you be the best of girl come embrace I as you love I with all you strength she too sob she let she gray head she face worn by she long servitude fall on she master 's breast wildly she kiss he put all she life into the kiss there let we not give way to emotion for you see we can do nothing this will be the end just the same if you wish I to love you obey I now that i be better that i can breathe easier do I the favor to run to dr ramond 's waken he and bring he back with you she be leave the room when he call to she seize by a sudden fear and remember i forbid you to go to inform my mother she turn back embarrassed and in a voice of entreaty say : oh monsieur mme felicite have make I promise so often -- but he be inflexible all he life he have treat he mother with deference and he think he have acquire the right to defend himself against she in the hour of he death he would not let the servant go until she have promise he that she would be silent then he smile once more go quickly oh you will see I again it will not be yet day break at last the melancholy dawn of the pale November day pascal have have the shutter open and when he be leave alone he watch the brighten dawn doubtless that of he last day of life it have rain the night before and the mild sun be still veil by cloud from the plane tree come the morning carol of the bird while far away in the sleep country a locomotive whistle with a prolonged moan and he be alone alone in the great melancholy house whose emptiness he feel around he whose silence he hear the light slowly increase and he watch the patch it make on the window-panes broaden and brighten then the candle pale in the grow light and the whole room become visible and with the dawn as he have anticipate come relief the sight of the familiar object around he bring he consolation but pascal although the attack have pass away still suffer horribly a sharp pain remain in the hollow of he chest and he left arm benumb hang from he shoulder like lead in he long wait for the help that martine have go to bring he have reflect on the suffering which make the flesh cry out and he find that he be resign he no longer feel the rebelliousness which the mere sight of physical pain have formerly awaken in he it have exasperate he as if it have be a monstrous and useless cruelty of nature in he doubt as a physician he have attend he patient only to combat it and to relieve it if he end by accept it now that he himself suffer its horrible torture be it that he have rise one degree higher in he faith of life to that serene height whence life appear altogether good even with the fatal condition of suffer attach to it suffer which be perhaps its spring yes to live all of life to live it and to suffer it all without rebellion without believe that it be make better by be make painless this present itself clearly to he die eye as the greatest courage and the greatest wisdom and to cheat pain while he wait he review he latest theory he dream of a means of utilize suffering by transform it into action into work if it be true that man feel pain more acutely accord as he rise in the scale of civilization it be also certain that he become stronger through it better arm against it more capable of resist it the organ the brain which work develop and grow stronger provide the equilibrium between the sensation which it receive and the work which it give back be not break might not one hope then for a humanity in which the amount of work accomplish would so exactly equal the sum of sensation receive that suffer would be utilize and as it be abolish the sun have rise and pascal be confusedly revolve these distant hope in he mind in the drowsiness produce by he disease when he feel a new attack come on he have a moment of cruel anxiety -- be this the end be he go to die alone but at this instant hurry footstep mount the stair and a moment later ramond enter follow by martine and the patient have time to say before the attack begin : quick quick a hypodermic injection of pure water unfortunately the doctor have to look for the little syringe and then to prepare everything this occupy some minute and the attack be terrible he follow its progress with anxiety -- the face become distort the lip grow livid then when he have give the injection he observe that the phenomenon for a moment stationary slowly diminish in intensity once more the catastrophe be avert as soon as he recover he breath pascal glancing at the clock say in he calm faint voice : my friend it be seven o'clock -- in twelve hour at seven o'clock to-night i shall be dead and as the young man be about to protest to argue the question no he resume do not try to deceive I you have witness the attack you know what it mean as well as i do everything will now proceed with mathematical exactness and hour by hour i could describe to you the phase of the disease he stop gasp for breath and then add : and then all be well i be content clotilde will be here at five all i ask be to see she and to die in she arm a few moment later however he experience a sensible improvement the effect of the injection seem truly miraculous and he be able to sit up in bed he back rest against the pillow he speak clearly and with more ease and never have the lucidity of he mind appear greater you know master say ramond that i will not leave you i have tell my wife and we will spend the day together and whatever you may say to the contrary i be very confident that it will not be the last you will let I make myself at home here will you not pascal smile and give order to martine to go and prepare breakfast for ramond say that if they need she they would call she and the two man remain alone converse with friendly intimacy the one with he white hair and long white beard lie down discourse like a sage the other sit at he bedside listen with the respect of a disciple in truth murmur the master as if he be speak to himself the effect of those injection be extraordinary then in a stronger voice he say almost gaily : my friend ramond it may not be a very great present that i be give you but i be go to leave you my manuscript yes clotilde have order to send they to you when i shall be no more look through they and you will perhaps find among they thing that be not so very bad if you get a good idea from they some day -- well that will be so much the better for the world and then he make he scientific testament he be clearly conscious that he have be himself only a solitary pioneer a precursor planning theory which he try to put in practice but which fail because of the imperfection of he method he recall he enthusiasm when he believe he have discover in he injection of nerve substance the universal panacea then he disappointment he fit of despair the shocking death of lafouasse consumption carry off valentin in spite of all he effort madness again conquer sarteur and cause he to hang himself so that he would depart full of doubt have no longer the confidence necessary to the physician and so enamored of life that he have end by put all he faith in it certain that it must draw from itself alone its health and strength but he do not wish to close up the future he be glad on the contrary to bequeath he hypothesis to the younger generation every twenty year theory change established truth only on which science continue to build remain unshaken even if he have only the merit of give to science a momentary hypothesis he work would not be lose for progress consist assuredly in the effort in the onward march of the intellect and then who could say that he have die in vain troubled and weary he hope concern the injection unrealized -- other worker would come young ardent confident who would take up the idea elucidate it expand it and perhaps a new epoch a new world would date from this ah my dear ramond he continue if one could only live life over again yes i would take up my idea again for i have be strike lately by the singular efficacy of injection even of pure water it be not the liquid then that matter but simply the mechanical action during the last month i have write a great deal on that subject you will find some curious note and observation there in short i should be incline to put all my faith in work to place health in the harmonious working of all the organ a sort of dynamic therapeutics if i may venture to use the expression he have gradually grow excited forget he approach death in he ardent curiosity about life and he sketch with broad stroke he last theory man be surround by a medium -- nature -- which irritated by perpetual contact the sensitive extremity of the nerve hence the action not only of the sens but of the entire surface of the body external and internal for it be these sensation which reverberate in the brain in the marrow and in the nervous center be there convert into tonicity movement and thought and he be convince that health consist in the natural progress of this work in receive sensation and in give they back in thought and in action the human machine be thus feed by the regular play of the organ work thus become the great law the regulator of the living universe hence it become necessary if the equilibrium be break if the external excitation cease to be sufficient for therapeutics to create artificial excitation in order to reestablish the tonicity which be the state of perfect health and he dream of a whole new system of treatment -- suggestion the all-powerful authority of the physician for the sens electricity friction massage for the skin and for the tendon diet for the stomach air cure on high plateau for the lung and finally transfusion injection of

admiration and affection master master it be of enthusiasm of folly like yours that genius be make have no fear i have listen to you i will endeavor to be worthy of the heritage you leave and i think with you that perhaps the great future lie entirely there in the sad and quiet room pascal begin to speak again with the courageous tranquillity of a die philosopher give he last lesson he now review he personal observation he say that he have often cure himself by work regular and methodical work not carry to excess eleven o'clock strike he urge ramond to take he breakfast and he continue the

remember especially to have dissect at the hospital the heart of a poor old man affect with sclerosis i can see it -- my heart it be the color of a dead leaf its fiber be brittle waste one would say although it have augment slightly in volume the inflammatory process have harden it it would be difficult to cut -- he continue in a lower voice a little before he have feel he heart grow weaker its contraction become feebler and slower instead of the normal jet of blood there now issue from the aorta only a red froth back of it all the vein be engorge with black blood the suffocation increase accord as the lift and force pump the regulator of the whole machine move more slowly and after the injection he have be able to follow in spite of he suffer the gradual revive of the organ as the stimulus set it beat again remove the black venous blood and send life into it anew with the red arterial blood but the attack would return as soon as the mechanical effect of the injection should cease he could predict it almost within a few minute thanks to the injection he would have three attack more the third would carry he off he would die at four o'clock then while he voice grow gradually weaker in a last outburst of enthusiasm he apostrophize the courage of the heart that persistent life maker work ceaselessly even during sleep when the other organ rest ah brave heart how heroically you struggle what faithful what generous muscle never weary you have love too much you have beat too fast in the past month and that be why you be break now brave heart who do not wish to die and who strive rebelliously to beat still but now the first of the attack which have be announce come on pascal come out of this pant haggard he speech sibilant and painful low moan escape he in spite of he courage good god would this torture never end and yet he most ardent desire be to prolong he agony to live long enough to embrace clotilde a last time if he might only be deceive himself as ramond persist in declare if he might only live until five o'clock he eye again turn to the clock they never now leave the hand every minute seem a eternity they mark three o'clock then half-past three ah god only two hour of life two hour more of life the sun be already sink toward the horizon a great calm descend from the pale winter sky and he hear at interval the whistle of the distant locomotive cross the bare plain the train that be pass now be the one go to the tulette the other the one come from marseille would it never arrive then at twenty minute to four pascal sign to ramond to approach he could no longer speak loud enough to be hear you see in order that i might live until six o'clock the pulse should be stronger i have still some hope however but the second movement be almost imperceptible the heart will soon cease to beat and in faint despairing accent he call on clotilde again and again the immeasurable grief which he feel at not be able to see she again break forth in this falter and agonized appeal then he anxiety about he manuscript return a ardent entreaty shone in he eye until at last he find the strength to falter again : do not leave I the key be under my pillow tell clotilde to take it she have my direction at ten minute to four another hypodermic injection be give but without effect and just as four o'clock be strike the second attack declare itself suddenly after a fit of suffocation he throw himself out of bed he desire to rise to walk in a last revival of he strength a need of space of light of air urge he toward the sky then there come to he a irresistible appeal from life he whole life from the adjoining workroom where he have spend he day and he go there staggering suffocating bend to the left side support himself by the furniture dr ramond precipitate himself quickly toward he to stop he cry : master master lie down again i entreat you but pascal pay no heed to he obstinately determine to die on he foot the desire to live the heroic idea of work alone survive in he carry he onward bodily he falter hoarsely : no no -- out there out there -- he friend be oblige to support he and he walk thus stumble and haggard to the end of the workroom and drop into he chair beside he table on which a unfinished page still lay among a confusion of papers and book here he gasp for breath and he eye close after a moment he open they again while he hand grope about seek he work no doubt they encounter the genealogical tree in the midst of other papers scatter about only two day before he have correct some date in it he recognize it and draw it toward he spread it out master master you will kill yourself cry ramond overcome with pity and admiration at this extraordinary spectacle pascal do not listen do not hear he feel a pencil under he finger he take it and bent over the tree as if he die eye no longer see the name of maxime arrest he attention and he write : die of ataxia in 1873 in the certainty that

apparently wait for she he have indeed be watch for she and have come downstairs to break the dreadful news gently to she she arrive out of breath she have cross the quincunx of plane tree near the fountain to shorten the way and on see the young man there instead of pascal whom she have in spite of everything expect to see she have a presentiment of overwhelming ruin of irreparable misfortune ramond be pale and agitate notwithstanding the effort he make to control he feeling at the first moment he could not find a word to say but wait to be question clotilde who be herself suffocate say

of the relation of this piteous and stoical death penetrate she heart and stamp itself there she reconstruct every hour of the dreadful day she follow to its close its grand and mournful drama she would live it over in she thought forever but she despairing grief overflow when martine who have enter the room a moment before say in a harsh voice : ah mademoiselle have good reason to cry for if monsieur be dead mademoiselle be to blame for it the old servant stand apart near the door of she kitchen in such a passion of angry grief because they have take she master from she because they have kill he that she do not even try to find a word of welcome or consolation for this child whom she have bring up and without calculate the consequence of she indiscretion the grief or the joy which she might cause she relieved herself by tell all she know yes if monsieur have die it be because mademoiselle go away from the depths of she overpowering grief clotilde protest she have expect to see martine weep with she like ramond and she be surprise to feel that she be a enemy why it be he who would not let I stay who insist upon my go away she say oh well mademoiselle must have be willing to go or she would have be more clear-sighted the night before you departure i find monsieur half-suffocated with grief and when i wish to inform mademoiselle he himself prevent I he have such courage then i could see it all after mademoiselle have go every night it be the same thing over again and he could hardly keep from write to you to come back in short he die of it that be the pure truth a great light break in on clotilde 's mind make she at the same time very happy and very wretched good god what she have suspect for a moment be then true afterward she have be convince see pascal 's angry persistence that he be speak the truth that between she and work he have choose work sincerely like a man of science with whom love of work have gain the victory over the love of woman and yet he have not speak the truth he have carry he devotion he self-forgetfulness to the point of immolate himself to what he believe to be she happiness and the misery of thing will that he should have be mistake that he should have thus consummate the unhappiness of both clotilde again protest wildly : but how could i have know i obeyed i put all my love in my obedience ah cry martine again it seem to I that i should have guess ramond interpose gently he take clotilde 's hand once more in he and explain to she that grief might indeed have hasten the fatal issue but that the master have unhappily be doom for some time past the affection of the heart from which he have suffer must have be of long standing -- a great deal of overwork a certain part of heredity and finally he late absorbing love and the poor heart have break let we go upstairs say clotilde simply i wish to see he upstairs in the death-chamber the blind be close shut out even the melancholy twilight on a little table at the foot of the bed burn two taper in two candlestick and they cast a pale yellow light on pascal 's form extend on the bed the foot close together the hand fold on the breast the eye have be piously close the face of a bluish hue still but already look calm and peaceful frame by the flow white hair and beard seem asleep he have be dead scarcely a hour and a half yet already infinite serenity eternal silence eternal repose have begin see he thus at the thought that he no longer hear she that he no longer see she that she be alone now that she be to kiss he for the last time and then lose he forever clotilde in a outburst of grief throw herself upon the bed and in broken accent of passionate tenderness cry : oh master master master -- she press she lip to the dead man 's forehead and feeling it still warm with life she have a momentary illusion : she fancy that he feel this last caress so cruelly await do he not smile in he immobility happy at last and able to die now that he feel she here beside he then overcome by the dreadful reality she burst again into wild sob martine enter bring a lamp which she place on a corner of the chimney-piece and she hear ramond who be watch clotilde disquiet at see she passionate grief say : i shall take you away from the room if you give way like this consider that you have some one else to think of now the servant have be surprise at certain word which she have overhear by chance during the day suddenly she understand and she turn paler even than before and on she way out of the room she stop at the door to hear more the key of the press be under he pillow say ramond lower he voice he tell I repeatedly to tell you so you know what you have to do clotilde make a effort to remember and to answer what i have to do about the papers be it not yes yes i remember i be to keep the envelope and to give you the other manuscript have no fear i be quite calm i will be very reasonable but i will not leave he i will spend the night here very quietly i promise you she be so unhappy she seem so resolve to watch by he to remain with he until he should be take away that the young physician allow she to have she way well i will leave you now they will be expect I at home then there be all sort of formality to be go through -- to give notice at the mayor 's office the funeral of which i wish to spare you the detail trouble yourself about nothing everything will be arrange to-morrow when i return he embrace she once more and then go away and it be only then that martine leave the room behind he and lock the hall door she run out into the darkness clotilde be now alone in the chamber and all around and about she in the unbroken silence she feel the emptiness of the house clotilde be alone with the dead pascal she place a chair at the head of the bed and sit there motionless alone on arrive she have merely remove she hat : now perceive that she still have on she glove she take they off also but she keep on she travel dress crumple and dusty after twenty hour of railway travel no doubt father durieu have bring the trunk long ago and leave they downstairs but it do not occur to she nor have she the strength to wash herself and change she clothes but remain sit overwhelmed with grief on the chair into which she have drop one regret a great remorse fill she to the exclusion of all else why have she obey he why have she consent to leave he if she have remain she have the ardent conviction that he would not have die she would have lavish so much love so many caress upon he that she would have cure he if one be anxious to keep a beloved be from die one should remain with he and if necessary give one 's heart 's blood to keep he alive it be she own fault if she have lose he if she could not now with a caress awaken he from he eternal sleep and she think herself imbecile not to have understand cowardly not to have devote herself to he culpable and to be forever punish for have go away when plain common sense in default of feeling ought to have keep she here bind as a submissive and affectionate subject to the task of watch over she king the silence have become so complete so profound that clotilde lift she eye for a moment from pascal 's face to look around the room she see only vague shadow -- the two taper throw two yellow patch on the high ceiling at this moment she remember the letter he have write to she so short so cold and she comprehend he heroic sacrifice the torture it have be to he to silence he heart desire to immolate himself to the end what strength must he not have require for the accomplishment of the plan of happiness sublime and disastrous which he have form for she he have resolve to pass out of she life in order to save she from he old age and he poverty he wish she to be rich and free to enjoy she youth far away from he this indeed be utter self-effacement complete absorption in the love of another and she feel a profound gratitude a sweet solace in the thought mingle with a sort of angry bitterness against evil fortune then suddenly the happy year of she childhood and she long youth spend beside he who have always be so kind and so good-humored rise before she -- how he have gradually win she affection how she have feel that she be he after the quarrel which have separate they for a time and with what a transport of joy she have at last give herself to he seven o'clock strike clotilde start as the clear tone break the profound silence who be it that have speak then she remember and she look at the clock and when the last sound of the seven stroke each of which have fall like a knell upon she heart have die away she turn she eye again on the motionless face of pascal and once more she abandon herself to she grief it be in the midst of this ever-increasing prostration that clotilde a few minute later hear a sudden sound of sob some one have rush into the room she look round and see she grandmother felicite but she do not stir she do not speak so benumbed be she with grief martine anticipate the order which clotilde would undoubtedly have give she have hurry to old mme rougon 's to give she the dreadful news and the latter daze at first by the suddenness of the catastrophe and afterward greatly agitate have hurry to the house overflow with noisy grief she burst into tear at sight of she son and then embrace clotilde who return she kiss as in a dream and from this instant the latter without emerge from the overwhelming grief in which she isolate herself feel that she be no longer alone hear a continual stir and bustle go on around she it be felicite cry come in and go out on tiptoe set thing in order spy about whisper drop into a chair to get up again a moment afterward after say that she be go to

do not speak again fall back into she former state of apathy she do not sleep however she wide open eye be fix persistently on pascal 's face for hour she sit there motionless erect rigid as if she spirit be far away with the dead at ten o'clock she hear a noise it be martine bring up the lamp toward eleven felicite who be sit watch in a armchair seem to grow restless get up and go out of the room and come back again from this forth there be a continual come and go as of impatient footstep prowl around the young woman who be still awake she large eye fix motionless on pascal twelve o'clock strike and one persistent thought alone pierce she weary brain like a nail and prevent sleep -- why have she obey he if she have remain she would have revive he with she youth and he would not have die and it be not until a little before one that she feel this think too grow confused and lose itself in a nightmare and she fall into a heavy sleep wear out with grief and fatigue when martine have announce to mme rougon the unexpected death of she son pascal in the shock which she receive there be as much of anger as of grief what she die son have not wish to see she he have make this servant swear not to inform she of he illness this thought send the blood course swiftly through she vein as if the struggle between they which have last during he whole life be to be continue beyond the grave then when after hastily dress herself she have hurry to la souleiade the thought of the terrible envelope of all the manuscript pile up in the press have fill she with tremble rage now that uncle macquart and aunt dide be dead she no longer fear what she call the abomination of the tulette and even poor little charle in die have carry with he one of the most humiliating of the blot on the family there remain only the envelope the abominable envelope to menace the glorious rougon legend which she have spend she whole life in create which be the sole thought of she old age the work to the triumph of which she have persistently devote the last effort of she wily and active brain for long year she have watch these envelope never weary begin the struggle over again when he have think she beaten always alert and persistent ah if she could only succeed in obtain possession of they and destroy they it would be the execrable past destroy efface it would be the glory of she family so hardly win at last free from all fear at last shine untarnished impose its lie upon history and she see herself traverse the three quarter of plassan salute by every one bearing herself as proudly as a queen mourning nobly for the fall empire so that when martine inform she that clotilde have come she quicken she step as she approach la souleiade spur by the fear of arrive too late but as soon as she be install in the house felicite at once regain she composure there be no hurry they have the whole night before they she wish however to win over martine without delay and she know well how to influence this simple creature bind up in the doctrine of a narrow religion go down to the kitchen then to see the chicken roast she begin by affect to be heartbroken at the thought of she son die without have make he peace with the church she question the servant press she for particulars but the latter shake she head disconsolately -- no no priest have come monsieur have not even make the sign of the cross she only have kneel down to say the prayer for the die which certainly could not be enough for the salvation of a soul and yet with what fervor she have pray to the good god that monsieur might go straight to paradise with she eye fix on the chicken turn on the spit before a bright fire felicite resume in a lower voice with a absorb air : ah my poor girl what will most prevent he from go to paradise be the abominable papers which the unhappy man have leave behind he up there in the press i can not understand why it be that lightning from heaven have not strike those papers before this and reduce they to ash if they be allow to leave this house it will be ruin and disgrace and eternal perdition martine listen very pale then madame think it would be a good work to destroy they a work that would assure the repose of monsieur 's soul great god do i believe it why if i have those dreadful papers in my hand i would throw every one of they into the fire oh you would not need then to put on any more stick with the manuscript upstairs alone you would have fuel enough to roast three chicken like that the servant take a long spoon and begin to baste the fowl she too seem now to reflect only we have not get they i even overhear some word on the subject which i may repeat to madame it be when mademoiselle go upstairs dr raymond speak to she about the papers ask she if she remember some order which she have receive before she go away no doubt and she answer that she remember that she be to keep the envelope and to give he all the other manuscript felicite tremble she could not restrain a terrify movement already she see the papers slip out of she reach and it be not the envelope only which she desire but all the manuscript all that unknown suspicious and secret work from which nothing but scandal could come accord to the obtuse and excitable mind of the proud old _ bourgeoise _ but we must act she cry act immediately this very night to-morrow it may be too late i know where the key of the press be answer martine in a low voice the doctor tell mademoiselle felicite immediately prick up she ear the key where be it under the pillow under monsieur 's head in spite of the bright blaze of the fire of vine branch the air seem to grow suddenly chill and the two old woman be silent the only sound to be hear be the drip of the chicken juice fall into the pan but after mme rougon have eat a hasty and solitary dinner she go upstairs again with martine without another word be speak they understand each other it be decide that they would use all possible means to obtain possession of the papers before daybreak the simplest be to take the key from under the pillow clotilde would no doubt at last fall asleep -- she seem too exhaust not to succumb to fatigue all they have to do be to wait they set themselves to watch then go back and forth on tiptoe between the study and the bedroom wait for the moment when the young woman 's large motionless eye should close in sleep one of they would go to see while the other wait impatiently in the study where a lamp burn dully on the table this be repeat every fifteen minute until midnight the fathomless eye full of gloom and of a immense despair do not close a little before midnight felicite install herself in a armchair at the foot of the bed resolve not to leave the spot until she granddaughter should have fall asleep from this forth she do not take she eye off clotilde and it fill she with a sort of fear to remark that the girl scarcely move she eyelid look with that inconsolable fixity which defy sleep then she herself begin to feel sleep steal over she exasperated tremble with nervous impatience she could remain where she be no longer and she go to rejoin the servant who be watch in the study it be useless she will not sleep she say in a stifled and tremble voice we must find some other way it have indeed occur to she to break open the press but the old oaken board be strong the old iron hold firmly how could they break the lock -- not to speak of the noise they would make and which would certainly be hear in the adjoining room she stand before the thick door however and feel they with she finger seek some weak spot if i only have a instrument she say martine less eager interrupted she object : oh no no madame we might be surprised wait i will go again and see if mademoiselle be asleep now she go to the bedroom on tiptoe and return immediately say : yes she be asleep she eye be close and she do not stir then both go to look at she hold they breath and walk with the utmost caution so that the board might not creak clotilde have indeed just fall asleep : and she stupor seem so profound that the two old woman grow bold they fear however that they might touch and waken she for she chair stand close beside the bed and then to put one 's hand under a dead man 's pillow to rob he be a terrible and sacrilegious act the thought of which fill they with terror might it not disturb he repose might he not move at the shock the thought make they turn pale felicite have advance with outstretched hand but she draw back stammer : i be too short you try martine the servant in she turn approach the bed but she be seize with such a fit of tremble that she be oblige to retreat lest she should fall no no i can not she say it seem to I that monsieur be go to open he eye and tremble and awe-struck they remain a instant longer in the lugubrious chamber full of the silence and the majesty of death face pascal motionless forever and clotilde overwhelm by the grief of she widowhood perhaps they see glorify that mute head guard its work with all its weight the nobility of a life spend in honorable labor the flame of the taper burn palely a sacred awe fill the air drive they from the chamber felicite who be so brave who have never in she life flinch from anything not even from bloodshed flee as if she be pursue say : come come martine we will find some other way we will go look for a instrument in the study they draw a breath of relief felicite look in vain among the papers on pascal 's work-table for the genealogical tree which she know be usually there she would so gladly have begin she work of destruction with this it be there but in she feverish excitement she do not perceive it she desire draw she back again to the press and she stand before it measure it and examine it with eager and covetous look in spite of she short stature in spite of she eighty-odd year she display a activity and a energy that be truly extraordinary

fuel feed they the fire grow larger the heap of ash rise higher and higher -- a thick bed of blacken leaf among which run million of spark but it be a long a never-ending task for when several page be throw on at a time they would not burn it be necessary to move they and turn they over with the tong the best way be to stir they up and then wait until they be in a blaze before add more the woman soon grow skilful at they task and the work progress at a rapid rate in she haste to get a fresh armful of papers felicite stumble against a chair oh madame take care say martine some one might come

they cause but at the threshold clotilde take in the whole scene with cruel distinctness -- the press wide open and completely empty martine madden by she fear of fire felicite radiant push into the flame with she foot the last fragment of the envelope smoke and fly soot fill the study where the roaring of the fire sound like the hoarse gasping of a murder man -- the fierce roar which she have just hear in she sleep and the cry which spring from she lip be the same cry that pascal himself have utter on the night of the storm when he surprise she in the act of steal he papers thief assassin she precipitate herself toward the fireplace and in spite of the dreadful roaring of the flame in spite of the fall piece of soot at the risk of set she hair on fire and of burn she hand she gather up the leaf which remain yet unconsumed and bravely extinguish they press they against she but all this be very little only some _ debris _ not a complete page remain not even a few fragment of the

after to-morrow when monsieur be no longer here i will go away then she go down to the kitchen and clotilde in spite of the fanaticism of this woman which have make she take part in a crime feel inexpressibly sad at this desertion when she be gather up the fragment of the papers however before return to the bedroom she have a thrill of joy on suddenly see the genealogical tree which the two woman have not perceive lie unharmed on the table it be the only entire document save from the wreck she take it and lock it with the half-consumed fragment in the bureau in the bedroom but when she find herself again in this August chamber a great emotion take possession of she what supreme calm what immortal peace reign here beside the savage destruction that have fill the adjoining room with smoke and ash a sacred serenity pervade the obscurity the two taper burn with a pure still unwaver flame then she see that pascal 's face frame in he flow white hair and beard have become very white he sleep with the light fall upon he surround by a halo supremely beautiful she bent down kiss he again feel on she lip the cold of the marble face with its closed eyelid dream its dream of eternity she grief at not be able to save the work which he have leave to she care be so overpowering that she fall on she knee and burst into a passion of sob genius have be violate it seem to she as if the world be about to be destroy in this savage destruction of a whole life of labor xiv in the study clotilde be button she dress hold she child whom she have be nurse still in she lap it be after lunch about three o'clock on a hot sunny day at the end of August and through the crevice of the carefully close shutter only a few scattered sunbeam enter pierce the drowsy and warm obscurity of the vast apartment the rest and peace of the Sunday seem to enter and diffuse itself in the room with the last sound of the distant vesper bell profound silence reign in the empty house in which the mother and child be to remain alone until dinner time the servant have ask permission to go see a cousin in the faubourg for a instant clotilde look at she child now a big boy of three month she have be wear mourning for pascal for almost ten month -- a long and simple black gown in which she look divinely beautiful with she tall slender figure and she sad youthful face surround by its aureole of fair hair and although she could not smile it fill she with sweet emotion to see the beautiful child so plump and rosy with he mouth still wet with milk whose gaze have be arrest by the sunbeam full of dance mote he eye be fix wonderingly on the golden brightness the dazzling miracle of light then sleep come over he and he let he little round bare head cover thinly with fair hair fall back on he mother 's arm clotilde rise softly and lay he in the cradle which stand beside the table she remain lean over he for a instant to assure herself that he be asleep then she let down the curtain in the already darkened room then she busy herself with supple and noiseless movement walk with so light a step that she scarcely touch the floor in put away some linen which be on the table twice she cross the room in search of a little missing sock she be very silent very gentle and very active and now in the solitude of the house she fall into a reverie and all the past year arise before she first after the dreadful shock of the funeral come the departure of martine who have obstinately keep to she determination of go away at once not even remain for the customary week bring to replace she the young cousin of a baker in the neighborhood -- a stout brunette who fortunately prove very neat and faithful martine herself live at sainte-marthe in a retire corner so penuriously that she must be still save even out of she small income she be not know to have any heir who then would profit by this miserliness in ten month she have not once set foot in la souleiade -- monsieur be not there and she have not even the desire to see monsieur 's son then in clotilde 's reverie rise the figure of she grandmother felicite the latter come to see she from time to time with the condescension of a powerful relation who be liberal-minded enough to pardon all fault when they have be cruelly expiate she would come unexpectedly kiss the child moralize and give advice and the young mother have adopt toward she the respectful attitude which pascal have always maintain felicite be now wholly absorb in she triumph she be at last about to realize a plan that she have long cherish and maturely deliberate which would perpetuate by a imperishable monument the untarnished glory of the family the plan be to devote she fortune which have become considerable to the construction and endowment of a asylum for the aged to be call rougon asylum she have already buy the ground a part of the old mall outside the town near the railway station and precisely on this Sunday at five o'clock when the heat should have abate a little the first stone be to be lay a really solemn ceremony to be honor by the presence of all the authority and of which she be to be the acknowledged queen before a vast concourse of people clotilde feel besides some gratitude toward she grandmother who have show perfect disinterestedness on the occasion of the opening of pascal 's will the latter have constitute the young woman he sole legatee and the mother who have a right to a fourth part after declare she intention to respect she son 's wish have simply renounce she right to the succession she wish indeed to disinherit all she family bequeath to they glory only by employ she large fortune in the erection of this asylum which be to carry down to future age the revered and glorious name of the rougon and after have for more than half a century so eagerly strive to acquire money she now disdain it move by a higher and purer ambition and clotilde thanks to this liberality have no uneasiness regard the future -- the four thousand franc income would be sufficient for she and she child she would bring he up to be a man she have sink the five thousand franc that she have find in the desk in a annuity for he and she own besides la souleiade which everybody advise she to sell true it cost but little to keep it up but what a sad and solitary life she would lead in that great desert house much too large for she where she would be lose thus far however she have not be able to make up she mind to leave it perhaps she would never be able to do so ah this la souleiade all she love all she life all she memory be center in it it seem to she at time as if pascal be live here still for she have change nothing of they former manner of live the furniture remain in the same place the hour be the same the habit the same the only change she have make be to lock he room into which only she go as into a sanctuary to weep when she feel she heart too heavy and although indeed she feel very lonely very lose at each meal in the bright dining-room downstairs in fancy she hear there the echo of they laughter she recall the healthy appetite of she youth when they two have eat and drink so gaily rejoice in they existence and the garden too the whole place be bind up with the most intimate fiber of she be for she could not take a step in it that they unite image do not appear before she -- on the terrace in the slender shadow of the great secular cypress where they have so often contemplate the valley of the viorne close in by the ridge of the seille and the parched hill of sainte-marthe the stone step among the puny olive and almond tree which they have so often challenge each other to run up in a trial of speed like boy just let loose from school and there be the pine grove too the warm embalsamed shade where the needle crackle under they foot the vast threshing yard carpet with soft grass where they could see the whole sky at night when the star be come out and above all there be the giant plane tree whose delightful shade they have enjoy every day in summer listen to the soothing song of the fountain the crystal clear song which it have sing for century even to the old stone of the house even to the earth of the grounds there be not a atom at la souleiade in which she do not feel a little of they blood warmly throb with which she do not feel a little of they life diffused and mingled but she prefer to spend she day in the workroom and here it be that she live over again she best hour there be nothing new in it but the cradle the doctor 's table be in its place before the window to the leave -- she could fancy he come in and sit down at it for he chair have not even be move on the long table in the center among the old heap of book and papers there be nothing new but the cheerful note of the little baby linen which she be look over the bookcase display the same row of volume the large oaken press seem to guard within its side the same treasure securely shut in under the smoky ceiling the room be still redolent of work with its confusion of chair the pleasant disorder of this common workroom fill with the caprice of the girl and the research of the scientist but what most move she to-day be the sight of she old pastel hang against the wall the copy which she have make of live flower scrupulously exact copy and of dream flower of a imaginary world whither she wild fancy sometimes carry she clotilde have just finish arrange the little garment on the table when lift she eye she perceive before she the pastel of old king david with he hand rest on the shoulder of abishag the young shunammite and she who now never smile feel she face flush with a thrill of tender and pleasing emotion how they have love each other how they have dream of a eternity of love the day on which she have amuse herself paint this proud and loving allegory the old king sumptuously clad in a robe hanging in straight fold heavy with precious stone wear the royal bandeau on he snowy lock but she be more sumptuous still with only she tall slender figure she delicate round throat and she supple arm divinely graceful now he be go he be sleep under the ground while she she pure and triumphant beauty conceal by she black robe have only she child to express the love she have give he before the assemble people in the full light of day then clotilde sit down beside the cradle the slender sunbeam lengthen cross the room from end to end the heat of the warm afternoon grow oppressive in the drowsy obscurity make by the closed shutter and the silence of the house seem more profound than before she set apart some little waist she sew on some tape with slow-moving needle and gradually she fall into a reverie in the warm deep peacefulness of the room in the midst of the glowing heat outside she thought first turn to she pastel the exact copy and the fantastic dream flower she say to herself now that all she dual nature be to be find in that passion for truth which have at time keep she a whole day before a flower in order to copy it with exactness and in she need of the spiritual which at other time take she outside the real and carry she in wild dream to the paradise of flower such as have never grow on earth she have always be thus she feel that she be in reality the same to-day as she have be yesterday in the midst of the flow of new life which ceaselessly transform she and then she think of pascal full of gratitude that he have make she what she be in day past when a little girl he have remove she from she execrable surroundings and take she home with he he have undoubtedly follow the impulse of he good heart but he have also undoubtedly desire to try a experiment with she to see how she would grow up in the different environment in a atmosphere of truthfulness and affection this have always be a idea of he it be a old theory of he which he would have like to test on a large scale : culture through environment complete regeneration even the improvement the salvation of the individual physically as well as morally she owe to he undoubtedly the best part of she nature she guess how fanciful and violent she might have become while he have make she only enthusiastic and courageous in this retrospection she be clearly conscious of the gradual change that have take place within she pascal have correct she heredity and she live over again the slow evolution the struggle between the fantastic and the real in she it have begin with she outburst of anger as a child a ferment of rebellion a want of mental balance that have cause she to indulge in most hurtful reverie then come she fit of extreme devotion the need of illusion and falsehood of immediate happiness in the thought that the inequality and injustice of this wicked world would he compensate by the eternal joy of a future paradise this be the epoch of she struggle with pascal of the torture which she have cause he plan to destroy the work of he genius and at this point she nature have change she have acknowledge he for she master he have conquer she by the terrible lesson of life which he have give she on the night of the storm then environment have act upon she evolution have proceed rapidly and she have end by become a well-balanced and rational woman willing to live life as it ought to be live satisfied with do she work in the hope that the sum of the common labor would one day free the world from evil and pain she have love she be a mother now and she understand suddenly she remember the night which they have spend in the threshing yard she could still hear she lamentation under the star -- the cruelty of nature the inefficacy of science the wickedness of humanity and the need she feel of lose herself in god in the unknown happiness consist in self-renunciation then she hear he repeat he creed -- the progress of reason through science truth acquire slowly and forever the only possible good the belief that the sum of these truth always augment would finally confer upon man incalculable power and peace if not happiness all be sum up in he ardent faith in life as he express it it be necessary to march with life which march always no halt be to be expect no peace in immobility and renunciation no consolation in turn back one must keep a steadfast soul the only ambition to perform one 's work modestly look for no other reward of life than to have live it bravely accomplish the task which it impose evil be only a accident not yet explain humanity appear from a great height like a immense wheel in action work ceaselessly for the future why should the workman who disappear have finish he day 's work abuse the work because he could neither see nor know its end even if it be to have no end why should he not enjoy the delight of action the exhilarating air of the march the sweetness of sleep after the fatigue of a long and busy day the child would carry on the task of the parent they be bear and cherish only for this for the task of life which be transmit to they which they in they turn will transmit to other all that remain then be to be courageously resign to the grand common labor without the rebellion of the ego which demand personal happiness perfect and complete she question herself and she find that she do not experience that anguish which have fill she formerly at the thought of what be to follow death this anxiety about the beyond no longer haunt she until it become a torture formerly she would have like to wrest by force from heaven the secret of destiny it have be a source of infinite grief to she not to know why she exist why be we bear what do we come on earth to do what be the meaning of this execrable existence without equality without justice which seem to she like a fevered dream now she terror be calm she could think of these thing courageously perhaps it be she child the continuation of herself which now conceal from she the horror of she end but she regular life contribute also to this the thought that it be necessary to live for the effort of living and that the only peace possible in this world be in the joy of the accomplishment of this effort she repeat to herself a remark of the doctor who would often say when he see a peasant return home with a contented look after he day 's work : there be a man whom anxiety about the beyond will not prevent from sleep he mean to say that this anxiety trouble and pervert only excitable and idle brain if all perform they healthful task all would sleep peacefully at night she herself have feel the beneficent power of work in the midst of she suffering and she grief since he have teach she to employ every one of she hour since she have be a mother especially occupy constantly with she child she no longer feel a chill of horror when she think of the unknown she put aside without a effort disquieting reverie and if she still feel a occasional fear if some of she daily grief make she sick at heart she find comfort and unfailing strength in the thought that she child be this day a day older that he would be another day older on the morrow that day by day page by page he work of life be be accomplish this console she delightfully for all she misery she have a duty a object and she feel in she happy serenity that she be do surely what she have be send here to do yet even at this very moment she know that the mystic be not entirely dead within she in the midst of the profound silence she hear a slight noise and she raise she head who be the divine mediator that have pass perhaps the beloved dead for whom she mourn and whose presence near she she fancy she could divine there must always be in she something of the childlike believer she have always be curious about the unknown have a instinctive longing for the mysterious she account to herself for this longing she even explain it scientifically however far science may extend the limit of human knowledge there be undoubtedly a point which it can not pass and it be here precisely that pascal place the only interest in life -- in the effort which we ceaselessly make to know more -- there be only one reasonable meaning in life this continual conquest of the unknown therefore she admit the existence of undiscovered force surround the world a immense and obscure domain ten time larger than the domain already win a infinite and unexplored realm through which future humanity would endlessly ascend here indeed be a field vast enough for the imagination to lose itself in in she hour of reverie she satisfy in it the imperious need which man seem to have for the spiritual a need of escape from the visible world of interrogate the unknown of satisfy in it the dream of absolute justice and of future happiness all that remain of she former torture she last mystic transport be there appease she satisfy there that hunger for console illusion which suffer humanity must satisfy in order to live but in she all be happily balance at this crisis in a epoch overburdened with science disquiet at the ruin it have make and seize with fright in the face of the new century wildly desire to stop and to return to the past clotilde keep the happy mean in she the passion for truth be broaden by she eagerness to penetrate the unknown if sectarian scientist shut out the horizon to keep strictly to the phenomenon it be permit to she a good simple creature to reserve the part that she do not know that she would never know and if pascal 's creed be the logical deduction from the whole work the eternal question of the beyond which she still continue to put to heaven reopen the door of the infinite to humanity march ever onward since we must always learn while resign ourselves never to know all be it not to will action life itself to reserve the unknown -- a eternal doubt and a eternal hope another sound as of a wing pass the light touch of a kiss upon she hair this time make she smile he be surely here and she whole be go out toward he in the great flood of tenderness with which she heart overflow how kind and cheerful he be and what a love for other underlie he passionate love of life perhaps he too have be only a dreamer for he have dream the most beautiful of dream the final belief in a better world when science should have bestow incalculable power upon man -- to accept everything to turn everything to we happiness to know everything and to foresee everything to make nature we servant to live in the tranquillity of intelligence satisfied meantime faith in life voluntary and regular labor would suffice for health evil be only the unexplained side of thing suffer would one day be assuredly utilize and regard from above the enormous labor of the world see the sum total of humanity good and bad -- admirable in spite of everything for they courage and they industry -- she now regard all mankind as unite in a common brotherhood she now feel only boundless indulgence a infinite pity and a ardent charity love like the sun bathe the earth and goodness be the great river at which all heart drink clotilde have be ply she needle for two hour with the same regular movement while she thought wander away in the profound silence but the tape be sew on the little waist she have even mark some new wrapper which she have buy the day before and she sewing finish she rise to put the linen away outside the sun be decline and only slender and oblique sunbeam enter through the crevice of the shutter she could not see clearly and she open one of the shutter then she forget herself for a moment at the sight of the vast horizon suddenly unroll before she the intense heat have abate a delicious breeze be blow and the sky be of a cloudless blue to the left could be distinguish even the smallest clump of pine among the blood-colored ravine of the rock of the seille while to the right beyond the hill of sainte-marthe the valley of the viorne stretch away in the golden dust of the setting sun she look for a moment at the tower of st saturnin all golden also dominate the rose-colored town and she be about to leave the window when she see a sight that draw she back and keep she there lean on she elbow for a long time still beyond the railroad a multitude of people be crowd together on the old mall clotilde at once remember the ceremony she know that she grandmother felicite be go to lay the first stone of the rougon asylum the triumphant monument destine to carry down to future age the glory of the family vast preparation have be go on for a week past there be talk of a silver hod and trowel which the old lady be to use herself determine to figure to triumph with she eighty-two year what swell she heart with regal pride be that on this occasion she make the conquest of plassan for the third time for she compel the whole town all the three quarter to range themselves around she to form a escort for she and to applaud she as a benefactress for of course there have to be present lady patroness choose from among the noblest lady of the quartier st marc a delegation from the society of working-woman of the old quarter and finally the most distinguished resident of the new town advocate notary physician without count the common people a stream of people dress in they Sunday clothes crowd there eagerly as to a festival and in the midst of this supreme triumph she be perhaps most proud -- she one of the queen of the second empire the widow who mourn with so much dignity the fall government -- in have conquer the young republic itself oblige it in the person of the sub-prefect to come and salute she and thank she at first there have be question only of a discourse of the mayor but it be know with certainty since the previous day that the sub-prefect also would speak from so great a distance clotilde could distinguish only a move crowd of black coat and light dress under the scorching sun then there be a distant sound of music the music of the amateur band of the town the sonorous strain of whose brass instrument be bear to she at interval on the breeze she leave the window and go and open the large oaken press to put away in it the linen that have remain on the table it be in this press formerly so full of the doctor 's manuscript and now empty that she keep the baby 's wardrobe it yawn open vast seemingly bottomless and on the large bare shelf there be nothing but the baby linen the little waist the little cap the little sock all the fine clothing the down of the bird still in the nest where so many thought have be store up where a man 's unremitting labor for thirty year have accumulate in a overflow heap of papers there be now only a baby 's clothing only the first garment which would protect it for a hour as it be and which very soon it could no longer use the vastness of the antique press seem brighten and all refresh by they when clotilde have arrange the wrapper and the waist upon a shelf she perceive a large envelope contain the fragment
