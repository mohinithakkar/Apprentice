till the revolution of 1688 and in the four subsequent reign with the last of which he volume close as have turn chiefly to a aristocracy -lrb- 1 -rrb- and it may be consider as have generally preserve that character through the long and eventful reign of george iii but even while he be write a change be already prepare of which more than one recent occurrence have give unmistakable warn a borough have be disfranchise for inveterate corruption in the first parliament of george iv -lrb- 2 -rrb- before its dissolution the same house of common have sanction the principle of a state endowment of the roman catholic clergy in ireland and have give a third reading to a bill for the abolition of all civil restriction affect member of that religion it be impossible to avoid foresee that the parliamentary reform inaugurate by the disfranchisement of grampound would soon be carry farther or that the emancipation as it be term of all christian sect be at least equally certain not to be long delay and it will be deny by no one that those measure which have no very obscure or doubtful connection with each other have gradually impart to the constitution a far more democratic tinge than would have be willingly accept by even the most liberal statesman of the preceding century or than in the day of the tudor or of the stuart would have be think compatible with the maintenance of the monarchy when george iii come to the throne he find the nation engage in a war which be occupy its arm not only on the continent of europe but in indium and america also and be extend she glory and she substantial power in both hemisphere _ inter arma silent lex _ and while the contest last neither legislator in parliament nor the people outside have much attention to spare for matter of domestic policy yet the first year of the new reign be not suffer to pass without the introduction of one measure limit the royal prerogative in a matter of paramount importance to the liberty of the people the independence of the judge the rule of make the commission of the judge depend on they good conduct instead of on the pleasure of the crown have indeed be establish at the revolution but it be still hold that these commission expire with the life of the sovereign who have grant they and at the accession of anne as also at that of george ii a renewal of they commission have be withhold from some member of the judicial bench but now even before the dissolution of the exist parliament the new king recommend to it such a change in the law as should secure the judge in the enjoyment of they office during they good behavior notwithstanding any demise of the crown give the proposal which be understand to have be originally suggest by himself additional weight by the very unusual step of make it the subject of a speech to the two house in the middle of the session a bill to give effect to it be at once bring in and though the house sit only a fortnight longer be carry before the dissolution the close of the year 1762 however see the restoration of peace and the circumstance connect with the treaty which re-establish it give birth to a degree of political and constitutional excitement such as have not agitate the kingdom for more than half a century that treaty have not be conclude by the minister who have conduct the war when george iii come to the throne he find the duke of newcastle preside at the treasury but the seal of one secretary of state in the hand of mr pitt who be universally regard as the guide genius of the ministry the other secretary of state be lord holdernesse but in the spring of 1761 as soon as the parliament be dissolve -lrb- 3 -rrb- that statesman retire from office and be succeed by the earl of bute a scotch nobleman who stand high in the favor of the king 's mother the princess dowager of wale but who have not till very recently be suppose to be actuate by political ambition and who be still less suspect of any statesman-like ability to qualify he for the office to which he be thus promote it be presently see however that he aspire to even higher dignity he at once set himself to oppose pitt 's warlike policy and on the question of declare war against spain he be so successful in induce the rest of the cabinet to reject pitt 's proposal that that statesman resign he office in unconcealed indignation have get rid of the real master of the ministry bute 's next step be to get rid of its nominal chief and in the spring of 1762 he manage to drive the duke of newcastle from the treasury and be himself place by the king at the head of the administration so rapid a elevation of a man previously unknown as a politician could hardly fail to create very widespread dissatisfaction which be in some degree augment by the nationality of the new minister lord bute be a scotchman and englishman have not wholly forgive or forget the scotch invasion of 1745 since that time the scotch have be regard with general disfavor scotch poverty and scotch greediness for the good thing of england have furnish constant topic for raillery and sarcasm and more than one demagogue and political writer have seek popularity by pander to the prevail taste for attack on the whole nation foremost among these be mr john wilkes member for aylesbury a man of broken fortune and still more damaged character but of a wit and hardihood that make he society acceptable to some of high rank and lax morality and cause he political alliance to be court by some who desire to be regard as leader of a party many of the transaction of the late reign have unfortunately not be favorable to the maintenance of any high standard of either public or private virtue on lord bute 's accession to office wilke have set up a periodical paper whose object and character be sufficiently indicate by its title _ the north briton _ and in which the diligence of lord bute in distribute place among he kinsman and countryman furnish the staple of almost every number while in many the princess of wale herself be not spare as the cause for motive not obscurely hint at of he sudden elevation so pertinacious and virulent be the attack thus launch at he coincide as they do at least in one point with the prejudice of the multitude that they be commonly believe to have have some share in drive lord bute from office which in the spring of 1763 he suddenly resign hope as it might almost seem thus to throw on he successor the burden of defend he measure the most important of these measure have be the conclusion of the treaty of versaille which when it be first announce to parliament have be vehemently attack in both house by pitt and he follower but have be approve by large majority wilke however not without reason believe it to be still unpopular with the nation at large and flush with he suppose victory over lord bute be watch eagerly for some occasion of re-open the question when such a opportunity be afford he by the king 's speech at the prorogation of the parliament which take place a few day after lord bute 's resignation lord bute have be succeed by mr george grenville who have for a time be one of he colleague as secretary of state and on he therefore the duty devolve of frame the royal speech the opening sentence of which refer to the re-establishment of peace in term of warm self-congratulation as have be effect upon condition honorable to the crown and beneficial to the people wilke at once catch at this panegyric as afford he just such a opportunity as he have be seek of renew he attack on the government which he regard as change in nothing but the name of the prime-minister -lrb- 4 -rrb- and four day after the prorogation -lrb- 5 -rrb- he accordingly issue a new number of _ the north briton _ -lrb- no 45 -rrb- in which he heap unmeasured sarcasm and invective on the peace itself on the royal speech and on the minister who have compose it as if conscious that mr grenville be less incline by temper than lord bute to suffer such attack without endeavor to retaliate he take especial pain to keep within the law in he stricture and accordingly carefully avoid say a disrespectful word of the king himself whom he describe as a prince of many great and amiable quality ever renown for truth honor and unsullied virtue but he claim a right to canvass the speech with the utmost freedom since it have always be consider by the legislature and by the public at large as the speech of the minister and he keep this distinction carefully in view through the whole number the speech he denounce with bitter vehemence as a abandon instance of ministerial effrontery as contain the most unjustifiable public declaration and infamous fallacy the peace he affirm to be such as have draw down the contempt of mankind on we wretched negotiator and he describe the present minister as a mere tool of the favorite by whom he still meditate to rule the kingdom with a rod of iron but in the whole number there be but one sentence which could be represent as imply the very slightest censure on the king himself and even that be qualify by a personal eulogy the king of england it say be not only the first magistrate of the country but be invest by the law with the whole executive power he be however responsible to he people for the due execution of the royal function in the choice of minister etc equally with the meanest of he subject in he particular duty the personal character of we present amiable sovereign make we easy and happy that so great a power be lodge in such hand but the favorite have give too just cause for he to escape the general odium the prerogative of the crown be to exert the constitutional power intrust to it in such a way not of blind favor and partiality but of wisdom and judgment this be the spirit of we constitution the people too have they prerogative and i hope the fine word of dryden will be engraven on we heart ` freedom be the english subject 's prerogative ' these be the last sentence of no 45 and in the present day it will hardly be think that however severe or even violent some of the epithet with which certain sentence of the royal speech be assail may have be the language exceed the bound of allowable political criticism with respect to the king indeed however accompany with personal compliment to himself those stricture may have be it may be admit that in assert any responsibility whatever to the people on the part of the sovereign even for the choice of he minister as be bind to exercise that choice with wisdom and judgment it go somewhat beyond the strict theory of the constitution undoubtedly that theory be that the minister choose by the king be himself responsible for every circumstance or act which lead to he appointment this principle be establish in the fullest manner in 1834 when as will be see hereafter sir robert peel admit he entire responsibility for the dismissal of lord melbourne by king william iv though it be notorious that he be in italy at the time and have not be consult on the matter but as yet such question have not be as accurately examine as subsequent event cause they to be and wilke 's assertion of royal responsibility to this extent probably coincide with the general feeling on the subject -lrb- 6 -rrb- at all event the error contain in it and the insinuation that due wisdom and judgment have not be display in the appointment of mr g grenville to the treasury be not so derogatory to the legitimate authority and dignity of the crown as to make the writer a fit subject for a criminal prosecution but mr grenville be of a bitter temper never incline to tolerate any stricture on he own judgment or capacity and fully imbue with the conviction that the first duty of a english minister be to uphold the supreme authority of the parliament and to chastise any one who dare to call in question the wisdom of any one of its resolution but _ the north briton _ have do this and more no 45 have not only denounce the treaty which both house have approve but have insinuate in unmistakable language that they approval have be purchase by gross corruption -lrb- a fact which be indeed sufficiently notorious -rrb- and consequently mr grenville determine to treat the number which contain the denunciation as a seditious libel the publication of which be a criminal offence and by he direction lord halifax as secretary of state issue what be term a general warrant -- a warrant that be which do not name the person or person against whom it be direct but which command the apprehension of the author printer and publisher of the offend paper leave the officer who be charge with its execution to decide who come under that description or in other word who be guilty of the act charge before they have be bring before any tribunal the warrant be execute wilke and some printer be apprehend wilke himself as if the minister 's design have be to make the charge ridiculous by exaggeration be consign to the great state-prison of the tower such a use of which be generally limit to those impeach of high-treason and indeed the commitment do declare that no 45 of _ the north briton _ be a libel tend to alienate the affection of the people from he majesty and to excite they to traitorous insurrection against the government wilke instantly sue out a writ of _ habeas corpus _ and be without hesitation release by the court of common plea on the legal ground that as a member of the house of common he be protect from arrest in all case except treason felony or a breach of the peace a decision which in the next session of parliament the minister endeavor to overbear by induce both house to concur in a resolution that privilege of parliament do not extend to the case of publishing seditious libel in he life of lord camden -lrb- 7 -rrb- who be chief-justice of the common plea at the time lord campbell express a warm approval of this resolution as one which would now be consider conclusive evidence of the law but with all respect to the memory of a writer who be himself a chief-justice we suspect that in this case he be advance a position as a author engage in the discussion of what have become a party question which he would not have lay down from the bench -lrb- 8 -rrb- the resolution certainly do not make it law since it be not confirm by any royal assent and to interpret the law be not within the province of the house of common nor except when sit as a court of appeal of the house of lord we may however fully agree with the principle which lord campbell at the same time lay down that privilege of parliament should not be permit to interfere with the execution of the criminal law of the country and this doctrine have be so fully acquiesce in since that member of both house have in more than one instance be imprison on conviction for libel the legality of the species of warrant under which wilke have be arrest be however a question of far greater importance and on that no formal decision be pronounce on this occasion the lieutenant of the tower in he return to the writ of _ habeas corpus _ and the counsel employ on both side equally avoid all mention of the character of the warrant but it be indirectly determine shortly afterward the leader of the opposition would fain have have the point settle by what in truth would not have settle it -- another resolution of the house of common but though it be discuss in several warm debate grenville always contrived to baffle he adversary though on one occasion he majority dwindle to fourteen -lrb- 9 -rrb- what however the house of common abstain from affirm be distinctly though somewhat extra-judicially assert by lord camden as chief-justice of the common plea wilke with some of the printer and other who have be arrest have bring action for false imprisonment which come to be try in he court and they obtain such heavy damages that the official who have be mulct apply for new trial on the plea of they be excessive but the chief-justice refuse the application and uphold the verdict on the ground that the jury in they assessment of damages have be influence by a righteous indignation at the conduct of those who seek to exercise arbitrary power over all the king 's subject to violate magna charta and to destroy the liberty of the kingdom by insist on the legality of this general warrant such a justification would hardly be admit now but in a subsequent trial a still higher authority the chief-justice of the king 's bench lord mansfield hold language so similar that once more to quote the word of lord campbell without any formal judgment general warrant have ever since be consider illegal however the release of wilke on the ground of he parliamentary privilege give he but a momentary triumph or rather respite the prosecution be not abate by the decision that he could not be imprison before trial while one effect of he liberation be to stimulate the minister to add another count to the indictment prefer against he on which he might be expect to find it less easy to excite the sympathy of any party wilke have not always confine he literary effort to political pamphlet there be a club name the franciscan -lrb- in compliment to sir franci dashwood lord bute 's chancellor of the exchequer who as well as lord sandwich the first lord of the admiralty be one of its member -rrb- which meet at medmenham abbey on the bank of the thame and there hold revel whose license recall the worst excess of the preceding century to this club wilke also belong and in indulgence of taste in harmony with such a brotherhood he have compose a blasphemous and indecent parody on pope 's essay on man which he entitle a essay on woman and to which he append a body of burlesque note purport to be the composition of pope 's latest commentator the celebrated dr warburton bishop of gloucester he have never publish it -lrb- indeed it may be doubt whether even in that not very delicate age any publisher could have be find to run the risk of issue so scandalous a work -rrb- but he have print a few copy in he own house of which he design to make present to such friend as he expect to appreciate it he have not however so far as it appear give away a single copy when on the very first day of the next session of parliament lord sandwich himself bring the parody under the notice of the house of lord if there be a single member of the house whose delicacy be not likely to be shock and whose moral could not be injure by such a composition it be certainly lord sandwich himself but he zeal as a minister to support he chief kindle in he a sudden enthusiasm for the support of virtue and decency also and have obtain a copy by some surreptitious means he now make a formal complaint of it to the house contend that the use of the name of the bishop of gloucester as author of the note constitute a breach of the privilege of the house and he be second by the bishop himself whose temper and judgment be unhappily very inferior to he learning and piety it be record that he actually compare wilke to the devil and then apologize to satan for the comparison but the lord be in a humor to regard no violence against wilke as excessive and submit to the guidance of the minister and the prelate resolve that the essay on woman -lrb- 10 -rrb- as also another poem by the same writer a paraphrase of the venus creator be a most scandalous obscene and impious libel and present a address to the king request he majesty to give the most effectual order for the immediate prosecution of the author and in the course of the next few week the house of common outrun the peer themselves in violence and manifest unfairness they concur with the lord in order no 45 of _ the north briton _ to be burn by the common hangman a order which be not carry out without great opposition on the part of the london populace who make it the occasion of a very formidable riot in which the sheriff themselves incur no little danger and by another resolution they order wilke to attend in he place to answer the charge of have publish the two work but at the time when they make this order it be well know that he could not obey it a few day before he have be challenge by a mr martin who till very recently have be one of the secretary of the treasury and who be generally believe to have prepare himself for the conflict by diligent practice with a pistol and in the duel which ensue wilke have be severely wound it be not only notorious that he have be thus disabled but he send a physician and surgeon of admit eminence in they profession and of unquestioned honor to testify to the fact at the bar of the house and subsequently he forward write certificate to the same purport from some french doctor who have special knowledge of gunshot wound but the common decline to accept this evidence as sufficient and direct two other doctor to examine he wilke however refuse to admit they : he refusal be treat as a sufficient ground for pronounce he guilty of a contempt of the authority of the house and for decide on he case in he absence and on the 19th of January before the case have come on for trial a resolution be carry that mr wilke be guilty of write and publish _ the north briton _ -lrb- no 45 -rrb- which this house have vote to be a false scandalous and seditious libel and that for the say offence he be expel the house at a later period of the year he be try on the two charge of publish no 45 and the essay on woman be find guilty of both and as he do not appear to receive judgment in November 1764 he be outlaw so far it may be say to have be a draw battle if on the one hand the minister have procure the expulsion of wilke on the other hand wilke have gain great notoriety and a certain amount of sympathy and have moreover enriched himself by considerable damages and again if the nation at large be a gainer by the condemnation of general warrant even that advantage might be think to be dearly gain by the discredit into which the parliament have fall through its intemperance but the contest between wilke and the ministry be only close for a time and when it be revive a singular freak of fortune cause the very minister who have lead the proceedings against he on this occasion to appear as he advocate to avoid the consequence of he outlawry he have take up he abode in paris wait for a change of ministry which as he hope might bring into power some to whom he might look for greater favor but when though in the course of the next two year two fresh administration be form it be see that neither lord rockingham the head of the first nor the duke of grafton and mr pitt -lrb- promote to the earldom of chatham -rrb- the head of the second have any greater sympathy with he than mr grenville he become desperate and look out for some opportunity of give effect to he discontent he find it in the dissolution of parliament which take place in the spring of 1768 in spite of he outlawry he instantly return to england and offer himself as a candidate for london there indeed he do not succeed though the populace be uproarious in he support and draw he carriage through the street as if in triumph but before the end of the month he be return at the head of the poll for middlesex when the mob celebrate he victory by great riot and outrage break the window of lord bute as he old enemy and of the lord mayor as the representative of the city of london which have reject he and insulting and even in some instance beat passer-by who refuse to join in they cheer for wilke and liberty he have already pledge himself to take the necessary step to procure the reversal of he outlawry and in pursuance of he promise he surrender in the court of king 's bench but he removal to prison cause a renewal of the tumult with greater violence than before the mob even rescue he from the officer who have he in custody and when have escape from he deliverer he with a parade of obedience to the law again surrender himself voluntarily at the gate of the king 's bench prison they threaten to attack the jail itself kindle a fire under its wall which be not extinguish without some danger and day after day assemble in such tumultuous and menacing crowd that at last lord weymouth the secretary of state write a letter to the surrey magistrate enjoin they to abstain from no measure which might seem necessary for the preservation of peace even if that could only be effect by the employment of the soldiery the riot grow more and more formidable till at last the magistrate have no resource but to call out the troops who on one occasion after they have be pelt with large stone and in many instance severely injure fire kill or wound several of the foremost rioter so tragical a event seem to wilke to furnish he with exactly such a opportunity as he desire to push himself into farther notoriety he at once print lord weymouth 's letter and circulate it with a inflammatory comment in which he describe it as a composition have for its fruit a horrid massacre the consummation of a hellish plot deliberately plan too angry to be prudent lord weymouth complain to the house of lord of this publication as a breach of privilege and the lord formally represent it to the house of common as a insult deliberately offer to they by one of its member there could be no doubt that such language as wilke have use be libellous in its imputation of design of deliberate wickedness it very far exceed the bitterest passage of _ the north briton _ and lord weymouth 's colleague therefore think they might safely follow the precedent set in 1764 of brand the publication as a libel and again procure the expulsion of the libeller from the house of common there be circumstance in the present case such as the difference between the constituency of aylesbury and middlesex and the enthusiastic fervor in the offender 's cause which the populace of the city have display which make it very doubtful whether the precedent of 1764 be quite a safe one to follow but the minister not only disregard every such consideration but as if they have wantonly design to give they measure a bad appearance and to furnish its opponent with the strongest additional argument against it they mix up with they present complaint a reference to former misdeed of wilke with which it have no connection on receive the message of the lord they have summon he to appear at the bar of the house of common that he might be examine on the subject but this proceeding be so far from intimidate he that he not only avow the publication of he comment on lord weymouth 's letter but glory in it assert that he deserve the thanks of the people for bring to light the true character of that bloody scroll such language be regard as a aggravation of he offence and the attorney-general move that he comment on the letter be a insolent scandalous and seditious libel and when that motion have be carry lord barrington follow it up with another to the effect that john wilkes esq a member of this house who have at the bar of this house confess himself to be the author and publisher of what the house have resolve to be a insolent scandalous and seditious libel and who have be convict in the court of king 's bench of have print and publish a seditious libel and three -lrb- 11 -rrb- obscene and impious libel and by the judgment of the say court have be sentence to undergo twenty-two month ' imprisonment and be now in execution under the say judgment be expel this house this motion encounter a vigorous opposition not only from mr burke and the principal member of the rockingham party which now form the regular opposition but also from mr grenville the former prime-minister who on the former occasion in 1764 have himself move the expulsion of the same offender he speech on this occasion be the only one which be fully report and it deserve the distinction from the exhaustive way in which it deal with every part of the question it display no inclination to extenuate wilke 's present offence but it point out with great force the circumstance that the supporter of the motion be far from agreement as to the reason by which they be guide that some member of the greatest authority in the house while they have avow they intention of vote for the expulsion have at the same time be careful to explain that the comment on lord weymouth 's letter be not the ground of they vote that so great a lawyer as mr blackstone have assert that that comment have not be properly and regularly bring before the house but have found he intention to vote for the expulsion solely upon that article of the charge which related to the three obscene and impious libel mention in it disavow in the most direct term all the other article that on the other hand other member of deserve weight and influence such as lord palmerston and lord f campbell have disdain the idea of regard the article of the three obscene and impious libel as afford any ground for they proceeding so practice a debater as mr grenville have but little difficulty therefore in argue against the advocate of expulsion when they be so divide that one portion of they do in fact reply to the other but it would be superfluous here to enter into the argument employ on either side to justify the expulsion or to prove it to be unjustifiable from a consideration of the character of either wilke or he publication the strength and importance of mr grenville 's speech lay in the constitutional point which it raise some supporter of the minister have dwell upon the former expulsion insist that a man who have be expel by a former house of common could not possibly be deem a proper person to sit in the present parliament unless he have some pardon to plead or some merit to cancel he former offence by a reference to the case of sir r walpole mr grenville prove that this have not be the opinion of former parliament and he contend with unanswerable logic that it would be very mischievous to the nation if such a principle should be now act on and such a precedent establish since though employ in the first instance against the odious and the guilty it might when once establish be easily apply to and make use of against the meritorious and the innocent and so the most eminent and deserving member of the state under the color of such a example by one arbitrary and discretionary vote of one house of parliament the worst species of ostracism might be exclude from the public council cut off and proscribe from the rights of every subject of the realm not for a term of year alone but forever he quote from l'esprit des lois a assertion of montesquieu that one of the excellence of the english constitution be that the judicial power be separate from the legislative and that there would be no liberty if they be blended together the power over the life and liberty of the citizen would then be arbitrary for the judge would be the legislator and have thus prove that it would be a violation of the recognize constitution to find a second expulsion on the first he proceed to argue that to expel he for this new offence would be impolitic and inexpedient as a step which would inevitably lead to a contest with the constituency which he represent since in the present disposition of the county of middlesex no one could entertain a doubt that wilke would be re-elect the house would then probably think itself under a necessity of again expel he and he would as certainly be again re-elect the house might indeed refuse to issue a new writ which would be to deprive the freeholder of middlesex of the right of choose any other representative but he could not believe that the house would think it fit to inflict such a punishment on the elector of a great county should it not do so the other alternative would be to bring into the house as representative and knight of the shire for middlesex a man choose by a few voter only in contradiction to the declare sense of a great majority of the freeholder on the face of the poll upon the supposition that all the vote of the latter be forfeit and throw away on account of the expulsion of mr wilke it seem premature to discuss that point before it arise and therefore the speaker contented himself for the present with say that he believe there be no example of such a proceeding and that if it should appear to be new and unfounded as the law of the land or even if any reasonable doubt could be entertain of its legality the attempt to forfeit the freeholder ' vote in such a manner would be highly alarming and dangerous few prophecy have be more exactly fulfil the house do expel mr wilke he do offer himself for re-election and be re-elected and the minister in consequence move and carry a resolution that john wilkes esq have be in this session of parliament expel this house be and be incapable of be elect a member to serve in this present parliament and in pursuance of this vote a writ be again issue at the end of another month the proceeding require to be repeat wilke have again offer himself for re-election no other candidate have present himself and in answer to a inquiry the under-sheriff report that no other candidate have be propose but john wilkes esq and that no elector have give or tender he vote for any other person once more the house resolve that he be incapable of be elect and issue a new writ but on this second occasion the ministry have provide a rival candidate in the person of the honorable hk luttrell he be duly propose and second a poll be take and keep open for several day and as it appear at the close that 1143 vote have be give for wilke and 296 for mr luttrell the sheriff again return wilke as duly elect a debate of singularly angry excitement arise on the reception of this return even lawyer such as mr de gray the attorney-general and sir fletcher norton who have be attorney-general be not ashamed to denounce the conduct of the sheriff in return mr wilke as highly improper and indecent as a fly in the face of a resolution of the house of common and sir fletcher even venture to advance the proposition that as the common be act in a judicial capacity they resolution be equal to law lord north too the chancellor of the exchequer as we learn from the parliamentary history speak long but chiefly to the passion he describe mr wilke and he action in a lively manner show the variety of trouble which he have give the ministry and that unless by vote in mr luttrell a end be put to this debate the whole kingdom would be in confusion though he own that he do not think that measure would put a end to the distraction he speak much more to the expediency than to the legality of the measure propose on the other side it be contend by several member burke and mr grenville be of the number that the house of common alone could not make a law bind any body but themselves that if they could disqualify one person they could disqualify as many as they pleased and thus get into they own hand the whole power of the government and precedent be produce to prove that vote of the house of lord and also of the house of common regard they own member have be disregard by the judge of the court of king 's bench as be contrary to law but the minister be secure of the steadiness of he adherent and a majority of 221 to 152 declare that mr luttrell have be duly elect but lord north be correct in he anticipation that they vote would not put a end to the agitation on the question and it be renew in the next session in a manner which at one time threaten to produce a breach between the two house the parliamentary history close its report of the debate on the resolution by which mr luttrell be seat with a summary of the argument use in it take from the annual register which as be universally know be at this time edit by mr burke it be a very fair and candid abstract which in fact put the whole question on one single issue that the house of common be the sole court of judicature in all case of election and that this authority be derive from the first principle of we government viz the necessary independence of the three branch of the legislature but though that doctrine be fully admit by the opposition they make that very admission a ground for revive the question in the next session by move for a resolution which should declare that ` be a court of judicature the house of common in decide matter of election be bind to judge accord to the law of the land and the known and established law of parliament which be part thereof ' it be understand that this resolution if carry be intend as a stepping-stone to other which should condemn the decision of the previous session yet it seem such a truism that even the minister could not venture to deny it but they propose to defeat the object of its framer by add to it a declaration that the late decision be agreeable to the say law of the land and we might pass on to the subsequent debate in which the constitutional correctness of that addition be distinctly challenge do it not seem desirable to notice two argument which be bring forward against the motion one by a independent member mr ongley the other by the attorney-general mr ongley contend that a power of preserve order and decency be essentially necessary to every aggregate body and with respect to this house if it have not power over its particular member they would be subject to no control at all the answer to this argument be obvious : that a right on the part of the house to control the conduct of its member be a wholly different thing from a right to determine who be or ought to be member and that for the house to claim this latter right except on grounds of qualification or disqualification legally prove would be to repeat one of the most monstrous of all cromwell 's act of tyranny when in 1656 he place guard at the door of the house with order to refuse admission to all those member whom however lawfully elect he do not expect to find sufficiently compliant for he purpose mr de gray 's argument be of a different character be base on what he foretell would be the practical result of a decision that expulsion do not involve a incapacity to be re-elect if it do not involve such incapacity and if in consequence mr wilke should be re-elected he consider that the house would naturally feel it its duty to re-expel he as often as the constituency re-elect he but one answer give to this argument be that to expel a second time would be to punish twice for one offence a proceeding at variance not only with english law but with every idea of justice another and one which have obtain greater acceptance be that the legitimate doctrine be that the issue of a new writ give the expel member a appeal from the house to the constituency and that the constituency have a constitutional right to overrule the judgment of the house and to determine whether it still regard the candidate as its most suitable representative the minister however be as before strong enough in the house to carry they resolution but the opposition return to the charge take up a entirely different though equally general position that by the law of the land and the known law and usage of parliament no person eligible by common right can be incapacitate by vote or resolution of this house but by act of parliament only it be remarkable that in the debate which ensue two member who successively rise to the dignity of lord chancellor mr thurlow and mr wedderburn take different side but nothing could shake the ministerial majority the resolution be reject and when lord rockingham propose the same resolution in the house of lord though it be support by all the eloquence of lord chatham he be beat by a majority of more than two to one and the minister even carry a resolution declare that any interference of the house of lord with any judgment of the house of common in matter of election would be a violation of the constitutional rights of the common even these decisive defeat of the opposition do not finally terminate the struggle the notoriety which wilke have gain have answer he purpose to no slight extent the city have adopt he cause with continually increase earnestness and effect it have make he sheriff alderman lord mayor and have enrich he with the lucrative office of city chamberlain and as one of the city magistrate he subsequently win the good opinion of many who have previously condemn he by he conduct during the gordon riot in which he exert he authority with great intrepidity to check and punish the violence of the rioter and when in 1782 lord rockingham become for the second time prime-minister he think he might well avail himself of the favor he have thus acquire and of the accession to office of those whom the line which they have formerly take bind to countenance he to bring forward a motion for the expunction of the resolution against he which have be pass in 1770 it be carry by a largo majority and though this be as evidently a party division as those have be by which he have be defeat twelve year before still as the last resolution on the subject it must be regard as decisive of the law and practice of parliament and as have settle the doctrine that expulsion do not incapacitate a member who have be expel from immediate re-election -lrb- 12 -rrb- the establishment of this rule and the abolition of general warrant be however not the only nor the most important result of these proceedings they lead indirectly to a innovation which it be hardly too much to say have have a greater influence on the character and conduct of parliament and indeed on the whole subsequent legislation of the country than can be attribute to any other single cause hitherto the bulk of the people have enjoy but very scanty and occasional means of acquire political education at time of vehement political excitement or any special party conflict pamphlet and periodical essay have enlighten they reader -- necessarily a select and small body -- on particular topic but stand order of both house often renew strictly forbid all publication of the debate which take place in either to a certain extent these order have come to be disregard and evade almost ever since the accession of the house of brunswick a london publisher have give to the world a annual account of the parliamentary proceedings and most interesting discussion of the year and before the middle of the reign of george ii two monthly magazine have give sketch of speech make by lead member of each party the reporter however do not venture to give the name of the speaker at full length but either disguise they under some general description or at most give they initial and sometimes find that even this profession of deference to the standing order do not insure they impunity as late as the year 1747 cave the proprietor and editor of the _ gentleman 's magazine _ be bring to the bar of the house of common for publish a account of a recent debate and only obtain he release by expression of humble submission and the payment of heavy fee the awe however which he humiliation and peril have be intend to diffuse gradually wear off the keen interest which be awaken by the ministerial change at the beginning of the reign of george iii which have be already mention naturally prompt a variety of effort to gratify it by a revelation of the language concern they which be hold by statesman of different party and these revelation be no longer confine to yearly or monthly publication more than one newspaper have of late adopt the practice of publish what it affirm to be a correct report of the debate of the previous day though in fact each journal garble they to suit the view of the party to which it belong and to quote the word of the historian of the period misrepresent the language and argument of the speaker in a manner which could hardly be consider accidental -lrb- 13 -rrb- the speaker on the ministerial side in the debate on the middlesex election have be especial object of these misrepresentation and at the beginning of 1771 one of that party colonel onslow mp for guilford bring the subject before the house complain that many speech and he own among they have be misrepresent by two newspaper which he name and that the practice have get to a infamous height so that it have become absolutely necessary either to punish the offender or to revise the standing order -lrb- 14 -rrb- and he accordingly move that the publication of the newspaper of which he complain be a contempt of the order and a breach of the privilege of the house and that the printer be order to attend the house at its next sit the habitual unfairness of the report be admit by the opposition but the publisher complain of evidently feel assure of they sympathy -lrb- which indeed be sufficiently and not very decorously show by its leader inflict on the house no fewer than twenty-three division in a single night -rrb- and rely on they countenance they pay no attention to the order of the house a fresh order for they arrest have be issue the sergeant-at-arm report that he have be unable to execute it by reason of they absence from they home on which the house not dispose to allow itself to be thus trifle with now address he majesty with a request that he would issue he royal proclamation for they apprehension and colonel onslow make a fresh motion with a similar complaint of the publisher of six more newspaper -- three brace as he describe they in language more sportsman like than parliamentary similar order for they appearance and when these be disregard for they apprehension be issue and at last one of those who have be mention in the royal proclamation mr wheble printer of the _ middlesex journal _ be apprehend by a officer name carpenter and carry before the sit magistrate at guildhall who by a somewhat whimsical coincidence happen to be alderman wilke wilke not only discharge he on the ground that there be no legal cause of complaint against he but when wheble in retaliation make a formal complaint of the assault commit on he by carpenter in arrest he bind wheble over to prosecute and carpenter to answer the complaint at the next quarter session and then report what he have do in a official letter to the secretary of state thomson another printer be in like manner arrest and when bring before mr oliver another alderman be discharge by he and when a day or two afterward a third -lrb- mr miller -rrb- be apprehend by whetham a messenger of the house of common mr brass crosby the lord mayor and the two alderman sign a warrant commit whetham to prison for assault miller whetham be bail by the sergeant-at-arm who report what have occur to the house and the house as the lord mayor and alderman oliver be member of it as representative for london and honiton order that they should attend the house in they place to explain they conduct and that mr wilke should attend at the bar of the house wilke decline to recognize the validity of the resolution which have seat colonel luttrell for middlesex refuse compliance with such a order write a letter to the speaker in which he observe that no notice be take of he as a member of the house and that the speaker 's order do not require he to attend in he place and he demand he seat in parliament and promise when he have be admit to he seat to give the house a most exact detail of he conduct but the lord mayor plead the charter of the city as a justification of he act in release a citizen of london who have be arrest on a warrant which have not be back by a city magistrate and demand to be hear by counsel in support of he plea he demand however be refuse and he and alderman oliver be commit to the tower but as if the minister be afraid of re-open the question of colonel luttrell 's election for middlesex they evade take notice of wilke 's disobedience to they order by a singularly undignified expedient issue a fresh order for he appearance on the 8th of April and adjourn till the 9th the minister now move the appointment of a select committee to investigate the whole affair and the committee before the end of the month make a elaborate report which however abstain from all mention of the offence commit by the printer and confine itself to a assertion that the power and authority of the house to compel the attendance of any commoner have ever extend as well to the city of london without exception on account of charter from the crown or any pretence of separate jurisdiction as to every other part of the realm and this assertion may be regard as have be uphold by the refusal of the judge to release the lord mayor and alderman when they sue out writ of _ habeas corpus _ and they consequently remain prisoner in the tower till they be release by the prorogation but with this report of the committee the matter be suffer to drop the transaction have cause almost unprecedented excitement which be not confine to the city for the grand-jury of many english county and a committee of the dublin merchant show they sympathy with the opposition by send up address to the imprison city magistrate and the minister have a prudent fear of keep alive a agitation which have not be always free from danger to the public tranquillity -lrb- 15 -rrb- in effect the victory remain with the opposition no farther attempt be make to punish any of the printer and though the standing order which forbid such publication have never be formally repeal ever since that time the publisher of newspaper and other periodical have be in the constant habit of give regular detail of the proceedings of both house of parliament and one enterprising publisher mr hansard have for many year publish a complete record of the debate in both house which be continually appeal to in the house themselves by member of both party as a manual of political and parliamentary history the practice as it now prevail be one of the many instance of the practical wisdom with which this nation often deal with difficult subject the standing order be retain as a instrument which in certain case it may possibly be expedient to employ as in fact it have be employ in one or two instance in the present reign when matter have be under consideration which however necessary to be discuss be of such a nature that the publication of the detail into which some speaker deem it desirable to go be regard by other as calculate to be offensive to the taste if not injurious to the moral of the community at large but the very fact of such a occasional enforcement of the standing order under very peculiar circumstance imply a recognition of the propriety of its more ordinary violation of the principle that publication ought to be the general rule and secrecy the unusual exception and indeed it be probably no exaggeration to say that such publication be not only valuable as the best and chief means of the political education of the people out-of-door but be indispensable to the working of we parliamentary system such as it have now become the successive reform bill which have place the electoral power in the hand of so vast a body of constituent as be never imagine in the last century have evidently regard the possession by the elector of a perfect knowledge of the language hold and the vote give by they representative as indispensable to the proper exercise of the franchise which they have confer and even if there have previously be no mean provide for they acquisition of such information it be certain that the elector would never have consent to be long keep in the dark on subject of such interest in another point of view the publication of the debate be equally desirable in the interest of the member themselves whether leader or follower of the different party not to mention the stimulus that it afford to the cultivation of eloquence -- a incentive to which even those least inclined or accustomed to put themselves forward be not entirely insensible -- it enable the minister to vindicate they measure to the nation at large the leader of the opposition to explain they objection or resistance to those measure in they own person and not through the hire agency of pamphleteer and each humbler member to prove to he constituent the fidelity with which he have act up to the principle he assertion of which induce they to confide they interest and those of the kingdom to he judgment and integrity secrecy and mystery may serve or be suppose to serve the interest of arbitrary ruler perfect openness be the only principle on which a free constitution can be maintain and a free people govern it seem convenient to take all the measure which in this first portion of the reign before we affect the proceedings or constitution of parliament together and indeed one enactment of great importance which be pass in 1770 it be hardly unreasonable to connect in some degree with the decision of the house which adjudge the seat for middlesex to colonel luttrell ever since the year 1704 it have be regard as a settle point that the house of common have the exclusive right of determine every question concern the election of its member but it be equally notorious that it have exercise that right in a manner which violate every principle of justice and even of decency election petition be decide by the entire house and be almost invariably treat as party question in which impartiality be not even profess thirty year before the prime-minister himself -lrb- sir robert walpole -rrb- have give notice to he supporter that no quarter be to be give in election petition and it be a division on one petition which eventually drive he from office there be not even a pretence make of decide accord to evidence for few of the member take the trouble to hear it a few year after the time of which we be speak lord george germaine thus describe the mode of proceeding which have previously prevail : the manager of petition do not ask those on whose support they calculate to attend at the examination of witness but only to let they know where they might be find when the question be go to be put that they might be able to send they word in time for the division the practice have become a public scandal by which the constituency and the house itself suffer equally -- the constituency inasmuch as they be liable to be represent by one who be in fact only the representative of a minority the house itself since its title to public confidence could have no solid or just foundation but such as be derive from its member be in every instance the choice of the majority yet so long as petition be judge by the whole house there seem no chance of the abuse be remove the number of judge confer the immunity of shamelessness on each individual to remedy such a state of thing in the spring of 1770 mr g grenville bring in a bill which provide for the future trial of all such petition by a select committee of fifteen member thirteen of whom should be choose by ballot one by the sit member whose seat be petition against and one by the petitioner the member of the committee be to take a oath to do justice similar to that take by juryman in the court of law and the committee be to have power to compel the attendance of witness to examine they on oath and to enforce the production of all necessary papers it be also to commence its sitting within twenty-four hour of its appointment and to sit from day to day till it should be prepare to present its report it be not to the credit of the minister that they make the passing of such a bill a party question the abuse which it be design to remedy be notorious and mr grenville do not exaggerate its magnitude when he declare that if it be not check it must end in the ruin of public liberty he be support by burke and by two lawyer mr dunning and mr wedderburn both destine to rise to some of the highest office in they profession but he be oppose by the attorney-general by lord north as leader of the house and by mr fox -- not yet turn into a patriot by lord north 's dismissal of he from office the debate both in the whole house and in committee be long and earnest some of the ministerial underling be not ashamed to deny the necessity of any alteration in the exist practice but they more favorite argument be found on the impropriety of the house delegate its authority to a committee which be assert to be a essential alteration of the constitution of the house of common lord north himself have too keen a instinct of propriety to deny the existence of a great evil and contented himself with plead for time for farther consideration while the attorney-general confine he objection to some detail of the bill which it would be easy to amend other with too accurate a foresight doubt the efficacy of the measure and prophesy that the additional sanction of the oath by which its framer hope to bind the committee to a just and honest decision would like oath of office and custom-house oath soon fall into matter of form and lose all sanction and so make bad worse on the other hand besides the argument found on the admit greatness of the evil to be remedy it be show that the institution of committee such as the bill propose the appointment of be sanction by numerous precedent and though the committee -- sometimes consist of as many as two hundred member -- be by far too large to make it probable that all would bestow a careful attention on the whole case there be nothing in the journal of the house to show that they decision be not regard as final or as require no subsequent confirmation from the whole house generally speak lord north could trust the steadiness of he majority but to he great surprise on this occasion he find himself desert by the country gentleman who vote in a body for the bill although they spokesman sir w bagot have be in no slight degree offend by some remark of burke who with a strange imprudence have claim a monopoly of the title of friend of the constitution for himself and he party and have sneer at the country gentleman as statesman of a very different description though by a late description give of they a tory be now the best species of whig and the union of the two body prove irresistible the bill be carry by a majority of sixty-two and the government do not venture to carry on they resistance to it in the house of lord any interference by which would indeed have be resent by the common as a violation of they privilege at first the duration of the bill be limit to seven year but in 1774 it be make perpetual by a still larger majority the experience of its work have convert many who have at first oppose it but who now bear willing testimony to its efficacy unhappily though the house could make the bill perpetual at least till formally repeal it could not invest its good effect with equal durability after a time the same complaint be advance against the decision of election committee that have formerly be employ to discredit the judgment of the whole house the success or failure of a petition again become a party question and as in a committee of a odd number the ministerialist or the opposition must inevitably have a majority of at least one member before the end of the reign it have become as easy to foretell the result of a petition from the composition of the committee as it have be in the time of walpole and it be with the approval of almost all party -- a approval extort only by the absolute necessity of the case -- that after one or two modification of mr grenville 's act have be try mr disraelus induce the house to surrender altogether its privilege of judge of election and to submit the investigation of petition on such subject to the only tribunal sufficiently above suspicion to command and retain the confidence of the nation the judge of the high court of law we shall probably be do the house of common of the day no injustice if we surmise that the degree in which public attention have recently be direct to the representation and the interest which the people be begin to show in the purity of election as the principle on the maintenance of which the very liberty of all might depend have some share in lead the house to establish the wholly new though most necessary precedent of punish a constituency for habitual and inveterate corruption it may be call the first fruit of mr grenville 's act at the end of the same year in which that statute have be pass a select committee have sit to try the merit of a petition which complain of a undue return for the borough of new shoreham and its report bring to light a organized system of corruption which there be too much reason to fear be but a specimen of that which prevail in many other borough as yet undetected it appear from the report found as it be on the evidence and confession of many of the person inculpate that a society have long exist in new shoreham entitle the christian club which under this specious name be institute as they frankly acknowledge for the express purpose of get as much money as possible at every election from the candidate they bring in the member of the club be under a oath and bond of # 500 not to divulge the secret of the club and to be bind by the majority on every election a committee of five person be nominate by the club to treat with the candidate for as much money as they could get and in pursuance of this system when on the death of sir stephen cornish one of the member for the borough five candidate offer themselves to supply the vacancy this committee of five open negotiation with they all the offer of the rival purchaser be liberal enough one -lrb- general smith -rrb- propose to buy the entire club in the lump for # 3000 add a promise to build 600 ton of shipping in the town a second -lrb- a mr rumbold -rrb- be willing to give every freeman # 35 and he offer be accept by the committee who however caution he that no freeman be entitle to the money who be not a member of the christian club he willingly agree to this limitation of he expenditure and both he and the club regard the matter as settle he pay every freeman who belong to the club he stipulate bribe and on the polling day they tender eighty-seven vote in he favor the entire constituency be something under one hundred and fifty the general find he # 3000 decline do not go to the poll but a mr purling and mr jame do the latter polling only four vote the former only thirty-seven what bribe mr purl have give be never reveal but by some means or other he have contrived to render himself the most acceptable of all the candidate to mr robert the return officer robert have himself be a member of the christian club but have quarrel with it and on the day of the election as rumbold 's voter come up he administer to each of they the oath against bribery they take it without scruple but he take it on himself to pronounce seventy-six of they disqualify and to refuse they vote and have thus reduce mr rumbold 's voter to eleven he return mr purling as duly elect mr rumbold not unnaturally petition against such a return when mr robert admit the fact allege against he but plead that he have act under the advice of counsel who have assure he that it be within he own discretion to admit or to refuse any vote that might be tender and that he might lawfully refuse any which in he own mind he think illegal it be a striking proof of the laxity which prevail on every quarter in electioneer practice that the house to a great extent admit he justification or excuse as valid by a strange stretch of lenity they give he credit for a honest intention and contented themselves with order he to be reprimand by the speaker but the case of the bribe freeman and of the borough generally be too gross to be screen by any party all agree that the borough must be regard as incurably corrupt and deserving of heavy punishment the attorney-general be order to prosecute the five member of the managing committee for a illegal and corrupt conspiracy and a bill be bring in to disfranchise and declare forever incapable of vote at any election eighty-one freeman who have be prove to have receive bribe and to punish the borough itself by extend the right of voting at future election to all the freeholder in the rape of bramber the district of sussex in which new shoreham lie a arrangement which reduce the borough itself to comparative insignificance mr fox oppose the bill on the ground that the offence commit could be sufficiently punish by the ordinary court of law but he stand alone in he resistance the bill be pass and a salutary precedent be establish the penalty inflict on new shoreham be for many year regard as the most proper punishment for all borough in which similar practice be prove to prevail and it might have continue to be think so have corruption be confine to the smaller borough but there be no doubt that in many large town corruption be equally prevalent and inveterate while there be also many county in which the cost of a contest be by far too large to be account for by any legitimate cause of expenditure and consequently as time wear on severer measure be consider necessary some borough be deprive of the right of election altogether in other whose population or constituency be too numerous to make they permanent disfranchisement advisable the writ be suspend for a time that its suspension might serve both as a punishment and as a warn a practice which be still not unfrequently adopt but no plan could be devise for deal with the evil in county till what seem hopeless to achieve by direct legislation be in a great degree effect by the indirect operation of the reform bill of 1832 the shorten of the duration of a election which be henceforth conclude in a single day and the multiplication of polling place which render it impossible to ascertain the progress of the different candidate till the close of the poll be provision have a inevitable and most salutary effect in diminish alike the temptation to bribe on the part of the candidate and the opportunity of enhance the value of he vote by the elector the vast increase of newspaper by diffuse political education and stimulate political discussion have have perhaps a still greater influence in the same direction and as bribery could only be bring to bear on

perception and distinctness of explanation that we may be excuse for quote it at length : the notion that the responsibility of he adviser impair the monarch 's dignity and importance be a complete mistake here we have no law of ministerial responsibility for the simple reason that we have no write constitution but this responsibility flow as a logical necessity from the dignity of the crown and of the sovereign ` the king can do no wrong ' say the legal axiom and hence it follow that somebody must be responsible for he measure if these be contrary to law or injurious to the country 's welfare minister here be not responsible _ qu _ minister that be _ qu _ official -lrb- as such they be responsible to the crown -rrb- but they be responsible to parliament and the people or the country as ` adviser of the crown ' any one of they may advise the crown and whoever do so be responsible to the country for the advice he have give the so-called accountability of minister to parliament do not arise out of a abstract principle of responsibility but out of the practical necessity which they be under of obtain the consent of parliament to legislation and the voting of tax and as a essential to this end of secure its confidence in practice minister be liable to account for the way and manner in which they have administer the law which they conjointly with the parliament have make and for the way they have expend the money that have be vote for definite object they be bind to furnish explanation to justify they proceedings to satisfy reasonable scruple and the answer ` we have as dutiful subject obey the sovereign ' will not be accept ` have you act upon conviction or have you not ' be the question ` if you have not then you be civil servant of the crown who counsel and do what you consider wrong or unjust with a view to retain you snug place or to win the favor of the sovereign ' and this be so parliament withdraw its confidence from they herein too lie that ministerial power of which sovereign be so much afraid they can say ` we will not do this or that which the sovereign wish because we can not be responsible for it ' but why should a sovereign see anything here to be afraid of to he it be in truth the best of safeguard a really loyal servant should do nothing for which he be not prepare to answer even though he master desire it this practical responsibility be of the utmost advantage to the sovereign make independence not subservience the essential of service and you compel the minister to keep he soul free toward the sovereign you ennoble he advice you make he staunch and patriotic while time-server the submissive instrument of a monarch 's extreme wish and command may lead and often have lead he to destruction but to revert to the law of responsibility this ought not to be in effect a safeguard for law itself as such it be superfluous in this country where law reign and where it would never occur to any one that this could be otherwise but upon the continent it be of the highest importance as where the government be a outgrowth of a relation of supremacy and subordination between sovereign and subject and the servant train in idea natural to this relation do not know which to obey the law of the sovereign the existence of such a law would deprive he of the excuse which should he offend the law and so be guilty of a crime be ready to he hand in the phrase ` the sovereign order it so i have merely obey ' while it would be a protection to the sovereign that he servant if guilty of a crime should not be

prosecution of wilke be not the only act of mr grenville 's administration which excite both the parliament and the people in 1764 the king be attack by a serious illness and as the prince of wale be a infant scarcely two year old it be manifestly necessary to make arrangement for a regency in the event of the throne become vacant while the heir be still a minor a similar necessity have arise in the precede reign on the death of the present king 's father and a bill have accordingly be introduce by mr pelham the minister of the day which in the event of the reign sovereign die during the minority of the boy who have now become the immediate heir to the throne vest both the guardianship of he person and the regency of the kingdom in he mother the princess dowager of wale who however in the latter capacity be only to act with the advice of a council compose of she brother-in-law the duke of cumberland and nine principal officer of state it be not conceal by either the king or the duke that they would have prefer a different arrangement one which would have confer a uncontrolled regency on the duke himself but the bill be pass by great majority in both house and serve in some respects as a model for that which be now to be bring forward the difference be that the regent be not to be expressly name in it to quote the word of the royal speech the king propose to the consideration of the two house whether under the present circumstance it would not be expedient to vest in he the power of appoint from time to time by instrument in write under he sign-manual either the queen or any other member of the royal family usually reside in great britain to be the guardian of the person of he successor and the regent of these kingdom until such successor should attain the age of eighteen year subject to such restriction and regulation as be specify and contain in a act pass on a similar occasion in the fourteenth year of the late king the regent so appoint to be assist by a council compose of the several person who by reason of they dignity and office be constitute member of the council establish by that act together with those whom the parliament might think proper to leave to he nomination it may be doubt whether such a power as he majesty desire be quite consistent with the principle of the constitution parliament have indeed grant henry viii the still greater power of nominate a series of successor but the appointment which he consequently make by will be eventually supersede when on the failure of he immediate descendant the representative of he elder sister whom he have pass over be seat on the throne to the exclusion of the descendant of he younger sister to whom he have give the preference in france the last two king loui xiii and xiv have both when on they death-bed assume the right of make the arrangement for the regency which would become necessary the heir to the throne be in each case a minor but in each instance the arrangement which they have make be disregard however on the present occasion the minister -lrb- who must be take to have frame the king 's speech -rrb- and the parliament agree in the propriety of confer the nomination of the regent on the king himself -lrb- 16 -rrb- and the bill might have pass almost without notice have it not be for a strange display of the prime-minister 's ill-temper and mismanagement mr grenville be at all time uncourtly and dictatorial in he manner even to the king himself he be also of a suspicious disposition and though he be universally believe to have owe he promotion to he present office to the recommendation of lord bute -lrb- 17 -rrb- he be extremely jealous of he predecessor he profess to believe and probably do believe that the king be still greatly under lord bute 's influence -lrb- though in fact they have never meet since that minister have quit the treasury -rrb- that lord bute be still as closely connect with the princess of wale as scandal have formerly report he to be and that george iii under the pressure of they combined influence would be induce to name he mother rather than he wife as the future regent and he be so entirely sway by this ridiculous and wholly groundless fear that when the bill to give effect to the royal recommendation be introduce into the house of lord he instigate one of he friend to raise the question who be include in the general term the royal family which lord halifax as secretary of state answer by say that he regard it as mean those only who be in order of succession to the throne such a definition would have exclude the queen as effectually as the princess dowager and when mr grenville find the peer reluctant to accept this view -lrb- which indeed he own lord chancellor pronounce untenable -rrb- he then send another of he colleague to represent to the king that he mother be so unpopular that even if the lord should pass the bill in such a form as render she eligible for nomination the common would introduce a clause to exclude she by name with great unwillingness and it be say not without tear george iii consent to the bill be so draw as to exclude she and it pass the lord in such a form but when it reach the common it be find that if the leader of the opposition hate bute much they hate grenville more they move the insertion of the name of the princess dowager as one of the member of the royal family whom the king might nominate regent if it should please he even grenville have not the boldness publicly to disparage he royal master 's royal mother the princess 's name be insert by a unanimous vote in the list of those from whom the king be empower to select the regent and the amendment be gladly accept by the house of lord -lrb- 18 -rrb- in spite however of the unanimity of the two house on the question it will probably be think that the author of the amendment by which it be propose to address the king with a entreaty to name in the bill the person to whom he desire to intrust the regency act more in the spirit of the constitution than those who be contented that the name should be omit indeed that statesman of the present century agree in hold that a arrangement of such importance should be make by the house of parliament in concurrence with the sovereign and not by the sovereign alone be show by the step take to provide for a regency in the event of the demise of the reign sovereign while the heir be a minor in the last and in the present reign the second bill -lrb- that of 1840 -rrb- be in this respect of the greater authority since lord melbourne the prime-minister do not propose it without previously secure the approval of the duke of wellington in he character of leader of the opposition we pass over for a moment the administration of lord rockingham as we have already pass over the taxation of we north american colony by mr grenville because it will be more convenient to take all the transaction relate to that subject together when we arrive at the time when the trouble arise out of the policy of the different administration toward those colony be bring to a head by the break out of civil war lord rockingham 's ministry which succeed mr grenville 's have as be well know but a brief existence and be replace by the cabinet so whimsically compose by mr pitt who reserve to himself the office of privy seal with the earldom of chatham the duke of grafton be the nominal head of the treasury but the direction of affair be wholly in the hand of the new earl till the failure of he health compel he temporary retirement from public life lord chatham be brother-in-law to mr grenville to whom in the occasional arrogance and arbitrariness of he disposition he bear some resemblance and one of the earliest act of he administration when couple with the language which he hold on the subject in the house of lord display that side of he character in a very conspicuous light the summer of 1766 have be unusually wet and cold both at home and abroad and the harvest have in consequence be so deficient as to cause a very general apprehension of scarcity while rumor be spread that the high price which the shortness of the crop could not fail to produce be artificially raise by the selfish covetousness of some of the principal corn-dealer who be buy up all the grain which come into the market and store it with the object of make a exorbitant profit out of the necessity of the consumer not only at home but abroad the poorer class see themselves as they believe threaten with famine rise in riotous crowd in some place attack the barn in which the corn be store and threatening destruction to both the storehouse and the owner the ministry first try to repress the discontent by the issue of a proclamation against forestaller and regrater frame in the language and spirit of the middle age and when that prove ineffectual to restore confidence they issue a order in council absolutely prohibit the exportation of any kind of grain and authorize the detention of any vessel lie in any british harbor which might be load with such a cargo we annals furnish no instance of such a embargo have be lay on any article of commerce in time of peace but the crisis be difficult the danger to the tranquillity of the kingdom be great and undeniable the necessity for instant action seem urgent and probably few would have be incline to cavil at lord chatham 's assertion that the embargo be a act of power which during the recess of parliament be justifiable on the ground of necessity have the ministry at once call parliament together to sanction the measure by a act of indemnity but lord chatham be at all time incline to carry matter with a high hand and willingly adopt the opinion advance by the chancellor -lrb- lord northington -rrb- that the measure be strictly legal and that no indemnity be necessary lord northington 's language on the subject lord campbell describe as exhibit he characteristic rashness and recklessness which seem to be aggravate by age and experience -lrb- 19 -rrb- and the censure do not seem too severe since he presently go so far as to maintain that the crown have a right to interfere even against a positive act of parliament and that proof of the necessity amount to a legal justification but however ill-considered he language may have be lord chatham adopt it and act on it so far as to decline call the parliament together before the appoint time though when the house do meet he allow general conway as secretary of state to introduce a bill of indemnity in the house of common it be warmly oppose in that house partly on the ground that if such a measure as the embargo have be necessary it would have be easy to have assemble parliament before the order in council be issue -lrb- for in fact the proclamation against forestaller and regrater have be issue on the 10th of September when parliament if not farther prorogue would have meet within a week -rrb- but on that same day parliament be farther prorogue from the 16th of September till the 11th of November -lrb- 20 -rrb- and it be not till after that prorogation on the 24th of September that the order in council be issue in the house of lord it seem to have be admit that the embargo be under all the circumstance not only desirable but indispensably necessary -lrb- 21 -rrb- but the opposition in that house be lead by a great lawyer -lrb- chief-justice lord mansfield -rrb- take a wider view of the whole case and after denounce the long prorogation of parliament as have be so culpably advise that there be no way leave of meet the emergency but by a interposition of the royal power direct the principal weight of they argument against the doctrine of the existence of any dispense power it be urge that the late order in council could only be justify by the general proposition that of any and if of any of every act of parliament the king with the advice of the privy council may suspend the execution and effect whenever he majesty so advise judge it necessary for the immediate safety of the people and this proposition be denounce as utterly inconsistent with the principle of the revolution which have be nothing but a most lawless and wicked invasion of the rights of the crown if such a dispense power be really one of the lawful prerogative of the sovereign reference be make to the power in more than one instance and especially in the case of ship-money claim and exercise by charle i and it be affirm that the dispense and suspend power and that of raise money without the consent of parliament be precisely alike and stand on the very same ground they be bear twin they live together and together be bury in the same grave at the revolution past all power of resurrection it be even argue that the dispensing or suspend power be yet more dangerous than that of raise money without a parliamentary vote since it be a power which might do the most mischief and with the greatest speed so many be the subject which it include it would be a return to the maxim of the idolator of prerogative as understand in those earlier day that be of absolute and arbitrary power _ a deo rex a rege lex _ it be farther argue that unless it could be say that the moment parliament break up the king stand in its place and that the continuance of act be consign into he hand he can not of right suspend any more than he can make law both act require the same power the law be above the king and the crown as well as the subject be bind by it as much during the recess as in the session of parliament and therefore the wisdom of the constitution have exclude every discretion in the crown over a positive statute and have emancipate parliament from the royal prerogative leave the power of suspension which be but another name for a temporary repeal to reside where the legislative power be lodge -- that be in king lord and common who together constitute the only supreme authority of this government precedent be cite to prove that in former time different ministry have avoid thus take the law into they own hand as when in 1709 and again in 1756 there be a similar apprehension of scarcity even though both those year be year of war and the bill of rights be quote as the statute in which every sort of dispense power be condemn though as exercise by jame ii it have only be exert in dispense with penal law and remit penalty finally say one speaker who perhaps be lord mansfield himself he be not a moderate minister who would rashly decide in favor of prerogative in a question where the rights of parliament be involve nor a prudent minister who even in a doubtful case commit the prerogative by a wanton experiment to what degree the people will bear the extent of it the opposite course be that by which a minister would consult the best interest of the crown as well as of the people the safety of the crown as well as the security of the subject require the close up of every avenue that can lead to tyranny -lrb- 22 -rrb- these argument prevail and the indemnity bill be pass to quote the word of the annual register -- at that time write by burke -- very much to the satisfaction of the public and that it should have be so accept be creditable to the good-sense of both party the precedent which be thus establish do indeed seem to rest on a principle indispensable to the proper working of a constitutional government in so extensive a empire as ours it be scarcely possible that sudden emergency require the instant application of some remedy should not at time arise and unless parliament be sit at the time such can only be adequately deal with if the minister of the crown have the courage to take such step as be necessary whether by the suspension of a law or by any other expedient on they own responsibility trust in they ability to satisfy the parliament instantly convoke to receive they explanation of the necessity or wisdom of they proceedings and in the candor of the parliament to recognize if not the judiciousness of they action at all event the good faith in which it have be take and the honest patriotic intention which have dictate it the establishment of the obligation instantly to submit the question to the judgment of parliament will hardly be deny to be a sufficient safeguard against the ministerial abuse of such a power and the instance in which such a power have since be exercise couple with the sanction of such exercise by parliament be a practical approval and ratification by subsequent parliament of the course that be now adopt -lrb- 23 -rrb- the next year a not very creditable job of the ministry lead to the enactment of a statute of great importance to all holder of property which have ever belong to the crown in the twenty-first year of jame i a bill have be pass give a secure tenure of they estate to all grantee of crown land whose possession of they have last sixty year the house have desire to make the enactment extend to all future as well as to all previous grant but to this jame have refuse to consent and tell the house that beggar must not be chooser he have compel they to content themselves with a retrospective statute since he time and especially in the reign of charle ii and william iii the crown have be more lavish and unscrupulous than at any former period in grant away its land and estate to favorite and no one have be so largely enrich by its prodigality as the most grasp of william 's dutch follower bentinck the founder of the english house of portland among the estate which he have obtain from he royal master 's favor be one which go by the name of the honor of penrith subsequent administration have augment the dignity and importance of he family they earldom have be exchange for a dukedom but the exist duke be a opponent of the present ministry who to punish he suggest to sir jame lowther a baronet of ancient family and of large property in the north of england the idea of apply to the crown for a grant of the forest of inglewood and of the manor of carlisle which hitherto have be hold by portland as belong to the honor of penrith but which not have be expressly mention in the original grant by william iii it be now say have be regard as include in the honor only by mistake it be not deny that portland have enjoy the ownership of these land for upward of seventy year without dispute and have the statute of jame be one of continual operation it would have be impossible to deprive he of they but as matter stand the lord of the treasury willingly listen to the application of sir jame lowther they even refuse permission to the duke to examine the original deed and the other document in the office of the surveyor on which he profess to rely for the establishment of he right and they grant to sir jame the land he pray for at a rent which could only be regard as nominal the injustice of the proceeding be so flagrant that in the beginning of 1768 sir george savile bring in a bill to prevent any repetition of such a act by make the statute of jame i perpetual so that for the future a possession for sixty year should confer a indisputable and indefeasible title the minister oppose it with great vehemence even take some credit to themselves for they moderation in not require from the duke a repayment of the proceeds of the land in question for the seventy year during which he have hold they but the case be so bad that they could only defeat sir george savile by a side-wind and a scanty majority carry a amendment to defer any decision of the matter till the next session sir george however be not discourage he renew he motion in 1769 when it be carry by a large majority with a additional clause extend its operation to the colony in north america and thus in respect of its territorial rights the crown be place on the same footing as any private individual and the same length of tenure which enable a possessor to hold a property against another subject henceforth equally enable he to hold it against the crown the policy not less than the justice of such a enactment might have be think to commend it to every thinking man as soon as the heat engender by a party debate have pass away it have merely place the sovereign and the subject on the same footing in respect of the security which prescription give to possession and it might therefore have be think that the vote of 1769 have settle the point in every case since what be the law between one private individual and another and between the sovereign and a subject might well have be take to be of universal application but the ministry be strangely unwilling to recognize such a universal character in the late act and find in the peculiar character of ecclesiastical body and ecclesiastical property a pretext for weaken the force of the late enactment by deny the applicability of the principle to the claim of ecclesiastical chapter in 1772 mr henry seymor one of the member for huntingdon move for leave to bring in a bill which he describe as one for quiet the subject of the realm against the dormant claim of the church or in other word for put the church on the same footing with respect to property which have pass out of its possession as the crown have be place in by the act of 1769 he contend that such a bill ought to be pass not only on the general principle that possessor who derive they property from one source ought not to be less secure than they who derive it from another but also on the grounds that as ecclesiastical body occasionally use they power length of possession which fortify and strengthen legal right and just title in every other case do in this alone render they more weak and uncertain from the difficulty which often occur in find documentary proof of very ancient title and that this be not a imaginary danger since a member of the house then present have recently lose # 120000 by a bishop revive a claim to a estate after the gentleman 's family have be in undisturbed possession of it above a hundred year the defense of the church however be take up by mr skinner attorney-general for the duchy of lancaster who argue that though in the case of the crown the _ nullum tempus _ which it have formerly claim and which have be put a end to in 1769 be a engine in the hand of the strong to oppress the weak the _ nullum tempus _ of the church be a defense to the weak against the strong as its best if not its sole security against the encroachment of the laity the parliamentary history record that in the course of a long debate lord north oppose the bring in of the bill as do the lord-advocate of scotland who give as a reason in favor of the bill though he vote against it that a law of similar nature have pass in scotland and that the whole kingdom clergy as well as laity find the very best effect from it -lrb- 24 -rrb- burke argue in favor of the bill with great force declare that in so do he do not mean anything against the church she dignity she honor she privilege or she possession he should wish even to enlarge they all but this bill be to take nothing from she but the power of make herself odious but the ministerial majority be too well discipline to be break and mr seymor could not even obtain leave to bring in the bill the year 1772 be mark by the discussion of a measure which the king seem to have regard as one of private interest only affect he personal rights over he own family but it be impossible to regard transaction which may affect the right of succession to the throne as matter of only private interest and indeed the bill be treat as one involve a constitutional question by both side of both house and as such be discuss with remarkable earnestness and with vehemence equalling that of any other debate which have as yet take place since the commencement of the reign the bill have its origin in the personal feeling of the king himself who have be greatly annoy at the conduct of he brother the duke of cumberland in marry a widow of the name of horton daughter of lord irnham and sister of the colonel luttrell whom the vote of the house of common have seat as member for middlesex and perhaps still more at the discovery that he other brother the duke of gloucester to whom he be greatly attach have marry another subject the widow lady waldegrave he majesty 's dissatisfaction be perhaps heighten by the recollection that he himself in early manhood have also be strongly attract by the charm of another subject and have sacrifice he own inclination to the combined consideration of pride of birth and the interest of he kingdom and though there be a manifest difference between the importance of the marriage of the sovereign himself and that of prince who be never likely to become sovereign he think it not unreasonable that he should be empower to exercise such a general guardianship over the entire family of which he be the head as might enable he to control its member in such arrangement by make he formal sanction indispensable to the validity of any matrimonial alliance which they might desire to contract a somewhat similar question have be raise in 1717 when george i have quarrel with the prince of wale -lrb- afterward george ii -rrb- assert a claim to control and direct the education of all the prince 's child and when they should be of marriageable age to arrange they marriage the prince on the other hand insist on he natural and inalienable right as they father to have the entire government of he own offspring a right which as he contend no royal prerogative could be enable or permit to override that question be not however bring before parliament to which at that time the king could probably not have trust for any leaning in he favor but he refer it in a informal way to the lord chancellor -lrb- lord cowper -rrb- and the common-law judge they investigate it with great minuteness a number of precedent be adduce for the marriage and education of the member of the royal family be regulate by the sovereign beginning with henry iii who give he daughter joan without she own consent in marriage to the king of scotland and come down to the preceding century at the commencement of which the council of jame i commit the lady arabellum stuart and mr seymor to the tower for contract a secret marriage without the king 's permission and at the end of which king william exercise the right of select a tutor for the duke of gloucester the son of the princess anne without any consultation with the princess herself and finally the judge with only two dissent voice express they conviction that the king be entitle to the prerogative which he claim the case do not however seem to have be regularly argue before they there be no trace of they have be assist in they deliberation by counsel on either side and they extra-judicial opinion be clearly destitute of any formal authority -lrb- 25 -rrb- so that it come before parliament in some degree as a new question but george iii be not of a disposition to allow such matter to remain in doubt and in compliance with he desire a bill be in 1772 introduce by lord rochfort as secretary of state which propose to enact that no descendant of the late king be child or grandchild and presumptive heir of the sovereign male or female other than the issue of princess who might be marry into foreign family should be capable of contract a valid marriage without the previous consent of the reign sovereign signify under he sign-manual and that any marriage contract without such consent should be null and void the king or the minister apparently doubt whether parliament could be prevail on to make such a prohibition life-long and therefore a clause be add which provide that if any prince or princess above the age of twenty-five year should determine to contract a marriage without such consent of the sovereign he or she might do so on give twelve month ' notice to the privy council and such marriage should be good and valid unless before the expiration of the twelve month both house of parliament should declare they disapproval of the marriage the conclude clause of the bill make it felony to presume to solemnize or to assist or to be present at the celebration of any such marriage without such consent be first obtain the bill be stoutly resist in both house at every stage both on the ground of usage and of general principle it be positively deny that the sovereign 's right of approve of all marriage in the royal family which be assert in the preamble of the bill be either found in law or establish by precedent or warrant by the opinion of the judge and it be contend that there never have be a time when the possession of royal rank have be consider necessary to qualify any one to become consort of a english prince or princess it have not even be regard as a necessary qualification for a queen three of the wife of henry viii have be english subject wholly unconnected with the royal family nor have the parliament nor the people in general complain of any one of those marriage moreover two of he child who have in they turn succeed to the crown have be the offspring of two of those wife and in the last century jame ii while duke of york have marry the daughter of a english gentleman and though it have not be without notorious reluctance that he royal brother have sanction that connection it be well know that charle ii himself have propose to marry the niece of cardinal mazarin in the house of peer lord camden especially object to the clause annul a marriage between person of full age and in the common mr dowdeswell who have be chancellor of the exchequer in lord rockingham 's administration dwelt with especial vigor on the unreasonableness of the clause which fix twenty-five as the age before which no prince or princess could marry without the king 's consent law positive law he argue and not the arbitrary will of a individual should be the only restraint man who be by law allow at twenty-one -lrb- 26 -rrb- to be fit for govern the realm may well be suppose capable of choose and govern a wife -lrb- 27 -rrb- lord folkestone condemn with great earnestness the expression in the preamble that the bill be dictate by the royal concern for the honor and dignity of the crown as imply a doctrine that a alliance of a subject with a branch of the royal family be dishonorable to the crown -- a doctrine which he denounce as a oblique insult to the whole people and which as such the representative of the people be bind to oppose and he also object to the vindicatory part as he term the clause which declare those who might assist or even be present at a marriage contract without the royal permission guilty of felony -lrb- 28 -rrb- the ministry however have a decide majority in both house and the bill become and remain the law of the land though fourteen peer include one bishop enter a protest against it on nine different grounds one of which condemn it as a extension of the royal prerogative for which the great majority of the judge find no authority while another with something of prophetic sagacity urge that the bill be pregnant with civil discord and confusion and have a natural tendency to produce a dispute title to the crown it may be doubt whether the circumstance which have induce george iii to demand such a power as that with which the bill invest he justify its enactment he be already the father of a family so numerous as to render it highly improbable that either of he brother or any of they child would ever come to the throne while as a previously exist law bar any prince or princess who might marry a roman catholic from the succession the additional restraint impose by the new statute practically limit they choice to a inconveniently small number of foreign royal house many of which to say the least be not superior in importance or purity of blood to many of we own noble nor can it be say to have be successful in accomplish he majesty 's object it be notorious that two of he son and very generally believe that one of he daughter married subject the prince of wale have choose a wife who be not only inferior in rank and social position to lady waldegrave or mr horton but be moreover a roman catholic and that another of he son petition more than once for permission to marry a english heiress of ancient family and we present sovereign may be think to have pronounce she opinion that the act go too far when she give one of she younger daughter in marriage to a nobleman who however high in rank have no royal blood in he vein the political inconvenience which might arise from the circumstance of the reign sovereign be connect by near and intimate relationship with a family of he british subject will probably always be think to render it desirable that some restriction should be place on the marriage of the heir-apparent but where the sovereign be bless with a numerous offspring there seem no sufficient reason for send the younger branch of the royal house to seek wife or husband in foreign country and as the precedent set in the case of the princess louise have be generally approve it be probable that in similar circumstance it may be follow and that such occasional relaxation of the act of 1772 will be regard as justified by and consistent with the requirement of public policy as well as by the law of nature -lrb- 29 -rrb- generally speak the two house agree in they support of the ministerial policy both at home and abroad but in spite of this political harmony a certain degree of bad feeling exist between they which on one occasion lead to a somewhat singular scene in the house of common the common imputed its origin to the discourtesy of the lord who when member of the common be order by they house to carry its bill up to the peer sometimes keep they wait three hour in the lobby among they lordship ' footman before they admit they burke affirm that this have happen to himself and that he speak of it not out of any personal pride nor as a indignity to himself but as a flagrant disgrace to the house of common which he apprehend be not inferior in rank to any other branch of the legislature but co-ordinate with they and the irritation which such treatment excited lead the common perhaps not very unnaturally to seek some opportunity to vindicate they dignity they find it in a amendment which the lord make on a corn bill in the middle of April 1772 resolution have be pass by the common in a committee of the whole house impose certain duty on the importation of wheat -lrb- 30 -rrb- and other grain when they be at a certain price which be fix at 48 and grant bounty on exportation when the price fall below 44 the lord make several amendment on the bill and among other one to strike out the clause which grant bounty but when the bill thus amend come back to the common even those who dislike the principle of bounty resent this act of the lord in meddle with that question which they regard as a violation of they peculiar and most cherish privilege the exclusive right of deal with question of taxation governor pownall who have charge of the bill declare that the lord have forget they duty when they interfere in raise money by the insertion of a clause that no bounty should be pay upon export corn and on this ground he move the rejection of the bill -lrb- 31 -rrb- in the last chapter of this volume a more fitting occasion for examine the rights and usage of the house of lord with respect to money-bill will be furnish by a series of resolution on the subject move by the prime-minister of the day it be sufficient here to say that the power of rejection be manifestly so different from that of originate grant -- which be admit to belong exclusively to the common -- and that there be so many precedent for the lord have exert this power of rejection in the course of the preceding century that they probably never conceive that in so do now they be commit any encroachment on the constitutional rights and privilege of the lower house but on this occasion the ill-feeling previously exist between the two house may be think to have predispose the common to seek opportunity for a quarrel and there never be a case in which both party in the house be more unanimous governor pownall call the rejection of the clause by the lord a flagrant encroachment upon the privilege of the house and affirm that the lord have forget they duty burke term it a proof that the lord do not understand the principle of the constitution a invasion of a known and avowed right inherent in the house as the representative of the people and express a hope that they be not yet so infamous and abandon as to relinquish this essential right or to submit to the annihilation of all they authority other call it a affront which the house be bind to resent and the more imperatively in consequence of the absence of a good understanding between the two house and the speaker sir john cust go beyond all he brother member in violence declare that he would do he part in the business and toss the bill over the table the bill be reject _ nem con _ and the speaker toss it over the table several of the member on both side of the question kick it as they go out -lrb- 32 -rrb- and to such a pitch of exasperation have they work themselves up that the game bill in which the lord have make alteration be serve in a similar manner though those alteration only refer to the penalty to be impose for violation of the game-law and could by no stretch of ingenuity be connect with any question of taxation note : -lrb-

lord to make any amendment on it and he recommend that the consideration of they amendment should be postpone for three month and in the mean time a new bill frame accord to the lord ' amendment should be pass the recommendation be approve by mr pitt as leader of the opposition and approve and act on by mr fox as leader of the ministry in that house but at the same time mr fox fully admit the

but in its progress it eventually involve we in a foreign war of great magnitude and thus become the one subject of supreme interest to every statesman in europe england have not bear she share in the seven year ' war without a considerable augmentation of the national debt and a corresponding increase in the amount of yearly revenue which it have become necessary to raise -lrb- 33 -rrb- and mr

of the colony in north america he propose to make they bear a share in the burden cause by enterprise from which they have profit accordingly in march 1764 he propose a series of resolution impose a variety of import duty on different article of foreign produce import into the british colony and plantation in america and also export duty on a few article of american growth when export or convey to any other place except to great britain another resolution affirm that toward defray the say expense it might be proper to charge certain stamp-duty in the say colony and plantation the resolution impose import and export duty be pass by both house almost without comment that relate to a stamp-duty he do not press at the moment announce that he postpone it for a year in order to ascertain in what light it would be regard by the colonist themselves and as most if not all of the colony have a resident agent in london he call they together explain to they the object and anticipated result of the new imposition -lrb- for such he admit it to be -rrb- and request they to communicate he view to they constituent add a offer that if they should prefer any other tax likely to be equally productive he should be desirous to consult they wish in the matter he probably regard such language on he part as a somewhat superfluous exercise of courtesy or conciliation so entire be he conviction of the omnipotence of parliament and of the impossibility of any loyal man or body of man call its power in question but he be greatly deceive he message be receive in america with universal dissatisfaction of the thirteen state which make up the body of colony there be scarcely one whose assembly do not present a petition against the propose measure and against any other which might be consider as a alternative grenville however be not a man to be move by petition or remonstrance he be rather one whom opposition of any kind harden in he purpose and as no substitute have be suggest at the opening of the session of 1765 he propose a series of resolution requisite to give effect to the vote of the previous year and impose certain stamp-duty and other duty on the settlement in america perhaps think to render he disregard of the objection which have be make less unpalatable by the insertion of word bind the government to apply the sum to be thus raise to the expense of defend protect and secure the colony themselves the resolution be pass as the parliamentary history record almost without debate on the 6th of march -lrb- 34 -rrb- but the intelligence be receive in every part of the colony with a indignant dissatisfaction which astonish even they own agent in england -lrb- 35 -rrb- formidable riot break out in several province in massachusett the man who have be

by the assembly of the different state to convene a general congress at new york in the autumn to organize a resistance to the tax and to take the general state of affair into consideration before however that time come a series of event have no connection with these transaction have lead to a change of ministry in england and the new cabinet be less inclined to carry matter with a high hand indeed even the boldest statesman could hardly have learn the state of feeling which have be excite in america without apprehension and those who have the chief weight in the new administration be not man to imperil the state by a insistance on abstract theory of right and prerogative accordingly when after lord rockingham have become prime-minister parliament meet in December 1765 the royal speech recommend the state of affair in america to the consideration of parliament -lrb- a recommendation which manifestly imply a disposition on the part of the king 's adviser to induce the house of common to retrace its step -rrb- papers be lay before parliament and witness from america be examine and among they a man who have already win a high reputation by he scientific acquirement but who have not be previously prominent as a politician dr benjamin franklin he have come over to england as agent for pennsylvanium and he examination as preserve in the parliamentary history may be take as a complete statement of the matter in dispute from the american point of view and of the justification which the colonist conceive themselves to have for refuse to submit to pay such a tax as have now be impose upon they at a later day he be one of the most zealous as he be probably one of the earliest advocate of separation from england but as yet neither he language nor he action afford any trace of such a feeling he affirm -lrb- 36 -rrb- the general temper of the colonist toward great britain to have be till this act be pass the best in the world they consider themselves as a part of the british empire and as have one common interest with it they do not consider themselves as foreigner they be jealous for the honor and prosperity of this nation and always be and always would be ready to support it as far as they little power go they consider the parliament of great britain as the great bulwark and security of they liberty and privilege and always speak of it with the utmost respect and veneration they have give a practical proof of they goodwill by have raise clothed and pay during the last war nearly 25000 man and spend many million nor have any assembly of any colony ever refuse duly to support the government by proper allowance from time to time to public officer they have always be ready and be ready now to tax themselves the colony have assembly of they own which be they parliament they be in that respect in the same situation as ireland they assembly have a right to levy money on the subject then to grant to the crown and indeed have constantly do so and he himself be specially instruct by the assembly of he own state to assure the ministry that as they always have do so they should always think it they duty to grant such aid to the crown as be suitable to they circumstance and ability whenever call upon for the purpose in a constitutional manner and that instruction he have communicate to the ministry but the colony object to parliament lay on they such a tax as that impose by the stamp act some duty they admit the parliament have a right to impose but he draw a distinction between those duty which be mean to regulate commerce and internal tax the authority of parliament to regulate commerce have never be dispute by the colonist the sea belong to britain she maintain by she fleet the safety of navigation on it she keep it clear of pirate she might therefore have a natural and equitable right to some toll or duty on merchandise carry through that part of she dominion toward defray the expense she be at in ship to maintain the safety of that carriage but the case of imposition of internal tax be wholly different from this the colonist hold that by the charter which at different time have be grant to the different state they be entitle to all the privilege and liberty of englishman they find in the great charter and the petition and declaration of right that one of the privilege of english subject be that they be not to be tax but by they common consent and these rights and privilege have be confirm by the charter which at different time have be grant to the different state in reply to a question put to he he allow that in the pennsylvanium charter there be a clause by which the king grant that he would levy no tax on the inhabitant unless it be with the consent of the colonial assembly or by a act of parliament word which certainly seem to reserve a right of taxation to the british parliament but he also demonstrate that in point of fact the latter part of the clause have never be act on and the colonist have therefore rely on it from the first settlement of the province that the parliament never would nor could by the color of that clause in the charter assume a right of tax they till it have qualify itself to exercise such right by admit representative from the people to be tax and in addition to objection on principle he urge some that he regard as of great force as to the working of this particular tax impose by the stamp act it be not a equal tax as the greater part of the revenue derive from it must arise from lawsuit for the recovery of debt and be pay by the lower sort of people it be a heavy tax on the poor and a tax on they for be poor in the back settlement where the population be very thin the inhabitant would often be unable to get stamp without take a long journey for the purpose the scarcity of specie too in the country would cause the pressure to be feel with great severity as in he opinion there be not gold and silver enough in the colony to pay the stamp-duty for a single year in reply to another question whether the colonist would be satisfy with a repeal of the stamp act without a formal renunciation of the abstract right of parliament to impose it he reply that he believe they would be satisfy he think the resolution of right would give they very little concern if they be never attempt to be carry into practice the colony would probably consider themselves in the same situation in that respect as ireland they know that the english parliament claim the same right with regard to ireland but that it never exercise it and they might believe that they would never exercise it in the colony any more than in ireland indeed they would think that it never could exercise such a right till representative from the colony should be admit into parliament and that whenever a occasion arise to make parliament regard the taxation of the colony as indispensable representative would be order this last question put to the witness like several other in the course of he examination have be frame with the express purpose of elicit a answer to justify the determination on the subject to which lord rockingham and he colleague have come it could not be deny that the government be place in a situation of extreme difficulty -- difficulty create in part by the conduct of the colonist themselves that as even they most uncompromising advocate mr pitt admit have be imprudent and intemperate though it be the imprudence of man who have be drive to madness by injustice on the one hand to repeal a act the opposition to which have be mark by fierce riot such as those of boston and even in the assembly of some of the state by language scarcely short of treason -lrb- 37 -rrb- seem a concession to intimidation scarcely compatible with the maintenance of the dignity of the crown or the legitimate authority of parliament on the other hand to persist in the retention of a tax which the whole population affect by it be evidently determine to resist to the uttermost be to incur the still greater danger of rebellion and civil war in this dilemma the minister resolve on a course calculate as they conceive to avoid both evil by combine a satisfaction of the complaint of the colonist with a assertion of the absolute supremacy of the british crown and parliament for every purpose and on February 24 1766 the secretary of state bring in a bill which after declare in its first clause that the king 's majesty by and with the consent of the lord spiritual and temporal and common of great britain in parliament assemble have have and of right ought to have full power and authority to make law and statute of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonist and people of america subject of the crown of great britain in all case whatsoever proceed to repeal the stamp act give a strong proof of the sincerity of the desire to conciliate the colonist by the unusual step of fix the second reading of the bill for the next day but in its different clause it encounter a twofold opposition which he have probably not anticipate it be unnecessary to notice that which rest solely on the inexpediency of repeal the stamp act the compulsory enforcement of which be require by the honor and dignity of the kingdom but the first clause be even more strenuously resist on grounds which its opponent affirm to rest on the fundamental principle of the constitution it be urge in the house of common by mr pitt that as the colony be not represent in parliament great britain have no legal right nor power to lay a tax upon they -- that taxation be no part of the govern or legislative power tax say the great orator be the voluntary gift and grant of the common alone in legislation the three estate of the realm be alike concerned but the concurrence of the peer and the crown to a tax be only necessary to clothe it with the form of a law the gift and grant be in the common alone the distinction between legislation and taxation be essentially necessary to liberty mr pitt have no claim to be consider as a great authority in the principle of constitutional law george ii slight as be he political knowledge or wisdom complain on one occasion of the ignorance of a secretary of state who have never read vattel and in this very debate he even boast of he ignorance of law-case and act of parliament but he coadjutor in the house of lord -lrb- lord camden at this time chief-justice of the common plea -rrb- owe the chief part of the respect in which he be hold to he suppose excellence as a constitutional lawyer and he fully endorse and expand pitt 's argument when the bill come up to the house of lord he affirm that he speak as the defender of the law and the constitution that as the affair be of the greatest consequence and in its consequence might involve the fate of kingdom he have take the strictest review of he argument he have examine and re-examine all he authority and that he search have more and more convinced he that the british parliament have no right to tax the american the stamp act be absolutely illegal contrary to the fundamental law of nature contrary to the fundamental law of this constitution -- a constitution govern on the eternal and immutable law of nature the doctrine which he be assert be not new it be as old as the constitution it grow up with it indeed it be its support taxation and representation be inseparably unite god have join they no british government can put they asunder to endeavor to do so be to stab we very vitals and he object to the first clause -lrb- that which declare the power and right to tax -rrb- on the ground that if the minister wantonly press this declaration although they be now repeal the stamp act they might pass it again in a month he even argue that they must have future taxation in view or they would hardly assert they right to enjoy the pleasure of offer a insult he be answer by lord northington -lrb- the chancellor -rrb- and by lord mansfield -lrb- the chief-justice -rrb- both of whom support the motion to repeal the tax but who also agree in deny the soundness of he doctrine that as far as the power be concern there be any distinction between a law to tax and a law for any other purpose and lord mansfield farther deny the validity of the argument which it have be attempt to find on the circumstance that the colony be not represent in parliament propound on the contrary what lord campbell call he doctrine of virtual representation there can say he be no doubt but that the inhabitant of the colony be represent in parliament as the greatest part of the people of england be represent among nine million of whom there be eight who have no vote in elect member of parliament every objection therefore to the dependency of the colony upon parliament which arise upon the ground of representation go to the whole present constitution of great britain for what purpose then be argument draw from a distinction in which there be no real difference of a virtual and a actual representation a member of parliament choose for any borough represent not only the constituent and inhabitant of that particular place but he represent the inhabitant of every other borough in great britain he represent the city of london and all the other common of the land and the inhabitant of all the colony and dominion of great britain and be in duty and conscience bind to take care of they interest lord mansfield 's doctrine of a virtual representation of the colony must be admit to be overstrain the analogy between the case of colonist in a country from no part of which representative be send to parliament and that of a borough or county where some class of the population which may in a sense be regard as spokesman or agent of the rest form a constituency and return member must be allow to fail yet the last sentence of this extract be worth preserve as lay down the important constitutional principle subsequently expand and enforce with irresistible learning and power of argument by burke that a member of the house of common be not a delegate bind under all circumstance to follow the opinion or submit to the dictation of he constituent but that from the moment of he election he be a councillor of the whole kingdom bind to exercise a independent judgment for the interest of the whole people rather than to guide himself by the capricious or partial judgment of a small section of it but in its more immediate object -- that of establish the two principle that the constitution know of no limitation to the authority of parliament and of no distinction between the power of taxation and that of any other kind of legislation -- lord mansfield 's speech be now universally admit to have be unanswerable -lrb- 38 -rrb- the abstract right be unquestionably on the side of the minister and the parliament who have impose the tax but he be not worthy of the name of statesman who conceive absolute rights and metaphysical distinction to be the proper foundation for measure of government and pay no regard to custom to precedent to the habit and feeling of the people to be govern who disregard the old and most true adage _ summum jus summa injurium _ omit to take into he calculation the expediency of he action when legislating for a nation which he be in the daily habit of weigh in he private affair the art or science of government be phrase in common use but they would be void of mean if all that be requisite be to ascertain the strict right or power and then unswervingly to act upon it in all its rigor and therefore while it must be admit that the character of the power vest in king lord and common assemble in parliament be unlimited and illimitable and that the legal competency to enact a statute depend in no degree whatever on the wisdom or folly the justice or wickedness of the statute the advice give to a constitutional sovereign by he adviser must be guide by other consideration to quote by anticipation the language address to the common on this subject by burke eight year afterward the proper policy be to leave the american as they anciently stand to be content to bind america by law of trade parliament have always do it and this should be the reason for bind they trade not to burden they by tax parliament be not use to do so from the beginning and this should be the reason for not tax these be the argument of state and kingdom -lrb- 39 -rrb- the ministry be strong enough to carry they resolution through both house they measure be divide into two act one know as the declaratory act assert the absolute and universal authority of parliament the other repeal the stamp act of the preceding year and both be pass without alteration though the lord divide against they on both the second and third reading of the bill for repeal found on they -lrb- 40 -rrb- some of they enter long protest in the journal of the house the right to tax be assert but the tax itself be repeal and franklin 's estimate of the feeling on the subject entertain by he countryman be fully verify by the reception which the intelligence meet with in the colony to quote the description of lord stanhope : in america the repeal of the stamp act be receive with universal joy and acclamation firework and festival celebrate the good news while address and thanks to the king be vote by all the assembly the word of the declaratory act indeed give the american slight concern they fully believe that no practical grievance could arise from it they look upon it merely as a salve to the wounded pride of england as only that ` bridge of gold ' which accord to the old french say should always be allow to a retreat assailant -lrb- 41 -rrb- a recent writer however have condemn the addition of the declaration of the abstract right to tax with great vehemence nothing say lord campbell -lrb- 42 -rrb- could exceed the folly of accompany the repeal of the stamp act with the statutable declaration of the abstract right to tax but it do not seem difficult to justify the conduct of the ministry in this particular for besides the great weight deservedly attach to franklin 's assurance that the declaration would not be object to by the colonist and besides the consideration that on a general view it be desirable if not indispensable to impress on all class of subject whether at home or abroad the constitutional doctrine of the omnipotence of parliament the line of argument adopt by mr pitt and lord camden in deny that omnipotence leave the minister no alternative but that of assert it unless they be prepare to betray they trust as guardian of the constitution forbearance to insist on the declaratory act could not fail to have be regard as a acquiescence on they part in a doctrine which lord campbell in the same breath admit to be false it may be add as a consideration of no small practical weight that without such a declaratory act the king would have be very reluctant to consent to the other and more important repeal act and on the whole the conduct of the ministry may we think be regard as the wisest settlement both of the law and of the practice it assert the law in a manner which offend no one and it make a precedent for place the spirit of statesmanship above the letter of the law and for forbear to put forth in its full strength the prerogative whose character be not fully understand by those who might be affect by they and also could plead that parliament itself have contribute to lead they to misunderstand it by its own conduct in never before exert it for the moment then contentment and tranquillity be restore in the colony unhappily they be not last the same year which see the triumph of the rockingham administration in the repeal of the stamp act witness also its fall before a discreditable intrigue and the ministry which succeed it have not be a year in office before the new chancellor of the exchequer charle townsend revive the discontent in america which lord rockingham have appease it can not be say however that the blame should all belong to he or that the rockingham party in the house of common be entirely free from a share in it they be -- not unnaturally perhaps -- greatly irritated at the intrigue by which lord chatham have supersede they and be not disincline to throw difficulty in the way of they successor for which the event of the next year afford more than one opportunity lord chatham as have be mention be universally recognize as the chief of the new ministry though he abstain from take the usual office of first lord of the treasury and contented himself with the privy seal but he have construct it of such discordant element -lrb- 43 -rrb- that no influence but he own could preserve consistency in its act or harmony among its member as nothing but he name could give it consideration either in parliament or in the country in the first month of the next year 1767 he be attack with a illness which for a time disabled he from attend the cabinet be apparently the forerunner of that more serious malady which before the end of the summer compel he long retirement from public life and the opposition take advantage of the state of disorganization and weakness which he illness cause among he colleague to defeat they on the budget in the house of common by a amendment to reduce the land-tax which cause a deficiency in the supplies of half a million this deficiency it of course become necessary to meet by some fresh tax and townsend -- who though endowed with great richness of eloquence be of a imprudent not to say rash temper and be possess of too thorough a confidence in he own ingenuity and fertility of resource ever to be incline to take into consideration any objection to which he scheme might be liable -- propose to raise a portion of the money which be need by tax on glass paper tea and one or two other article to be pay as import duty in the american colony he colleague and especially the duke of grafton himself the first lord of the treasury and as such the nominal prime-minister have be also as secretary of state a member of lord rockingham 's ministry which have repeal the former tax do not consent to the measure without great and avowed reluctance but yield they own judgment to the strong feeling in its favor which notoriously exist in the house of common -lrb- 44 -rrb- indeed that house pass the clause impose these import duty without hesitation be probably influence in no small degree by the evidence give in the preceding year by dr franklin who as have be already see have explain that the colonist draw a distinction between what he call internal tax and import duty intend to regulate commerce and that to the latter class they be not incline to object and a second consideration be that these new duty be accompany and counterbalance by a reduction of some other tax so that the ministry contend that the effect of these financial measure take altogether would be to lower to the colonist the price of the article affect by they rather than to raise it but one of the resolution adopt provide that the whole of the money to be raise from these tax should not be spend in america but that after make provision for certain colonial object specify the residue of such duty should be pay into the receipt of he majesty 's exchequer and there reserve to be from time to time disposed of by parliament toward defray the necessary expense of defend protect and secure the say colony and plantation and this clause seem to have be understand as design to provide means for augment the number of regular troops to be maintain in the colony whose employment in the recent disturbance have make they more unpopular than formerly -lrb- 45 -rrb- at all event the intelligence of these new tax though only import duty find the colonist in a humor to resist any addition of any kind to they financial burden the event of the last two year have teach they they strength it be undeniable that the repeal of the stamp act have be extort by the riot in boston and other place and the success of this system of intimidation could not fail to encourage its repetition accordingly the news of this fresh attempt at taxation be meet by a unanimous determination to resist it newspaper writer and pamphleteer denounce not only the duty but the ministry which impose they petition from almost every state be send over to england address to the king and to the parliament but the violent temper of the leader of the populace be not content to wait for answer to they association be at once form in boston and one or two other city where resolution be adopt in the spirit of retaliation -lrb- as they framer avow -rrb- to desist from the importation of any article of british commerce and to rely for the future on american manufacture the principal custom-house officer at boston be badly beaten and other be compel to seek refuge in a man-of-war which happen to be in the harbor it would be painful and at the present day useless to trace the step by which these local disturbance gradually grow into one general insurrection the spirit of resistance be undoubtedly fan by a party which from the first contemplate a total separation from england as its ultimate result -lrb- 46 -rrb- if indeed they have not conceive the design even before grenville have give the first provocation to discontent but the colonist be not without advocate in england even among the member of the government the duke of grafton while he remain prime-minister be eager to withdraw all the duty of which they complain but he be overrule by the majority of he colleague he prevail however so far that lord hillsborough the secretary of state be authorize to write a circular-letter to the governor of the different province in which he disown in the most distinct language possible a design to propose to parliament to lay any farther tax upon america for the purpose of raise a revenue and promise for the next session a repeal of all the tax except that on tea and when the duke retire from the treasury and be succeed by lord north that statesman himself bring forward the promise repeal in a elaborate speech -lrb- 47 -rrb- in which he explain that the duty on tea which he alone propose to retain have be originally a boon to the american rather than a injury as be accompany by the removal of a far heavier tax but he admit that even that consideration be not the one which influence he in he opinion that that duty should be maintain so greatly be the perception that the real object of those who complain of it be not the redress of a grievance but the extinction of a right which be a essential part of the control supremacy of england the fact that the right to tax have be deny make it a positive duty on the part of the english minister to exert that right to temporize would be to yield and the authority of the mother country if now unsupported would be relinquish forever and he avow he idea of the policy proper to be pursue to be to retain the right of tax america but to give it every relief that might be consistent with the welfare of the mother country he carry he resolution though the minority -- which on this occasion be lead by mr pownall who have himself be governor of massachusett and who move a amendment to include tea in the list of tax propose to be repeal -- be stronger than usual -lrb- 48 -rrb- but the concession fail to conciliate a single colonist it have become as burke say four year afterward a matter of feeling -lrb- 49 -rrb- and the irritation feed on itself till in 1773 a fresh act empower the east indium company to export tea to the colony direct from they own warehouse without its be subject to any duty in england -- which lord north undoubtedly intend as a boon to the colonist -- only increase the exasperation the ship which bring the tea to boston be board and seize by a formidable body of rioter disguise as native savage and the tea be throw into the sea the intelligence be receive in england with very different feeling by the different party in the state the minister conceive themselves force to assert the dignity of the crown and propose bill to inflict severe punishment on both the city of boston and the whole province of massachusett the opposition insist on remove the cause of these disturbance by a total repeal of the tea-duty the minister prevail by a far larger majority than before but he success only increase the exasperation in the colony and it be a evil omen for peace that the leader of the resistance begin to search the record of the english long parliament for the revolutionary precedent and form of the puritan of that day -lrb- 50 -rrb- the next year see fresh attempt to procure the repeal of the obnoxious tax reject by the house of common but before the news of this division reach america blood have already be shed -lrb- 51 -rrb- civil war begin the next year the colony now unite in one solid body assert they independence take the title of the united state and though the government at home make more than one effort to recall the colonist to they allegiance and send out commissioner of high rank with large power of concession and though in one remarkable instance the mission of mr penn in the summer of 1775 with the petition to the king know as the olive branch seem to show a desire for a maintenance of the union on the part of the colonial congress -lrb- 52 -rrb- from the moment that the sword be draw all hope of preserve the connection of the colony must have be see by all reasonable man to be at a end it be beside we present purpose to recapitulate the military operation of the war though they verify another of burke 's warning that suppose all moral difficulty to be get over the ocean remain -- that could not be dry up and as long as it continue in its present bed so long all the cause which weaken authority by distance must continue in fact distance from england be one of the main circumstance which decide the contest the slowness of communication -- almost inconceivable to the present generation -- render impossible that regularity in the transport of re-enforcement and supplies which be indispensable to success and add to the strange absence of military skill show by every one of the british general soon place the eventual issue of the war beyond a doubt but one measure by which lord north 's government endeavor to provide for the strengthening of the army employ in america be so warmly challenge on constitutional grounds that though the fortunate separation of hanover from great britain have prevent the possibility of any recurrence of such a proceed it would be improper to pass it over in he speech at the opening of the autumnal session of 1775 the king announce to the house that in order to leave a larger portion of the established force of the kingdom available for service in north america he have send a part of he electoral troops to the garrison of gibraltar and port mahon and the announcement arouse a vehement spirit of opposition which find vent in the debate of both house on the address and in two substantive motion condemn the measure as a violation of the constitution as establish by the bill of rights and the act of settlement it be strenuously maintain that both these statute forbid the raise or keep on foot a standing army in the kingdom in time of peace and also the introduction of foreign troops into this kingdom without the previous consent of parliament on any pretence whatever and that the fact that gibraltar and minorca be detach from these island do not exclude they from the character of form a part of the british dominion and on these grounds lord shelburne who support lord rockingham on a amendment to the address do not hesitate to denounce this employment of the hanoverian regiment as fundamentally infringe the first principle of we government and to declare it high-treason against the constitution he ask if there be a settle plan to subdue the liberty of this country what surer means could be adopt than those of arm roman catholic and introduce foreign troops -lrb- 53 -rrb- and compare the measure under discussion to the case of the dutch regiment of william iii which the parliament wisely refuse to allow he to retain in the house of common the opposition be lead by sir jame lowther and governor johnstone the latter of whom appeal to the clause in the act of settlement which enact that no person bear of other than english parent should enjoy any office or place of trust civil or military within the kingdom and argue that to employ foreign officer in the protection of a british fortress be to place they in a office of great military trust the discussion bring to light strange division and weakness in the ministry the ministerial lawyer differ on the grounds on which they rely the attorney-general thurlow deny that the expression this kingdom in the bill of rights include the foreign dependency of the crown -lrb- 54 -rrb- -lrb- a narrowing of its force which the chancellor lord bathurst wholly repudiate -rrb- while the argument on which he himself insist most strongly that the existence of rebellion in america put end to all condition which suppose the kingdom to be at peace could not obtain the support of any one of he colleague but a plea urge by a independent member lord denbigh be regard by some of the speaker with greater favor he contention be that neither the bill of rights nor the act of settlement have be violate since both those great statute must be interpret with reference to the time at which they be frame and to the recent act of jame ii and william iii the recurrence of which they have be design to prevent act to which the present proceeding bear no resemblance a stronger justification however might have be find in very recent precedent in 1745 the minister have bring over six thousand dutch troops to re-enforce the army of the duke of cumberland and they act have be subsequently approve by parliament and in 1756 at the commencement of the seven year ' war when the loss of minorca have lead to such a distrust of we fleet that a french invasion be very generally apprehend both house present address to george ii beg he to bring over some hanoverian regiment and in the course of the next year other address to thank he for compliance with they entreaty look at the strict law of the question few lawyer doubt that the expression this kingdom in the bill of rights include the entire dominion of the crown or that that great statute be undoubtedly intend to protect the privilege of all they inhabitant whether within the four sea or in foreign settlement but it also seem that the clause against raise and keep on foot a standing army without the consent of parliament be not more violate by keep a mixed garrison in gibraltar and port mahon than garrison consist of native soldier only and undoubtedly the keep of a armed force in both these fortress have be sanction by parliament nor could the colonel of a foreign regiment in garrison under the command of a british governor be fairly say to be in a office of great military trust so far therefore the charge against the ministry may be think to have fail but the accusation of have transgress the clause which prohibit the introduction of foreign troops into this kingdom without the previous consent of parliament on any pretence whatever must on the other hand be regard as prove and indeed lord north himself may be take to have show some consciousness that it be so since he justify he conduct in omit to procure that previous consent by the necessity of the case by the plea that as parliament be in vacation the time which would have be consume in wait for its sanction would have neutralize the advantage desire from the employment of the hanoverian since the regiment which they be to replace at gibraltar and port mahon could not after such delay have reach america in time to be of service and since he also consent eventually to ask parliament for a act of indemnity the preamble of which affirm the existence of doubt as to the legality of the step which have be take and the fate of this act afford a still more striking proof of the division in the ministry since after lord north himself have propose it in the house of common and it have be pass there by a large majority it be reject in the house of lord where he own colleague lord gower lord suffolk and lord weymouth speak and vote against it as needless because in they judgment no doubt of the state of the law on the subject could exist from a statesman-like point of view the employment of the hanoverian seem abundantly defensible if force be still to be employ to bring back the colonist to they obedience the circumstance of they be subject of we sovereign in he other character of elector of hanover clearly distinguish it from the hiring of the hessian and brunswick mercenary which have be deservedly condemn and as the entire number fall short of two thousand -lrb- 55 -rrb- lord shelburne 's expression of fear for the liberty and religion of englishman be a absurd exaggeration moreover the warm approval which less than twenty year before parliament have give to the introduction of a far larger body of the same troops into england itself justify the anticipation that a similar sanction would now be cheerfully give that sanction -- which indeed might have be think to be invite by the announcement of the measure in the king 's speech -- be undoubtedly requisite and if it be a bill of indemnity for have act without it be equally necessary but as have be see in the last chapter for a administration on urgent occasion to take action on its own responsibility and then to apply for indemnity be a course in strict harmony with the practice of the constitution and if in this instance the minister be in any respect blamable they error would seem to have be limit to they abstain from instantly call parliament together to sanction they act and be contented to wait for the ordinary time of the house meet the war therefore go on the assertion of they independence by the colony divide and so far weaken the advocate of they cause in parliament one section of whom lead by lord chatham regard any diminution of we dominion as not only treasonable but ruinous on the other hand it procure they the alliance of france and spain but it can not be say that either of these incident produce any practical effect on the result of the war lord chatham 's refusal to contemplate they independence could not retard its establishment and the alliance of france and spain which bring nothing but disaster to those country could not accelerate it by a single moment for nearly six year the war continue with alternation of success the victory gain by the british arm be the more numerous the triumph of the american be incomparably the more important involve as they do the surrender of two entire army the latter of which that of lord cornwalli in 1781 do in fact terminate the war and with the war the existence of the ministry which have conduct it a singularly rapid succession of new administration ensue -- so rapid that the negotiation for peace which the first that of lord rockingham open be not formally complete till the third -lrb- 56 -rrb- know as the coalition ministry be on the point of dismissal it would be beside we purpose to enter into the detail of the treaty which constitute the united state as they be now call a nation by we formal recognition of they independence even in that recognition which be the most important article of the treaty no constitutional principle be involve though it afford the only instance in we history which can seem to throw a doubt on we inheritance of that capacity for government which the roman poet claim as in ancient time the peculiar attribute of he own countryman it present the only instance of a loss of territory people by man who come of we blood and who still speak we language it be a stern and severe lesson and yet fraught with discredit and disaster as it be it nevertheless bear fruit in a later age which we may be excuse for regard as a example of the generally predominate influence of sober practical sense in we countryman when not lead away by the temporary excitement of passion as show in we capacity to take home to ourselves and profit by the teaching of experience the loss of the american colony be cause by the submission of the parliament and nation to man of theory rather than of practice ideologist as napoleon call they doctrinaire to use the modern expression man who because parliament have a abstract right of universal legislation regard it as a full justification for insist on its exercise without give a think to the feeling or prejudice or habit of those who might be affect by they measure abstractedly consider lord chatham and lord camden be undoubtedly wrong in deny the power of parliament to tax the colony but there be better judgment in they counsel though found on false premise than in those of grenville and townsend though theirs be the more correct view of the constitutional power of legislation the two peer be wrong in they principle the two chancellor of the exchequer be unwise in they application of they principle and the practical error be the more disastrous one it be now generally admit that the true statesman-like course toward the colony be that adopt by lord rockingham and he colleague in 1765 -- to avoid weaken the supreme power of parliament by any disavowal of the right to tax but to avoid imperil the sovereign authority of the king by a novel exertion of it as much of we common english law be make up of precedent so in a still greater degree be we feeling and idea of we rights and privilege regulate by precedent and we lose america because in 1764 and 1767 neither minister nor parliament take man 's feeling and prejudice into account the loss of the united state therefore be a lesson not undeserved and by we statesman since that day it have be take in the right spirit of profit by its teaching as a guide to they own conduct since that day the enterprise of we people have plant we flag in region far more distant and have extend the dominion of we sovereign over province far more extensive than those which we then lose and on some of the administration of the present reign the duty have fall of frame scheme of government for those new acquisition as also for some of those previously possess in how different a spirit from that which actuate the early minister of george iii -lrb- 57 -rrb- those to whom the task be commit by queen victorium apply themselves to they task may be see in a maxim lay down by the present lord gray when he preside at the colonial office -lrb- 1846-1852 -rrb- that the success of free institution in any country depend far less upon the particular form of those institution than upon the character of the people on whom they be confer but how he and other in the same office carry out that principle must be reserve for a later chapter besides the numerous motion which be bring forward by the opposition respect the continuance and conduct of the war there be several also which be indirectly prompt by it the opposition claim to be on this subject not only the champion of the real interest of the nation but also its spokesman who express the opinion and feeling of all the thinking and independent portion of the people that they effort be overborne they attribute to the subservience of the parliament to the minister and of the minister to the crown -lrb- 58 -rrb- and consequently several motion be make by member of that party the object of which be in one way or another to diminish what they regard as the undue influence of the crown in one instance and that the most successful a direct denunciation of that influence be employ but the earlier and more frequent proposal be direct to the purification of the house of common and to the strengthening of its independence it be remarkable that of these the two which related to a subject of which the common be usually most especially and most rightly jealous the interference of peer in election have the worst fortune in 1780 complaint be make and substantiate that the duke of bolton and the duke of chando -lrb- who be also lord-lieutenant of the county -rrb- have exert themselves actively in the last election for hampshire and in support of motion that these peer have be guilty of a breach of the privilege of the house and a infringement of the liberty and privilege of the common of great britain a case be adduce in which queen anne have dismiss the bishop of worcester from the office of almoner for similar interference nor do lord nugent a relative of the duke of chando deny the fact allege on the contrary he avow they and adopt a line of defense which many must have think a aggravation of the charge since it assert that to prevent such interference be impossible and therefore the house would but waste its time in try however on this occasion the house take the view which he thus suggest to it postpone all farther consideration of the matter for four month and the charge the duke of bolton be shelve in a somewhat similar manner even have these peer and such practice be censure with the very greatest severity the censure could have have but a very limited effect but it be on measure of a wider scope embrace what begin to be call a reform of parliament that the more zealous member of the opposition place they chief reliance as far as we record of the debate can be trust lord chatham ten year before have give the first hint of the desirableness of some alteration of the exist system on one occasion he denounce the small borough as the rotten part of the constitution thus originate the epithet by which they in time come to be generally describe but more usually he disavow all idea of disfranchise they propound rather a scheme for diminish they importance by a large addition to the county member however he never take any step to carry out he view think perhaps that it be not in the upper house that such a subject should be first broach but he have not be long in the grave when a formal motion for a reform of a different kind be bring forward by one of the member for the city of london alderman sawbridge -lrb- 59 -rrb- who in may 1780 apply for leave to bring in a bill for shorten the duration of parliament he own preference he avow to be for annual parliament but he suspicion that the house would think such a measure too sweeping have induce he to resolve to content himself with aim at triennial parliament as leave be refuse the bill propose to be introduce may perhaps be think disentitle to mention here be it not that the circumstance that proposal for shorten the duration of parliament be still occasionally bring forward seem to warrant a account of a few of the argument by which those who take the lead part in the debate which ensue resist it the minister lord north declare that the alderman have misunderstand the view of we ancestor on the subject as they desire have be not that parliament should be elect annually but that it should sit every year a end which have now be attain fox on the other hand while avow that hitherto he have always oppose similar motion declare he wish now to see not only triennial but annual parliament as the sole means of lessen the influence of the crown if any of he constituent be to ask he to what we present misfortune be ascribable he should say the first cause be the influence of the crown the second the influence of the crown and the third the influence of the crown but it be reply by burke who usually exhaust every question he take in hand that such a bill would rather tend to augment that influence since the crown by its constant stated power influence and revenue would be able to wear out all opposition at election that it would not abate the interest or inclination of minister to apply that interest to the elector on the contrary it would render it more necessary to they if they desire to have a majority in parliament to increase the means of that influence to redouble they diligence and to sharpen dexterity in the application the whole effect of the bill would therefore be to remove the application of some part of that influence from the elect to the elector and farther to strengthen and extend a court interest already great and powerful in borough it must greatly increase the cost of a seat in parliament and if contest be frequent to many they would become a matter of expense totally ruinous which no fortune could bear the expense of the last general election be estimate at # 1500000 and he remember well that several agent for borough say to candidate ` sir you election will cost you # 3000 if you be independent but if the ministry support you it may be do for # 2000 and even less ' and he adduce the case of ireland where formerly when a parliament sit for the king 's life the ordinary charge for a seat be # 1500 but now when it sit for eight year four session the charge be # 2500 and upward such a change as be propose would cause triennial corruption triennial drunkenness triennial idleness etc and invigorate personal hatred that would never be allow to soften it would even make the member himself more corrupt by increase he dependence on those who could best support he at election it would wreck the fortune of those who stand on they own private means it would make the elector more venal and injure the whole body of the people who whether they have vote or not be concern in election finally it would greatly impair the proper authority of the house itself it would deprive it of all power and dignity and a house of common without power and without dignity either in itself or its member be no house of common for this constitution the applicability of some of he argument -- those found on the disorder at time of election -- have be greatly diminish if not destroy at the present day by the limitation of the polling to a single day the disfranchisement of the smaller borough have neutralize other but the expense of a general election be not believe to have diminish and that alone seem a strong objection to a system which would render they more frequent than they be at present mr sawbridge could not obtain the support of a third of he hearer -lrb- 60 -rrb- but he notion have partisan in the other house who be not discourage by such a division and three week later the duke of richmond bring forward a reform bill on so large a scale that as the parliamentary history record it take he a hour and a half to read it and which contain provision for annual parliament and universal suffrage but he meet with even less favor than the alderman and he bill be reject without a division still the subject be not allow to rest even after lord north have be replace by lord rockingham the demand for parliamentary reform be continue the young mr pitt make himself the mouth-piece of the reformer and found a motion which he make in may 1782 on the corrupt influence of the crown a influence which have be point at in every period as the fertile source of all we misery a influence which have be substitute in the room of wisdom of activity of exertion and of success a influence which have grow up with we growth and strengthen with we strength but which unhappily have not diminish with we diminution nor decayed with we decay he bring forward no specific plan but denounce the close borough and ask emphatically whether it be representation for some decayed village almost destitute of population to send member to parliament under the control of the treasury or at the bidding of some great lord or commoner he however be defeat though by the small majority of twenty and it be remarkable that when the next year he revive the subject develop a more precise scheme -- akin to that which he father have suggest of increase the number of county member and include provision for the disfranchisement of borough which have be convict of systematic corruption -- he be beat by a far larger majority -lrb- 61 -rrb- the distinctness of he plan only serve to increase the number of he adversary a kinsman of pitt 's lord mahon make a equally futile attempt to diminish the expense of election partly by inflict very heavy penalty on party guilty of either give or receive bribe -lrb- 62 -rrb- and partly by prohibit candidate from provide conveyance for elector and more than one bill for disfranchise revenue-officer as be specially liable to pressure from the government and to prevent contractor from sit in parliament be bring forward but be lose the smallness of the division in they favor be not the least remarkable circumstance in the early history of reform it be make still more evident that as yet the zeal for reform be confine to a few when two year afterward pitt though now invest with all the power of a prime-minister be as unable as when in opposition to carry a reform bill which in more than one point foreshadow the measure of 1832 propose as it do the disfranchisement of thirty-six small borough which be to be purchase of they proprietor nearly on the principle adopt in the irish union act and on the other hand the enfranchisement of copyholder but it differ from lord gray 's act in that it distribute all the seat thus to be obtain among the county with the exception of a small addition to the representative of london and westminster however he supporter very little exceed the number who have divide with he in 1783 and lord north who lead the opposition in a speech denounce any change have a majority of seventy-four after this second defeat pitt abandon the question at all event for the time be convince to quote earl stanhope 's description of he opinion on the subject that nothing but the pressure of the strongest popular feeling such as do not then exist could induce many member to vote against they own tenure of parliament or in fact against themselves -lrb- 63 -rrb- what perhaps weigh with he more on decide to acquiesce in this vote as final be the perception that as yet the question excite no strong interest out-of-door and when a few year later some who seek to become leader of the people endeavor to raise a agitation on the subject they teaching be too deeply infected with the contagion of the french revolution to allow a wise ruler to think it consistent with he duty to meet they with anything but the most resolute discouragement but concurrently with the first of these motion for parliamentary reform two more direct attack on the royal influence and on what be allege to be the undue exertion of it be make in the session of 1780 the first be make by burke who bring forward a measure of economical reform demonstrate in a speech of extraordinary power a vast mass of abuse arise from corrupt waste in almost every department of the state and in every department of the royal household without exception and propose a most extensive plan of reform which deal with royal dignity such as the duchy of lancaster and the other principality annex to the crown with the crown-land a great portion of which he propose to sell with the office of the royal household a sufficient specimen of the abuse on which be furnish by the statement that the turnspit in the king 's kitchen be a member of parliament and with many department of state such as the board of work and the pay-office etc he be studiously cautious in he language urge indeed that he scheme of reform would extinguish secret corruption almost to the possibility of its existence and would destroy direct and visible influence equal to the office of at least fifty member of parliament but carefully guard against any expression impute this secret corruption this influence which it be so desirable to destroy to the crown but he supporter be less moderate and mr thoma townsend declare that fact which he mention contain the most unquestionable presumptive evidence of the influence of the crown he mean the divert of its revenue to purpose which dare not be avow in corrupt and influence the member of both house of parliament and he assert that the principle and object of the bill be the reduction of the influence of the crown the bill be not oppose by the minister on its principle but lord north even while consent to its introduction do not pledge himself not to oppose it in some or other of its subsequent stage and in fact he supporter resist it in almost every detail some of they utterly deny the right of the house to interfere at all with the expenditure of the civil list other contest the propriety of alienate the crown-land and a still greater number object to the abolition of some of the office which it be propose to sweep away such as that of the third secretary of state or secretary for the colony that of treasurer of the chamber and other of a similar character and as the minister succeed in defeat he on several though by no means all of these point burke at last give up the bill fox warn the house at the same time that it should be renew session after session and boast that even the scanty success which it have meet with have be worth the struggle the other direct attack be make by mr dunning who perhaps do not then foresee that he himself be destine soon to fill one of the office which have come under the lash of burke 's sarcasm and who a few day afterward in move that it be necessary to declare that the influence of the crown have increase be increase and ought to be diminish rest no small portion of he argument on the treatment that burke 's bill have receive he affirm that though lord north have declare that the influence of the crown be not too great the division on that bill and on many other measure which have be under discussion be irrefragable proof of the contrary he quote hume and judge blackstone as testify to the existence and steady increase of that influence and could affirm of he own knowledge and pledge he honor to the truth of the assertion that he know upward of fifty member in that house who always vote in the train of the noble lord in the blue ribbon -lrb- 64 -rrb- but who reprobate and condemn out of the house the measure they have support and vote for in it mr t pitt even instance the present possession of office by lord north as a indubitable proof of the enormous influence of the crown it be not strange that lord north oppose a resolution support by such argument with all the power of the government base he own opposition chiefly on the wisdom of maintain the rule long since establish by parliament never to vote abstract proposition but he presently see that he be in a minority and be force to be content with adopt and carry a amendment of mr dunda one of the member for edinburgh who flatter himself that by the insertion of _ now _ he convert a general assertion into a temporary declaration which might at a future time be disavow as no longer applicable a majority of eighteen -lrb- 65 -rrb- affirm the resolution and when the mover follow it up by a second declare that it be competent to this house to examine into and to correct abuse in the expenditure of the civil list revenue as well as in every other branch of the public revenue whenever it shall seem expedient to the wisdom of this house to do so though the minister with what be almost a appeal _ ad misericordiam _ implore the house not to proceed he do not venture to take a division and that resolution also with one or two other design to give instant effect to they be adopt and report by the committee to the house in a single evening -lrb- 66 -rrb- the first resolution do in fact embody a complaint or at least a assertion which the rockingham party have constantly make ever since the close of the marquis 's first administration in a speech which he have make only a few week before -lrb- 67 -rrb- lord rockingham himself have declare that it be early in the present reign promulgate as a court axiom that the power and influence of the crown alone be sufficient to support any set of man he majesty might think proper to call to he council and burke in he short account of he administration of 1765 have not only imputed both its formation and its dismissal to the express request and express command of they royal master but in the sentence they discountenance and it be to be hope forever abolish the dangerous and unconstitutional practice of remove military officer for they vote in parliament condemn with unmistakable plainness some act of the precede ministry which be universally understand to have be force upon it by the king himself general conway have be deprive of the colonelcy of he regiment lord rockingham himself with several other peer have be dismiss from lord-lieutenancy as a punishment for vote against the ministry such dismissal be a flagrant attempt to put down all freedom of debate in parliament which of all its privilege be the one most essential to its usefulness if not to its very existence but as burke say the practice have be abandon and the first resolution therefore as lord north say involve no practical result it be the second resolution that confer a constitutional character and importance on this debate and it be not too much to say that no vote of greater value have be come to for many year it might have be consider almost as the assertion of a truism include in the power of grant supplies to declare that the parliament have the right and authority to examine into and correct abuse in the expenditure if it have not be deny by more than one speaker on the ministerial side though not by the prime-minister himself but that denial make the assertion of the right a imperative duty for certainly the exclusive right of authorize a levy of money would lose half its value if unaccompanied by the other right of prevent the waste of the revenue thus raise it may likewise be say that another principle of the parliamentary constitution be by implication contain in mr dunning 's second resolution and that the word it be competent to this house to examine into and to correct abuse in the expenditure be mean to imply a denial of the competency of the other house to institute or even to share in such a examination even if that be the object of its framer it only coincide with the view of the peer themselves a very considerable majority -lrb- 68 -rrb- of whom have a few week before reject a motion make by lord shelburne for the appointment of a committee of member of both house to examine without delay into the public expenditure principally on the ground urge by the secretary of state lord stormont and by several other peer that to inquire into reform and control the public expenditure would be a improper interference with the privilege of the common the chief-justice lord mansfield even go the length of warn he brother peer that such interference might probably lead the common to dispute in they turn the power of judicature in the last resort exercise by the peer lord camden on the contrary affirm as a proposition which no noble lord present would deny that that house have a right to inquire so far as the disposal of public money come under they cognizance as a deliberative body and in the lower house itself burke in he speech in favor of he bill for economical reform go even farther than lord camden and blame the house of lord for reject lord shelburne 's motion on such a ground they have go he say farther in self-denial than the utmost jealousy of the common could have require a power of examine account of censure correct and punish the common have never that he know of thought of deny to the lord it be something more than a century ago that the common have vote the lord a useless body they have now vote themselves so and it would seem that the lord themselves to a certain extent retract this they self-denying vote when before the end of the same session they discuss burke 's bill for economical reform and pass it though it be a money-bill contain extraneous enactment and as such contravene one of they own standing order which have be pass in the beginning of queen anne 's reign when the system of tack as it be call have excite great discontent which be not confine to themselves the propriety of reject the bill on that ground be vigorously urge by the only two lawyer who take part in the debate the chancellor lord thurlow and lord loughborough whose object be avowedly thus to give a practical proof that the lord have not vote themselves useless but even those who disregard they advice fully assert the right of the peer to exercise they discretion as legislator we have notice this matter on a previous occasion the privilege claim by the common both as to its origin and its principle have be carefully examine by hallam who have point out that in its full exclusiveness it be not older than charle ii since the convention parliament of 1660 make several alteration in undoubted money-bill to which the common do not object -lrb- 69 -rrb- and though he attachment to whig principle might have incline he to take they part in any dispute on the subject he nevertheless think that they have strain both precedent and constitutional analogy in they assertion of this privilege which be a anomaly that can hardly rest on any other ground of defense than such a series of precedent as establish a constitutional usage the usage which for two century be establish in this case by the good-sense of both party clearly be that the lord could never originate a money-bill nor insert any clause in one increase or even alter the burden lay by one on the people but that they be within they right in absolutely reject one but such a right have a tendency to lapse through defect of exercise and we shall hereafter see that the disposition to make encroachment which in this matter hallam impute to the common have lead they in the present reign to carry they pretension to a height which at a former period have be practically ignore by the one house and formally disclaim by the other it may be remark that mr dunning 's success in carry he first resolution do in itself to a certain extent disprove the truth of that resolution since if the influence of the crown have be such as he represent it it must have be sufficient to insure its rejection but that resolution and a new statute of which in a previous session he have be one of the principal promoter be reckon by lord stanhope as among the chief cause of the disgraceful riot of 1780 in the summer of 1778 he have second and support with great eloquence the repeal of some of the penal statute against the roman catholic which have be pass in the reign of william iii it be the first blow at that system of religious intolerance which for nearly a century have be one of the lead principle as it have be also the chief disgrace of the constitution and it be pass with scarcely any opposition by both house as however the statute which it repeal have be enact before the scotch union the repeal do not extend to scotland and it be necessary therefore to bring in a separate measure for that kingdom but the intelligence that such a proceeding be in contemplation excited great wrath among the scotch presbyterian who in the hope of defeat it establish a protestant association for the defense of what they call the protestant interest and elect as its president lord george gordon a young nobleman whose act on more than one occasion give reason to doubt the soundness of he intellect against any relaxation whatever of the restriction on the roman catholic the association send up petition to the house and to the king couch in language the wildness of which be hardly consistent with the respect due to parliament or to the sovereign apparently in the hope of mitigate its opposition the house the next year pass a act similar in principle to relax some of the restriction still impose on protestant dissent minister by some of the subscription which be require of they but as in the reign of charle ii the presbyterian hatred of the roman catholic be too uncompromising to be appease in such a manner and when lord george find the house of common itself acknowledge the danger with which the constitution be threaten by the influence of the crown he see in they vote a justification for all he alarm since he have adopt as one of he most settle opinion the belief that george iii be himself a papist at heart and under the influence of this strange idea he draw up a petition to parliament which he invite all the member of the association to accompany he to present he summons be receive with enthusiasm by he follower the number who in obedience to it muster in st george 's field which he have appoint as the place of rendezvous be not reckon by any one at less than fifty thousand and some calculation even double that estimate whatever the number may originally have be it be speedily swell by the junction of large band of the worst character in the metropolis who soon begin to display they strength by every kind of outrage they commence by attack some of the roman catholic chapel which they burn and they audacity increase at the sight of they exploit they proceed to assault the house of different member of parliament who have vote for the measure which have offend they because the chief-justice lord mansfield have lately preside at a trial where a roman catholic have be acquit they sack and burn he house and try to murder himself the magistrate afraid of expose themselves to the fury of such a mob keep for the most part out of the way and though the troops have be put under arm and several regiment from the rural district have be bring up to london in haste the military officer be afraid to act without order leave to work they pleasure almost without resistance the rioter attack the different prison burnt newgate and release all the prisoner and make more than one attack on the bank of england where however fortunately the guard be strong enough to repel they but still no active measure be take to crush the riot the belief be general that the soldier might not act at all or at all event not fire on rioter till a hour after the riot act have be read and the mob have be warn to disperse and no magistrate could be find to brave its fury by read it there seem no obstacle to prevent the rioter from make themselves master of the whole capital have it not be for the firmness of the king himself who when all the proper authority fail show himself in fact as well as in name the chief magistrate of the kingdom -lrb- 70 -rrb- he summon a privy council and urge the member to adopt instant measure of repression and when some of the minister seem to waver he put the question himself to the attorney-general whether the interpretation put on the riot act which seem to he inconsistent with common-sense be justify by the law wedderburn unhesitatingly reply that it be not that if a mob be commit a felony as by burn dwelling-house and could not be prevent by other mean the military accord to the law of england might and ought to be immediately order to fire upon they the reading of the riot act be wholly unnecessary under such circumstance -lrb- 71 -rrb- the king insist on this opinion be instantly act on a proclamation be issue and order be send from the adjutant-general 's office that the soldier be to act at once without wait for direction from the civil magistrate a few hour now suffice to restore tranquillity the chief-justice in he place in the house of lord subsequently declare wedderburn 's opinion and the order give in reliance upon it to be in strict conformity with the common law lay down as the principle on which such a interpretation of the law rest the doctrine that in such a case the military be act not as soldier but as citizen no matter whether they coat be red or brown they be legally employ in preserve the law and the constitution -lrb- 72 -rrb- and wedderburn who before the end of the year become chief-justice of the common plea repeat the doctrine more elaborately in a charge from the bench it be a lesson of value to the whole community it be quite true that the constitution place the army in a state of dependence on the civil power but when that doctrine be so misunderstand as to be suppose to give temporary immunity to outrage it be most important that such a misconstruction should be correct and that it should be universally know that military discipline do not require the soldier to abstain from the performance of the duty incumbent on every citizen

gain this victory by unite with lord north and a portion of the tory party whom ever since he dismissal from office in 1774 he have be unwearied in denounce threatening lord north himself with impeachment and he now use it to compel the king to intrust the chief office in the government to the very man whom he majesty have refuse to employ in such a office six month before the transaction of the next twelve month exhibit in a striking light more than one part of the practical working of we monarchical and parliamentary constitution not only in its correspondence with but what be more important to notice in its occasional partial deviation from strict theory the theory have sometimes be express in the formulum the king reign but do not govern but like many another terse apophthegm it convey a idea which require some modification before it can be regard as a entirely correct representation of the fact and the king himself especially if endow with fair capacity and force of character imbue with earnest conviction and animated by a genuine zeal for the honor and welfare of he kingdom will be likely to dwell more on the possible modification than on the rigid theory even those who insist most on the letter of the theory will not deny that if the king have not actual power he have at least great influence and the line between authority and influence be hard to draw one of george the third 's earliest minister have explain to he majesty that the principle of the constitution be that the crown have a undoubted right to choose its minister and that it be the duty of subject to support they unless there be some very strong and urgent reason to the contrary -lrb- 78 -rrb- and such a doctrine be too much in harmony with the feeling of george iii himself not to be cordially accept for george iii be by no means incline to be a _ rous fainant _ no sovereign be ever penetrate with a more conscientious desire to do he duty to he people conscious perhaps that he capacity be rather solid than brilliant he give unremitting attention to the affair of the nation in every department of the government and perhaps not very unnaturally conceive that he do so justified he as far as he might be able in put a constraint on he minister to carry out he view thus he have notoriously induce lord north to persevere in the late civil war in america long after that minister have see the hopelessness of the contest and it be probably only the knowledge of the strength of he feeling on that subject and of he warm attachment to that minister that cause the parliament so long to withstand all the eloquence of the advocate of peace and the still stronger argument of circumstance he might fairly think that he have now greater reason to adhere to he own judgment for fox 's recommendation of the duke of portland in preference to lord shelburne be a act not only of unwarrantable presumption but of inconceivable folly since there be no comparison between the qualification of the two man and the coalition by which six month afterward he have as it be revenge himself for the rebuff and have drive lord shelburne from office be as the king well know and as even fox 's own friend do not conceal from themselves almost universally condemn out-of-door -lrb- 79 -rrb- to this combination therefore he majesty try every expedient to escape from yield and when pitt 's well-considered and judicious refusal of the government leave he no alternative but that of submission to fox 's dictation it would hardly have be very unnatural if he disposition and attitude toward a ministry which have thus force itself upon he have be those attribute to he by lord john russell of a enemy constantly on the watch against it -lrb- 80 -rrb- but for some time that be not the impression of the minister themselves in July when they have be in office more than three month fox admit that he have never behave toward they as if he be displeased with they and that he have no project of substitute any other administration for the present one -lrb- 81 -rrb- and he temperate treatment of they be the more remarkable because a flagrant blunder of burke -lrb- who fill the post of paymaster -rrb- in reinstate some clerk who have be dismiss by he predecessor for dishonesty have manifestly weaken the ministry in the house of common -lrb- 82 -rrb- while in another case in which the king have clearly in no slight degree a personal right to have he opinion consult and he wish accept by they as the guide for they conduct the establishment to be arrange for the prince of wale whose twenty-first birthday be approach fox persuade the parliament to settle on the young prince a allowance of so large a amount that some even of he own colleague dislike it as extravagant -lrb- 83 -rrb- while the king himself reasonably disapprove both of the amount and of the mode of give it the amount be large beyond all precedent and the fact of its be give by parliament render the prince entirely independent of he parental control of which he conduct have give abundant proof that he stand greatly in need that he presently change he line of behavior toward they be cause by they introduction of a bill which he regard as aim in no small degree at he own prerogative and independence -- the celebrated indium bill by which in the November session fox propose to abrogate all the charter which different sovereign have grant to the east indium company to abolish all vested rights of either the company or individual and to confer on a board of seven person to be name by parliament the entire administration of all the territory in any way occupy by the company it be at once object to by the opposition in the house of common now lead by mr pitt as a measure thoroughly unconstitutional on the twofold ground that such a abrogation of formally grant charter and such a extinction of vested rights be absolutely without precedent and also that one real if conceal object of the bill be to confer on the minister who have frame and introduce it so vast a amount of patronage as would render they absolute master of the house of common and indirectly therefore of the king himself who would be practically disabled from ever dismiss they that such a revocation of ancient charter and such a immovable establishment of a administration be inconsistent with the principle of the constitution be not a position take up by pitt in the heat of debate but be he deliberate opinion as may be fairly infer from he assertion of it in a private letter -lrb- 84 -rrb- to he friend the duke of rutland it may however be doubt whether the epithet unconstitutional could be properly apply to the bill on either ground there be indeed a certain vagueness in the meaning or at all event in the frequent use of this adjective sometimes it be use to imply a violation of the provision of the great charter or of its later development the bill of rights sometimes to impute some imagine departure from the principle which guide the framer of those enactment but in neither sense do it seem applicable to this bill to designate the infringement or revocation of a charter by such a description would be to affirm the existence of a right in the sovereign to invest a charter from whatever motive it may originally have be grant with such a character of inviolability or perpetuity that no parliament should on ever such strong grounds of public good have the power of interfere with it and to attribute such a power to the crown appear less consistent with the limitation affix to the royal prerogative by the constitution than to regard all trust create by the crown as subject to parliamentary revision in the interest of the entire nation on the second ground the description seem even less applicable a arrangement of patronage be a mere matter of detail not of principle for the minister to propose such a arrangement as should secure for himself and he party a perpetual monopoly of power and office might be grasp and arrogant for parliament -lrb- and parliament consist of the sovereign and the peer as well as of the house of common -rrb- to assent to such a arrangement might be short-sighted and impolitic but it be not clear that either the minister in propose such a enactment or the parliament in adopt it would be violate either the letter or the spirit of the constitution every member of the govern board be to be appoint by the parliament itself and though unquestionably fox would have the nomination and though he could reckon on the support of the majority in the house of common for those whom he might select still it be a strictly constitutional machinery that he be put in motion a measure however may be very objectionable without be unconstitutional and such a view of the indium bill the progress of the debate in the house of common dispose the king to take of it in the house of peer lord thurlow describe the bill as one to take the crown off he head and place it on that of mr fox and even without adopt that description to its full extent the king might easily regard the bill as a very unscrupulous attempt to curtail he legitimate authority and influence he become most anxious to prevent the bill from be present to he for he royal assent and it be presently represent to he that the knowledge of he desire would probably induce the lord to reject it among the peer who have attack the bill on its first introduction into they house be earl temple whose father have take so prominent a part in the negotiation for the formation of a new ministry in 1765 and who have himself be lord-lieutenant of ireland under lord shelburne 's administration but he have not think it prudent to divide the house against its first reading and feel great doubt as to he success in a division on the second unless he could fortify he opposition by some argument as yet untried he have no difficulty in find a willing and effective coadjutor since the retirement of lord bute from court no peer have make himself so personally acceptable to the king as lord thurlow who have be lord chancellor during the last four year of lord north 's administration and in consequence as it be generally understand of the earnest request of george iii have be allow to retain the seal by lord rockingham and afterward by lord shelburne what special attraction draw the king toward he unless it be some idea of he honesty and attachment to the king himself -- on both of which point subsequent event prove he majesty to be wholly mistaken -- it be not very easy to divine but he interest with the king at this time be notorious and equally notorious be the deep resentment which he cherish against fox and lord north of whom as he allege the former have proscribe and the latter have betray he to he therefore lord temple now apply for advice as to the best mode of work on the king 's mind and with he assistance draw up a memorial on the character of the indium bill on its inevitable fruit if it should pass -lrb- which it describe as a extinction of more than half of the royal power and a consequent disable of he majesty for the rest of he reign -rrb- and on the most effectual plan for defeat it for which end it be suggest that he majesty should authorize some one to make some of the lord acquaint with he wish that the bill should be reject -lrb- 85 -rrb- george iii eagerly adopt the suggestion and draw up a brief note which he intrust to lord temple himself and which state that he majesty allow earl temple to say that whoever vote for the indium bill be not only not he friend but would be consider by he as he enemy and if these word be not strong enough earl temple might whatever word he might deem stronger and more to the purpose -lrb- 86 -rrb- lord temple lose no time in avail himself of the permission thus grant he and as it be by no mean he object to keep the transaction secret he conduct be make the subject of severe comment by the prime-minister himself the next time that the bill be mention in the upper house the duke of portland indeed profess to have learn it only from common report and to hope that the report be unfounded since be it true he should be want in the duty he owe to the public as a minister if he do not take the opportunity of propose a measure upon it to they lordship that would prove that they feel the same jealousy the same detestation the same desire to mark and stigmatize every attempt to violate the constitution as he do lord temple in reply abstain from introduce any mention of the king 's opinion or wish but avowed plainly that he have use he privilege as a peer to solicit a interview with he majesty and that at that interview he have give he advice what that advice have be he would not then say it be lodge in the breast of he majesty nor would he declare the purport of it without the royal consent or till he see a proper occasion but though he would not declare affirmatively what he advice to he sovereign be he would tell they lordship negatively what it be not it be not friendly to the principle and object of the bill -lrb- 87 -rrb- the debate last till near midnight of the speaker a great majority declare against the bill and on the division it be reject by a majority of nineteen -lrb- 88 -rrb- this take place on the 15th of December on the 18th as the minister have not resign -- not regard a single defeat in the upper house as a necessary cause for such a step -- the king send messenger to they to demand they resignation and the next day it be publicly announce in the house of common that pitt have accept the office of prime-minister but fox who have anticipate the dismissal of himself and he colleague be by no means incline to acquiesce in it or to yield without a struggle and on the 17th one of he partisan in the house of common mr baker one of the member for hertfordshire bring forward some resolution on the subject of the late division in the house of lord he profess to rest they solely on rumor but he urge that it be the duty of that house to express its abhorrence even of that rumor since by such a action as be allege that responsibility of minister which be the life of the constitution would be take away and with it the principal check that the public have upon the crown and he urge the member of that house as the guardian of the constitution to stand forward and preserve it from ruin to maintain that equilibrium between the three branch of the legislature and that independence without which the constitution could no longer exist and with this view to resolve that to report any opinion or pretend opinion of he majesty upon any bill or other proceed depend in either house of parliament with a view to influence the vote of the member be a high crime and misdemeanor derogatory to the honor of the crown a breach of the fundamental privilege of parliament and subversive of the constitution of the country it be oppose by pitt chiefly on the ground that mr baker only base the necessity for such a resolution on common report which he fairly enough deny to be a sufficient justification of it and partly on the undoubted and inalienable right of peer either individually or collectively to advise he majesty whenever they think the situation of public affair make such a step a essential part of they duty but it be support by lord north as necessary on constitutional principle since the act so generally report and believe affect the freedom of debate and by fox who declare that the action which be report if true strike at the great bulwark of we liberty and go to the absolute annihilation not of we chartered rights only but of those radical and fundamental one which be paramount to all charter which be consign to we care by the sovereign disposition of nature which we can not relinquish without violate the most sacred of all obligation to which we be entitle not as member of society but as individual and as man the right of adhering steadily and uniformly to the great and supreme law of conscience and duty of prefer at all hazard and without equivocation those general and substantial interest which member have swear to prefer of acquit themselves honorably to they constituent to they friend to they own mind and to that public whose trustee they be and for whom they act he avow he conviction that rumor in this instance speak truth and affirm that the responsibility of minister be the only pledge and security the people of england possess against the infinite abuse so natural to the exercise of royal power argue that if this great bulwark of the constitution be once remove the people would become in every respect the slave and property of despotism this must be the necessary consequence of secret influence he argue that the sole distinction between a absolute and a limited monarchy be that the sovereign in one be a despot and may do as he please but that in the other he be himself subject to the law and consequently be not at liberty to advise with any one in public affair who be not responsible for that advice and that the constitution have clearly direct he negative to operate under the same wise restriction mr baker 's resolution be carry by a large majority but as we have see do not deter the king from dismiss the ministry the conduct of george iii in this transaction have be discuss by writer of both party with such candor that the tory historian lord stanhope while evidently desirous to defend it by implication pass a slight censure on it in the phrase that the course pursue by the king be most unusual and most extreme and most undesirable to establish as a precedent -lrb- 89 -rrb- while on the other hand so rigid a whig as lord campbell urge in he favor that if it be ever excusable in a king of england to cabal against he minister george iii may well be defend for the course he now take for they have be force upon he by a factious intrigue and public opinion be decidedly in he favor -lrb- 90 -rrb- but to those who regard not the excuse which previous provocation may be conceive in some degree to furnish to human infirmity but only the strict theory and principle of the constitution on which the doctrine of the responsibility of the minister and the consequent irresponsibility of the sovereign rest lord campbell 's conditional justification for the communication make through lord temple will hardly appear admissible we can not be sure how far mr grenville 's diary be to be trust for transaction in which he be not personally concerned or for conversation at which he be not present but in give a account -lrb- 91 -rrb- of some of the occurrence of the spring of 1766 while lord rockingham be prime-minister we find he relate a conversation between the king and lord mansfield on the ministerial measure for conciliate the american colony by the repeal of the stamp act combine however with a assertion of the _ right _ to tax he -lrb- lord mansfield -rrb- take notice of the king 's name have be bandy about in a very improper manner to which the king assent say he have be very much displeased at it as think it unconstitutional to have he name mention as a means to sway any man 's opinion in any business which be before parliament and that all those who approach he know that to be he sentiment lord mansfield say he differ from he majesty in that opinion for that though it would be unconstitutional to endeavor by he majesty 's name to carry question in parliament yet where the lawful rights of the king and parliament be to be assert and maintain he think the make he majesty 's opinion in support of those rights to be know be very fit and become the line here allege to have be draw by the great chief-justice between proclaim the king 's opinion in support of rights but withhold it in the case of measure be perhaps too fine to be perceptible by ordinary intellect but however the king may have understand the judge it be clear that the doctrine thus assert do not justify but condemn such a act as the communication of the king 's opinion and wish in the case under consideration if it would be unconstitutional to endeavor by he majesty 's name to carry question in parliament it must be at least equally so to use he name to defeat they and the case be infinitely stronger if the measure to be defeat be one which have be introduce by he minister for there can be no doubt whatever that so long as they be he minister they be entitle to he full and complete support on every question alike in they general policy and on each separate measure when he can no longer give they that support which the very act of confer they office on they promise they he only legitimate and become course be to dismiss they from they office and to abide the judgment of parliament and the nation on that act thus william iv act in the autumn of 1834 and thus george iii himself act at the end of the month of which we be speak but to retain they in they office and to employ a unofficial declaration of he dissent from they to defeat they policy be neither consistent with the straightforward conduct due from one gentleman to another nor with the principle on which the system of administration such as prevail in this country be found as have be already mention the king at once dismiss the coalition ministry mr pitt accept the conduct of affair and by so do accept the responsibility for all the act of the king which have conduce to he appointment lord john russell who in he memorial and correspondence of fox have relate and examine the whole transaction at considerable though not superfluous length while blame the prudence and in some point the propriety of fox 's conduct at the same time severely censure pitt as commit a great fault in accept office as the price of a unworthy intrigue and affirm that he and he colleague who accept office upon the success of this intrigue place themselves in a unconstitutional position -lrb- 92 -rrb- this seem to be a charge which can hardly be bear out in dismiss he former ministry the king be clearly act within he right and if so pitt be equally within he in undertake the government the truer doctrine would seem to be that in so undertake it he assume the entire responsibility for the dismissal of he predecessor -lrb- 93 -rrb- and leave it to the people at large by the vote of they representative to decide whether that dismissal be justified and whether as its inevitable consequence he acceptance of office be also justified or not the entire series of transaction from the meeting of parliament in November 1783 to its dissolution in the follow march may be constitutionally regard as a appeal by the king from the exist house of common to the entire nation as represent by the constituency and they verdict as be well know ratify in the most emphatic manner all that have be do and we may assert this without imply that if the single act of empower lord temple to influence the peer by the declaration of the king 's private feeling have be submit by itself to the elector they would have justify that the stir excitement of the three month ' contest between the great rival lead they to pronounce upon the transaction as a whole and to leave unnoticed what seem for the moment to be the minor issue -- the move if we may borrow a metaphor from the chess-table which open the game and it may be observe that though on the 17th of December pitt resist mr baker 's resolution with he utmost energy in the numerous debate which ensue he carefully avoid all allusion to lord temple 's conduct or to the measure which have lead to the dismissal of he predecessor farther than be necessary for the explanation of the principle of he own indium bill it may even be surmise that if he have be incline to recognize lord temple 's interference as warrantable the breach between that peer and himself which occur before the end of the week would not have take place since it seem nearly certain that the cause of that breach be a refusal on the part of pitt to recommend he cousin for promotion in the peerage a step which at such a moment would have have the appearance of a approval of he most recent deed -lrb- 94 -rrb- but which he could hardly have refuse if it have be do with he privity the battle as need hardly be tell be first fight among the representative of the people in the house of common for there be only one occasion on which the opinion of the lord be invite when they declare in favor of pitt by a decisive majority -lrb- 95 -rrb- but in the lower house the contest be carry on for more than two month with extraordinary activity and ability by a series of resolution and motion bring forward by the partisan of the coalition and contest by the youthful minister in one respect the war be wage on very unequal term pitt who have be but three year in parliament and whose official experience could as yet only be count by month have to contend almost single-handed against the combined experience and eloquence of lord north fox and burke fortunately however for he they own mismanagement soon turn the advantage to he side they be too angry and too confident to be skilful or even ordinarily cautious the leader on both side make profession in one respect similar they both alike deny that a desire of office influence either they conduct or they language -lrb- a denial for which pitt 's refusal of the treasury a year before gain he more credit than could be expect by fox after he coalition with lord north -rrb- and both alike profess to be struggle for the constitution alone for some fundamental principle which each charge he antagonist with violate fox on one occasion even go so far as in some degree to involve the king himself in he censure declare not only that the struggle be in fact one between pitt himself and the constitution but that it be also one between liberty and the influence of the crown and between prerogative and the constitution and that pitt have be bring into power by means absolutely subversive of the constitution -lrb- 96 -rrb- but no act of which he thus accuse the minister or the king show such a disregard of the fundamental principle of the constitution of parliament as be exhibit by fox himself when in the very first debate after the christmas recess he call in question that most undoubted prerogative of the crown to dissolve the parliament and draw a distinction which have certainly never be hear of before declare that though the king have a incontestable right to dissolve the parliament after the close of a session many great lawyer doubt whether he have such a right in the middle of a session a dissolution at such a period be a penal one profess to believe that a immediate dissolution be intend he even threaten to propose to the house of common measure to guard against a step so inimical to the true interest of the country and make a more direct attack than ever on the king himself by the assertion of a probability that even if pitt do not contemplate a dissolution he royal master might employ secret influence to overrule he and might dissolve in spite of he -lrb- 97 -rrb- a imputation which lord north with a strange departure from he customary good-humor condescend to endorse -lrb- 98 -rrb- there could be no doubt that both the doubt and the menace be of themselves distinct attack on the constitution and they be moreover singularly impolitic and inconsistent with other of the speaker 's argument since if the nation at large approve of he view and conduct a dissolution -- which would have place the decision in its hand -- would have be the very thing he should most have desire on another evening though he admit as a principle that the sovereign have the prerogative of choose he minister he not only seek to narrow the effect of that admission by the assertion that to exercise that prerogative in opposition to the house of common would be a measure as unsafe as unjustifiable -lrb- 99 -rrb- but to confine the right of decide the title of the minister to confidence to the exist house of common he accuse pitt of court the affection of the people and on this foundation wish to support himself in opposition to the repeat resolution of the house pass in the last three week have he confine himself to urge the necessity of the minister and the house of common be in harmony even though such a mention of the house of common by itself be to a certain extent a ignore of the weight of the other branch of the legislature he would have only be advance a doctrine which be practically establish at the present day since there have be certainly more than one instance in which a ministry have retire which enjoy the confidence of both the sovereign and the house of lord because it be not support by a majority in the house of common but when he proceed to make it a charge against the minister that he trust to the good-will of the people to enable he to disregard the verdict of the house of common he forget that it be only as represent the people that the house have any right to pronounce a verdict and that if it be true that the judgment of the people be more favorable to the minister than that of the house of common the difference which thus exist be a condemnation of the exist house and a irresistible reason for call on the constituency to elect another pitt therefore have no slight advantage in defend himself against so rash a assailant he do not shrink he say from avow himself the friend of the king 's just prerogative and in do so he maintain that he have a title to be regard as the champion of the people not less than of the crown prerogative have be justly call a part of the rights of the people and he be sure it be a part of they rights which they be never more inclined to defend of which they be never more jealous than at that hour -lrb- 100 -rrb- and he contend that fox 's objection to a dissolution betray a consciousness that he have not the confidence of the nation at last when the contest have last nearly two month fox take the matter into he own hand and no longer put he partisan in the front of the battle on the 1st of march he himself move for a address to the king the most essential clause of which submit to he majesty 's royal consideration that the continuance of a administration which do not possess the confidence of the representative of the people must be injurious to the public service and therefore that he majesty 's faithful common do find themselves oblige again to beseech he majesty that he would be graciously pleased to lay the foundation of a strong and stable government by the previous removal of he present minister in the speech with which he introduce this address he put himself forward as especially the champion of the house of common he charge the prime-minister with a express design to reduce the house to insignificance to render it a mere appendage to the court a appurtenance to the administration he assert the existence of a systematic design to degrade the house after which there be not another step necessary to complete the catastrophe of the constitution and on this occasion he distinguish the feeling of the king from those which influence the minister affirm he confidence that the king 's heart have no share in the present business -lrb- 101 -rrb- pitt on the other hand in reply affirm that he be call on by duty to defend the rights of the other branch of the legislature the just and constitutional prerogative of the sovereign upon which the opposition be seek to encroach without even have show a single reason to justify such invasion he freely admit that if the house of common or either of the other branch of the legislature disapprove of a administration on proper grounds it would not be well for that administration to retain office but in the present instance he contend that no ground for disapprobation have be show the exist administration have in fact by a unaccountable obstinacy and untowardness of circumstance be deprive of all opportunity of show its capacity or its intention if any accusation should be make and prove against it if any charge should be substantiate it would indeed be proper for the minister to resign and if in such a case he be afterward to continue in office he would suffer himself to be stigmatize as the champion of prerogative and the unconstitutional supporter of the usurpation of the crown but till this period arrive he should reckon it he duty to adhere to the principle of the constitution as deliver to we by we ancestor to defend they against innovation and encroachment and to maintain they with firmness the constitution of this country he presently add be its glory but in what a nice adjustment do its excellence consist equally free from the distraction of democracy and the tyranny of monarchy its happiness be to be find in its mixture of part it be this mixed government which the prudence of we ancestor devise and which it will be we wisdom to support they experience all the vicissitude and distraction of a republic they feel all the vassalage and despotism of a simple monarchy they abandon both and by blend each together extract a system which have be the envy and admiration of the world this system it be the object of the present address to defeat and destroy it be the intention of this address to arrogate a power which do not belong to the house of common to place a negative on the exercise of the prerogative and to destroy the balance of power in the government as it be settle at the revolution fox have urge that we history afford no example of a ministry retain office after the house of common have pass a resolution condemn it pitt in reply urge that we history equally fail to furnish any instance of a ministry have be call on to retire without any misconduct be allege against they and the result of the division show that he argument and he firmness be produce a impression on the house for though he be again defeat the majority against he -lrb- only twelve -rrb- be far smaller than on any previous division -lrb- 102 -rrb- a week later this feeling in he favor be show still more decidedly when fox on move for a fresh address or as he term it a representation to the king that the house have receive he majesty 's reply to they address with surprise and affliction he could only carry it by a single vote -lrb- 103 -rrb- and this division close the struggle fox make no farther effort before the end of the month the parliament be dissolve and the general election which ensue send to the house a majority to support the minister which pitt be fairly warrant in claim as the full justification of the course which he have pursue on a review of the whole of this extraordinary transaction or series of transaction it be impossible to avoid regard the issue of the struggle as a all-important element in the case and a test almost decisive of the correctness of conduct of the rival leader we may leave out of the question the action of the king in he communication to lord temple which although sanction by the great legal authority of lord thurlow we be for reason already give compel to regard as unconstitutional but for which mr pitt be only technically responsible have indeed make himself so by he subsequent acceptance of office but have have no previous suspicion of the royal intention similarly we may dismiss from we consideration the merit or demerit of fox 's indium bill the design which be imputed to its framer or the consequence which whether intend or not by they be predict as certain to flow from it and we may confine ourselves to the question whether in the great parliamentary struggle which ensue and which last for more than three month -lrb- 104 -rrb- the doctrine advance by mr fox and the conduct pursue by he be more or less in accordance with the admit rule and principle of the constitution these doctrine may be reduce to two : the first a declaration that no minister be justified in retain office any longer than he be sustain in it by the favorable judgment of the representative of the people take by itself this but for one consideration might be pronounce the superfluous assertion of a truism superfluous because it be obvious that a house of common hostile to a minister can compel he resignation by obstruct all he measure and pitt himself recognize this as fully as fox though we may hardly agree with he that the opposition be bind to allow he time to develop he policy and to bring forward he various measure before it pronounce a opinion adverse to they in 1835 when sir r peel first meet parliament after he acceptance of office consequent on the king 's dismissal of lord melbourne 's ministry the opposition encounter and defeat he twice in the first week of the session -- on the choice of a speaker and on the address though the latter have be frame with the most skilful care to avoid any necessity for objection but no attempt be make by he to call in question the perfect right of lord j russell and he follower in the house to choose they own time and field of battle but there be one farther consideration that the authority belong to the judgment of the house of common depend on that judgment be not solely its own but the judgment also of the constituency which have return it and whose mouth-piece it be and also that the house be not immortal but be liable to be send back to those constituency to see whether they will ratify the judgment which they representative have express whether in other word they judgment be the judgment of the nation also this farther consideration be in fact pitt 's plea for resist the majority which through January and February so repeatedly pronounce against he and in determine to appeal to the constituency as the court of ultimate resort he be clearly within the line of the constitution it follow that fox in protest against a dissolution in threaten even to take step to prevent it be act in self-evident violation of all constitutional principle and precedent he be deny one of the most universally acknowledge of the royal prerogative the distinction which he endeavor to draw between a dissolution at the close of a session and one in the middle of it have manifestly no validity in law or in common-sense the minister have a clear right to appeal from the house of common to the people and one equally clear to choose he own time for make that appeal the appeal be make the judgment of the nation be pronounced and its pronouncement may be and indeed must be accept as a sufficient justification in a constitutional point of view of pitt 's conduct both in accept and retain office if he retain it for three month in opposition to the voice of the exist house of common he could certainly allege that he be retain it in accordance with the deliberate judgment of the nation and this be the verdict of a modern statesman a very careful student of the theory of we parliamentary constitution and one whom party connection would notoriously have incline to defend the line take by mr fox have it be possible to do so indeed he may be say to show he bias in that statesman 's favor when he affirm that he would have be right in move a resolution of censure on pitt for he acceptance of office which he presently call the result of the success of a court intrigue -lrb- 105 -rrb- and without a particle of evidence to justify the imputation affirm to have be prepare beforehand with much art and combination but _ amicus fox sed magis arnica veritas _ and though he thus pass censure on pitt where the fact on which he base it be at least unproved on those point as to which the fact be clear and certain he condemn fox altogether affirm that he attempt to show that the crown have not the prerogative of dissolve parliament in the middle of a session have neither law nor precedent in its support -lrb- 106 -rrb- and he proceed to lay down with great clearness and accuracy the practice as well as the theory of we mixed government which be that when two of the power of the state can not agree and the business of the state be stop the only appeal be to the people at large thus when in the reign of queen anne the house of lord and the house of common fulminate resolution at each other a dissolution clear the air and restore serenity if no case have occur since the revolution of a quarrel between the crown and the house of common the cause be to be seek in the prudence with which every sovereign who have reign since that event have wield he constitutional authority if george iii have be want in that prudence it do not follow that he be debar from the right of appeal to the people any other doctrine would invest the house of common elect for the ordinary business of the state with a supreme power over every branch of it this supreme power must rest somewhere accord to we constitution it rest in the common assent of the realm signify by the person duly qualify to elect the member of the house of common and lord russell in thus expound he idea on this subject be undoubtedly express the view that ever since the transaction of which we have be speak have be take of the point chiefly in dispute since that day there have be more than one instance of parliament be dissolve in the middle of a session but though the prudence of the different minister who advise such dissolution may perhaps have be question -- nay though in one memorable instance it be undoubtedly a penal dissolution in the fullest sense of the word -lrb- 107 -rrb- -- no one have ever accuse the sovereign 's adviser of seduce he into a unconstitutional exercise of he prerogative pitt be now prime-minister with a degree of power in parliament and of popularity out-of-door that no former minister not even he own father have ever enjoy as such by the confession of one who be certainly no friendly critic -lrb- 108 -rrb- he become the greatest master of parliamentary government that have ever exist he administration may be regard as a fresh starting-point in the history of the country as the inauguration of the principle of steady amendment improvement and progress in place of the maxim which have guide all he predecessor since the revolution of regard every thing as permanently settle by the arrangement make at that time and they own duty consequently as bind they to keep everything in its exist condition but of all the minister record in we annals there be not one so greatly in advance of he time as pitt and from the very outset of he ministerial career he apply himself not only to the removal or correction of admit abuse or defect but in case where the fault be in we general system of policy have be less conspicuous to the establishment of new principle of action which have be the rule of all succeed statesman he be not indeed the first raiser of the question of parliamentary reform but he be the first to produce a elaborate scheme with that object part of which such as the suppression of the smaller borough and the enfranchisement of place which have gradually become more important have be lead feature of every subsequent bill on the subject he be the first to propose the removal of those political disability under which the roman catholic labor which no one before he have regard as consistent with the safety of the state and to which he sacrifice office he be the first to conceive the idea of develop we national industry and resource by commercial treaty with other nation even choose for he essay-piece a treaty with a country with which we relation for nearly five hundred year have be almost uninterruptedly hostile and which fox in the heat of he opposition object even to consider in any other light than that of a enemy he lay the foundation for all subsequent legislation connect with we colony in he bill for the government of canada and he establish a system for the government of we indian dependency on so statesman-like a principle that all subsequent administration concur in uphold it till subsequent event compel the abolition of all the share in the government of the country previously possess by the company a great writer of the past generation -lrb- 109 -rrb- who in some respects have do full justice to he genius and political virtue have however -lrb- partly it can hardly be doubt from regard himself as a follower of he great rival fox -rrb- contrast he capacity as a war-minister with that of he father draw a comparison on this point very disadvantageous to the son we need not stop to examine how far the praise which he bestow on lord chatham 's talent as a planner of military operation be deserve but it may very fairly be contend that the disparage view of pitt 's military policy which he have advance be found solely on what be in this as well as in many other instance a most delusive criterion success it be true unquestionably that in the campaign of 1793-4-5 against the french revolutionist while he take upon this country the entire burden of the naval war on land he contented himself with play a secondary part and employ a comparatively small force -lrb- which however double that which he father have send to minden -rrb- -lrb- 110 -rrb- for the success of the military operation trust chiefly to the far stronger austrian and prussian division under the command of prince coburg and the duke of brunswick to which the british regiment be but auxiliary it be true also that the result of they operation be unfortunate and that the german general prove wholly unable to contend with the fiery and more skilful impetuosity of jourdan and pichgru but the question be not whether pitt 's confidence in the prowess of he ally be misplace but whether he have not abundant reason to justify he in entertain it and to judge fairly on this point we must recollect the reputation which for the last forty year the austrian and prussian army have enjoy the result of the seven year ' war have establish the renown of the prussian and the duke of brunswick be understand to be a favorite pupil of the great frederic the same war have show that the austrian be not very unequal to the prussian while the reputation of the french troops have fall to the lowest ebb the most memorable event in they annals during the same war be the rout of rosbach when 60000 of they flee before frederic and 22000 at the break out of the revolution it might be say that de bouille be the only french general of the slightest reputation and since the sad journey to varenne he have be a exile from he country and though again in 1803 pitt once more trust for success on land to continental alliance not only do he deserve admiration for the diplomatic talent with which he unite austrium prussium and russium against france but it can hardly be doubt that confederacy would have be triumphant have not the incompetent vanity of alexander ruin all its prospects by he rash disregard at austerlitz of the experienced warning of he own staff -lrb- 111 -rrb- the new form of government which he establish for indium and to which allusion have be make have lose the greater part of its importance in the eye of the present generation from the more-recent abolition of the political authority of the east indium company though of some of the principle which he avow he have take for he guide it be worth while to preserve the record with such clearness as well as statesman-like wisdom do they affirm the object which every one should keep in view who apply himself to legislation for distant dependency where the privilege and interest of foreign fellow-subject be to be regard with as jealous a solicitude as those of we own countryman these object may be briefly describe as be the reconcile the vested and chartered interest of the company with the legitimate authority of the king 's government for though pitt admit that state necessity might occasionally be allow as a valid reason for the abrogation of a charter he affirm that nothing short of such absolute necessity could excuse such a measure and he rely on the previous history of the company to prove the fallacy of a observation that have sometimes be make that commercial company could not govern empire there be three interest to be consider : that of the native indian that of the company and that of this country and the problem to be solve be how to do the most good to indium and to the east indium company with the least injury to we constitution some of he remark contain unavoidable allusion to fox 's bill of the previous year since some of the provision of he bill be entirely opposite to those which fox have frame the most material point of difference be the character of the board of control which he propose to establish fox as have be see have propose to make the commissioner to be appoint under he bill irremovable for several year whatever change might take place in the home government a arrangement which the opposer of the bill suspect of be design to prevent any change in the home government from take place pitt on the other hand lay down as one of he lead principle that the board could not be permanent that it must be subordinate to the administration of the day and that permanency would be in itself a deviation from the principle of the constitution and would involve the board in contradiction to the executive government that could not fail to be attend with great public inconvenience a institution to control the government of indium must be either totally independent of the government of this country or subordinate to it the board be to consist of none but privy councillor and instead of the vast amount of patronage which be to have be create by the bill of 1783 this board be to create no increase of officer nor to impose any new burden the first and leading idea would be to limit the subsist patronage and so little be pitt covetous to engross that which do and must continue to subsist that he leave even the officer of the government of bengal to the nomination of the court of director subject only to the negative of the crown and the court of director be also to have the nomination of the officer of all the subordinate government except only of the commander-in-chief who for various reason must remain to be appoint by the crown another very important part of the arrangement be that gradation and succession be to be the general rule of promotion a regulation which of itself would be a forcible check upon patronage and tend greatly to its reduction the governor of bengal be to be the governor-general of the whole country the governor of madra and bombay be subordinate to he and each governor be to be assist by a council of three member of whom the commander of the force be to be one the spirit in which a law or a government be administer be commonly of greater practical importance than the word in which the regulation or the system be frame or define and pitt therefore conclude he speech by lay down a few clear and simple principle as those from which alone a good government could arise the first and principal object would be to take care to prevent the government from be ambitious and bent on conquest commerce be we object and with a view to its extension a pacific system should prevail and a system of defense and conciliation the government there ought therefore in a especial manner to avoid war or enter into alliance likely to create war it be not to forget to pay a due regard to self-defence or to guard against sudden hostility from neighbor power and whenever there be reason to apprehend attack to be in a state of preparation this be indispensably necessary but whenever such circumstance occur the executive government in indium be not to content itself with act there as the circumstance of the case might require it be also to send immediate advice home of what have happen of what measure have be take in consequence and what farther measure be intend to be pursue and a tribunal be to be establish to take cognizance of such matter the system of take present from the native be to be absolutely prohibit a regulation which he hope would tend effectually to check private corruption and lastly it be propose to establish a court of criminal judicature for the trial in england of certain class of delinquent after they return from indium the judge of the court be to be man of the highest character they be to be choose by ballot some be take from the bench of judge some from each house of parliament and they be not to be tie down to strict rule of evidence but to be upon they oath to give they judgment conscientiously and to pronounce such judgment as the common law would warrant such a tribunal he admit to be a innovation but unless some new process be institute offence shocking to humanity opposite to justice and contrary to every principle of religion and morality must continue to prevail unchecked uncontrolled and unrestrained and the necessity of the case outweigh the risk and the hazard of the innovation these be the general outline of the constitution which in 1784 the parliament establish for indium and the skill with which it be adapt to the very peculiar character of the settlement to be govern be sufficiently prove by the fact that it be maintain with very little alteration equally by whig and tory administration for three-quarter of a century till the great convulsion of the mutiny compel a entire alteration in the system and the abolition of the govern power of the company as we shall have occasion to relate in a subsequent chapter the principle which pitt have lay down as the guide maxim for the governor the avoidance of ambitious view of conquest the preservation of peace and the limitation of the aim of the government to the encouragement and extension of commerce be not equally adhere to undoubtedly in some instance the war in which even during pitt 's too short lifetime the indian government be engage come under he description of war which be justifiable on the ground of self-defence -- war undertake for the preservation of what have be previously win or purchase rather than for the acquisition of new territory at the expense of chief who have give we no provocation but for other though professedly undertake with a view only of anticipate hostile intention the development of which might possibly be reserve for a distant future it be not easy to find a similar justification and it may be fear that in more than one case governors-general conscious of great ability have be too much inclined to adopt the pernicious maxim of loui xiv that the aggrandizement and extension of he dominion be the noblest object which a ruler of nation can have in view yet though unable on strictly moral grounds to justify all the warlike enterprise which make up so large a part of we subsequent indian history it be impossible probably for even the most rigid moralist to avoid some feeling of national pride in the genius of we countryman who in the short space of a single century have build up a empire of a magnitude unequalled even by the caesar and have govern and still be govern it in so wise and beneficent a spirit and with such a display of administrative capacity that we rule be recognize as a blessing by the great majority of the nation themselves as a protection from ceaseless intestine war from rapine and that worst of tyranny anarchy which be they normal condition before clive establish we supremacy at plassy and into which they would surely and speedily fall back if we control authority be to be withdraw indium be not the only british settlement for which the growth of we empire compel pitt to devise a constitution the year which see he birth have also see the conquest of canada from the french and in 1774 a system of government for the new province have be establish which it be sufficient here to describe as one which differ but little from a pure despotism the administration be vest in a governor and legislative council every member of which be to be nominate by the crown but the working of this act have from the first proved very unsatisfactory and have become more so as the population increase by the influx of fresh settler from great britain and also from the united state here many of those who in the recent civil war have adhere the connection with the mother country have be expose to constant malice and ill-treatment and have prefer cross the border and obtain land in canada to return to england pitt recognize the evil and undertake to remedy it and in 1791 he introduce a bill to establish a constitution for canada which a recent historian describe as remarkable as recognize for the first time the wise and generous principle of independent colonial institution which have since be fully develop in every dependency of the british crown capable of local self-government -lrb- 112 -rrb- one peculiar difficulty in frame such a constitution arise from the circumstance of the old french colonist who greatly outnumber the settler of british blood be attach to the roman catholic religion while the british settler be nearly or perhaps all protestant though of different denomination the difficulty be indeed lessen by the circumstance that the french dwelt in quebec and the district between that city and the mouth of the st lawrence and that the english have for the most part betake themselves to the more inland region and this local separation of the two race the minister now take for he guide in the arrangement which he devise the most important feature in it be the division of the province into two part as upper and lower canada and the establishment of a distinct local legislature for each division a house of assembly be create in each and a council so as in pitt 's word to give both division the full advantage of the british constitution the assembly be to have the power of taxation -lrb- so that there be no room leave for such perverse legislation by a british parliament as have lately cost its sovereign the united state -rrb- the act of _ habeas corpus _ be extend to the province -lrb- a privilege which no one of french blood have ever enjoy before -rrb- the tenure of land be to be the socage -lrb- 113 -rrb- tenure so long and happily establish in england complete religious toleration be establish and a certain proportion of land be allot in upper canada as a provision for a protestant clergy and the foundation of a ecclesiastical establishment so great be pitt 's desire to complete the resemblance between the colony and great britain that he even contemplate the creation of a aristocracy by the introduction of a provision enable the king to grant hereditary colonial title the possession of which should include hereditary seat in the provincial council the two latter clause be oppose by fox and the latter of they though sanction by parliament be never carry out in practice but fox bitter as he be at this time in he general opposition to the government agree cordially in the general principle of the bill avow he conviction that the only method of retain distant colony with advantage be to enable they to govern themselves so that each party in the british parliament be entitle to a share of the credit for this pattern of all subsequent colonial constitution -- pitt for the original genius for organization which he contrivance of all the complicated detail of the measure display and fox for he frank adoption of the general principle inculcate by he rival even while differ as to some of the minor detail of the measure during these year the country be increase in prosperity and the minister be daily rise in credit more powerful and more popular than the most successful or the most brilliant of he predecessor but during these same year two great constitutional difficulty have arise one of which indeed the deep sense which both party feel of the danger of investigate it shelve almost as soon as it be see but the other of which besides the importance which it derive from the degree in which it involve the principle of the supreme authority of parliament and bring under discussion even that which regulate the succession to the crown imperil the existence of the ministry and threaten a total change in both the domestic and foreign policy of the nation the prince of wale who have come of age in the summer of 1783 have at once begin to make himself notorious for the violence of he opposition to he father 's minister carry the openness of he hostility so far as during the westminster election to drive about the street with a carriage and all he servant profusely decorate with fox 's color and still more discreditably by most unmeasured profligacy of all kind the consequence be that he soon become deeply involve in debt so deeply that in 1787 a member of fox 's party give notice of he intention to move that the parliament should pay he debt and increase he income pitt without specify he reason avow that he should feel it he duty to oppose any grant of such a character but another member of parliament mr rolle one of the member for devonshire be trammel by no such feeling of responsibility express a similar resolution in language which contain a allusion perfectly understand on both side of the house he say that the question thus propose to be bring forward go immediately to affect we constitution in church and state and every one know that he be refer to a report which have recently become general that the prince be marry to a roman catholic lady of the name of fitzherbert no direct notice be take of this allusion at the moment fox himself who have the chief share of the prince 's confidence be accidentally absent but a day or two afterward he refer to rolle 's speech with great indignation declare that it refer to a low malicious calumny which have no foundation whatever and be only fit to impose on the lowest order of person be press as to the precise force of he assertion and be ask whether it mean more than that under the exist law such as the royal marriage act there have be no marriage because there could have be no _ legal _ marriage he declare that he mean no such evasion but that no marriage ceremony legal or illegal have ever take place and farther that in say this he be speak on the direct authority of the prince himself no more degrading act stain the annals of british royalty for the fact be true -- the very next evening fox learn the deceit which the prince have practice on he from a gentleman who have be one of the witness to the marriage which have be solemnize by a protestant clergyman fifteen month before -lrb- 114 -rrb- and he indignation be such that for some time afterward he abstain from all interference in the prince 's affair while the language hold by the prince 's other confidant mr sheridan be so evasive as to betray a consciousness that whatever have occur would not bear the light of day so that there be very few to whom the truth or falsehood of the report be a subject of interest who feel any uncertainty on the subject it may probably be regard as fortunate for the peace of the kingdom that the prince who eventually become king george iv leave behind he no issue from he marriage with the princess the failure of heir of he body thus remove any temptation to raise the question whether he have not himself forfeit all right to succeed to the throne by he previous marriage to a roman catholic a clause of the bill of rights provide that any member of the royal family who should marry a roman catholic -lrb- with the exception of the issue of princess who may be the wife of foreign prince -rrb- shall by that marriage be render incapable of inherit the crown of england and though the royal marriage act -lrb- which as we have see have be recently pass -rrb- have enact that no marriage of any member of the royal family contract without the consent of the reign sovereign should be valid it by no means follow that a invalidity so create would exempt the contractor of a marriage with a roman catholic which as a honorable man he must be suppose to have intend to make valid from the penalty enact by the bill of rights it be a point on which the most eminent lawyer of the present day be by no means agree the spirit of the clause in that bill undoubtedly be that no apparent or presumptive heir to the crown should form a matrimonial connection with any one who should own allegiance to a foreign power and that spirit be manifestly disregard if a prince marry a roman catholic lady even though a subsequent law have enact a conditional invalidity of such a marriage we may find a analogy to such a case in instance where a man have abducted a minor and induce she to contract a marriage with himself the lady may not have be reluctant but the marriage have be annul and the husband have be criminally prosecute the nullity of the marriage not avail to save he from conviction and punishment a bigamous marriage be invalid but the bigamist be punish and apart from any purely legal consideration it may be think that public policy forbid such a construction of law as would make the illegality or invalidity of a act -lrb- and all illegal act must be more or less invalid -rrb- such a protection to the wrong-doer as would screen he from punishment whatever may be the judgment form on the legal aspect and merit of the case the conduct of the prince could not fail to give the great body of the people justly jealous at all time of they national adherence to truthfulness and honesty a most unfavorable impression of he character as have be already mention fox be so indignant at have be make the instrument to assure the parliament and the nation of a falsehood that he for a time break off all communication with he -lrb- 115 -rrb- yet a singular caprice of fortune or it would be more proper to say a melancholy visitation of providence before the end of the following year lead fox to carry he championship of the same prince who have so abused he confidence to the length of pronounce the most extravagant eulogy on he principle and on he right to the confidence and respect of the nation at large in the autumn of 1788 the king fall into a state of bad health which in no long time affect he mind and by the middle of November have so deranged he faculty as to render he incapable of attend to he royal duty or in fact transact any business whatever parliament be not sit but its re-assembling have be fix for the 4th of December and before that day arrive the king 's illness have assume so alarming a character and it appear so unsafe to calculate on he immediate recovery that the minister summon a privy council the summons be address to the member of the opposition as well as to he own follower to receive the opinion of the physician in attendance on he majesty as a necessary foundation for the measure which he conceive it to be he duty to propose to parliament those opinion be that it be almost certain that the disease would not be permanent though no one could undertake to fix its duration with the least appearance of probability and as the royal authority could not be leave in abeyance as it be for a uncertain period it be indispensable to appoint a regent to conduct the affair of the kingdom till the king should happily be once more in a condition to resume he function in consider the line of conduct adopt in this emergency by pitt and he great rival fox pitt have one manifest advantage on he side that it be impossible to attribute the course which he take to any personal motive or any desire for the retention of official power while it be equally impossible to doubt that fox be in no slight degree -lrb- 116 -rrb- and that lord loughborough the prince 's chief adviser on point of law be wholly influence by the hope of supplant the ministry pitt have never the least doubt that on the establishment of the regency he should be dismiss and be prepare to return to the bar but he knowledge of the preference which the prince entertain for he rival do not lead he to hesitate for a single moment as to the propriety of place he in a situation to exercise that preference on the reassembling of parliament he at once take what he conceive to be the proper parliamentary course of proceed at he suggestion committee in both house be appoint to take a formal examination of the royal physician and when those committee have report that the king be for the present incapable of discharge he royal function though likely at some future period to be able to resume they he move the house of common to appoint another committee to search for precedent of such proceedings as might have be take in the case of the personal exercise of the royal authority be prevent or interrupt by infancy sickness or infirmity with a view to provide for the same such a search for precedent be no novelty and may be think to have be especially proper in such a case as this since history record the appointment of several regency one under circumstance strikingly resemble those now exist when in 1454 henry vi have fall into a state of imbecility and the parliament appoint the duke of york protector -lrb- 117 -rrb- of the kingdom but fox instantly oppose it with extreme vehemence declare that the appointment of such a committee would be a pure waste of time it be notorious he affirm that no precedent exist which could have any bearing on the present case since there be in existence a person such as have never be find on any previous occasion a heir-apparent of full age and capacity to exercise the royal authority and he declare it to be he deliberate opinion that the prince of wale have as clear and express a right to assume the rein of government and to exercise all the power of sovereignty during the illness and incapacity of the sovereign as if that sovereign be actually decease such a assertion of indefeasible right be so totally at variance with the whig doctrine which pitt equally with fox regard as the true principle of the constitution that pitt at once perceive the advantage which it give he by enable he to stand forward as the supporter of the supreme authority of parliament which fox have by implication deny he instantly reply that to assert a inherent indefeasible right in the prince of wale or any one else independently of the decision of the two house fall little short of treason to the constitution but at the same time to prevent any one pretend to misconceive he intention he allow it to be see with sufficient plainness that when once the right of parliament to appoint the regent have be establish he should agree in the propriety of confer that office on the prince of wale the committee be appoint but even before it could report the result of its investigation the doctrine advance by fox have be the subject of discussion in the house of lord where lord camden who have preside over the meeting of the privy council a few day before on move for the appointment of a similar committee of peer have take occasion to declare that if fox have make such a assertion as rumor imputed to he it be one which have no foundation in the common law of the kingdom he have never read nor hear of such a doctrine its assertor might raise expectation not easily lay and might involve the country in confusion and he contend as pitt have do in the common that its assertion be a strong argument in favor of the appointment of a committee that it might be at once see whether it be warrant by any precedent whatever the report of the two committee bear out fox 's statement that no precedent entirely applicable to the case before they have ever occur but by this time fox have learn that the argument which he have found on it be in the highest degree unpalatable both to parliament and to the nation and for a moment he seek to modify it by a explanation that though he have claim for the prince the naked right he have not by that expression intend to maintain that that right could be reduce into possession without the consent of parliament a explanation not very reconcilable to common sense since if a right be inherent and indefeasible parliament could not without absolute tyranny refuse to sanction its exercise and in fact he coadjutor sheridan on the very same evening re-assert he original doctrine in if possible still more explicit term warn the minister of the danger of provoke the prince to assert he right while a still greater man -lrb- burke -rrb- declare that the minister have take up a attitude on the question tantamount to that of set himself up as a competitor to the prince such inconsiderate violence give a great advantage to pitt one of whose most useful characteristic as a debater be a readiness and presence of mind that nothing could discompose he repel such menace and imputation with a equally lofty scorn and after a few necessary preliminary bring forward a series of resolution one of which declare the fact of the sovereign 's illness and consequent incapacity a second affirm it to be the right and duty of the two house of parliament to provide the means for supply the defect in the royal authority and a third impose on the house the task of decide on the mode in which the royal assent necessary to give they resolution the authority of law should be signify it be impossible to object to the first but the second be stubbornly contest by the opposition the chief of the coalition ministry once more fight side by side though lord north contented himself with argue that the affirmation of the right and duty of parliament be a needless raising of a disputable point and move therefore that the committee should report progress as the recognize mode of shelve it fox however carry away by the heat of debate return to the assertion of the doctrine of absolute right overlook he subsequent modification of it and again give pitt the advantage by condescend to impugn he motive for propose the resolution as be inspire not by a zeal for the constitution but by a consciousness that he do not deserve the confidence of the prince and therefore anticipate he instant dismissal by the regent the re-affirmation of the prince 's inherent right be indeed necessary to fox as the foundation for the objection which he take to other part of pitt 's scheme for the minister while admit to its full extent the irresistible claim which the prince of wale possess to the preference of parliament for the regency propose at the same time to impose certain limitation on he exercise of the authority so long as there be a reasonable hope of he royal father 's recovery he be not to have the power to create peerage nor to alienate the property of the crown nor to grant office in reversion and as the queen be to have the care of he majesty 's person she also be to have the appointment of all the office in the royal household fox on the other hand object with extreme earnestness to the impropriety of impose any limitation whatever on the power of the regent and then the question whether the prince be to derive he right to the regency from the authority of parliament or from he natural position and inalienable precede right as he father 's heir become one of practical importance if the parliament have the right to confer authority it have clearly the right to limit the authority it confer if the prince have a indefeasible right to the regency independently of the will of parliament then parliament could have no pretence to limit or restrain the exercise of a authority which in no degree flow from itself fox indeed take another objection to the impose of limitation to the authority to be intrust to the regent contend that this would be to create a power unknown to the constitution -- a person in the situation of king without regal power but not to mention precedent draw from the reign of edward iii richard ii and henry vi in the twenty-fourth year of the very last reign george ii on the death of he son the father of the present king have enjoin the parliament to provide for the government in the case of he own death while the heir be still a minor recommend to they the appointment of the princess dowager of wale as regent with such power and limitation as might appear expedient and in conformity with he desire the parliament have appoint the princess regent with a council of regency to assist she and have enact that several portion of the regal power should be withhold from the regent if she could not obtain the consent of the council thus appoint -lrb- 118 -rrb- this part of the case be so plain that when after the different resolution propose by pitt have be adopt in both house fox insist that instead of proceeding by a bill to create a regency and to appoint the prince of wale regent the only course which could be adopt with propriety would be to present a address to the prince to entreat he to assume the government he fail to induce the house to agree with he and finally as if he be determine to find a battle-field in every clause he make a vigorous resistance to the expedient by which pitt propose that the formal royal assent which be necessary to make the bill law should be give fox on one occasion have go the length of deny that the two house have any right to be regard as a parliament while the king a essential part of parliament be incapacitate but such a objection could have have no force even in the mind of he who raise it since the proceedings of the two convention parliament of 1660 and 1689 labor under a similar defect and yet they act have be recognize as valid and ratify by subsequent parliament and now in reference to the expedient propose by the minister that the two house should empower and authorize the lord chancellor to affix the great seal to the bill burke with great but for he not unusual violence denounce both the proposal and the chancellor declare that such a step would be the set up of a phantom of sovereignty a puppet a idol a idiot to which he disclaim all allegiance a more perilous amendment be one propose to another clause by mr rolle enact that if the regent should marry a roman catholic he authority should cease since the bill of rights as we have see forbid a sovereign to marry a roman catholic without incur the forfeiture of he crown it be evidently reasonable that the same restriction should be impose on every regent but it be hard at the moment altogether to dissociate such a clause from the discussion of the preceding year and mr rolle endeavor to give the clause a more pointed meaning by a amendment to enact that the forfeiture should be incur by the mere celebration of any marriage ceremony whether the marriage thus perform be legal and valid or not he amendment however be unanimously reject the bill be pass without alteration by the house of common the prince while protest in a elaborate and most able letter draw up for he by burke against the restriction impose by the bill nevertheless consent to sacrifice he own judgment to the general good of the kingdom and to accept the authority limit as it be and by the middle of February the bill be send up to the house of lord there lord camden have charge of it and he position as a former chancellor give irresistible weight to he opinion that the mode propose to give the final sanction to the bill be strictly in accordance with the spirit and practice of the constitution the point with which he deal be the previous one how parliament which be to pass the bill be to be open for circumstance as it be parliament could not at present take a single step the law as he put it declare that the king must be present either in person or by a representative when he could not attend personally the legal and constitutional process be to issue letters-patent under the great seal in the present dilemma therefore he recommend that the two house should direct letters-patent to be issue under the great seal authorize commissioner to open parliament in the name of he majesty he must use the liberty to say that those who treat this proposal with ridicule be ignorant of the law of they country a fiction it might be term but it be a fiction admirably calculate to preserve the constitution and by adopt its form to preserve its substance the authority of the great seal he explain to be such that even if the lord chancellor by caprice put it to any commission it could not afterward be question and he adduce a precedent of a very similar character to the course now propose which occur at the commencement of the reign of henry vi when the sovereign be a infant of nine month old the great seal be place in he hand and it be suppose to be give to he by the master of the roll whereupon many commission be seal by it and the government be carry on under its authority that precedent he remind the peer have be follow as recently as the year 1754 when during a illness of george ii lord chancellor hardwicke affix the great seal to a commission for open a session of parliament and finally he conclude by move that it be expedient and necessary that letters-patent for open the parliament should pass under the great seal -lrb- 119 -rrb- the motion be carry and parliament be open in accordance with it and if it have be necessary the same expedient would have suffice to give the requisite assent to the regency bill a necessity which be escape by the fortunate recovery of the royal patient which be announce by he medical adviser a day or two before that fix for the third reading of the bill in the house of lord though the question be thus leave undetermined for the moment it be revive twenty-two year afterward when the same sovereign be attack by a recurrence of the same disease and the exist ministry then preside over by mr perceval bring forward a regency bill almost identical with that which on this occasion have be frame by mr pitt and the opposition lead by lord gray and sir samuel romilly raise as nearly as possible the same objection to it which be now urge by fox and he adherent the ministerial measure be however again support by considerable majority so that the course propose by mr pitt on this occasion may be say to have receive the sanction of two parliament assemble and sit under widely different circumstance and may therefore be take as have establish the rule which will be adopt if such a emergency should unfortunately arise hereafter and indeed though the propriety of pitt 's proposal have as be natural be discuss by every historical and political writer who have deal with the history of that time there have be a general concurrence of opinion in favor of that statesman 's measure lord john russell while give a document entitle material for a pamphlet in which he recognize the handwriting of lord loughborough and which contain the grounds of the opinion advance by he and adopt by mr fox that from the moment the two house of parliament declare the king unable to exercise he royal authority a right to exercise that authority attach to the prince of wale do not suppress he own opinion of the erroneousness of this or any other doctrine that attribute to any individual or any constitute authority exist in the state a strict or legal right to claim or to dispose of the royal authority while the king be alive but incapable of exercise it -lrb- 120 -rrb- the only writer as far as i be aware who advocate the opposite view be lord campbell who after quote the speech of lord camden from which extract have be make comment on it and on the whole transaction in the follow term : from the course then adopt and carry through i presume it be now to be consider part of we constitution that if ever during the natural life of the sovereign he be unable by mental disease personally to exercise the royal function the deficiency be to be supply by the two house of parliament who in they _ discretion _ will probably elect the heir-apparent regent under such restriction as they may please to propose but who may prefer the head of the ruling faction and at once vest in he all the prerogative of the crown on the two occasion refer to in the reign of george iii the next heir be at enmity with the king and he minister this be consider the loyal and courtly doctrine and from its apparent advancement of the rights of parliament there be no difficulty in cast odium on those who oppose it but i must avow that my deliberate opinion coincide with that of burke fox and erskine who pronounce it to be unsupported by any precedent and to be in accordance with the principle of the polish not the english monarchy the two house of parliament would be the proper tribunal to pronounce that the sovereign be unable to act but then as if he be naturally as well as civilly dead the next heir ought of right to assume the government as regent ever ready to lay it down on the sovereign 's restoration to reason in the same way as we lady victorium would have return to a private station if after she accession there have appear posthumous issue of william iv by he queen it be easy to point out possible abuse by the next heir as regent to the prejudice of the living sovereign but there may be greater abuse of the power of election imputed to the two house whereby a change of dynasty might be effect i conceive therefore that the irish parliament -lrb- 121 -rrb- in 1789 act more constitutionally in acknowledge the _ right _ of the next heir in scout the fiction of a commission or royal assent from the insane sovereign and in address the prince of wale to take on himself the government as regent though the sneer at the possibility of parliament prefer the head of the ruling faction to the heir-apparent be hardly consistent with the impartial candor which be one of the most imperative duty of a historical critic and though the allusion to the principle of the polish monarchy be not very intelligible yet no one will refuse to attach due weight to the deliberate opinion of one who win for himself so high a professional reputation as lord campbell but with all respect to he legal rank we may venture to doubt whether he have not lay down as law speaking as a literary man and a historian a doctrine which he would not have entertain as a judge for if we consider the common law of the kingdom it be certain that in the case of subject if a man become deranged he next heir do not at once enter on he property as if he be naturally as well as civilly dead and if as in such case be notoriously the practice the court of chancery appoint a guardian of the lunatic 's property analogy would seem to require that the house of parliament as the only body which can possibly claim authority in such a matter should exercise a similar power in provide for the proper management of the government to that which the law court would exercise in provide for the proper management of a estate and that therefore the principle of constitutional -lrb- 122 -rrb- statesmanship which be deeply interested in uphold the predominant authority of parliament must justify the assertion of the minister that the two house have the entire and sole right to make regulation for the government of the kingdom during the incapacity of the sovereign and that the next heir even when a son of full age can have no more right to succeed to he father 's royal authority in he lifetime than if that father be a subject he would have to succeed to he estate the opposite doctrine would seem to impugn the legality of the whole series of transaction which place william and mary on the throne the admission of a indefeasible right of the heir-apparent would have bear a perilous resemblance to a recognition of that divine right every pretension to which the revolution of 1688 have extinguish if again as fox and he follower at one time endeavor to argue the house in 1789 have no right to the name or power of a parliament because the king have no part in they meeting the convention that sit a century before -lrb- as indeed be admit -rrb- be certainly far less entitle to that name or power for it have not only never be call into existence by a king but be assemble in direct defiance of the king similarly it be admit that the body which invite charle ii to return and resume he authority be equally destitute of the validity which could only be give by a royal summons yet both these body have perform action of greater importance than that which be look for from this parliament the one have abolish the exist and usurp government and restore to he kingdom a king who have be long a exile the other have as it be pass sentence on the exist sovereign on grounds which confessedly will not bear a strict examination and have confer the crown on a prince who have no hereditary claim to the title the justification of both act be necessity _ salus regnus suprema lex _ and the necessity be clearly more urgent in the present case than in either of the precede instance for unless the parliament interfere to create a authority there be absolutely none in existence which be capable of act it should also be remember that this parliament of 1789 though not open for the session by the king have be originally elect in obedience to he order and have be prorogue by he proclamation to the day of meeting -lrb- 123 -rrb- and though the opening of a session by a speech from the throne be the usual form for the commencement of its proceedings it may be doubt whether it be so indispensable a part of they that none of they act be valid without it the break out of the french revolution and the degree in which in spite of all its atrocity and horror the revolutionary spirit for a time infect a large party in england prevent pitt from revive the plan of reform which he have frame with such care and genius for organization and in which though defeat in parliament both before and after he become minister he have hitherto continue to cherish the hope of eventually succeed but when club and society where the most revolutionary and seditious doctrine be openly broach be spring up in london and other large town and unscrupulous demagogue by speech and pamphlet be busily disseminate theory which tend to the subversion of all legitimate authority he not unnaturally think it no longer seasonable to invite a discussion of scheme which would be support in many quarter only to quote he own word as a stepping-stone to ulterior object which they dare not avow till they power of carry they into effect should be by this first acquisition secure but the alarm which the spread of revolutionary idea excite in he mind be display not only passively in this abstention from the advocacy of measure the expediency of which must at all time in some degree depend on the tone of they introduction but also in active measure of repression some of which be not indeed unwarranted by precedent but other of which can hardly be deny to have be serious inroad on the constitution infringement of the freedom of opinion and discussion to which all englishman be entitle and one of which be to say the least a very perilous extension of a law already sufficiently severe the statute of treason if the french have be content with the overthrow of they own government and institution much as we should have lament the indiscriminate rashness and abhor the atrocity with which they design be carry out we should still have adhere to the unquestionable maxim that no nation be justified in interfere in the internal affair of another but the jacobin and girondin demagogue who have now the undisputed sway in pari do not limit they view to they own country but openly declare themselves the enemy of all established government in every country and the convention pass a formal resolution in which they proffer fraternity and assistance to every people which might be incline to rise against they government they resolution be officially communicate to the sympathize society in england and emissary be secretly encourage to cross the channel in the hope of gain convert nor be they exertion barren two man be convict in scotland of a plot to seize edinburgh castle to massacre the garrison to imprison the judge and to rise in arm to compel the government to a change of policy in london the king be fire at on he way to open parliament and on he return he carriage be attack by a furious mob and be only protect from serious injury by a troop of the life guard such outrage prove the existence of a new danger against which no previous government have ever be call on to provide and such as in the opinion of the cabinet could only be meet by novel measure of precaution the first be direct against the foreign propagator of revolution the resolution of the convention have be promulgate in November 1792 and at the meeting of parliament in December lord grenville as foreign secretary of state introduce in the house of lord a alien bill to enable the government to deal in a summary manner with any foreign visitor whose conduct or character might seem to call for its interference it provide that all foreigner who have arrive in the kingdom since the precede January should give in a statement of they name and residence that any one who should arrive in future should furnish a account of he name he station in life and he object in visit england that the king by proclamation order in council or sign-manual might direct all foreigner to reside in such district as might be think suitable that no one might quit the residence in which he first settle without a passport and that the secretary of state might order any suspect foreigner to quit the kingdom instantly the act be to be in operation for twelve month and lord grenville in introduce it though he admit it to be a measure of rather a novel nature explain at the same time that it be so far from be new in the power which it give that magna charta distinctly recognize the power and right of the crown to prevent foreigner from enter or reside within the realm all that be really new be the define of the manner in which that power should be exercise since it have be so rarely need that doubt might exist as to the proper mode of put it in action the bill which be adopt in both house by large majority be remarkable among other circumstance from the fact that its discussion furnish the first instance of a public display of the difference between the two section of the opposition subsequently describe by burke in one of he most celebrated pamphlet as the old and new whig those whom he call the old whig -lrb- the duke of portland sir gilbert elliott mr windham not to mention burke himself -rrb- earnestly support it while lord lansdowne mr fox mr sheridan and mr gray resist it with equal zeal lord lansdowne take the ground that it be a suspension of the _ habea corpus _ act while fox and gray denounce it in more general term as a measure utterly irreconcilable with the principle of the constitution mr gray apparently refer chiefly to the power give by the bill to the secretary of state to send any foreigner from the country which he describe as make the bill a measure of oppression give power for the exercise of which no man be responsible sir gilbert elliott 's answer be singularly ingenious he do not deny that the bill confer additional power on the crown though not more than be justify by exist circumstance but he maintain that the right of give extraordinary power to the crown on occasion be so far from be inconsistent with the principle of the constitution that to grant extraordinary power in extraordinary emergency be a part of it essential to the character of a free government if such power be at all time possess by the crown its authority would be too great for a free government to co-exist with it but if such could not be at time confer on the crown its authority would be too small for its own safety or that of the people the argument of the minister be no doubt greatly recommend both to the parliament and the people in general by the notoriety of the fact that foreign agent be in many of we large town busily and not unsuccessfully engage in propagate what be know as jacobin doctrine but even without that aid it be clear that every government must for the common good of all be at time of extraordinary emergency invest with the power of suspend law make for ordinary circumstance and what would be a intolerable evil if the supreme magistrate take upon himself to exercise it cease to be one when the right to exercise it be confer by the nation itself in parliament if the bill do as be argue suspend the _ habea corpus _ act that statute have be enact by parliament and therefore for parliament in a case of necessity to suspend its operation be clearly within the spirit of the constitution the bill affect we own fellow-subject be still more warmly contest one be know as the traitorous correspondence bill which accord to lord campbell be suggest by lord loughborough who have lately become lord chancellor the old law of high-treason enact in the reign of edward iii have be in effect greatly mitigate by later statute which have make act to which that character be imputed more difficult of proof by a stricter definition of what be admissible evidence and other safeguard and the practice of the court have by degree practically reduce the list of treason enumerate in the old law indictment for many of the offence contain in it forbear to assert that the person accuse have incur the penalty of high-treason but this new bill greatly enlarged the catalogue it make it high-treason to hold any correspondence with the french or to enter into any agreement to supply they with commodity of any kind even such as be not munitions of war but article of ordinary merchandise or to invest any money in the french fund and it enact farther that any person who by any write preaching or malicious and advise speaking should encourage such design as the old statute of edward make treasonable should be liable to the penalty of high-treason another bill be design to check the grow custom of hold public meeting by provide that no meeting the object of which be to consider any petition to the king or parliament or to deliberate on any alleged grievance should be hold without those who convene it and who must be householder give previous notice of it by public advertisement and empower any two justice of the peace at they own discretion to declare any such meet a unlawful assembly and to disperse it by force if from the subject discuss the language hold or any special circumstance they should regard it as dangerous fox and those who still adhere to he resist almost every clause of these different bill they maintain that one of the most fundamental maxim of law in every country call itself free be that property be in the highest degree entitle to the protection of the law and if so that the right of dispose of it or invest it in any manner must be consider under the same protection that any interference with ordinary commercial transaction be equally repugnant to the spirit of the constitution and take a practical view of the question they warn the minister that such rigorous enactment impose such extreme penalty would defeat they own end for it be a general and true maxim that excess of punishment for a crime bring impunity along with it and that no jury would ever find a verdict which would doom a fellow-creature to death for sell a yard of cloth and send it to france they protest too against inflict on word whether write or speak penalty which have hitherto be confine to overt act and the clause confer power on magistrate to prevent or disperse public meeting encounter still more vehement opposition fox insist with great eloquence that public meeting for the discussion of public subject be not only lawful but agreeable to the very essence of the constitution that indeed to they under that constitution most of the liberty which englishmen now enjoy be particularly owe the people he maintain have a right to discuss they grievance they have a inalienable right to complain by petition and to remonstrate to either house of parliament or to the king and to make two magistrate who might be strong partisan irresponsible judge whether anything say or do at a meeting have a tendency to encourage sedition be to say that a free constitution be no longer suitable to we pitt justified these measure partly on the ground of the special and unprecedented danger of the time as prove by the late attempt on the king 's life and partly by the open avowal of republican doctrine make at the meeting of different society partly also on the temporary character of the measure since in each bill a period be fix after which its operation should expire and he argue farther that as many of the action specify in these bill as seditious or treasonable be by many lawyer consider capable of be reach by statute already exist though not universally understand it be humane not cruel to remove doubt and to prevent man from be ensnare by the ambiguity of old law and in may 1794 he bring in another bill found on the report of a secret committee which in compliance with a royal message the house of common have appoint to investigate the proceedings and object of certain society which be know to exist in different part of the kingdom in obedience to a secretary of state 's warrant found on swear information they book and papers have be seize and have be seal up be now lay before the house with the report of the committee that they prove that several of the society which they name have ever since the end of the year 1791 be uniformly pursue a settle design for the subversion of the constitution one society in particular have approve a plan for assemble a convention in imitation of the french assembly sit under that title in order to overturn the established government and to wrest from the parliament the power which the constitution place in its hand to prevent the dissemination of such principle and to defeat such scheme pitt now ask leave to bring in a bill to empower he majesty -- act of course through the secretary of state -- to secure and detain such person as he should suspect of conspire against the king 's person and government he admit that the power which he thus propose to confer amount to a suspension of the _ habea corpus _ act in every part of the unite kingdom nor do he deny that it be a unusually strong measure but he contend that it be one justify by absolute necessity by the manifest danger of such a conspiracy as the committee have affirm to exist to the tranquillity of the nation and the safety of the government fox it may almost be say as a matter of course oppose the introduction of any such measure but he opposition be hardly mark by he usual force of argument he be hamper by the impossibility of deny either the existence of the society which the committee and the minister have mention or the dangerous character of some of they design but he object to the measure of repression which be propose partly on the absence of all attempt at concealment on the part of the promoter of these society partly on the contemptible character of the convention which it be design to summon and the impossibility that such a assembly should have the slightest influence he even make they avowed hostility to the constitution a plea for a panegyric on that constitution and on the loyal attachment to it evince by the vast majority of the people and from that he proceed to find a fresh argument against the propose measure contend that it make a fatal inroad on that very constitution which be so highly value by the whole nation he describe it as a measure of infinitely greater mischief than that which it propose to remedy since it would give the executive authority absolute power over the personal liberty of every individual in the kingdom he do not deny that a similar measure have be enact under william iii again in 1715 and again in 1745 but he contend that the present peril bear no resemblance to the danger of those time this measure go to overturn the very corner-stone of the constitution and if it pass there be a end of the constitution of england the bill be pass in both house by very large majority -lrb- 124 -rrb- it be originally enact for six month only but be from time to time renew till the end of the century if we take a general survey of all these measure together as part of one great defensive scheme for the preservation of the public tranquillity and the general safety of the empire it may probably be think that though undoubtedly suspension of the constitution they be not open to the charge of be unconstitutional since they be enact not only for the welfare of the people but with they consent and concurrence legitimately signify by they representative in parliament it be scarcely consistent with sound reason to contend that the _ habea corpus _ which have be enact by parliament could not be suspend by the authority which have enact it that the constitution which exist for the benefit of the people could not be suspend by the people or to deny if it be in appearance transgress by these enactment that it be yet transgress by strictly constitutional act by the decision of the parliament to whose power the constitution prescribe no limit but it be not sufficient that in this point of view these measure may have be defensible in judge of they statesmanship it be almost equally to be consider whether they be expedient and politic whether the emergency or necessity be such as to justify such rigorous method of repression it be fairly open to doubt whether some of they and especially the traitorous correspondence and the seditious meeting bill do not treat as treasonable act which do not go beyond sedition and whether so to treat they be not to invest they with a importance which do not belong to they and on this part of the question the general judgment have we think be unfavorable to the government and it have be commonly allow that the chancellor whose advice on legal subject the prime-minister naturally take for he guide give he impolitic counsel in fact it be well know that these two act to a great extent fail in they object through they excessive severity several jury have refuse to convict person who be prosecute for treason who would certainly not have escape have they only be indict for sedition and it be deserving of remark that these two bill be not regard with favor by the king himself if the anecdote -- which seem to rest on undeniable authority -- be true that he express satisfaction at the acquittal of some prisoner on the ground that almost any evil would be more tolerable than that of put man to death for constructive treason it must therefore probably be affirm that these two act the treason act and the seditious meeting act go beyond the necessity of the case that they be not only violation of the constitution -- which when the measure be temporary as these be be not always indefensible -- but that they be superfluous unjust and impolitic superfluous when they propose to deal with act already visitable with punishment by the ancient law of the kingdom unjust when they create new class of offence and impolitic as exciting that kind of disapproval of the act of government which in many mind have a tendency to excite a spirit of discontent with and resistance to legitimate authority and indeed it must be infer that such be the light in which these measure be regard by a statesman who in he general policy be proud to acknowledge himself mr pitt 's pupil as he be also the most skilful and successful of he more immediate successor twenty-five year afterward the distress cause by the reaction inevitably consequent on the termination of twenty year of war produce a political excitement scarcely inferior to that with which pitt have now to deal and seditious society and meeting scarcely less formidable but as we shall see lord liverpool take warning perhaps from the mistake into which mr pitt be lead on this occasion though compel to bring forward new and stern measure of repression and even to suspend the _ habea corpus _ act for a time keep strictly within the line of constitutional precedent and be careful to avoid confounding sedition with treason note : -lrb- footnote 73 : he have be lord-chamberlain in lord

of ireland and the feeling of its people in the latter year of the reign of george ii mr hallam have fix on the year 1753 as that in which the irish parliament first begin to give vent to aspiration for equality with the english parliament in audible complaint and the irish house of common find the kingdom in the almost unprecedented condition of have a surplus revenue after the payment of all charge take step to vindicate that equality by a sort of appropriation bill there be however three fundamental difference between the parliament of the two country which above all other stand in the way of such equality as the irish patriot desire : the first that by a law as old as the time of henry vii and call sometimes the statute of drogheda from the name of the town in which it be first promulgate and sometimes poyning ' act from the name of sir henry poyning the lord-deputy at the time no bill could be introduce into the irish parliament till it have receive the sanction of the king and privy council in england the second that the parliament last for the entire life of the king who have summon it -- a regulation which cause a seat in the house of common to be regard almost as a possession for life and consequently enormously increase the influence of the patron of borough some of whom could return a number of member such as the mightiest borough monger in england could never aspire to equal -lrb- 125 -rrb- the third difference of scarcely inferior importance be that the parliament only sit in alternate year but though these arrangement suit the patron and the member of the house of common it be not strange that the constituency whose power over they representative be almost extinguish by they regard they with less complacency and at the general election which be the consequence of the accession of george iii pledge be very generally exact from the candidate that if elect they would endeavor to procure the passing of a septennial act like that which have be the law in england ever since the early year of george i a bill with that object be introduce in 1761 and report on not unfavorably as to its principle by the english law adviser to whom the privy council refer it but as if it have be design to exemplify in the strongest possible manner the national propensity for make blunder it contain one clause which render it not only impracticable but ridiculous the clause provide that no member should take he seat or vote till he qualification have be prove before the speaker in a full house but the speaker could not be choose till the member have establish they right of vote so that the whole be bring to a dead-lock and the bill if pass could never have be carry out in the ministry of 1767 however -- that of the duke of grafton and lord chatham -- lord halifax be replace at dublin castle by lord townsend who among he other good quality deserve specially honorable mention as the first lord-lieutenant who make residence in dublin he rule on principle for till very lately non-residence have be the rule and residence the exception a fact which be of itself a melancholy but all-sufficient proof of the absolute indifference to irish interest show by all class of english statesman and under he government a bill for shorten parliament be pass though it fix the possible duration of each parliament at eight year instead of seven the variation be make to prevent a general election from be hold at the same time in both country but accord to common belief solely in order to keep up a mark of difference between the irish and english parliament and those who entertain this suspicion fancy they see a confirmation of it in the retention of the regulation that the irish parliament should only sit in alternate year a practice wholly inconsistent with any proper idea of the duty and privilege of a parliament such as prevail on this side of the channel since a parliament whose session be thus intermittent could not possibly exercise that degree of supervision over the revenue either in its collection or its expenditure which be among its most important duty and the continue maintenance of this practice must be regard farther as a proof that the english legislator have not yet learn to consider ireland as a integral part of the kingdom entitle in every particular to equal rights with england and scotland indeed it be impossible for any englishman to contemplate the history of the treatment of ireland by the english legislator whether king minister or parliament for more than a century and a half without equal feeling of shame at the injustice and wonder at the folly of they conduct not only be ireland deny freedom of trade with england -lrb- a denial as inconsistent not only with equity but also with common-sense as if windsor have be refuse free trade with london -rrb- -lrb- 126 -rrb- but irish manufacture be deliberately check and suppress to gratify the jealous selfishness of the english manufacturer macaulay in he zeal for the memory of william iii have not scruple to apologize for if not to justify the measure deliberately sanction by that sovereign for the extinction of the irish woollen manufacture on the ground that ireland be not a sister kingdom but a colony that the general rule be that the english parliament be competent to legislate for all colony plant by english subject and that no reason exist for consider the case of the colony in ireland as a exception -lrb- 127 -rrb- there be perhaps no passage in he whole work less to he credit but if such be the spirit in which a english historian could write of ireland in the latter half of this present century it may perhaps diminish we wonder at the conduct of we legislator in a earlier generation the penal law on the subject of religion be also conceive and carry out in a spirit of extraordinary rigor and injustice by far the larger portion of the irish population still adhere to the roman catholic faith but as far as the negative punishment of restriction and disability could go its profession be visit as one of the most unpardonable of offence no roman catholic could hold a commission in the army nor be call to the bar nor practice as a attorney and when it be find that a desire to devote themselves to the study of the law have lead many gentleman to acknowledge a conversion to protestantism a statute be actually pass to require they to prove they sincerity by five year ' adherence to they new form of religion before they could be regard as have wash off the defilement of they old heresy sufficiently to be think worthy to wear a gown in the four court no roman catholic might keep a school while a strange refinement of intolerance have add a statute prohibit parent from send they child to roman catholic school in a foreign country and the manner in which the government be carry on be if possible worse even than the principle the almost continual absence of the lord-lieutenant inevitably leave the chief management of the detail in the hand of underling and the favor of the castle be only to be acquire by the lowest time-serving of which those who could influence election wealthy and high-born as they for the most part be be not more innocent than the representative no support to government could be look for from either peer or commoner unless it be purchase by bribe more or less open which it be equally discreditable to ask and to grant for one of the worst fruit of the system which have so long reign throughout the island be the general demoralization of all class mr fronde give george iii himself the credit of be the first person who resolutely desire to see a change of the system and to try the experiment whether ireland might not be manage by open rectitude and real integrity -lrb- 128 -rrb- but he first effort be baffle by the carelessness or incompetency of the viceroy since it be difficult to find any man of ability who would undertake the office and for some year thing go on with very little change great lord of different rank have equally no object but that of control the castle and engross the patronage of the government and in not a few instance of also procure large grant or pension for themselves each seek to build up a individual influence which no viceroy could ever have withstand have they be unite instead of be separate by mutual jealousy which enable he from time to time to play off one against the other but the war with the north american colony which break out in 1774 by some of its indirect consequence bring about a great change in the affair of ireland the demand for re-enforcement to the army engage in america could only be meet by denude the british island themselves of they necessary garrison no part of they be leave so undefended as the irish coast and after a time the captain of some of the american privateer learn how little resistance they have to fear venture into st george 's channel penetrate even into the inland water and threaten carrickfergus and belfast in matter of domestic policy it be possible to procrastinate to defer decide on relaxation of the penal law or the removal of trade restriction but to delay put the country into a state of defense against a armed enemy for a single moment be not to be think of yet the government be powerless of the regular army almost every available man be in or on he way to america and the most absolute necessity therefore compel the irish to consider themselves as leave to they own resource for defense it be as impossible to levy a force of militia as one of regular troops for the militia could not be embody without great expense and the finances of the whole kingdom have be so mismanage that money be as hard to procure as man in this emergency several gentleman propose to the lord-lieutenant to raise body of volunteer the government though reluctant to sanction the movement could see no alternative since the presence of a armed force of some kind be indispensable for the safety of the island the movement grow rapidly by the summer of 1779 several thousand man be not only under arm but be be rapidly drill into a state of efficiency and have even establish such a reputation for strength that when in the autumn the same privateer that have be so bold in belfast lough the year before reach the irish coast in the hope of plunder limerick or galway they find the inhabitant of the district well prepare to receive they and do not venture to attempt a descent on any part of the island and when the parliament meet in October some of the member who see in the success that could not be deny to have attend they exertion a irresistible means of strengthen the rise pretension of ireland to a equality of law and freedom with england move vote of thanks in both house to the whole body of volunteer they be carry by acclamation and the volunteer of the metropolis line the street between the parliament house and the castle when accord to custom the member of the two house march in procession to present they address to the lord-lieutenant such a recognition of the power of this new force stimulate those member who claim in a special degree the title of friend of ireland to greater exertion a wiser government than that of lord north would have avoid give occasion for the existence of a force which the utter absence of any other have make master of the situation the volunteer even boast that they have be call into existence by english misgovernment in the word of one of they most eloquent advocate england have sow she law like dragon ' tooth and they have spring up as armed man ireland begin to feel that she be strong and not unnaturally desire to avail herself of that strength which england now could not question to put forward demand for concession which in common fairness could not well be deny in 1778 when lord north in the hope of recover the allegiance of the north american colony bring forward what he term he conciliatory proposition the irish member begin to press they demand that the advantage thus offer to the american should be extend to they own countryman also that the fact of the irish not have rebel should not be make a plea for treat they worse than those who have and in the front of all they request be one for the abolition of those unjust and vexatious duty which shackle they trade and manufacture but the jealousy of the english and scotch manufacturer be still as bitter and unhappily still as influential as it have prove in the time of william iii and to humor the grasp selfishness of manchester and glasgow lord north meet the demand of the irish with a refusal of which every word of he speech on the proposition to america be the severest condemnation and which he seek to mitigate by some new regulation in favor of the linen trade to which the english and scotch manufacturer make no objection since they have no linen factory the irish in despair have recourse to non-importation agreement of which the american have set the example binding themselves not to import nor to use any article of english or scotch manufacture with which they could possibly dispense and the result be that lord north yield to fear what he have refuse to justice and the next year bring in bill to grant the irish the commercial equality which they demand some of the most oppressive and vexatious of the penal law be also relax and some restriction which the navigation act impose on commerce with the west indy be repeal but strange to say the english minister still cling to one grievance of monstrous injustice and steadily refuse to allow judicial appointment to be place on the same footing as in england and to make the seat of a judge on the bench depend on he own good conduct instead of on the caprice of a king or a minister but the manifest reluctance with which the english government have grant this partial relief encourage the demand for farther concession the irish member rarely deficient in eloquence or fertility of resource have be lately re-enforce by a recruit of pre-eminent power whom lord charlemont have return for he borough of moy henry grattan and lead by he begin to insist that the remain grievance to the removal of which the nation have a right would never be extinguish so long as the supreme power of legislation for the country rest with the english and scotch parliament and that the true remedy be only to be find in the restoration to the irish parliament of that independence of which it have be deprive ever since the time of henry vii they be encourage by the visibly increase weakness of lord north 's administration throughout the year 1781 it be evidently totter to its fall and on the 22d of February 1782 grattan bring forward in the irish house of common a resolution intend if carry to lay the foundation of a bill that a claim of any body of man other than the king lord and common of ireland to bind this kingdom be unconstitutional illegal and a grievance this resolution aim at the abolition of poyning ' act other resolution demand the abolition of the power exercise by the privy council under color of poyning ' act and a farther relaxation of the penal law so helpless do the government by this time feel itself that the attorney-general who be its spokesman on this occasion could not venture to resist the principle of these resolution but be contented to elude they for the time by objection take to some of the detail and grattan give notice of another motion to bring the question to a more definite decision which he fix for the 16th of April before that day come lord north 's government have cease to exist and have be replace by lord rockingham 's one most influential member of which be the most distinguish of live irishman mr burke who while in opposition have always show himself a warm supporter of the claim of he countryman and be not likely to have he ardor in the cause damp by be place in a situation where he could procure a friendly hearing to he counsel once more they have increase they demand require besides the removal of the purely political grievance a surrender of the right of appeal from the irish to the english court of law but they new master be incline to grant everything which seem requisite to the establishment of complete equality between the two kingdom and though the new ministry be dissolve in a few month by the premature death of its chief he live long enough to carry the repeal of poyning ' act the retention of which be now admit to be not only senseless but mischievous since the existence of a body invest with nominal dignity but practically powerless be calculate not only to provoke discontent but to furnish a lever for agitation the repeal be however nothing less than the establishment of a entirely new constitution in ireland the irish parliament the meeting of which have hitherto be a mere form and farce be install in a position of absolute independence to grant money or to make law subject to no other condition than that they legislation should be of a character to entitle it to the royal assent a condition to which every act of the british parliament be likewise and equally liable unhappily as a irish patriotic writer exclaim on this occasion it be write in the book of fate that the felicity of ireland should be short-lived -lrb- 129 -rrb- and a similar shortness of existence be to be the lot of the separate independence of she parliament even while frame instruction for the lord-lieutenant in he honest desire to inaugurate a system of just government for ireland george iii have warn he on no account to summon a parliament without he special command -lrb- 130 -rrb- and regard by the light of subsequent event it can hardly be deny that the prohibition display a accurate insight into the real difficulty of the country and also into the character of the people themselves as the source of at least some of those difficulty we ought not to judge its leader too severely a nation which have be long keep in bondage and be suddenly present with liberty be hardly more able to bear the change than a man immure for year in a dark dungeon can at once endure the unveil light of the sun and independence have be grant to the irish too suddenly for it to be probable that they would at once and in every instance exercise it wisely all party be to blame in different degree the first danger come from the volunteer who flush with self-importance from the belief that it be the impose show of they strength which have enable the parliament to extort lord rockingham 's concession from the english house now claim to be master of the parliament itself with the termination of the american war and the consequent return of the english army to europe the reason for they existence have pass away but they refuse to be disband and establish a convention of armed delegate to sit in dublin during the session of parliament and to overawe the house into pass a series of measure which they prescribe and which include a parliamentary reform bill of a most sweeping character on this occasion however the house of common act with laudable firmness lead by mr fitzgibbon a man of great power and above all suspicion of corruptibility it spurn the dictation of a unauthorized body and reject the reform bill avowedly on the ground of its be present to it under the mandate of a military congress and the convention finding itself powerless to enforce its mandate dissolve but the difficulty of the government be not over with the suppression of the volunteer convention the lord-lieutenant have a harder because a more enduring contest to encounter with the parliament and the patron of the borough a single act of parliament may substitute a new law for a old one but no one resolution or bill have a magical power to extinguish long habit of jobbery and corruption member and patron alike seem to regard the late concession as chiefly valuable on account of the increase value which it enable they to place on they service to the government and one can not read without a feeling of shame that one or two of the bishop who be wont to be regard as the proprietor of the seat for they diocesan city be not behind the most nameless lay boroughmonger in the resolution they evince make a market of they support of the government the consequence be that the government be unable to feel confident of its power to carry any measure except at a price that it be degrade to pay while of those few member who be above all suspicion of personal corruption many be so utterly wrong-headed and have they mind so fill with unreasonable jealousy for what they call the honor and dignity of ireland and with a consequent distrust of england and of all englishman that they honest folly be even a greater obstacle to wise and good government than the mean cunning of the other there can hardly be a more striking proof of the difficulty to be overcome by a minister than be furnish by a speech make by a gentleman of the highest character and of deservedly wide influence in the northern county mr brownlow of lurgan one of the member for armagh which be quote by mr froude -lrb- 131 -rrb- pitt be painfully conscious of the commercial injustice with which hitherto ireland have always be treat and in the very first year of he administration he apply himself to the removal of the most mischievous of the grievance of which the irish merchant complain adopt to a great extent a scheme which have be put before he by one of the most considerable gentleman of that body which be base on the principle of equalization of duty in both country it be unnecessary here to enter into the detail of the measure which he introduce into the house of common he avow it to be the commencement of a new system of government for ireland a system of a participation and community of benefit a system of equality and fairness which without tend to aggrandize one portion of the empire or to depress the other should seek the aggregate interest of the whole it be a substitute for the system which have hitherto be adopt of make the smaller country completely subordinate to and subservient to the greater of make the smaller and poorer country a mere instrument for the advantage of the greater and wealthier one he therefore propose now to create a situation of perfect commercial equality in which there be to be a community of benefit and also to some extent a community of burden and he urge the house to adopt that system of trade with ireland that would tend to enrich one part of the empire without impoverish the other while it would give strength to both that like mercy the favorite attribute of heaven ` be twice bless -- it blesseth he that give and he that take ' it might he say be regard as a treaty with ireland by which that country would be put on a fair equal and impartial footing with great britain in point of commerce with respect to foreign country and we colony the community of burden which he measure would impose on ireland be this : that whenever the gross hereditary revenue of ireland should exceed # 650000 -lrb- a amount considerably in excess of anything it have ever yet reach -rrb- the excess should be apply to the support of the fleet of the unite kingdom it be in fact a burden that could have no existence at all until the irish trade have become far more flourishing and productive than as yet it have ever be yet a measure conceive in such a spirit of liberality and frame with such careful attention to the minutest interest of irish trade mr brownlow do not hesitate to denounce as one tend to make ireland a tributary nation to great britain the same term he declare have be hold out to america and ireland have equal spirit with america to reject they he even declare that it be happy for mr orde -lrb- the chief secretary who have introduce the measure into the irish house of common -rrb- that he be in a country remarkable for humanity have he propose such a measure in a polish diet he would not have live to carry back a answer to he master if he conclude the gift of britain be to be accompany with the slavery of ireland i will never be a slave to pay tribute i will hurl back she gift with scorn baffle by such frantic and senseless opposition pitt condescend to remodel he measure in its new form it be not so greatly for the advantage of ireland he have be constrain to admit some limitation of he original liberality by the opposition which it have meet with in england also where fox at all time a avowed enemy of freedom of trade have make himself the mouth-piece of the london and liverpool merchant who could not see without the most narrow-minded apprehension the monopoly of the trade with indium and the west indy which they have hitherto enjoy threaten by the admission of ireland to its benefit and now a clause in the second bill bind the irish parliament to reenact the navigation law exist in england call up a opposition from grattan -lrb- 132 -rrb- as furious as that with which mr brownlow have denounce the original measure to demand the enactment of the english navigation law he declare be a revocation of the constitution and he rival flood in he zeal to emulate he popularity with the mob surpass he in vehemence inveigh against the clause as one intend to make the irish parliament a mere register of the english parliament which it should never become all the argument bring forward in favor of the measure by the supporter of the government -- argument which probably no one would now be find to deny to have be unanswerable -- fail to make the slightest impression on a house in which the chief object of each opponent of the ministry seem to be to outrun he fellow in violence and eventually the measure fall to the ground and for fifteen year more ireland be deprive of the advantage which have be intend for she and even yet the danger from the volunteer be not wholly extinguished though they convention have be suppress its leader have only change they tactic under the guidance of a dublin ironmonger name napper tandy they now propose to convene a congress to consist not as before of delegate from the volunteer body but of person who should be representative of the entire nation and tandy have even the audacity to issue circular to the sheriff of the different county to require they in they official capacity to summon the people to return representative to this congress the sheriff of dublin a man of the name of o'reilly obey the requisition but fitzgibbon who luckily be now attorney-general instantly prosecute he for abuse of he office he be convict fine and imprison and he punishment deter other from follow he example and a rigorous example have become indispensable since it be know to the government that tandy and some of he follower be act in connection with french emissary and that they object be the separation of ireland from england and in the mind of some of they certainly the annexation of the country to france indeed on one occasion fitzgibbon assert in the house of common that he have see resolution invite the french into the country the government would gladly have establish a militia to supersede the volunteer but the temper of the irish parliament in its newly-acquired independence render any such attempt hopeless and mr grattan with a perversity of judgment which he warmest admirer must find it difficult to reconcile with statesmanship if not with patriotism even oppose with extreme bitterness a bill for the establishment of a police for dublin though he could not deny that there exist in the city a organize body of ruffian who make not only the street but even the dwelling-house of the more orderly citizen unsafe by outrage of the worst kind commit on the largest scale -- assault plundering ravishment and murder in the rural district of the south the disturbance be so criminally violent and so incessant that the lord-lieutenant be compel to request the presence of some additional regiment from england as the sole means of preserve any kind of respect for the law and more than once the mob of rioter show themselves so bold and formidable that the soldier be compel to fire in self-defence and order be not restore but at the cost of many life presently a conspiracy bill be pass and gradually the firmness of the government re-establish a certain amount of internal tranquillity but shortly afterward a crisis arise which more than the debate on the commercial proposition or on the volunteer or on the police show how over-liberal have be the confidence of the english minister who have repeal poyning ' act and have bestow independent authority on the irish parliament before the member have learn how to use it we have see how keen a contest be excite in the english parliament by the deranged condition of the king 's health in 1788 and the necessity which consequently arise for the appointment of a regency grattan be in london at the time where he have contract a personal intimacy with fox and have be present by he to the prince of wale whose graciousness of manner and profession of adherence to the whig system of politics secure he attachment to that party grattan be easily indoctrinate by fox with he theory of the indefeasible claim of the prince to the regency as he birthright and be understand to have promise that the irish parliament should adopt that view the case be one which seem unprovided for there be no question but that the law enact that the sovereign of england should also be the sovereign of ireland but no express law of either country contain any such stipulation respect a regent and grattan conceive that in the absence of any pre-existing ordinance it would be easy to contend that the irish parliament be the sole judge who the regent should be and on what term he should exercise the royal authority the irish parliament have be prorogue in 1787 to the 5th of February 1789 the same day on which after numerous examination of the physician in attendance on the royal patient and after the passing of a series of resolution enunciate the principle on which the government be proceed pitt introduce the regency bill into the english house of common be prepare to conduct it through both house with all the despatch that might be consistent with a due observance of all the form of deliberation grattan 's object be to anticipate the decision of the english parliament so as to avoid every appearance that the irish parliament be only follow it and he therefore propose that the house of common should instantly vote a address to the prince request he to take upon himself the regency of the kingdom of ireland by he own natural right as the heir of the crown make sure not only that he advice would be take by those whom he be address but that the house of lord would not venture to dissent from it fitzgibbon as attorney-general and spokesman of the government in the common as a matter of course oppose such precipitate action not only warn he hearer of the folly and danger of take a step which might dissolve the single tie which now connect ireland with great britain but explain also the whole principle of the constitution of the two kingdom so far as it be a joint constitution in term which give he speech a permanent value as a summary of its principle and its character he recall to the recollection of the house the act of william and mary which declare the kingdom of ireland to be annex to the imperial crown of england and the sovereign of england to be by undoubted right sovereign of ireland also and argue from this that mr grattan 's proposal be contrary to the law of the realm and criminal in the extreme the crown of ireland as he tell he hearer and the crown of england be inseparably unite and the irish parliament be totally independent of the british parliament the first of these position be you security the second you freedom and any other language tend to the separation of the crown or the subjection of you parliament the only security of you liberty be the connection with great britain and gentleman who risk break the connection must make up they mind to a union god forbid i should ever see that day but if the day come on which a separation shall be attempt i shall not hesitate to embrace a union rather than a separation he proceed to show that as the irish parliament have itself enact that all bill which pass they two house should require the sanction of the great seal of england they actually have no legal power to confer on the prince of wale such authority as grattan advise he be invest with whatever might be the form of word in which they resolution be couch he point out also that if the irish parliament should insist on appoint the prince of wale regent before it be know whether he would accept the regency of england it be manifestly not impossible that they might be appoint a regent for ireland be a different person from the regent of england and in that case the moment a regent be appoint in great britain he might send a commission under the great seal appoint a lord-lieutenant of ireland and to that commission the regent of ireland would be bind to pay obedience another objection of great force to he mind be that the course recommend by grattan would be a formal appeal from the parliament of england to that of ireland it would sow the seed of dissension between the parliament of the two country and indeed those who be profess themselves advocate for the independence of the irish crown be advocate for its separation from england but the house be too entirely under the influence of grattan 's impassioned eloquence for fitzgibbon 's more sober argument to be listen to the address propose by grattan be carry by acclamation and the peer be scarcely less unanimous in its favor one of the archbishop even dilate on the duty of avail themselves of the opportunity of assert the total independence of ireland even when on a second discussion as to the mode in which the address be to be present to the prince fitzgibbon report that he have consult the chancellor and all the judge and that they be unanimously of opinion that till the regency bill should be pass in england the address be not only improper but treasonable he find he warning equally disregard and when the lord-lieutenant refuse to transmit the address to england on the avowed ground of its illegality grattan propose and carry three resolution : the first that the address be not illegal but that in address the prince to take on himself the regency the parliament of ireland have exercise a undoubted right the second that the lord-lieutenant 's refusal to transmit the address to he royal highness be ill-advised and unconstitutional the third that a deputation from the two house should go to london to present the address to the prince mr fronde affirm that the deputation even when prepare to sail for england be very irresolute and undecided whether to present the address or not from a reasonable fear of incur the penalty of treason to which the lawyer pronounce those who should present it liable but they courage be not put to the test as have be already see before the end of the month the king 's recovery be announce and the question of a regency do not occur again till the irish parliament have be unite to the english since lord rockingham 's concession in 1782 the project of a legislative union between the two country resemble that which united scotland to england have more than once be broach we have see it allude to by fitzgibbon in the course of these discussion and it be no new idea it have be discuss even before the union with scotland be complete and have then be regard in ireland with feeling very different from those which prevail at a later period ten year after the time of which we be speak grattan denounce the scheme with almost frantic violence fitzgibbon -lrb- though after the rebellion he recommend it as indispensable -rrb- as yet regard it only as a alternative which though he might eventually embrace it he should not accept without extreme reluctance but at the beginning of the century all party among the protestant irish have be eager for it and even the lead roman catholic have be not unwilling to acquiesce in it unluckily the english minister be unable to shake off the influence of the english manufacturer and they in another development of the selfish and wicked jealousy which have lead they in william 's reign to require the suppression of the irish woollen manufacture now in anne 's rise against the proposal of a legislative union -lrb- 133 -rrb- in blindness which be not only fatal but suicidal also they persuade themselves that the union would make ireland rich and that england 's interest be to keep she poor as if it have be possible for one portion of the kingdom to increase in prosperity without every other portion benefit also by the improvement however in the reign of anne the union be a question only of expediency or of wisdom the wide divergence of the two parliament on this question of the regency transform it into a question of necessity the king might have a relapse the irish parliament on a recurrence of the crisis might re-affirm its late resolution might frame another address to the prince of wale and there might be no alternative between see two different person regent of england and ireland or what would be nearly the same thing see the same person regent of the two country on different grounds and exercise a different authority and if these proceedings of the irish parliament have work in the mind of the great english minister a conviction of the absolute necessity of prevent a recurrence of such danger by the only practicable means open to he -- the fusion of it into one body with the english parliament by a legislative union -- the occurrence of the ensue ten year enforce that conviction with a weight still more irresistible it have be see how stir a influence the revolutionary fever engender by the overthrow of the french monarchy for a time exert even over the calmer temper of englishman in ireland where ever since sarsfield and he brave garrison enlist under the banner of loui xiv a connection more or less intimate with france have be constantly keep up the event in paris have produce a far deeper and wider effect more than one demagogue among the volunteer have avow a desire to see the whole country transfer its allegiance from the english to the french sovereign and this preference be more pronounced after the triumph of democracy in the french capital for the leader of the movement themselves nearly all man of the lowest degree denounce the irish noble with almost as much vehemence as the english connection yet pitt 's policy dictate partly by a spirit of conciliation and still more by feeling of justice be gradually remove many of the grievance of which the irish have real reason to complain next to the restriction on trade nothing have make such a impression on he mind as the iniquity of the penal law and those he proceed to repeal encourage the introduction of bill to throw open the profession of the law to roman catholic to allow they seat on the magistrate ' bench and commission in the army and to grant they the electoral franchise a concession which he himself would willingly have extend by admit they to parliament itself but these relaxation of the old penal code important as they be only conciliate the higher class of the roman catholic most of the roman catholic prelate and most of the roman catholic lay noble proclaim they satisfaction at what have be do and they good-will toward the minister who have do it but the professional agitator be exasperated rather than conciliate at find so much of the ground on which they have rest cut from beneath they foot so desirous be pitt to carry conciliation to the greatest length that could be consistent with safety that he hold more than one conference with grattan himself but he find that great orator not very manageable partly as it may seem from some of mr windham 's letter through jealousy of fitzgibbon who be now the irish chancellor -lrb- 134 -rrb- and still more from a desire to propitiate the roman catholic for whom he demand complete and immediate emancipation while pitt who be probably already resolve on accomplish a legislative union think as far as we can judge that emancipation should follow not precede the union lest if it should precede it it might prove rather a stumbling-block in the way than a stepping-stone to the still more important measure it be not very easy to determine what influence the emancipation as it be rather absurdly call -lrb- 135 -rrb- if it have be grant at that time might have have in quiet the prevail discontent with one large party it would probably have increase it for there be quite as great a inclination to insurrection in ulster as in leinster or munster and with the northern presbyterian animosity to popery be at least as powerful a feeling as sympathy with the french republican a subsequent chapter however will afford a more fitting opportunity for discuss the argument in favor of or against emancipation what seem certain be that a large party among the roman catholic of the lower class value emancipation itself principally as a measure to another end -- a separation from england pitt meanwhile hopeless of reconcile the leader of the different party -- the impulsive enthusiasm of grattan with the sober practical wisdom of fitzgibbon -- pursue he own policy of conciliation unite with vigor and one of the measure which he now carry subsist unaltered in its principle to the present day there be no part of the penal law of which the folly and iniquity be more intolerable than the restriction which they impose on education to a certain extent they defeat themselves the clause which subject to severe penalty a roman catholic parent who send he child abroad to enjoy the benefit of a education which he be not allow to receive at home be manifestly almost incapable of enforcement and the youth design for order in the romish church have be invariably send to foreign college -- some to douai or st omer in france some to the renowned spanish university of salamanca but the french college have be sweep away by the revolution which also make a passage to spain -lrb- the greater expense of which have at all time confine that resource to a small number of student -rrb- more difficult and the consequence be that in 1794 the roman catholic primate dr troy petition the government to grant a royal license for the endowment of a college in ireland justice and policy be equally in favor of the grant of such a request for the sake of the whole kingdom and even for that of protestantism itself it be better that the roman catholic priesthood should be a educate rather than a ignorant body of man and in the temper which at that time prevail over the western country of the continent it be at least equally desirable that the rise generation should be preserve from the contagion of the revolutionary principle which the present ruler of france be so industrious to propagate pitt at once embrace the idea and in the spring of the next year a bill be introduce into the irish parliament by the chief secretary authorize the foundation and endowment of a college at maynooth in the neighborhood of dublin for the education of roman catholic generally whether destine for the church or for lay profession it be a singular circumstance that the only opposition to the measure come from grattan and he party who urge that as the roman catholic have recently be allow to matriculate and take degree at trinity college though not to share in the endowment of that wealthy institution the endowment of another college to be exclusively confine to roman catholic would be a retrograde step undoing the benefit of the recent concession of the authority of trinity would be a revival and re-enactment of the principle of separation and exclusion and a injury to the whole community for as he wisely contend nothing be so important to the well-doing of the entire people as the extinction of the religious animosity which have hitherto embittered the feeling of each church toward the other and nothing could so surely tend to that extinction as the unite the member of both from they earliest youth in the pursuit both of knowledge and amusement as school-fellow and playmate if mr froude 's interpretation of the motive of those who influence grattan on this occasion be correct he be unconsciously make a tool of by those whose real object be a separation from england of the attainment of which they despair unless they could unite protestant and roman catholic in its prosecution the bill however be pass by a very large majority and # 9000 a year be appropriate to the endowment of the college half a century afterward as will be see that endowment be enlarged and place on a more solid and permanent footing by one of the ablest of pitt 's successor it be a wise and just measure and if its success have not entirely answer the expectation of the minister who grant it its comparative failure have be owe to circumstance which the acutest judgment could not have foresee but it seem certain that neither the concession nor the refusal of any demand put forward by any party in ireland could have prevent the insurrection which break out shortly afterward there be two party among the disaffected irish -- or it should perhaps rather be say that two different object be keep in view by they -- one of which the establishment of a republic be dearer to one section of the malcontent separation from england with the contingency of annexation to france be the more immediate aim of the other though the present existence of a republican form of government in france to a great extent unite the two as have be mention before the original mover in the conspiracy be of low extraction dublin tradesman in a small way of business napper tandy be a ironmonger wolfe tone be the son of a coach-maker but they have obtain a recruit of a very different class a younger son of the duke of leinster lord edward fitzgerald a man of very slender capacity who at he first entrance into parliament when scarcely more than of age have make himself remarkable by a furious denunciation of pitt 's irish proposition have marry a natural daughter of the duke of orlean a prince in spite of he royal birth one of the most profligate and ferocious of the french jacobin and have catch the revolutionary mania to such a degree that he abjure he nobility and substitute for the appellation which mark he rank the title of citizen fitzgerald he have enrol himself in a society know as the unite irishman and have go to france as its plenipotentiary to arrange with hoche one of the most brilliant and popular of the french general a scheme for the invasion of ireland in which he promise he that on he landing he should be join by ten of thousand of armed irishmen hoche enter warmly into the plan be furnish with a splendid army by the director and in December 1796 set sail for ireland but the fleet which carry he be disperse in a storm many of the ship be wreck other be capture by the british cruiser and the remnant of the fleet sadly cripple be glad to regain its harbor two year afterward another invade expedition have still worse fortune general humbert who in 1796 have be one of hoche 's officer do succeed in effect a landing at killalum bay in mayo but he and the whole of he force be speedily surround and compel to surrender and a month afterward a large squadron with a more powerful division of troops under general hardy on board find itself unable to effect a landing but fall in with a squadron under sir john warren who capture every ship but two wolfe tone who be on board one of they be take prisoner and only escape the gallows by suicide this happen in October 1798 but it be difficult to conceive with what object these last expedition have be despatch from france at all for in the precede summer the rebellion of the irish have break out and have be totally crush in a few week -lrb- 136 -rrb- not without terrible loss of life on both side nor without the insurgent leader -- though many of they be gentleman of good birth fortune and education and still more be clergy -- show a ferocity and ingenuity in cruelty which the worst of the french jacobin have scarcely exceed one of the saddest circumstance of the whole rebellion be that the insurgent who have burn man woman and child alive who have deliberately hack other to piece against whom they do not profess to have a single ground of complaint beyond the fact that they be english and protestant find advocate in both house of the english parliament who declare that the rebellion be owe to the severity of the irish viceroy and he chief councillor who deny that the rebel have solicit french aid and who even vote against grant to the government the re-enforcement necessary to prevent a revival of the treason the rebellion be crush with such celerity as might have convince the most disaffected of the insanity of defy the power of great britain but it be certain that the spirit which prompt the rebellion be not extinguish and that as it have be feed before so it would continue to be feed by the factious spirit of member of the irish house of common and of those who could return member -lrb- 137 -rrb- so long as ireland have a separate parliament not indeed that pitt require the argument in favor of a union which be thus furnish the course adopt by the irish parliament on the regency question be quite sufficient to show how great a mistake have be make by the repeal of poyning ' act but what the rebellion prove be that the union would not admit of a instant 's delay and pitt at once apply himself to the task of frame a measure which while it should strengthen england by the removal of the necessity for a constant watchfulness over every transaction and movement in ireland should at the same time confer on and secure to ireland substantial advantage such as without a union the english parliament could scarcely be induce to contemplate mr hallam in one of the last chapter of he work -lrb- 138 -rrb- while show by unanswerable argument the advantage which scotland have derive from she union with england have also enumerate some of the cause which impede the minister of the day in he endeavor to render it acceptable to the scotch member to whom it be propose the most apparently substantial of these be the unprecedented character of the measure no past experience of history be favorable to the absorption of a lesser state at least where the government partake so much of the republican form in one of superior power and ancient rivalry but in the case of the present measure what have thus be a difficulty in the scotch union might have be expect to be regard as a argument in its favor since the keenest patriot among the scotch have long be convince that the union have bring a vast increase of prosperity and importance to they country and what be now confess to have prove advantageous to scotland might naturally be expect to be equally beneficial to ireland another obstacle have be the fear of the danger to which the presbyterian church might be expose when bring thus within the power of a legislature so frequently influence by one which hold she not as a sister but rather a bastard usurper to a sister 's inheritance but here again experience might give she testimony in favor of a irish union since it be incontestable that those apprehension -- which no doubt many earnest scotchman have sincerely entertain -- have not be realize but that since the union the presbyterian church have enjoy as great security as complete independence and as absolute a authority over its member as in the preceding century that the parliament have never attempt the slightest interference with its exercise of its privilege and that the church of england have be equally free from the exhibition of any desire to stimulate the parliament to such action while the roman catholic church which have many more adherent in england than the presbyterian church have ever have be quite powerful enough to exact for itself the maintenance of its rights and the minister be quite willing to grant equal security to those which at the beginning of the century have be think sufficient for the church of scotland a third reason which we great historical critic put forward for the disfavor with which the union be at the time regard by many high-minded scotchman he find in the gross prostitution with which a majority sell themselves to the surrender of they own legislative existence that similar means be to some extent employ to win over opponent of the government in ireland can not it must be confess be deny though the temptation hold out to convert oftener take the shape of title promotion appointment and court favor than of actual money the most recent historian of this period -- who to say the least be not biass in favor of either the english or irish government of the period -- pronounce as he opinion form after the most careful research that the bribery be on the other side cornwalli and castlereagh -lrb- the lord-lieutenant and the chief secretary -rrb- both declare it to be within they knowledge that the opposition offer four thousand pound ready money for a vote but they name only one man who be purchase and he vote be obtain for four thousand pound from the language of lord cornwalli it be certain that if money be spend by the government in this way it be without he knowledge but many thing may have be do by the inferior agent of the government and possibly by castlereagh himself which they would not venture to lay before the lord-lieutenant it appear however from the papers which have recently come to light that the prevalent belief of the union have be mainly effect by a lavish expenditure of money be not well-founded still it be certain that some money be expend in this way besides actual payment for vote he add that a very large sum -- a hundred thousand pound -- be say to have be expend in the purchase of seat the holder of which be of course to vote against the measure and name lord downshire as subscribe # 5000 lord lismore and mr white # 3000 each while the government fund be chiefly expend in engaging -lrb- 139 -rrb- young barrister of the four court to write for the union but even if it be true that corruption be employ to the very utmost extent that be ever allege by the most vehement opponent of the measure and of the government it may be fear that very few of the last century irishman would have be so shocked at it as to consider that fact a objection to the union especially it be sad and shameful to say among the upper class the poorer class those who could render no political service to a minister as be consequently beneath official notice be unassailed by he temptation but the demoralization of the man of rank and property be almost universal and few seat be dispose of few vote be give except in return for favor grant or out of discontent at favor refuse and it can not be deny that the tendency to political jobbery have not be diminish by the concession of 1782 if indeed it may not be say that the increase importance which those concession have give to the irish parliament have lead the member of both house to place a increase value on they service certainly no previous lord-lieutenant have give such description of the universality of the demand make on he as be forward to the english government by those who hold that office in the sixteen year precede the outbreak of the rebellion it be remarkable that the transaction which as have be say before may be conceive to have first force on pitt 's mind the conviction of the absolute necessity of the union -- namely the course pursue by the irish parliament on the regency bill -- bear a close resemblance to that which above all other consideration have make the scotch union indispensable namely the act of security pass by the scottish estate in 1703 which actually provide that on the decease of queen anne without issue the estate should name she successor but should be debar from choose the admit successor to the crown of england unless such form of government be settle as should fully secure the religion freedom and trade of the scottish nation -lrb- 140 -rrb- the scotch estate therefore have absolutely regard the possible separation of the two kingdom as a contingency which might become not undesirable and though it be too ticklish a argument to bring forward it may very possibly have occur to pitt that a similar vote of the irish parliament be not impossible the claim which grattan follow fox have set up on behalf of the prince of wale be one of a indefeasible right to the regency and as far as right by inheritance go he claim to the crown if or whenever a vacancy should occur be far less disputable but as have be mention in the last chapter a question have already be raise whether he royal highness have not forfeit he right to the succession and it be quite possible that that question might be renew the fact of the prince 's marriage to a roman catholic be by this time generally accept as certain the birth of the princess charlotte give greater importance to the circumstance than it seem to have while the prince remain childless and if the performance of the marriage ceremony should be legally prove and the english law court should pronounce that the legal invalidity of the marriage do not protect the prince from the penalty of forfeiture it be highly probable that the irish parliament would take a different view -- would refuse in spite of the bill of rights to regard marriage with a roman catholic as a disqualification but would recognize the prince of wale as king of ireland several minor consideration such as the desirableness of uniformity in the proceedings of the two country with respect to money bill the mutiny act and other arrangement of parliamentary detail all point the same way and on the whole it may be say that scarcely any of the opponent of the government measure be find to deny its expediency especially as regard the interest of great britain the objection which be make be urge on different grounds in the irish house of common a member who though a young man have already establish a very high reputation for professional skill as a barrister for eloquence equally suit to the bar and to the senate and for sincere and incorruptible patriotism mr plunkett take upon himself to deny the competency of the irish parliament to pass a bill not only to extinguish its own existence but to prevent the birth of any future parliament and to declare that the act if it should be pass would be a mere nullity and that no man in ireland would be bind to obey it and in the english house of common mr gray may be think to have adopt something of the same view when he propose a amendment to suspend all proceedings on the subject till the sentiment of the people of ireland respect that measure could be ascertain he do not of course deny -lrb- he be speak on the 21st of April 1800 -rrb- that the bill have be pass by both house of the irish parliament by considerable majority -lrb- 141 -rrb- but he contend that that parliament do not speak the sentiment of the people and that be the case that its voice be of no authority it be evident that all argument found on a denial of the omnipotence of a parliament whether english or irish be invalid the question of that omnipotence as have be see in a former chapter have be fully discuss when mr pitt 's father deny the power of parliament to tax the american colony and that question may fairly be regard as have be settle at that time it be equally clear that the denial that on any question whatever the house of common must be take to speak the sentiment of the constituency whether the proposal of such question have be contemplate at the time of they election or not be the advancement of a doctrine wholly inconsistent with we parliamentary constitution and one which would practically be the parent of endless agitation and mischief to expect that the member could pronounce on no new question without a fresh reference to they constituent would be to reduce they from the position of representative to that of delegate such as that of the member of the old states-general in france whose early decay be attribute by the ablest political writer in no small degree to the dependence of the member on they constituent for precise instruction another argument on which mr gray insist with great earnestness be worth preserve though subsequent invention have destroy its force he contend that the example of the scotch union do not when properly consider afford any argument in favor of a irish union from the difference of situation of the two country scotland be a part of the same island as england there be no physical impediment to rapid and constant communication the relative situation of the two country be such that the king himself could administer the executive government in both and there be no occasion for a separate establishment be keep up in each but the sea lay between england and ireland and the delay and sometimes difficulty which be thus interpose render it necessary that ireland should have a separate government and he affirm that this be a insuperable bar to a beneficial union quote a say of lord somer that if it be necessary to preserve a separate executive government at edinburgh after the union he would abandon the measure mr gray even deny that the prosperity of scotland since the union be mainly attributable to that measure it be not the union it be the adoption of a liberal policy the application of a proper remedy to the particular evil under which the country labor that remove the cause which have impede the prosperity of scotland but this argument be clearly open to the reply that the adoption of that liberal policy have be a direct effect of the union and would have be impracticable without it and be therefore a strong inducement to the adoption of a similar union with ireland where the exist evil be at least as great as those which a century before have keep down scotland another of he argument have be remarkably falsify by the event with a boldness in put forward what be manifestly indeed avowedly a party objection and which as such must be look upon as somewhat singular he find a reason for resist the addition of a hundred irish member to the british house of common in the probability that they would as a general rule be subservient to the minister he instance the uniform support which the member for scotland have give to every act of minister and see in that example reason to apprehend that the irish member would become a no less regular band of ministerial adherent it would be superfluous to point out how entirely contrary the result have be to the prediction it be however beside the purpose of this work to dwell on the argument by which the minister support he proposal or on those with which the opposition resist it whether apparently found on practical consideration such as those bring forward by mr gray or those of a more sentimental character which rest on the loss of national dignity and honor which it be assume would be the consequence of the measure it seem desirable rather to explain the principal condition on which the union be to be effect as pitt explain it to the house of common in April 1800 in the preceding year he have confine himself to move a series of resolution in favor of the principle which though they be adopt by both house in england he do not at that time endeavor to carry farther since in the irish house of common the utmost exertion of the government could only prevail by a single vote -lrb- 142 -rrb- and he naturally think such a majority far too slender to justify he rely on it so far as to proceed farther with a measure of such vast importance but during the recess he have introduce some modification into he original draft of the measure which though slight be sufficient to conciliate much additional support and the consequence be that in February of this year both the irish house accept it by sufficient majority -lrb- 143 -rrb- and therefore he now feel able to lay the detail of the measure before the english parliament to take they in the order in which he enumerate they that which have appear to the irish parliament the first and most important be the share which the irish constituency ought to have in the representation of the house of common on this point the parliament of ireland be of opinion that the number of representative for ireland ought to be one hundred and he be not dispose to differ from the conclusion to which it have come he regard it indeed as a matter of but small importance whether the number of representative from one part of the unite empire be greater or less if they be enough to make know the local want to state the interest and convey the sentiment of the part of the empire they represent it would produce that degree of general security which would be want in any vain attempt to obtain that degree of theoretical perfection about which in modern time they have hear so much he approve of the principle which have be lay down upon this part of the subject in the parliament of ireland -- a reference to the suppose population of the two country and to the propose rate of contribution the proportion of contribution propose to be establish be seven and a half for great britain and one for ireland while in the proportion of population great britain be to ireland as two and a half or three to one -lrb- 144 -rrb- so that the result on a combination of these two calculation would be something more than five to one in favor of great britain which be about the proportion which it be propose to establish between the representation of the two country the principle of selection of the constituency which have be adopt he likewise consider most equitable and satisfactory for ireland the plan propose be that the member of the county and the principal commercial city should remain entire the remain member be to be select from those place which be the most considerable in point of population and wealth this be the only plan which could be adopt without trench on the constitution it introduce no theoretical reform in the constitution or in the representation of this country it make no distinction between different parliamentary rights nor any alteration even the slightest in the internal form of parliament another consideration which he have keep in mind in frame this measure be this : by the law of england care have be take to prevent the influence of the crown from become too great by too many office be hold by member of parliament and pitt have no doubt that there would be a general feeling that some provision ought to be make on this subject in the arrangement for the new parliament at present among the representative of the county and great commercial town whose seat be to be preserve in the new unite parliament there be not above five or six who hold office and though it be impossible to estimate the possible number of place-holder with precision he think what would he most fair for he to propose would be that no more than twenty of the irish member should hold place and that if it should happen that a greater number do hold place during pleasure then those who have last accept they should vacate they seat in the house of peer he propose that twenty-eight lord temporal of ireland should have seat in the unite parliament who should be elect for life by the peer of ireland -- a arrangement which differ from that which at the beginning of the century have be adopt for the representative peer of scotland but he argue and surely with great reason that the choice of peer to represent the irish nobility for life be a mode that be more congenial to the general spirit and system of a peerage than that of they be septennially elect as the nobility of scotland be of the spiritual peer four be to sit in rotation to the lay peer a farther privilege be give which the minister regard as of considerable and even constitutional importance by the article of the scotch union a peer if not choose as a representative of the peerage be not eligible as a candidate for the house of common in either england or scotland but this bill reserve a right to the peer of ireland who should not be elect to represent they own peerage to be elect member of the house of common of the unite parliament of great britain and pitt urge that this be a far better mode of treatment than have be adopt for the nobility of scotland so that a nobleman of ireland if not represent he own order might be choose as a legislator by a class of inferior rank which he be so far from regard as improper that he deem it in a high degree advantageous to the empire analogous to the practice as well as friendly to the spirit of the british constitution and he enforce he argument by point out with honest pride the advantage which in that respect the spirit and practice of we constitution give to we nobility over the noble of other country we know full well he continue the advantage we have experience from have in this house those who in the course of descent as well as in hope of merit have have a prospect of sit in we house of peer those therefore who object to this part of the arrangement -lrb- for as he have previously mention it have be make a subject not only of objection but of ridicule -rrb- can only do so from the want of due attention to the true character of we constitution one of the great leading advantage of which be that a person may for a long time be a member of one branch of the legislature and have it in view to become a member of another branch of it this it be which constitute the lead difference between the nobility of great britain and those of other country with we they be permit to have legislative power before they arrive at they higher station and as they be like all the rest of mankind to be improve by experience in the science of legislation as well as in every other science we constitution afford they that opportunity by they be eligible to seat in this house from the time of they majority this be one of those circumstance which arise frequently in practice but the advantage of which do not appear in theory till chance happen to cast they before we and make they subject of discussion these be the shades of the british constitution in which its latent beauty consist and he affirm he conviction that this privilege would prove a advantage to the nobility of ireland and a improvement in the system of representation in the house it will hardly be deny that the arrangement that the representative peer of ireland should enjoy they seat for life do make it desirable that those who be not so elect to the upper house should be eligible as candidate for a place in the lower house otherwise those who be not choose as representative of the peerage would have be place in the anomalous and unfair position of be the only person in the kingdom possess of the requisite property qualification and not disqualify by sex or profession who be absolutely exclude from the opportunity of distinguish themselves and serve they country in parliament how great the practical benefit to the house of common and the country the clause he be recommend be calculate to confer be show in a remarkable manner the very year of he death when a irish peer be return to the house of common who retain he seat for nearly sixty year as the representative of different constituency the university of cambridge being among the number during the course of that period rise through a variety of office to that of prime-minister and as be admit even by those who dissent most widely from some of he opinion and action earn for himself a honorable reputation as one who have render faithful service to the crown and on more than one occasion have confer substantial benefit on the country the arrangement propose with respect to the peer be not oppose but mr gray -- generally act as the spokesman of the opposition on this question -- raise a objection to make so large a addition as that of one hundred new member to the british house of common he repeat he prophecy make on a previous occasion of the subserviency to the minister which the irish member might be expect to exhibit and therefore move a amendment to reduce the number of irish representative to eighty-five but to obviate the discontent which such a reduction might be expect to excite in ireland he propose to diminish the number of english member also by disfranchise forty of the most decayed borough a step which would leave the number of member in the new unite parliament as nearly as possible the same as it be before he find however very few to agree with he he amendment be reject by 176 to 34 and the minister 's proposal be adopt in all its detail mr pitt touch lightly on the next article which limit the royal prerogative of create peer by a provision that the king should never confer any fresh irish peerage till three peerage should have become extinct this again be a point of difference between the condition of the scotch and irish union since by the term of the scotch union the king be forever debar from create any new scotch peerage but it be point out that the greater antiquity of the scotch peerage and the circumstance that in scotland the title descend to collateral branch be calculate to make the extinction of a scotch peerage a event of very rare occurrence while the comparative newness -lrb- with very few exception -rrb- of irish peerage and the rule by which they be confine to immediate male descendant render the entire extinction of the irish peerage probable if the power of add to or make up the number be not give to the crown recent legislation have give such importance to the next resolution that it will be well to quote he precise word : 5 that it would be fit to propose as the fifth article of union that the church of that part of great britain call england and of ireland shall be unite into one church and that when he majesty shall summon a convocation the archbishop bishop and clergy of the several province in ireland shall be respectively summon to and sit in the convocation of the unite church in the like manner and subject to the same regulation as to election and qualification as be at present by law establish with respect to the like order of the church of england and that the doctrine worship discipline and government of the say unite church shall be preserve as now by law establish for the church of england save to the church of ireland all the rights privilege and jurisdiction now thereunto belong and that the doctrine worship discipline and government of the church of scotland shall likewise be preserve as now by law and by the act of union establish for the church of scotland and that the continuance and preservation forever of the say unite church as the established church of that part of the say unite kingdom call england and ireland shall be deem and take to be a essential and fundamental article and condition of the union pitt 's comment on this article be so brief as to show that he regard its justice as well as its importance too obvious to need any elaborate justification he point out that that portion of it which related to convocation have be add by the irish parliament and would only say on so interesting a subject that the prosperity of the irish church could never be permanent unless it be a part of the union to leave as a guard a power to the unite parliament to make some provision in this respect as a fence beyond any act of they own that could at present be agree on but while he thus show he conviction that the permanent prosperity of the irish church be essential to the welfare of the kingdom he be by no means insensible to the claim of the roman catholic church -lrb- as found not more in policy than in justice -rrb- to be place in some degree on a footing of equality with it not only by a recognition of the dignity of its minister but also by a endowment which should be proportion to they requirement and should place they in a position of worldly competence and comfort for which hitherto they have be dependent on they flock -lrb- 145 -rrb- to use the expression of a modern statesman he contemplate level up not level down perhaps it may be say that he contemplate level up as the surest and most permanent obstacle to any proposal of level down at the same time it be fair to remark that the argument which on a recent occasion be so strongly press by the champion of the church that it be beyond the power of parliament to repeal what be here declare to be a essential and fundamental article and condition of the union be untenable on every consideration of the power of parliament and indeed of common-sense since it would be a intolerable evil and one productive of the worst consequence if the doctrine be admit that any parliament could make a unchangeable law and bind its successor forever and moreover since the very word of this article do clearly imply the power of parliament over the church the power assert to make some provision for the permanence of its prosperity clearly involve a power to make provision of a opposite character the expediency or impolicy the propriety or unrighteousness of a measure must always depend on the merit of the question itself at the time and not on the judgment or intention of legislator of a earlier generation and advocate weaken instead of strengthen they case when they put forward argument which however plausible or acceptable to they own partisan be nevertheless capable of refutation the next article related to a question of paramount practical importance and of special interest since as have be see before there be no subject on which the past legislation of the english parliament have be so discreditable but the jealousy of english manufacturer though it have prevail over the indifference of william iii who reserve all he solicitude for matter of foreign diplomacy could find no echo in the large mind and sound commercial and financial knowledge of the modern statesman he lay it down as the principle of he legislation on this subject -- a principle which he be sure that every gentleman in the house be ready to admit -- that the consequence of the union ought to be a perfect freedom of trade whether of produce or manufacture without exception if possible that a deviation from that principle ought to be make only when adhering to it might possibly shake some large capital or materially diminish the effect of the labor of the inhabitant or suddenly and violently shock the receive opinion or popular prejudice of a large portion of the people but that on the whole the communication between the two kingdom should in spirit be free that no jealousy should be attempt to be create between the manufacturer of one place or the other upon the subject of ` raw material ' or any other article for it would surely be consider very narrow policy and as such would be treat with derision be a attempt make to create a jealousy between devonshire and cornwall between lancashire and durham he say then that the principle of the union on this head should be liberal and free and that no departure from it should ever take place but upon some point of present unavoidable necessity he be even able to add -lrb- and he must have feel peculiar satisfaction in make the statement since the change in the feeling of the english manufacturer on the subject must have be mainly the fruit of he own teaching and be a practical recognition of the benefit which they have derive from he commercial policy take as a whole -rrb- that the english manufacturer do not wish for any protective duty all they desire be free intercourse with all the world and though the want of protective duty might occasion they partial loss they think it amply compensate by the general advantage he even think the arrangement now to be make would encourage the growth of wool in ireland and that england would be able to draw supplies of it from thence and he do not fear that there would be trade enough for both country in the market of the world and in the market which each country would afford to the other the english manufacturer do not however acquiesce very cheerfully in every part of he commercial arrangement on the contrary against the clause which repeal all prohibition of or bounty on exportation of different article grow or manufacture in either country they petition and even set up a claim which be grant to be hear by counsel and to produce witness but pitt steadily refuse the least modification of this part of he measure not merely on account of its intrinsic reasonableness and justice but because there be scarcely any condition to which the irish themselves attach greater importance a equally important and more difficult matter to adjust to the satisfaction of both parliament be the apportionment of the financial burden between the two nation it would be tiresome as well as superfluous to enter into minute detail the more so as the arrangement propose be of a temporary character after a long and minute discussion pitt 's appraisement be admit to come as near to strict fairness and equity as any that could be make the separate discharge of its public debt already incur be leave to each kingdom and it be farther settle that for twenty year fifteen part of the expense of the nation out of seventeen should be bear by great britain and two by ireland other article provide that the law and court of both kingdom civil and ecclesiastical should remain in they exist condition subject of course to such alteration as the united legislature might hereafter deem desirable the resolution when adopt -- as they speedily be -- be embody in a bill which pass through the last stage by receive the royal assent at the beginning of July the state of public feeling in ireland be not yet sufficiently calm down after the rebellion for it to be prudent to venture on a general election and it be consequently ordain that the member for the irish county and for those irish borough which have be select for the retention of representation should take they seat in the unite parliament on its next meeting on the 22d of January 1801 the unite or to give it its more proper designation the imperial parliament hold its first meeting be although in its sixth session so far regard as a new parliament that the king direct a fresh election of a speaker the union as thus effect be so far a vital change in the constitution of both great britain and ireland that it greatly alter the situation in which each kingdom have previously stand to the other till 1782 the position of ireland toward england have be one of entire political subordination and though that have in appearance be modify by the repeal of poyning ' act yet no one doubt or could doubt that whenever the resolution of the two parliament come into conflict the irish parliament would find submission unavoidable but by the union that subordination be terminate forever the character of the union -- of the condition that be on which the two country be unite -- be one of perfect and complete equality on all important point indeed in all matter whatever except one or two of minor consequence where some irremovable difference between they compel some trifling variation it be not a connection of domination on the one side and subordination on the other where every concomitant circumstance might tempt the one to overbearing arrogance while the other could not escape a feeling of humiliation it be rather -- to quote the eloquent peroration of pitt when in the preceding year he first introduce the subject to the consideration of the house of common -- a free and voluntary association of two great country join for they common benefit in one empire where each retain its proportionate weight and importance under the security of equal law reciprocal affection and inseparable interest and which want nothing but that indissoluble connection to render both invincible on that occasion pitt have argue from the great subsequent increase in the population and wealth of edinburgh and glasgow and in the prosperity of the whole country of scotland that a similar result might be look for in ireland and the general trade of ireland and especially the linen manufacture within a very few year begin to realize he prediction so that it be strange to find fox on the great minister 's death five year afterward reiterate he disapproval of the union as a plea for refuse he the appellation of a great statesman -lrb- 146 -rrb- in one point alone the intrigue of a colleague prevent pitt from carry out to the full he liberal and enlighten view and compel he to leave the union incomplete in a matter of such pre-eminent importance that it may be say that all the subsequent disquietude which have prevent ireland from reap the full benefit he desire from the union be traceable to he disappointment on that subject -lrb- 147 -rrb- we have see that he contemplate as a natural and necessary consequence or even part of the union a extensive reform of the law affect the roman catholic indeed the understanding that he be prepare to introduce a measure with that object have no small weight in conciliate in some quarter support to the act of union accordingly when describe the arrangement which he have in view for the church of ireland he indicate he intention with sufficient plainness by the statement that it might be proper to leave to parliament a opportunity of consider what might be fit to be do for he majesty 's catholic subject word which be generally understand to express he feeling that both justice and policy require the removal of the restriction which debar the roman catholic from the complete enjoyment of political privilege but the history and different bearing of that question it will be more convenient to discuss in a subsequent chapter when we shall have arrive at the time when it be partially deal with by the ministry of the duke of wellington note : -lrb- footnote 125 : mr froude say four great family -- the fitzgerald of kildare the boyle the ponsonby and the beresford --

unavoidable at the time when no ship could be certain of get from holyhead to dublin in less than three week he pronounce inconsistent with the fusion of the two people which be the object of the

but it be at all event plain that the reason arise from the difficulty and uncertainty of communication which make its abolition impossible at the beginning of the century have pass away with the introduction of steam-vessel and telegraph communication of london with dublin be now as rapid as communication with edinburgh and that be the case it be not easy to see how a establishment which have never be think of for scotland can be desirable for ireland -rrb- chapter vi a census be order -- dissolution of pitt 's administration -- impeachment of lord melville -- introduction of lord ellenborough into the cabinet -- abolition of the slave-trade -- mr windham 's compulsory training bill -- illness of the king and regency -- recurrence to the precedent of 1788 - ' 89 -- death of mr perceval -- lord liverpool become prime-minister -- question of appointment in the household -- appointment of a prime-minister the union with ireland be the last great work of pitt 's first administration and a noble close to the legislation of the eighteenth century but the last month of the year be also signalize by another enactment which though it can not be say to have anything of a character strictly entitle to the name of constitutional nevertheless establish a practice so valuable as the foundation of a great part of we domestic legislation that it will perhaps hardly be consider foreign to the scope and purpose of this volume to record its commencement in November 1800 mr abbott the member for helstone bring in a bill to take a census of the people of the unite kingdom point out not only the general importance of a knowledge of the population of a country in its entire amount and its different class to every government but also its special bearing on agriculture and on the means requisite to provide subsistence for the people on trade and manufacture and on we resource for war such a census as he propose have be more than once take in holland sweden spain and even in the united state young as be they separate national existence it have be take once -- nearly fifty year previous -- in scotland and something like one have be furnish in england in the reign of edward iii by a subsidy roll and in that of elizabeth by diocesan return furnish by the bishop to the privy council -lrb- 148 -rrb- he farther argue for the necessity of such a proceeding from the different notion entertain by man of sanguine or desponding temper as to the increase or diminution of the population some despond man have assert that the population have decrease by a million and a half between the revolution and peace of pari in 1763 other -lrb- of whom the speaker himself be one -rrb- believe that on the contrary it have increase in that interval by two million he motion be unanimously adopt by both house and when the census be take its real result furnish as strong a proof of its usefulness as any of the mover 's argument by the extent of the prevail miscalculation which it detect for mr abbott who have spare no pain to arrive at a correct estimate while he mention that some person reckon the population of england and wale at 8000000 pronounce that accord to other statement form on a more extensive investigation and as it seem to he on a more correct train of reasoning the total number could not be less than 11000000 in point of fact exclude those employ in the army and navy who be nearly half a million the number for england and wale fall short of nine million -lrb- 149 -rrb- it would be quite superfluous to dilate on the value of the information thus supply without which indeed much of we subsequent legislation on poor-laws corn-law and all matter relate to rating and taxation would have be impracticable or the merest guesswork as be mention in the precede chapter pitt find himself unable to fulfil the hope which in he negotiation with different party in ireland he have lead the roman catholic to entertain of the removal of they civil and political disability so rigorous be those restriction both in england and ireland that a roman catholic could not serve even as a private in the militia and a motion make in 1797 by mr wilberforce -- a man who could certainly not be suspect of any lean to roman catholic doctrine -- to render they admissible to that service though it be adopt in the house of common be reject by the house of lord but pitt who on that occasion have support wilberforce do not confine he view to the removal of a single petty disability but propose to put the whole body of roman catholic on a footing of perfect equality with protestant in respect of they eligibility to every kind of office with one or two exception and during the autumn of 1800 he be busily engage in frame the detail of he measure in order to submit it to he royal master in its entirety and so to avoid disquieting he with a repetition of discussion on the subject which he know to be distasteful to he for five year before george iii have consult the chief-justice lord kenyon and the attorney-general sir john scott -lrb- afterward lord eldon -rrb- on the question whether some propose concession to dissenter protestant as well as roman catholic do not militate against the coronation oath and many exist statute and have receive they legal opinion that the test enact in the reign of charle ii though wise law and in policy not to be depart from might be repeal or alter without any breach of the coronation oath or act of union -lrb- with scotland -rrb- -lrb- 150 -rrb- they opinion on the point be the more valuable since they be notoriously oppose to they political conviction and might be suppose to have carry sufficient conviction to the royal mind but he majesty 's scruple be now unfortunately revive by the lord chancellor who strange to say be himself a presbyterian and who treacherously avail himself of he knowledge of what be in contemplation to anticipate the prime-minister 's intended explanation to the king he fully succeed in he object of fix the king 's resolution to refuse he assent to the contemplated concession -lrb- which by a curious confusion of idea he majesty even characterize as jacobinical -lrb- 151 -rrb- -rrb- though not in the object which he have still more at heart of induce the king to regard he as the statesman in the whole kingdom the most deserving of he confidence the merit of the question will be more appropriately examine hereafter it be sufficient to say here that pitt conceive himself bind by personal honor as well as by statesman-like duty to persevere in he intended measure or to retire from a office which no man be justified in hold unless he can discharge its function in accordance with he own judgment of what be require by the best interest of the state resign he post and be succeed by mr addington addington 's ministry be make memorable by the formation of the northern confederacy against we and its immediate and total overthrow by nelson 's cannon and for the peace of amien severely criticise in parliament as that of utrecht and every subsequent treaty with a similar object have be but defensible both on grounds of domestic policy as well as on that of afford we a much-needed respite from the strain of war though it prove to be only a respite and a feverish one since at the end of two year the war be renew to be wage with greater fury than ever but it be too short-lived for any constitutional question to arise in it and when in 1804 pitt resume the government he attention be too completely engross by the diplomatic arrangement by which he hope to unite all the nation east of the rhine in resistance to a power whose ever aggressive ambition be a standing menace to every continental kingdom for he to be able to spare time for the consideration of measure of domestic policy except such as be of a financial character but though he premature death render he second administration shorter than even addington 's it be not wholly unproductive of question of constitutional interest it witness a recurrence to that which can not but be regard as among the most important privilege of the house of common the right of impeach a minister for maladministration a report of a commission appoint for the investigation of the naval affair of the kingdom have reveal to parliament a gross misapplication of the public money commit by the paymaster of the navy and as that officer could not have offend as he have do without either gross carelessness or culpable connivance on the part of the treasurer of the navy lord melville who have since be promote to the post of first lord of the admiralty the house of common order he impeachment at the bar of the house of lord the vote be pass in 1805 during pitt 's administration though the trial do not take place till the year follow in reality the charge do not impugn lord melville 's personal honor on which at first sight it appear to press hardly mr whitbread himself the member for bedford who be the chief promoter and manager of the impeachment admit that he never imputed to lord melville any participation in the plunder of the public and as lord melville be acquit on every one of the charge bring against he the case might have be pass over here with the barest mention of it be it not that lord campbell have point out the mode of procedure as differ from that adopt in the great trial of warren hasting twenty year before and by reason of that difference form a model for future proceedings of the same kind if unhappily there should ever be occasion give for a similar prosecution the credit of the difference lord campbell give to the chancellor lord erskine who instead of allow the house of lord to sit to hear the case a few day in a year and when sit be convert from a court of justice into a theater for rhetorical display insist that it should sit like every other criminal tribunal _ de die in diem _ till the verdict be deliver and he enforce both upon the manager of the house of common and on the counsel for the defendant the wholesome rule of procedure establish for the detection of crime and the protection of innocence -lrb- 152 -rrb- it be well know that on the trial of hasting the manager of that impeachment and most especially burke claim a right of give evidence such as no court of law would have admit and set up what they entitle a usage of parliament independent of and contradistinguish from the common law -lrb- 153 -rrb- but on that occasion lord thurlow then chancellor utterly deny the existence of any such usage -- a usage which in time of barbarism when to impeach a man be to ruin he by the strong hand of power be quote in order to justify the most arbitrary proceedings he instance the trial of lord stafford as one which be from begin to end mark by violence and injustice and express a hope that in these enlighten day no man would be try but by the law of the land we may fairly agree with lord campbell that it be to be hope that the course adopt by lord erskine in this case have settle the principle and mode of procedure for all future time since certainly the importance of a impeachment both as to the state interest involve in it and the high position and authority of the defendant ought to be consider as reason for adhering with the greatest closeness to the strict rule of law rather than for relax they in any particular but as be natural the public could spare little attention for anything except the war and the arrangement make by the minister for engage in it with effect the interest which such a state of thing always kindle be in this instance greatly inflamed by napoleon 's avowal of a design to invade the kingdom though it be now know that the preparation of which he make such a parade be merely a feint to throw austrium off she guard -lrb- 154 -rrb- during addington 's administration pitt have speak warmly in favor of give every possible encouragement to the volunteer movement and also in support of a proposal make by a independent member colonel crawford to fortify london and one of he first measure after he resumption of office be a measure know as the additional force bill to transfer a large portion of the militia to the regular army it be so purely a measure of detail that it would hardly have be necessary to mention it have it not be for a objection make to it by the prime-minister 's former colleague lord grenville and for the reply with which that objection be encounter by the chief-justice lord ellenborough the former denounce it as unconstitutional since he declare it tend to establish a large standing army in time of peace and lord ellenborough on the other hand declare the right of the crown to call out the whole population in arm for the defense of the realm to be so radical essential and hitherto never question part of the royal prerogative that even in such a age of adventurous proposition he have not expect that any lord would have venture to question it -lrb- 155 -rrb- pitt die in the beginning of 1806 and be succeed by a administration of which he great rival fox be the guide spirit while he live though lord grenville be first lord of the treasury and after fox 's death which take place in September the undisputed prime-minister but the formation of the administration be not complete without a step which be at once strongly denounce not only by the regular opposition but by several member of political moderation as a violation if not of the letter at least of the spirit of the constitution the introduction of the lord chief-justice lord ellenborough into the cabinet it be notorious that he be invite to a seat among that body as the representative of a small party the personal friend of lord sidmouth for the ministry be form in some degree on the principle of a coalition lord grenville himself have be a colleague of pitt throughout the greater part of that statesman 's first ministry and as such have be always oppose to fox while lord ellenborough have be attorney-general in addington 's administration which avowedly only differ from pitt on the single subject of the catholic question the appointment be at once make the subject of motion in both house of parliament in the house of lord lord bristol who bring the question forward denounce this identification of a judge with the executive government as injurious to the judicial character subversive of the liberty of the people and have a direct and alarming tendency to blend and amalgamate those great elementary principle of political power which it be the very object of a free constitution to keep separate and distinct in the house of common mr canning take a similar objection and though he admit that a precedent for the act might be find in the case of lord mansfield who while chief-justice have also be a cabinet minister in the administration of 1757 he argue forcibly that that precedent turn against the ministry and the present appointment because lord mansfield himself have subsequently admit that he have infringe the principle of the constitution by act as a cabinet minister and chief-justice at the same time fox in reply rely principally on two argument the first be that he have never hear of such a thing as the cabinet council become the subject of a debate in that house he have never know of the exercise of the king 's prerogative in the appointment of he minister be bring into question on such grounds as have now be allege the second that in point of fact there be nothing in the constitution that recognize any such institution as a cabinet council that it be a body unknown to the law and one which have in no instance whatever be recognize by parliament he farther urge that as lord ellenborough be a privy councillor and as the cabinet be only a select committee of the privy council he be in fact as liable to be summon to attend the cabinet as a privy councillor as he be in he present situation the last argument be beneath the speaker to use since not one of he hearer be ignorant that no member of the privy council unconnected with the government ever be summon to the deliberation of the cabinet and though as he correctly state there be no legal record of the member comprise any cabinet it may safely be affirm that since July 1714 when the duke of argyll and the duke of somerset claim admission to the deliberation of the minister on account of the danger in which the queen lay though they admit that they have receive no summons to attend -lrb- 156 -rrb- there have be no instance of any privy councillor attend without a summons nor except at the accession of a new sovereign of summons be send to any member of the council except the actual minister the second argument be even worse as be still more sophistical it might be true that no law nor statute recognize the cabinet as a body distinct from the privy council but it be at least equally true that there be no one who be ignorant of the distinction that it be in truth one without which it would be difficult to understand the organization or working of any ministry the indispensable function and privilege of a ministry be to deliberate in concert and in private on the measure to be take for the welfare of the state but there could be little chance of concert and certainly none of privacy if every one who have ever be swear a member of the privy council have a right to attend all its deliberation again to say that the king 's prerogative as exercise in the choice of he adviser be a thing so sacred that no abuse of it or want of judgment show in its exercise can warrant a complaint be inconsistent with every principle of constitutional government and with every conceivable idea of the privilege of parliament in fact parliament have claim a right to interfere in matter apparently touch more nearly the royal prerogative and it be only in the reign precede the present reign that hostile comment have be make in parliament on the appointment of a particular person as ambassador to a foreign power yet the post of ambassador be one which might have be suppose to have be farther remove from the supervision of parliament than that of a minister a ambassador be in a special degree the personal representative of the sovereign and the sovereign therefore have it might be suppose a right to a most unfettered choice in such a matter strip of all technicality and even of all reference to the manifest possibility of such a circumstance arise as that the chief-justice if a member of a cabinet may have a share in order the institution of a prosecution which as a judge it may be he lot to try one consideration which be undeniable be that a member of a cabinet be of necessity and by the very nature of he position in it a party man and that it be of preeminent importance to the impartiality of the judicial bench and to the confidence of the people in the purity integrity and freedom from political bias of they decision that the judge should be exempt from all suspicion of party connection lord campbell even go the length of say what be not urge on either side of either house in these debate that it be allege by at least one contemporary writer that lord mansfield 's position in the cabinet do perceptibly influence some of he view and measure respect the press -lrb- 157 -rrb- and though in both house the ministry have a majority on the question of the propriety of the appointment he record he own opinion -lrb- 158 -rrb- that the argument be all on the lose side and that mr fox show he consciousness that it be so by he concession that the chief-justice should absent himself from the cabinet when the expediency of commence prosecution for treason or sedition be to be discuss he add also that it be say that lord ellenborough himself ere long change he opinion and to he intimate friend express deep regret that he have ever be prevail upon to enter the cabinet but if the composition of the cabinet of 1806 have in this respect be generally condemn on the other hand the annals of that ministry short-lived as it be be mark by the enactment of one great measure which have be stamp with universal approbation it may perhaps be say that the existence promotion discouragement or suppression of a branch of trade have no title to be regard as a constitutional question but the course which the british parliament after a long period of hesitation have adopt respect not only the slave-trade but the employment of slave-labor in any part of the british dominion be so intimately connect with the great constitutional principle that every man whatever be he race or nation or previous condition whose foot be once plant on british soil be free from that moment that it can not be account a digression to mention the subject here to we statesman of queen anne 's time traffic in slave be so far from be consider discreditable that the ministry of that reign pride themselves greatly on what be call the assiento treaty with spain by which they secure for the british merchant and ship-owner the privilege of supply the west indium island with several thousand slave a year in 1748 the minister of george ii be equally jealous of the credit of renew it it have even on one occasion be decide in the court of common plea that a action of trover could be maintain for a negro because negro be heathen though chief-justice holt scout the idea of be bind by a precedent which would put a human be on the same footing as a ox or a ass and declare that in england there be no such thing as a slave subsequent decision however of two lord chancellor -- lord talbot and lord hardwicke -- be not wholly consistent with the doctrine thus lay down by holt and the question could not be regard as finally settle till 1772 when a slave name somersett be bring over to england from jamaica by he master and on he arrival in the thame claim he freedom and under a writ of _ habeas corpus _ have he claim allow by lord mansfield the master 's counsel contend that slavery be not a condition unsanctioned by english law for villeinage be slavery and no statute have ever abolish villeinage but the chief-justice in the first place deny that villeinage have ever be slavery such as exist in the west indy and in the second place he pronounce that whether it have be or not it have at all event long cease in england and could not be revive the air of england have long be too pure for a slave and every man be free who breathe it every man who come into england be entitle to the protection of english law -lrb- 159 -rrb- but this freedom be as yet hold to be only co-extensive with these island and for sixty year more we west indium island continue to be cultivate by the labor of slave some of whom be the offspring of slave previously employ though by far the greater part be import yearly from the western coast of africa the supply from that country seem inexhaustible the native chief in time of war gladly sell they prisoner to the captain of british vessel in time of peace they sell they they own subject and if at any time these mode of obtain slave slacken the captain would land at night and attack the village on the coast sweep off the inhabitant on board they ship and at once set sail with they booty the suffering of these unhappy captive in what be call the middle passage -- the passage between they native land and the west indium island -- be for a long time unknown or disregard till early in pitt 's first ministry they attract the notice of some of we naval officer who be station in the west indy and who on they return to england related the horror which they have witness or hear of -- how between deck too low to admit of a full-grown man standing upright the wretched victim chained to the side of the ship lay squeeze together in such number though the whole voyage be within the tropics that from the overpowering heat and scantiness of food it be estimate that two-third of each cargo die on the passage most fortunately for the credit of england the fearful trade be bring under the notice of a young member of parliament singularly zealous in the cause of humanity and religion endowed with untiring industry and powerful eloquence and connect by the closest tie of personal intimacy with mr pitt to hear of such a system of organize murder as the british officer describe the slave-trade to be be quite sufficient to induce mr wilberforce to resolve to devote himself to its suppression he lay the case in all its horror before he friend the prime-minister a man as ready as himself to grapple with and extinguish all prove abuse and pitt at once promise he all the support which he could give it be no easy task that he have take on himself a year or two before burke have apply himself to frame some regulation which he hope might gradually remove the evil but little as he be move by consideration of popularity or daunt by difficulty he have abandon the attempt as one which would meet with a resistance too powerful to be overcome wilberforce be not a bolder man than burke but he have no other object to divide he attention and therefore to this one he devote all he faculty and energy enlist supporter in every quarter seek even the co-operation of the french government and open a correspondence with the french secretary of state m montmorin a statesman of great capacity and what be far rarer in france of incorruptible honesty m montmorin however though alive to the cruelty of the traffic be unable to promise he any aid allege the fear of the french planter that its abolition would ruin the french island he say that it be one of those subject upon which the interest of man and they sentiment be so much at variance that it be difficult to learn what be practicable -lrb- 160 -rrb- wilberforce have already find that the english merchant be still less manageable pitt have enter so fully into he view that in 1788 he himself move and carry a resolution pledge the house of common to take the slave-trade into consideration in the next session and another friend of the cause sir w dobben bring in a bill to diminish the horror of the middle passage by proportion the number of slave who might be convey in one ship to the tonnage of the vessel but those concern in the west indium trade rise up in arm against even so moderate a measure and one so clearly demand by the most ordinary humanity as this the liverpool merchant declare that the absence of restriction on the slave-trade have be the chief cause of the prosperity and opulence of they town and obtain leave to be hear by counsel against the bill but fox unite with pitt on this subject and the bill be carry but this be all the practical success which the effort of the abolitionist as they begin to be call achieve for many year and even that be not win without extreme difficulty lord chancellor thurlow oppose it with great vehemence in the house of lord as the fruit of a five day ' fit of philanthropy which have just spring up and point to the conduct of the french government which as he assert have offer premium to encourage the trade as a example that we should do well to follow it be even say that he have contrived to incline the king himself to the same view to have persuade he that the trade be indispensable to the prosperity of we manufacturer and in the chancellor 's word that it be he royal duty to show some humanity to the whites as well as to the negro and more than once when bill to limit or wholly suppress the trade have be pass by the common the same mischievous influence defeat they in the lord the last year of pitt 's first administration be too fully occupy with the affair of ireland negotiation with foreign power and the great war with france to enable he to keep pace with he friend 's zeal on the subject but in he second administration occupy though he be with a recurrence of the same cause he find time to prepare and issue a order in council prohibit the importation of slave into we fresh colonial acquisition and the employment of british ship to supply the dutch french and spanish island and this order in council pave the way for the total abolition one of the earliest proceedings of the new ministry be the introduction by the attorney-general sir arthur pigott of a bill to extend and make it perpetual to forbid the importation of african negro by british ship into the colony conquer by or cede to we in war or into the colony of any neutral state in the west indy for at present every state that have colony in america or the west indy and that be not actually at war with we avail itself of the opportunity of british shipping to carry on the trade it be resist as vehemently as any former measure with the same object and partly on the new ground that it would in no degree stop the trade or diminish the suffering of the african but would merely rob we ship-owner of they profit to enrich the american mr rise the member for christchurch who advance this argument have be a friend of pitt yet though he quote a instance of a single vessel have bury one hundred and fifty-two slave on one voyage he be not ashamed to deprecate the bill on the plea that the manufacturer of manchester stockport and paisley would be go about naked and starving and thus by attend to a suppose claim for relief from a distant quarter we should give existence to much more severe distress at home the bill however be carry in both house and receive the royal assent and fox who support it warmly in he speech on the third reading -lrb- one of the last speech which he ever address to the house -rrb- invite wilberforce to regard it as a stepping-stone to the total abolition of the trade and as a encouragement to renew he motion for that object and though he could not promise he the support of the government as a government he could answer for himself and many of he friend who hold the highest and most dignified station in the other house of parliament they still feel the question of the total abolition as one involve the dearest interest of humanity and as one which should they be successful in effect it would entail more true glory upon they administration and more honor upon they country than any other transaction in which they could be engage mr fox do not live to see the opening of another session but when that time come the position which he have take up that the measure of which he have thus promote the passing be a encouragement to do more be adopt to its full extent by the chief of he colleague lord grenville who in February 1807 himself bring forward a motion for the entire abolition of the trade though he be prime-minister he could not introduce it as a government measure since two of he colleague -- lord sidmouth the president of the council and mr windham the secretary of state for the colony -- oppose it though the former profess a desire to see the trade abolish but would have prefer to attain that end by impose such a tax on every slave import as should render the trade unprofitable he have another obstacle also to encounter in the vehement opposition of some of the prince of the royal family the duke of clarence and sussex more especially who be know to be canvass against the bill and be generally understand in so do to be act in accordance with the view of they elder brother but he be confident that by this time the feeling of the whole country be with he on the subject he be resolve to rest he case on its justice and therefore consent that the house should hear counsel on the subject though he resist they demand to be allow to call witness accordingly counsel be hear for the whole body of west indium planter and for those of one or two separate island such as jamaica and trinidad for the liverpool merchant and even for the trustee of the liverpool dock but some of they reasoning he even turn against themselves refuse for a moment to admit that the profit obtain by robbery could be urge as a argument for the continuance of robbery he denounce the trade as the most criminal that any country could be engage in and as one that lead to other crime in the treatment of the slave after they reach the west indy he instance three most horrible and dreadful murder of slave that have be commit in barbado and quote the report of lord seaforth governor of the island who on investigation have find that by the law of the colony the punishment affix to such murder be a fine of eleven pound he be oppose by the duke of clarence who direct he remark chiefly to a defense of the general humanity of the planter and by lord westmoreland who in a speech of singular intemperance denounce the principle of the measure as one after the passing of which no property could be render safe which could fall within the power of the legislature he even make it a argument against the bill that its principle if carry to its legitimate logical end must tend to the abolition of slavery as well as of the slave-trade he object especially to the assertion in the preamble that the trade be contrary to justice and humanity declare that those word be only insert in the hope that by they foreign power might be humbug into a concurrence with the abolition and wind up he harangue by a declaration that though he should see the presbyterian and the prelate the methodist and pew-preacher the jacobin and the murderer unite in support of it he would still raise he voice against it it must have be more painful to the minister to be oppose by so distinguish a officer as lord st vincent who resist the bill chiefly on the ground that its effect would be to transfer british capital to other country which would not be dispose to abandon so productive a trade and declare that he could only account for lord grenville 's advocacy of it by suppose that some obus man have cast he spell upon he but the case be too strong for any argument to prevail which be base solely on the profit of a trade which no one pretend to justify the bill pass the lord by a majority of nearly three to one in the house of common where the opposition be much feebler by one infinitely larger -lrb- 161 -rrb- and by a somewhat remarkable coincidence it receive the royal assent on the same day on which lord grenville announce to he brother peer that he administration be at a end even before the abolition have thus become law the member for northumberland earl percy endeavor to give practical effect to lord westmoreland 's view that emancipation of the slave be its inevitable corollary by move for leave to bring in a bill for the gradual abolition of slavery in the british settlement of the west indy but he be oppose by lord howick -lrb- 162 -rrb- though he have be among the earnest advocate of abolition partly for the sake of the negro themselves and partly on the ground that the legislature have no right to interfere with the property of the colonist little foresee that the measure which he now oppose be reserve for he own administration and that its accomplishment would be one of its chief title to the respectful recollection of posterity and as the house be presently count out the discussion would not have be worth recording be it not for the opportunity which it give of display the practical and moderate wisdom of wilberforce himself who join in the opposition to lord percy 's motion the enemy of abolition have he say always confound abolition with emancipation he and he friend have always distinguish between they and not only abstain from propose emancipation but be ready to reject it when propose by other how much soever he look forward with anxious expectation to the period when the negro might with safety be liberate he know too well the effect which the long continuance of abject slavery produce upon the human mind to think of they immediate emancipation a measure which at the present moment would be injurious both to they and to the colony he and those who act with he be satisfy with have gain a object which be safely attainable and they have reason to be satisfy for the good work thus do be not limit by the extent of the british dominion vast as they be the example of the homage thus pay by the parliament and the nation to justice and humanity be contagious the principle on which the bill be found and be carry be such that for mere shame foreign country could hardly persist in maintain a traffic which those who have derive the greatest profit from it have on such grounds renounce though we minister do not trust to they spontaneous sympathy but make the abolition of the traffic by we various ally or those who wish to become so a constant object of diplomatic negotiation even purchase the co-operation of some by important concession in one instance by the payment of a large sum of money the conference and congress which take place on the re-establishment of peace give they great facility for press they view on the different government and lord liverpool 's instruction to lord castlereagh and the duke of wellington as plenipotentiary of we government -lrb- 163 -rrb- show the keen interest which he take in the matter and the skilful manner in which he seek to avail himself of the predominant influence which the exertion and triumph of this country have give she with every foreign cabinet though portugal be a ally to whom we regard ourselves as bind by special tie as well as by the great benefit we have confer on she yet as she cling with the greatest pertinacity to the trade he do not scruple to endeavor to put a constraint upon she which should compel she submission and instruct lord castlereagh to induce the congress to take the best means in they power to enforce it by the adoption of a law on the part of the several state to exclude the colonial produce of those country who should refuse to comply with this system of abolition and exertion so resolutely put forward be so successful that the trade be avowedly proscribe by every european nation though unquestionably it be still carry on by stealth by merchant and ship-owner of more than one country -- not if the suspicion of we statesman be well found without some connivance on the part of they government nor be we effort in the cause the fitful display of impulsive excitement we have continue they and widen they sphere as occasion have present themselves exert a successful influence even over unchristian and semi-civilized government of which a instance have very recently be furnish in the assurance give by the khedive of egypt to we minister reside at he court that he be take vigorous measure to suppress the slave-trade which be still carry on in the interior of africa and that we may believe he promise that he will not relax he exertion till it be extinguish at least in the region on the north of the equator individual as a rule be slow to take warning from the experience of other slower perhaps to follow they example in well-doing nation be slower still when such a example be follow still more when it be adopt by a general imitation it will usually be find not only that the good be of a very unusual standard of excellence but that he or they who have set the example be endow with a force of character that predispose other to submit to they influence and credit of this kind england may fairly claim for the general abolition of the slave-trade for the condemnation and abolition of the slave-trade have this distinguish feature that the idea of such a policy be of exclusively british origin no nation have ever before conceive the notion that to make a man a slave be a crime on the contrary there be not want those who from the recognition of such a condition in the bible argue that it be a divine institution and they who denounce it and labor for its suppression have not only inveterate prejudice and long custom to contend with but find array against they many of the strongest passion that animate mankind the natural desire for gain unite merchant ship-owner and planter in unanimous resistance to a measure calculate to cut off from they one large source of profit patriotism which however misguided be sincere and free from all taint of personal covetousness induce many who wear wholly unconnected either with commerce or with the west indy to look with disfavor on a change which not only imperil the interest of such important body of man but which they be assure by those concerned must render the future cultivation of estate in the west indy impracticable while such a result would not only ruin those valuable colony but would also extinguish that great nursery for we navy which be furnish by the vessel at present engage in the west indium trade to disregard such substantial consideration to risk a loss of revenue a diminution of we colonial greatness and a weakening of we maritime power even while engage in a formidable war under no other pressure but that of a respect for humanity and justice be certainly a homage to those virtue and also a act of self-denying courage of which the previous history of the world have furnish no similar example and it be one of which in one point of view the nation may be more justly proud than of the achievement of its wisest statesman or the exploit of its most invincible warrior for it be the act of the nation itself no previous sentiment of the people pave the way for pitt 's triumph in finance for nelson 's or wellington 's victory by sea and land but the slave-trade could never have be abolish by any parliamentary leader have not the nation as a whole become convinced of its wickedness and when once so convinced resolve to brave everything rather than persist in it the merit of have impress it with this conviction belong to mr wilberforce whose untiring unswerving devotion of brilliant eloquence and practical ability to the one holy object and whose ultimate success give he a just claim to be reckon among the great man of a generation than which the world have see none more prolific of every kind of greatness but the nation itself be also entitle to no slight credit for have so rapidly appreciate the force of he teaching and for have encourage its representative to listen to he voice by the knowledge that by adopt he measure they would be carry out the wish and determination of the whole people a measure for the strengthening of the army introduce by the secretary of state for war mr windham though not one of perpetual force since it require to be renew every year claim a brief mention from the extent to which one of its clause trench on the freedom of the subject by make every man of military age -lrb- from sixteen year old -lrb- 164 -rrb- to forty -rrb- liable to be compel to submit to military training for a certain period of each year nothing to quote the secretary 's word be to exempt any man from the general training but he become a volunteer at he own expense the advantage of which would be that he could train himself if he choose and fight if occasion require it in the corps to which he should belong instead of be liable to fall in among the regular as out of the immense mass of the population some selection must be make those call on to be train be to be select by lot and he would have the people divide into three class between the age of sixteen and forty : the first class to comprehend all from sixteen to twenty-four the second those between twenty-four and thirty-two and the third all from thirty-two to forty the number of day for training he propose to limit to twenty-six with a allowance of a shill a day for each man the result aim at by this part of he measure be the creation of a force different from and unconnected with the militia and he do not conceal he hope that the military habit which it would implant in a large portion of the population would lead many of those thus about to be train to enlist in the regular army to the militia itself he pay a high but not undeserved compliment declare it for home service certainly equal to any part of we regular force with the single exception that it have never see actual service but the militia could not be call on to serve out of the kingdom and he object be to increase the force available for foreign service -- to see the great mass of the population of the country so far train as to be able to recruit immediately whatever loss the regular army might sustain in action as yet the number of man yearly obtain by recruit fall far short of the requirement of the service wellington have not yet begin that career of victory which create a national enthusiasm for war and fill we rank with willing soldier and another clause of the same bill be frame in the hope of make the service more acceptable to the peasantry by limit the time for which recruit be to be enlist and enter man at first in the infantry for seven year or in the cavalry -lrb- as that branch of the service require a longer apprenticeship -rrb- for ten then allow they the option of renew they engagement for two period -- in the infantry of seven year each in the cavalry of six and five with increase pay during each of the two period and a small pension for life if the soldier retire after the second period and the full allowance of chelsea which be to be farther raise to a shill a day for those who elect to serve the whole twenty-one year this principle the present reign have see carry to a much greater extent but the change be too recent for even the most experienced officer to be agree on its effect and it be only because of this recent extension of it that this clause be mention here but the enactment of a law of compulsory service be clearly a inroad on the great constitutional right of every man to choose he own employment at the same time it be equally clear that it be only such a inroad as under the circumstance be fully justifiable it be true that all danger of french invasion have pass away with trafalgar but the kingdom be still engage in a gigantic war and the necessity of the case -- always the supreme law -- be so little deny by the opposition that they objection to the bill be direct entirely against the clause for limited enlistment and not against that which abridge the subject 's liberty by compelling he to learn to serve he country in war the reign of george iii which have now last fifty year be draw practically to a close the excitement cause by the ministerial change in 1801 have already bring on one relapse though fortunately a very brief one of the king 's malady of 1788 and in the autumn of 1810 the death of the daughter who be suppose to be he especial favorite the princess amelium produce a recurrence of it which though at first the physician entertain more sanguine hope of he speedy recovery than on any former occasion he never shake off more than one change of ministry have recently take place in 1807 lord grenville have be compel as pitt have be in 1801 to choose between yield he opinion on the catholic question or resign he office and have choose the latter alternative he have be succeed for two year by the duke of portland but in 1809 that nobleman have also retire and have be succeed by he attorney-general mr perceval the only practising barrister who have ever be so promote and he now be prime-minister and as such force to make arrangement for carry on the government during the illness of he sovereign naturally regard the course pursue in 1789 as the precedent to be follow accordingly on the 20th of December he propose for the adoption of the house of common the same resolution which pitt have carry twenty-two year before -- that the king be prevent by indisposition from attend to public business that it be the duty of parliament to provide means for supply the defect of the personal exercise of the royal authority and its duty also to determine the mode in which the royal assent to the measure necessary could be signify and he also follow pitt 's example in express by letter to the prince of wale he conviction that he royal highness be a person most proper to be appoint regent and explain at the same time the restriction which seem proper to be impose on he immediate exercise of the complete sovereign authority though the advanced age at which the king have now arrive make it reasonable that those restriction should now be limit to a single year the prince on he part show that time have in no degree abate he repugnance to those restriction and he answer the minister 's letter by refer he to that which he have address to pitt on the same subject in 1788 and he induce all he brother to address to perceval a formal protest against the establishment of a restricted regency which they proceed to describe as perfectly unconstitutional as be contrary to and subversive of the principle which seat they family upon the throne of this realm -lrb- 165 -rrb- perceval however with pitt 's example before he have no doubt of the course which it be he duty to pursue and the opposition also for the most part follow the tactic of 1789 the line of argument now adopt by each party be so nearly identical with that employ on the former occasion that it be needless to recapitulate the topic on which the different speaker insist though it be worth remark that lord holland who as the nephew of fox think it incumbent on he to follow he uncle 's guidance do on one point practically depart from it as he uncle have do he deny the right of the house to impose any restriction on the prince 's exercise of the royal authority but at the same time he consent to put what may be call a moral limitation on that exercise by add to a amendment which he propose to the resolution propose by the minister a expression of the farther opinion of the house that it will be expedient to abstain from the exercise of all such power as the immediate exigency of the state shall not call into action until parliament shall have pass a bill or bill for the future care of he majesty 's royal person during he majesty 's present indisposition it be remarkable that the leader of the opposition be in a great degree stimulate in the line they take by the very same hope which have animated fox and he follower in 1789 -- the expectation that the regent 's first act would be to discard the exist ministry and to place they in office but again they be disappoint in they anticipation of the realization of which they have make so sure that they have take no pain to keep they secret they even betray they mortification to the world when the prince 's intention on the subject of the administration become know by the violence of they language in parliament some of they party denounce the employment of the great seal to give the royal assent to the bill as fraud and forgery nor indeed could the regent himself even while express he intention to make no change in the administration lest any act of he might in the smallest degree have the effect of interfere with the progress of he sovereign 's recovery suppress a expression of dissatisfaction at the recent arrangement which he consider have place he in a situation of unexampled embarrassment and have create a state of affair ill calculate as he fear to sustain the interest of the unite kingdom in this awful and perilous crisis and most difficult to be reconcile to the general principle of the british constitution -lrb- 166 -rrb- there be at this time general and apparently well-founded hope of the king 's recovery for at interval during the whole of January the prime-minister have interview with he majesty and on the very day on which the bill become law the king himself mention it to lord eldon the chancellor and say that he acquiesce in it from perfect confidence in the advice of he physician and on the sound judgment and personal attachment of he minister for the present therefore no change be make in the administration but when in the spring of the following year mr perceval be murder the necessity for a new arrangement which this strange and calamitous atrocity force upon the regent -- who by this time have come into possession of he full authority -- lead to he make offer of the conduct of affair to more than one prominent statesman all of they as be somewhat remarkable be peer and though the proposal eventually come to nothing and the negotiation terminate in the re-establishment of the former ministry with lord liverpool at its head yet some of the cause to which they failure be publicly or generally attribute seem desirable to be record because the first and that most openly avowed bear a not very distant resemblance to the complication which baffle sir robert peel 's endeavor to form a administration in 1839 and another correspond precisely to a proposal which in 1827 the regent -- then king george iv -- do himself make to the duke of wellington it be unnecessary to dwell on the singular manner in which the regent first profess to give he confidence to lord wellesley then transfer it to lord moira -lrb- 167 -rrb- and then to a certain extent include lord gray and lord grenville in it nor would it be profitable to discuss the correctness or incorrectness of the suspicion express by mr moore in he life of sheridan -- who be evidently at this time as fully in the regent 's confidence as any one else -- that at the bottom of all these evolution of negotiation there be anything but a sincere wish that the object to which they relate should be accomplish -lrb- 168 -rrb- the reason avow by lord gray and lord grenville for refuse a share in the project administration be the refusal of lord moira who have be employ by the prince to treat with they on the subject to allow they to make a power of remove the officer at present fill the great office of the household -lrb- 169 -rrb- a express condition of they acceptance of ministerial office they affirm that a liberty to make new appointment to these office have usually be give on every change of administration but lord moira while admit that the prince have lay no restriction on he in that respect declare that it would be impossible for he to concur in make the exercise of this power positive and indispensable in the formation of the administration because he should deem it on public grounds peculiarly objectionable such a answer certainly give a great color to moore 's suspicion since it be hardly possible to conceive that lord moira take on himself the responsibility of give it without a previous knowledge that it would be approve by he royal master in a constitutional point of view there can it will probably be feel be no doubt that the two lord have a right to the liberty they require and the very man concern the great officer of the household be evidently of the same opinion since the chief lord yarmouth inform sheridan that they intend to resign in order that he might communicate that intention to lord gray and sheridan who conceal the intelligence from lord gray can hardly be suppose any more than lord moira to have act in a manner which he do not expect to be agreeable to the prince but in canning 's opinion this question of the household be only the ostensible pretext and not the real cause of those two lord reject the regent 's offer the real cause be as he believe that the prince himself have already name lord wellesley as prime-minister and that they be resolve to insist on the right of the whig party to dictate on that point to the regent -lrb- 170 -rrb- just as in 1782 fox have endeavor to force the duke of portland on the king when he majesty prefer lord shelburne as have be intimate in a former page it will be see hereafter that in 1839 a similar claim to be allow to remove some of the lady of the royal household and the rejection of that claim by the sovereign prevent sir r peel from form a administration and as that transaction be discuss at some length in parliament it will afford a better opportunity for examine the principle on which the claim and practice -lrb- for of the practice there be no doubt -rrb- rest for the present it be sufficient to point out the resemblance between the case but it be remarkable that unwarrantable as the pretension of the whig leader be to dictate to the regent to whom he should confide the lead of the government -lrb- if indeed can be correct in he opinion -rrb- yet it be not one to which the regent feel any repugnance since in 1827 when lord liverpool 's illness again leave the treasury vacant he be then on the throne as george iv propose to the duke of wellington to desire the remain member of the administration themselves to select a chief under whom they would be willing to continue in he service but the duke tell he that the plan of allow they to choose they own leader would be most derogatory to he position that the choice of the prime-minister be a act which ought to be entirely he own for that in fact under the british constitution it be the only personal act of government which the king of great britain have to perform -lrb- 171 -rrb- though not generally a great authority on constitutional point we apprehend that the duke be clearly correct in this view which indeed have be so invariably carry out in practice that the king 's suggestion would not have deserve mention have it not be a king 's so far from it belong to any individual subject or to any party to name the prime-minister to do so be even beyond the province of the parliament parliament decide whether it will give its confidence to a administration of one party or the other but not only have no vote ever be give on the question whether one member of the dominant party be fitter or not than another to be its head but we do not remember a single instance of any member of either house express a opinion on the subject in he place in parliament to do so would be feel by every member of experience to be a infringement on the prerogative of he sovereign and it may be add that a contrary practice would certainly open the door to intrigue or what

brilliant and decisive triumph which be never to cease till he have carry he victorious march far into the heart of france itself at such a time it may well be suppose that the attention of the new ministry be too fully occupy with measure necessary for the conduct of the war to leave it much time for domestic legislation yet even its first session be not entirely barren in the first excitement of the restoration when the nation be still exasperate at the recollection of what it have suffer under the triumphant domination of the puritan two law have be frame to chastise they conceive in a spirit as intolerant and persecute as have dictate the very worst of they own one which be call the conventicle act inflict on all person above the age of sixteen who should be present at any religious service perform in any manner differently from the service of the church of england in any meeting-house where more than five person besides the occupier of the house should be present severe penalty rise gradually to transportation and give a single magistrate authority to convict and to pass sentence on the offender the other commonly know as the five mile act forbid all minister of any sect who do not subscribe to the act of uniformity and who refuse to swear to they belief in the doctrine of passive obedience from teaching in any school and from come within five mile of any city corporate town or borough send member to parliament or any town or village in which they themselves have reside as minister the latter statute have fall into complete disuse and many of the provision of the former have be relax though magistrate in general construe the relaxing enactment as leave the relaxation wholly at they discretion to grant or to withhold and be very much in the habit of withholding or abridge they other statute such as the test act have subsequently be pass against every sect of dissenter though they have only impose civil disability and have not inflict penalty but the new prime-minister be a man to whose disposition anything resemble persecution be foreign and repugnant before he predecessor 's unhappy death he have already discuss with he the propriety of abolish law conceive in such a spirit and he no sooner find himself at the head of the government than he prepare a bill to carry out he view he draw a distinction between the act inflict penalty and those which only impose disability with these latter he do not propose to interfere but in July he colleague lord castlereagh introduce into the house of common a bill to repeal the conventicle act and the five mile act altogether and when it have pass the common he himself move its adoption by the lord enforce he recommendation by the argument that a enlarged and liberal toleration be the best security to the established church a church not found on the exclusion of religious discussion but in its homily its canon and all the principle on which it rest court the investigation of the scripture upon which it found its doctrine at the same time while urge the repeal of act which he truly brand as a disgrace to the statute-book he be not blind to the duty impose on he as responsible for the public tranquillity of take care that meeting hold ostensibly for purpose of devotion should not be pervert to the design of political agitator and therefore he provide in the bill for the registration of all place appropriate to religious worship and for the exaction from the preacher and teacher in those meeting of some test or security in the oath to be take by they he have already secure the acquiescence of the bishop and he be equally successful now in win the assent of the house the condition such as they be do not prevent the bill from be entirely acceptable to the non-conformist and though they spokesman in the house of common mr w smith member for norwich confess a wish that it have go a little farther and have grant complete religious liberty he at the same time express sincere gratitude on the part of the non-conformist for what be thus do for they and declare that as a act of toleration it certainly be the most complete which have hitherto be pass in this country it be in fact the beginning of the abandonment of that system of discouragement of and hostility to all sect except the established church which have hitherto be regard by a large party as one of the most essential principle of the constitution and as such it make the year 1812 in some respects a landmark in we constitutional history mr smith have refer to a omission which prevent he from speak of the bill as complete he be allude to the test and corporation act which have be pass ten year later than the conventicle act in the same reign of charle ii and which many of the non-conformist and especially the unitarian have urge lord liverpool to include in this measure of repeal but which he decide on retain as have be say above he draw a distinction between act inflict penalty and those which go no farther than impose political disability feel that any relief of protestant dissenter from such disability must inevitably lead to the concession of a similar indulgence to roman catholic and not be as yet prepare to admit to parliament the member of a church which recognize the duty of obedience in any matter to a foreign sovereign for as the disability have be originally impose on the roman catholic so they be now maintain on political not religious grounds and even those most oppose to a relaxation of they be careful to explain they resistance to be one which time and a change of circumstance might mitigate -lrb- 173 -rrb- as a fitter opportunity for discuss the question will be afford by the duke of wellington 's bill in 1829 we should not have mention it at all in this place have not lord liverpool in arrange he administration adopt a mode of deal with it which though rather a parliamentary or departmental than a constitutional innovation be nevertheless one of so strange a character as to seem to call for examination ever since the formation of walpole 's ministry it have be the invariable rule and practice for all the member of the cabinet to act in concert on all measure of importance or indeed it may be say on all measure on which a parliamentary vote be take but in arrange he administration after mr perceval 's death lord liverpool find it absolutely impossible to form one satisfactory either to the nation or to himself if it be to be confine to member in perfect agreement with himself on the subject of the retention of the disability affect the roman catholic and therefore in order to be able to form a ministry generally strong and respected he adopt the strange expedient of allow every member of it to act independently on this one question he make it what be call a open question the arrangement as explain to the house of common by lord castlereagh the ministerial leader of that assembly be that in submission to the grow change of public opinion in favor of those claim -lrb- the roman catholic claim -rrb- and the real sentiment of certain member of the government it have be resolve upon as a principle that the discussion of this question should be leave free from all interference on the part of the government and that every member of that government should in it be leave to the free and unbiassed suggestion of he own conscientious discretion it be a arrangement which secure the prime-minister the co-operation of lord castlereagh himself and eventually of mr canning but it fail to propitiate the opposition the leader of which in the house of common mr ponsonby turn it into open ridicule affirm that nothing could be more absurd than a cabinet profess to have no opinion on such a important subject and it must be confess that mr ponsonby 's language on the subject seem the language of common-sense so far from the importance of a question justify such a arrangement that importance appear rather to increase if possible the necessity for absolute unanimity in the administration than to diminish it and on a grave and momentous subject to leave each member of a ministry free to pronounce a separate and different judgment so that one may resist what he colleague advocate be to abdicate the function of government altogether to permit such liberty be either a proof that the ministry be weak altogether -- which it be not -- or that its conduct on this question be weak in either case it be a mischievous precedent that be thus set -lrb- 174 -rrb- and the fact that it have since be follow in more than one instance be so far from be any justification of it that it rather supply a additional reason for condemn it as be the cause of wider mischief than if it have be confine to one single question or have influence the conduct of one cabinet only it have often be say that the name cabinet be unknown to the law and that what we call the cabinet be in fact only a committee of the privy council as a statement of law the assertion may be correct but it be certain that for more than a century and a half the constitution have adopt the principle that the cabinet consist of the holder of a certain to some extent a fluctuate number of the principal state officer and recognize the responsibility of all for the action of each member of it do by that recognition sanction a expectation that on all question or at all event on all but those of the most trivial character they will speak and act with that unanimity which be indispensable not only to the strength of the government itself but to its be hold in respect by the people such respect be indeed among the most essential element of its strength the incident of the war itself do not belong to a work such as this but tantalize as it must be to a historian of any class to pass over the brilliant series of achievement which give britain the glory of be twice -lrb- 175 -rrb- the principal agent in the deliverance of continental europe the glory of salamanca victorium orthe and waterloo must be leave to other writer who it be not unpatriotic to hope may never again have similar cause for exult description but out of the crowning triumph of waterloo a difficulty arise which though it may be difficult to characterize the principle on which it be settle since it be not strictly a question of constitutional international or military law and though the circumstance be so peculiar that the conclusion adopt be never likely to be refer to as a precedent seem still deserving of a brief mention especially as a act of parliament be pass to sanction the decision of the cabinet baffle by the vigilance of we cruiser in every attempt to escape from one of the western port of france to america napoleon be at last compel to surrender himself to a british squadron but though he be we prisoner the prime-minister consider we in all we dealings with he as so bind by engagement to we ally that he be to be regard as the common prisoner of all so far that we should not give he up or release he without the joint consent of all the question be full of difficulty there be probably very few person in this or any other country who do not coincide in the impropriety of release he and so put it in he power once more to rekindle a war in europe but it be a political view of the case found on a consideration of what be require by the tranquillity of europe and it be not easy to lay down any legal ground to justify the determination some regard he as a french subject and if that view be correct he could hardly be detain by we as a prisoner of war after we have conclude a treaty of peace with france but again it seem to some the lord chancellor be among they a questionable point whether in the last campaign we have be at war with france whether on the contrary we have not assume the character of a ally of france against he and on the supposition that we have be at war with france a second question be raise by lord ellenborough the chief-justice what rights result on principle from a state of war as against all the individual of the belligerent nation -- rights whatever they may be seldom if ever enforce against individual because individual hardly ever make war but as part of a aggregate nation the question -- as after consultation with lord ellenborough and he own brother sir william scott it finally appear to lord eldon on whom the prime-minister naturally depend as he chief legal counsellor though in its political aspect he judge for himself -- be firstly whether it could possibly be inconsistent with justice or the law of nation that till some peace be make by treaty with some person consider as napoleon 's sovereign or till some peace be make with himself we should keep he imprison in some part of we king 's dominion and secondly whether there be any person who could possibly be consider he sovereign after the treaty of 1814 have clothe he with the character of emperor of elba with imperial dignity and imperial revenue lord liverpool himself however raise another question : whether by he invasion of france he have not forfeit he right to be regard as a independent sovereign rest this doubt on a suggestion which among other he propose to the lord chancellor that at elba he enjoy only a limited and conditional sovereignty which cease when the condition on which he hold it be violate this last suggestion it must be confess appear untenable as totally inconsistent with the language of the treaty of fontainebleau under the provision of which napoleon become sovereign of elba and which do not contain a single article which bear out the opinion that he sovereignty be limit or conditional on the contrary the word of the treaty expressly agree that elba should form during he life a separate principality which should be possess by he in full sovereignty and property there be no need to discuss the view of blucher on the news of napoleon 's landing at frejus reach the plenipotentiary assemble at the congress of vienna they at once issue a declaration that in break the convention which have establish he at elba buonaparte -lrb- for they refuse he he imperial appellation of napoleon -rrb- have destroy the only legal title on which he existence depend he have place himself out of the pale of civil and social relation and as the enemy and disturber of the peace of the world he be deliver over to public justice and the old prussian burning with a desire to avenge the indignity and injury which he have inflict on prussium avow he determination to execute he as a outlaw if he should fall into he hand and it be still less worthwhile to inquire -- though lord holland in he place in parliament do desire the house to consult the judge on the point -- whether if napoleon be a prisoner of war he be not entitle to he _ habeas corpus _ if detain after the signature of a treaty of peace with all the power or any of which he could be consider as the subject on the whole the simplest view of the position and of we detention of he the view most reconcilable with the principle which regulate the wage and the relinquish a state of war seem to be to consider that napoleon be a sovereign with whom we be at war that that war could only be terminate by a treaty of peace between ourselves and he that it rest with we to conclude or to abstain from conclude any such treaty and that till we should conclude it we have clearly a right to detain he as a prisoner of war it must at the same time be admit that modern history afford no precedent for the detention of a prisoner for he whole life -lrb- unless indeed elizabeth 's imprisonment of the queen of scot may be consider as one -rrb- and that the most solid justification for it be necessity to quote the language of lord eldon i believe it will turn out that if you can not make this a _ casus exceptioni _ or _ omissus _ in the law of nation found upon necessity you will not really know what to say upon it _ salus reipublica suprema lex _ as to one state _ salus omnium rerumpublicarum _ must be the _ suprema lex _ as to this case -lrb- 176 -rrb- in the course of the year 1818 a somewhat singular question as to the position of the regent be raise by a claim advance by colonel berkeley to produce he royal highness as a witness in a court of law the prince consult the prime-minister and the prime-minister refer it to the attorney and solicitor general not conceal he own impression that it could not be consistent with he constitutional position and prerogative for the king to appear as a witness to be subject to examination and cross-examination -lrb- 177 -rrb- they in they statement of opinion assume it to be a undeniable principle of the constitution that the sovereign by reason of he royal character could not give testimony and therefore they have no doubt that the regent exercise he authority be equally prevent from so do colonel berkeley 's counsel have urge that even if he could not appear in open court and be swear he have the privilege of communicate he evidence in a peculiar mode by certificate under the sign manual or great seal but the attorney and solicitor general profess that they could not discover whence this last privilege be derive they urge as a insurmountable objection to such a contrivance that all instrument under the sign manual or great seal must in point of form be in the name of and on behalf of the king which would manifestly be incongruous when the evidence certify be not that of the king but of the regent himself and they quote a case in which lord chief-justice wille have say that the certificate of the king under he sign manual of a fact -lrb- except in a old case in chancery -rrb- have always be refuse as it have be urge also on colonel berkeley 's behalf that the prince have formerly join in prove the will of the duke of brunswick he brother-in-law they farther express a opinion that he ought not to have do so but should have leave it to the other executor on the point whether the king himself could give evidence orally or in any other manner they opinion express very plainly the principle on which they maintain that he could not that he be not compellable to do so that he could not be swear -lrb- there be no power capable of administer a oath to he in a court of justice -rrb- that whether he testimony be give _ viv voce _ or otherwise no question in chief or on cross-examination could be propose to he be admit by colonel berkeley 's counsel and that he testimony must be conclusive as to the fact state by he appear necessarily to follow from the perfection ascribe by law to he royal character for such remarkable exception therefore to the case of all other witness they could not but think that strong and decisive authority ought to be produce while the silence of text-writer on the subject so far from be favorable to the notion that the king can give evidence appear to afford a directly contrary inference and they sum up they opinion in a few word : that he royal highness the prince regent while in the personal exercise of the royal authority be in the situation of the king in this respect and that the king could not by any mode give evidence as a witness in a civil suit it be very improbable that colonel berkeley should have make the application without previously ascertain the willingness of the prince to give evidence could such a course be permit and as he royal highness on receive this opinion of the law-officer of the crown do not come forward as a witness that opinion may be hold to have settle the question and apart from the constitutional objection rely on by those able lawyer it be evident that there would be serious practical objection to the sovereign be make a witness it would be derogatory to he royal character to put himself in a position where comment could be make either by the oppose barrister or by the public outside on he evidence and on the other hand it would be perilously unfair to one litigant for he adversary to be able to produce a witness who be not subject to cross-examination nor to remark upon he testimony the reign of george iii be now draw to its close and if it produce no legislation affect the principle of the constitution -lrb- it will presently be see that it do produce one measure which its opponent brand as a violation of these principle -rrb- yet in its last year it witness the revival of a agitation which be keep up with vary animation till it be temporarily quiet by the concession of its demand we have see that one of pitt 's earliest effort at legislation have be direct to a reform in parliament a object which to the end of he life he consider of great importance though the revolutionary spirit arouse by the trouble in france and the open sympathy with the french jacobin and republican avow by a party among ourselves -- which if numerically weak be sufficiently loud and active to be dangerous -- prevent he from ever re-open the subject but though the french revolution in this way prove for the time a insurmountable obstacle to the success of the reformer in another way it insure the revival of the question by the general spirit of inquiry which it awaken among the population at large and which soon go beyond the investigation of any single abuse or anomaly for even less far-sighted statesman than pitt confess the existence of much that be not only theoretically indefensible but practically mischievous the period little short of a century which elapse between the death of william iii and pitt 's accession to office have be one of almost complete stagnation and apathy the scotch union the septennial bill the establishment of a militia and the place bill of 1743 be the only instance of any legislation deserving the name of constitutional which make the reign of anne and the first two george memorable and in the very nature of thing it be impossible that after so long a slumber there should not be much to do and many whether capable or incapable eager to bear a share in the work the sudden cessation of the excitement of war have beget a restless craving for some other excitement to take its place and none seem so creditable as energy and acuteness in the discovery and removal of abuse complaint be make and not without reason of the working of the poor-law of the terrible severity of we criminal code of the hardship and suffering of the younger member of the work class especially in the factory of the ignorance of a large portion of the people in itself as prolific a cause of mischief and crime as any other but though committee and commission be appoint by parliament to investigate the condition of the kingdom in respect of these matter a feeling be grow up that no effectual remedy would be apply till the constitution of the house of common itself be reform so as to make it a more real representation of the people than it could as yet be consider and a farther stimulus to this wish for such a parliamentary reform be supply by the distress which a combination of circumstance spread among almost all class in the year immediately follow the conclusion of the second treaty of peace -lrb- 178 -rrb- the harvest of the year 1816 and 1817 be unusually deficient and this press heavily on the farmer and land proprietor the merchant and manufacturer who while every part of the continent be disturbed or threaten by the operation of contend army have practically enjoy almost a monopoly of the trade of the world find they profit reduce by the new competition to which the re-establishment of peace expose they to a point which compel they to a severe reduction of expenditure the uncertainty feel as to the result to be bring about by the inevitable repeal of the bank act of 1797 and the return to cash payment -- result which it be impossible to estimate correctly beforehand -- have a tendency to augment the distress by the general feeling of uneasiness and distrust which it create and the employer of labor could not suffer without those who depend on they for employment suffering still more severely the consequence be that there be a general stagnation of trade number of artisan and laborer of every kind be throw out of work and they enforced idleness and poverty which be its result make they ready to become the tool of demagogue such as be never want in the hour of distress and perplexity meeting be convene ostensibly to petition for reform but in reality to afford opportunity for mob-orator eager for notoriety to denounce the government and those whom they style the ruling class as the cause of the present and past evil from these meeting multitude issue forth ripe for mischief in some place they rise against the manufacturer and destroy they machine to the recent introduction of which they attribute they want of employment in other still more senselessly they even set fire to the store of grain in the corn-dealer ' warehouse aggravate by they destruction the most painful of they own suffering on one occasion a mob which have assemble in one of the eastern district of london on pretence of frame a petition to be present to the prince regent at the close of the meeting parade the street with a tricolor flag the emblem of the french revolutionist and pillage a number of shop especially those of the gun-maker spread terror through all that side of the metropolis in at least one instance the violence of the rioter rise to the height of treason assassin fire at the regent in the park as he be return from the house of lord whither he have be to open parliament and when it be find that they have miss they aim the mob attack the royal carriage pelt it with large stone and break the window nor be it without some difficulty that the escort of troops clear a path for he through the mob and enable he to reach carlton house in safety the first effect of these outrage be to damage the cause of reform itself even such uncompromising reformer as lord gray denounce meeting at which extensive scheme of reform be submit to individual incapable of judge of they propriety the second consequence be to compel the minister to take step to prevent a recurrence of such tumult and crime at first they be contented with a temporary suspension of the _ habea corpus _ act but even while that suspension be in force it do not entirely prevent meeting at some of which the language of the speaker certainly border on sedition and when the suspension be take off fresh meeting on a larger scale and of a more tumultuous character than ever be hold in more than one rural district finally in July of 1819 the whole kingdom be throw into a violent state of excitement by a meeting hold at birmingham at which the leader assume the newly-invented party name of radical not only demand the remodelling of the whole system of government but because birmingham as yet send no member to the house of common take it upon themselves to elect sir charle wolseley a baronet of respectable family as they representative to the parliament and charge he to claim a place in the house of common in the next session by the side of those elect in obedience to the royal writ sir charle be at once arrest on the charge of have at this meeting use seditious language calculate to lead to a breach of the peace but the radical leader far from be intimidate by this demonstration of vigor on the part of the government immediately summon a similar meeting in manchester announce they intention to elect a representative of that great town likewise which though the largest of all the manufacturing town be also unrepresented in the imperial parliament the magistrate prohibit the meeting it be only postpone for a week when the people assemble in such formidable number -lrb- no estimate reckon they at fewer than 60000 -rrb- that the ordinary civil authority deem themselves unequal to deal with it and call in the aid first of the yeomanry and then of a hussar regiment the soldier behave with great forbearance as soldier always do behave on such occasion but they be bind to execute the order which be give they to arrest some of the leader and in the tumult which be the inevitable consequence of they attempt to force a way through so dense a crowd three or four life be unfortunately lose so unusual a catastrophe call out the energy of both party the radical leader publish manifesto declare the people have be massacre by the soldier by the order of the government meeting be hold to denounce the conduct of the minister one be even promote by lord fitzwilliam as lord-lieutenant of yorkshire a dignity of which he be instantly deprive while on the other hand the grand-jury of cheshire and lancashire make report of the condition of those county to the secretary of state which show that a most alarming spirit prevail over the greater part of the district the most inflammatory publication have be issue in the principal town at a price which put they within the reach of the poorest class of society the training and military drilling of large body of man under regular leader have be carry on to a great extent for some time chiefly by night and there be no doubt that a extensive manufacture of arm be go on what be a hardly inferior symptom of danger be a system of intimidation which prevail to a most serious degree many magistrate have receive notice threaten they life and combination have be form to withhold custom from publican and shopkeeper who have come forward to support the civil power in many part of the two county the grand-jury declare that no warrant of arrest or other legal process could be execute the payment of tax have cease and the landlord be threaten with the discontinuance of they rent it be admit that the spirit of disaffection be local confine to three or four county but those county be next to middlesex itself the most populous and among the most important in the kingdom and there be danger lest the feeling if not check might spread the crisis seem so momentous that some even of the opposition leader volunteer they counsel and aid to the minister in deal with it and the minister after long deliberation decide on call parliament together in November and introduce some bill which they conceive necessary to enable they to restore and preserve tranquillity they be six in number and -- perhaps with some sarcastic reference to gardiner 's six act in the sixteenth century -- they be very commonly speak of as lord sidmouth 's six act that noble lord be the home-secretary to whose department they belong it be not necessary here to do more than mention the general purport of five of they one prohibit military training without the sanction of the government another empower magistrate to search for arm which they have reason to believe be collect for illegal purpose the third authorize the seizure of seditious and blasphemous libel the fourth subject publication below a certain size to the same stamp as that require for a newspaper the fifth regulate the mode of proceeding in trial for misdemeanor of a political character but these enactment be regard as little more than arrangement of detail or procedure involve no principle and some of they be admit even by the most steadfast opponent of the minister to be necessary but the sixth design to restrain the practice of hold large open-air meeting -- not indeed forever but for a certain period fix at five year -- be strongly resist by the greater portion of the whig party in both house as a denial to the people of one of they most ancient and constitutional rights -lrb- 179 -rrb- its

prohibition it forbid any one to attend such meeting except freeholder of the county or parishioner of the parish or member of the corporation of the city or borough in which they be hold or member of the house of common for such place it empower magistrate to proceed to the place where such meeting be be hold and if they think it necessary to require the aid of constable it enact that any meet the tendency of which should be to incite or stir up the people to hatred and contempt of the person of he majesty he heir and successor or of the government or constitution of this country as by law

's name to depart and make those who do not depart in obedience to such warning liable to prosecution for felony and if convict to seven year ' transportation it forbid the display of flag banner or ensign at any meeting and the employment of any drum or military or other music but it except from its operation any meeting or assembly which should be wholly holden in any room there be one peculiarity in the line take by the opponent of the bill that they do not deny that the meeting which have induce the minister to propose it be a evil dangerous to the general tranquillity but it be strongly urge by lord erskine and other that the exist law be quite strong enough to deal with they so that a new enactment be superfluous and by other in both house that such meeting be a ancient and constitutional mode of discuss abuse or petition parliament any interference with which be a greater evil than the meeting themselves as be a violation of the constitution mr brougham in particular admit to the full extent of the assertion of the minister themselves the wickedness and folly of many of the speech make at the recent meeting he express with great force he entire disapproval of the system on which these meeting have be conduct and admit that the martial array which have be exhibit and the vastness of the number of those who have attend be of themselves calculate to excite alarm but he declare that he could not on that account acquiesce in a total subversion of a popular right on the other hand the minister themselves do not deny the general right of the people to petition the legislature or to carry they address to the foot of the throne and therefore -lrb- as lord harrowby the president of the council admit -rrb- there could be no doubt of they right to assemble so far as be necessary to agree to they petition or address it be a right that do not depend on the bill of rights on which it be usually ground but have exist long before but this bill he contend impose no restriction on the legitimate enjoyment of that privilege it only regulate the meeting at which it be to be exercise and lord liverpool affirm that the bill be not only consistent with the exist law and principle of the constitution but be even propose in furtherance of those principle and for the purpose of protect the people of this country against a series of evil which if not check must subvert they law and liberty in attempt to form a correct judgment on the question whether this bill be constitutional or unconstitutional it must i think be admit that as have be remark before the term constitutional and unconstitutional be somewhat vague and elastic there be no one document -- not magna charta nor the petition of eight nor the bill of rights -- which can be say to contain the whole of the british constitution its spirit and principle be indeed to be find in all the law to which they give animation and life but not in any one law and among its lead principle be those which embrace the right of every individual to freedom of action and freedom of speech so long as he do not commit any crime himself nor tempt other to do so yet it do not follow that a new enactment which for a while abridge or suspend that freedom of action or speech be inconsistent with those constitutional principle minister to whom the government of a country be intrust do wrong if they limit they operation to the punishment of offence which have be commit it be at least equally they duty as far as possible to prevent they commission to take precautionary measure especially at time when there be notorious danger of offence be commit at the same time they be bind not to legislate under the influence of panic not to yield to fear have no substantial ground and in they measure of precaution they be farther bind to depart from or overstep the ordinary law as little as be compatible with the attainment of they object in all such case each action of theirs must stand or fall by its own merit by the greatness of the emergency which have cause it and by its sufficiency for its end for as no law except such as forbid moral crime be invariable so even the dearest privilege of each subject be he for the common good be liable to temporary suspension for that common good but the burden of justification lie on those who propose that suspension now that this bill be such a suspension of the long-established rights of the subject and so far a overstepping of the principle of the constitution be admit by the very fact of its framer only propose for it a temporary authority have it not invade a valuable and real right it might have be make of perpetual obligation but it be not easy to see how it can be deny that the danger against which it be intend to guard be also real it be certain that itinerant demagogue be visit district with which they have no connection for the sole purpose of stir up political agitation it be clear that such meeting as they convene where those assemble could only be count by ten of thousand be too large for deliberation and be only mean for intimidation and equally clear that though the exist law may have arm the magistrate with authority to disperse such meeting they do not furnish he with the means of do so without at least the risk of bloodshed -lrb- for such a risk must be involve in the act of put soldier in motion -rrb- and still less do they invest he with the desirable power of prevent such meeting it be necessary therefore to go back to the original principle and object of every constitution the tranquillity safety and welfare of the nation at large and it do not appear that this bill go beyond what be necessary for that object indeed though party division be not always trustworthy test of the wisdom or propriety of a measure the unusual magnitude of the majority by which on this occasion the minister be support in both house may fairly be regard as a testimony to the necessity of the bill -lrb- 180 -rrb- while its sufficiency be prove by the abandonment of all such meeting and the general freedom from agitation in every part of the country which prevail in the following year though its most remarkable incident be one of which demagogue might well have take advantage if they have not have so convince a proof of the power of government and of the resolution of the minister to exert it

north american colony the only event which can be so describe be far more than counterbalance by we vast acquisition in indium at the cape of good hope and malta while to we maritime supremacy in the complete establishment of which rodney and nelson have crown the work of anson and hawke be now add a splendor of military renown far surpass that achieve by any other of the nation which have bear

to show we political progress and advancement have be no less steady or valuable yet important from a constitutional point of view as be many of the labor of we legislator in these sixty year they be surpass in they influence on the future history of the nation as well as in the reality and greatness of the change which be produce by they in the constitution by the transaction of the reign of the next two sovereign though the two unite scarcely equal in they duration a quarter of that of they venerable father it have be see how pitt be baffle in he effort to remodel the house of common and to remove the disability under which the roman catholic labor the reason for which even grant that they have be sufficient to justify they original imposition have in he judgment long pass away he pursuit of the other great object of he domestic policy the emancipation of trade from the shackle which impede its universal development be rudely interrupt by the pressure of the war force upon he by that very nation which he have desire to make the first partner if one may use such a expression in the prosperity which he hope to diffuse by he commercial treaty with she but as in the case of other man in advance of they age the principle which he have assert be destine to bear fruit at a later period and the mere fact of a change in the person of the sovereign seem to make a change in the policy hitherto pursue less unnatural yet memorable as the reform which it witness be destine to make it no reign ever commence with more sinister omen than that at which we have now arrive the new king have not be on the throne a month when a conspiracy be discover surpassing in its treasonable atrocity any that have be hear of in the kingdom since the day of the gunpowder plot and even before those concern in that foul crime have be bring to punishment the public mind be yet more generally and profoundly agitate by a scandal which in one point of view be still more painful as in some degree involve the whole kingdom in its disgrace the marriage of the present sovereign to mr fitzherbert have already be mention a few year afterward in the year 1795 regard that marriage as illegal he have contract a second with he cousin the princess caroline of brunswick but even in royal family a more unfortunate alliance have never take place they have never meet till she arrive in england for the wedding and as he have never profess any other motive for consent to the match than a desire to obtain the payment of he debt he do not think it necessary to disguise he feeling or to change he habit or even to treat she with decency for a single day on he very first introduction to she he behave to she with marked discourtesy -lrb- 183 -rrb- shortly after the marriage he formally separate himself from she and both before and after the separation live in undisguised licentiousness she on she part indignant at he neglect and infidelity and exasperate at the restriction which he presently place on she intercourse with they only child make no secret of she feeling and on many occasion display such disregard of the ordinary rule of prudence and propriety that he have some color for charge of infidelity to she marriage vow which after a few year he bring against she the king she uncle could not refuse to appoint a commission to investigate the truth of the accusation but the commissioner unanimously acquit she of any graver fault than imprudence she be again receive at court from which she have be exclude while the inquiry be pend but she husband 's animosity toward she be not appease as time wear on and as the king 's derangement deprive she of she only protector it even seem as if he desire to give it all the notoriety possible till at last wearied out by he implacable persecution she seek and obtain he permission to quit the country and take up she abode abroad it be a most unfortunate resolution on she part she fix she residence in italy where she gradually learn to neglect the caution which she have observe in england till after a year or two report arise of she intimacy with a servant whom she have raise from a menial situation to that of the chief officer of she household and whom she admit to a familiarity of intercourse which other besides she husband think quite incompatible with innocence he send agent into italy to inquire into the truth of those rumor and they report so greatly confirm they that even before the king 's death he lay it before the prime-minister with a demand that he should at once take step to procure he a divorce in which he profess to believe that the princess herself would willingly acquiesce he be so far correct that she legal adviser be willing to advise she to consent to a formal separation to be ratify by a act of parliament but such a arrangement fall far short of the prince 's wish the princess charlotte the heiress to he throne have die in childbirth two year before and he be anxious to be set free to marry again the minister be place in a situation of painful embarrassment there be a obvious difficulty in point out to one who already stand toward they in the character of they sovereign and who must inevitably soon become so that he own conduct make the prospect of obtain a divorce from the ecclesiastical court hopeless and the only other expedient calculate to attain he end a direct application to parliament for relief found upon the special circumstance of the case or a proceeding against the princess for high-treason be but little more promising indeed it be afterward ascertain to be the unanimous opinion of the judge that the charge of high-treason could not be legally sustain since the individual who be allege to be the partner in the criminality imputed to she be a foreigner and therefore owe no allegiance to the crown could not be say to have violate it -lrb- 184 -rrb- he chafe under they resistance to he wish and would have deprive they of they office could he have rely on any successor whom he might give they prove more complaisant but before he could make up he mind the death of george iii force upon both he and they the consideration of he and he wife 's position since it make it necessary to remodel the prayer for the royal family and instantly to decide whether she name and title as queen be to be insert in it he be determine that they should not be mention and as the practice of pray for a queen consort by name appear not to have be invariable they be willing to gratify he on this point though it be evidently highly probable that she would consider this as a fresh insult sufficient to justify she in carry out a threat which she have recently hold out of return to england she ablest adviser do not indeed regard it in this light since the prayer as now frame implore the divine protection for all the royal family in general term in which she might be suppose to be include and make no separate mention of any member of the family -lrb- 185 -rrb- but unfortunately she be much more under the influence of counsellor who be neither lawyer nor statesman but who only desire to use she as a tool to obtain notoriety for themselves a long negotiation ensue it be inevitable that some application should be make to parliament in connection with she affair since the annuity which have be settle upon she by parliament in 1814 on the occasion of she departure from england have expire with the life of the late king and the minister propose that that annuity should now be raise from # 35000 to # 50000 on condition of she remain abroad have by they positive refusal to concur in any proceedings against she while she remain abroad extort the king 's acquiescence in this proposal though he call it a great and painful sacrifice of he personal feeling they seek to conciliate she acceptance of it by mention she in it by she title of queen and by coupling with it a sanction to she appointment of she law-officer a attorney and solicitor general a act which could only be exercise by a queen and though a part of the condition of she residence abroad require that she should do so under some other title that seem only a conform to a ordinary practice of royal prince on they travels at the same time the minister state frankly to mr brougham a lawyer of the highest reputation as a advocate whom she have appoint she attorney-general that if she should reject the offer and come to england as she have already announce she intention of do such a course would leave they no alternative but would compel they to institute proceedings against she eventually she prefer the advice of other to that of mr brougham or as it may perhaps be more consistent with the real fact to say she yield to she own feeling of hatred of she husband which it must be confess be far from unnatural she believe or profess to believe that he have more to dread from a exposure of he conduct than she have from any revelation of she action and under this impression in the spring she cross the channel and take up she residence in london it be a step which seem to lord liverpool to leave he no alternative and in consequence he at once take the course which he have from the beginning conceive she arrival would render indispensable he bring down to parliament a royal message from the king announce that she return to england have make it necessary to communicate to the house document relate to she conduct since she departure from the kingdom which he recommend to they immediate and serious attention he propose the appointment by ballot of a committee of the house of lord to examine those document and when the committee have report that the document contain allegation deeply affect the honor of the queen etc appear to the committee calculate to affect not only the honor of the queen but also the dignity of the crown and the moral feeling and honor of the country so that in they opinion they should become the subject of a solemn inquiry which might be best effect in the course of a legislative proceeding he introduce a bill of pain and penalty to deprive she of she title of queen and to annul she marriage no one would willingly dwell on so melancholy and disgraceful a subject as far as the queen be concern a protracted investigation during which a number of witness favorable and unfavorable be examine left no doubt on the mind of almost all dispassionate people that the misconduct allege against she have be abundantly prove at the same time there be a feeling equally general that the king 's treatment of she from the very beginning of they married life have disentitle he to any kind of relief and this sentiment be so strongly show by the gradual diminution of the majority in favor of the bill as it proceed through its several stage that lord liverpool who have already abandon the clause annul the marriage eventually withdraw the whole bill perceive the impossibility of induce the house of common to pass it when it should go down to that house no act of lord liverpool 's ministry have be attack with greater bitterness than that of allow any proceedings whatever to be take against the queen partly on the ground that however profligate she conduct have be it have certainly not be more gross than that of she husband which have provoke and give opportunity for she error partly because a great scandal be thus publish to the world and a shock be give to the national decency and morality which the minister above all man be bind to avoid partly also because the mode of proceed adopt be allege to be wholly unprecedented and because as be contend the power of parliament ought not to be invoke to inflict penalty which if deserve should have be leave to the court of law it can not be deny that there be weight in these objection but in estimate they force it must be consider that every part of the conduct of the minister show that they motive be not the gratification of the king 's private feeling whether direct to the object of indulge he enmity against he wife or to that of obtain freedom to contract a second marriage on the contrary so long as the queen remain abroad no language could be more distinct consistently with the respect due to he royal dignity than that in which they express to he they insurmountable objection to every mode of proceed against she which he have suggest found almost equally on consideration of the interest of he majesty and of the monarchy -lrb- 186 -rrb- and the painful obligation under which they conceive themselves to lie of postpone they regard for he majesty 's feeling to great public interest but when the queen come to england the case be greatly alter the question now force on the consideration of the cabinet be not the mode of avoid a intolerable scandal but the choice between two scandal both of the gravest character the scandal to be dread from the revelation of the conduct of both king and queen that could not fail to result from the investigation which in justice must precede any attempt to legislate on the subject be indeed as great as ever but it have now to be compare with the alternative scandal of allow a woman lie under such grievous imputation to preside over the british court as if resident in england and in undisturbed possession of she royal rank she of necessity must preside the consequence would evidently have be that the court would have be desert by all who could give lustre and dignity to it by they position and character and in the slight thus offer to she royalty and the monarchy themselves would seem to be bring into contempt the latter scandal too would be the more permanent grievous and shameful as might be the disclosure which must be anticipate from a investigation in which the person accuse must be permit the employment of every means of defense include recrimination the scandal be yet one which would to a certain extent pass away with the close of the inquiry but if she be leave undisturbed in the enjoyment of she royal rank and of privilege which could not be separate from it that scandal would last as long as she life -- longer in all probability than the reign it be hardly too much to say that the monarchy itself might have be endanger by the spectacle of such a king and such a queen and the minister might fairly contend that of two great danger and evil they have on the whole choose the least lastly if the queen 's conduct be to be investigate though the mode adopt be denounce as unconstitutional by the opposition -lrb- for not greatly to they credit the lead whig make she guilt or innocence a party question -rrb- it do not seem to deserve the epithet though it may be confess to have be unsupported by any direct precedent isabellum the faithless wife of edward ii have indeed be condemn by the lord to the forfeiture of many of the estate which she have illegally appropriate but it do not appear that she violation of she marriage vow or even she probable share or acquiescence in she husband 's murder form any portion of the grounds of she deprivation and the parliament which attaint catherine howard proceed solely on she confession of ante-nuptial licentiousness without give she any opportunity of answering or disprove the other charge which be bring against she unprecedented therefore the course now adopt may be admit to have be but it be the only practicable one the different minute of the cabinet which the prime-minister lay before the king establish most conclusively the correctness of they opinion that no impeachment for high-treason could lie against she she could not be a accomplice in such a offence of one who be a foreigner could not have commit it it be equally impossible for the king to sue for a divorce as one of he subject might have do because it be the established practice of parliament not to entertain a bill of divorce without the judgment of the ecclesiastical court be previously obtain and produce and under the circumstance to obtain from the ecclesiastical court such a sentence as could alone lay the foundation for a bill of divorce be clearly out of the question the case be a new and extraordinary one and be such could only be deal with in some new and extraordinary manner and in all such case a appeal to parliament seem the most if not the only constitutional mode of solve the difficulty where the exist law be silent or inapplicable the most natural resource clearly be to go back to the fountain of all law that be to the parliament which alone be competent to make a new law in one point of view the question may seem unimportant since we may well hope that no similar case will ever arise to require the precedent now set to be appeal to but not unimportant if it in any way or degree contribute to establish the great principle that the solution of all matter of moment to the state belong to the parliament alone : a principle which in its legitimate completeness carry with it a condemnation of many a modern association whose object whether avowed or disguised be clearly to supersede where it fail to intimidate the sole constitutional legislature the abandonment of the bill be naturally hail as a triumph by the queen and she partisan but with the excitement of the struggle against the government the interest take in she case die away the next year when she demand to be crown with she husband he refusal to admit she claim elicit scarcely any sympathy for she under this renew grievance in truth it be one as to which precedent be unfavorable to she demand and the mortification at find herself already almost forget contribute to bring on a illness of which she die in less than a year after the termination of what be call she trial and in a short time both she and it be forget for the next few year the history of the kingdom be one of progressive correction of abuse or defect the king pay visit to ireland and scotland part of he dominion which he father have never once visit and in both be receive with the most exultant and apparently sincere acclamation and though one great calamity fall on the ministry in the loss of lord castlereagh -- who in a fit of derangement bring on by the excitement of overwork unhappily lay violent hand on himself -- he death sad as it be could not be say to weaken or to affect the general policy of the cabinet indeed as he be replace at the foreign office by he old colleague and rival mr canning in one point of view the administration may be say to have be strengthen by the change since as a orator canning have confessedly no equal in either house of parliament another change be productive of still more practical advantage lord sidmouth retire from the home office and be succeed by mr peel previously secretary for ireland and the transfer of that statesman to a english office facilitate reform some of which be as yet little anticipated even by the new secretary himself the earliest of they and one not the least important in its bearing on the well-doing of society the mitigation of the severity of we criminal code be indeed but the follow up of a series of measure in the same direction which have be commence in the time of the duke of portland 's second administration and it must be add in spite of its resistance the influence of various trade and of the owner of different kind of property press in turn upon we legislator have render we code the most sanguinary that have probably ever exist in christendom each class of proprietor regard only the preservation of he own property and have no belief in the efficacy of any kind of protection for it except such as arise from the fear of death nor any doubt that he be justify in procure the infliction of that penalty to avert the slightest loss to himself the consequence be that at the beginning of the present century there be above two hundred offence the perpetrator of which be liable to capital punishment some of a very trivial character such as cut down a hop-vine in a kentish hop-garden rob a rabbit-warren or a fish-pond personate a out-pensioner of greenwich hospital or even be find on a high-road with a blacken face the intention to commit a crime be infer from the disguise even though no overt act have be commit a act of elizabeth make pick a pocket a capital offence another pass as late as the reign of william iii affix the same penalty to shop-lifting even when the article steal might not exceed the value of five shilling and the fault of these enactment be not confine to they unreasonable cruelty they be as mischievous even to those whom they be design to protect as they be absurd as some owner begin to perceive in the list of capital offence be that of steal linen from a bleaching-ground and a large body of bleacher present a petition to parliament entreat the repeal of the statute which make it such on the ground that practically it have be find not to strike terror into the thief but almost to secure they impunity from the reluctance of jury to find a verdict which would sentence a fellow-creature to the gallows for such a offence nor be this by any mean the only instance in which the barbarity of the law defeat its object and its combined impolicy and inhumanity have some year before attract the notice of sir samuel romilly who have be solicitor-general in the administration of 1806 and who shortly after its dissolution begin to apply himself to the benevolent object of procure the repeal of many of the statute in question and in the course of a few year do succeed in obtain the substitution of milder penalty for several of the less flagitious offence he die in 1818 but the work which he have begin be continue by sir jame mackintosh a man of even more conspicuous ability and one who could adduce he own experience in favor of the change which he recommend to the parliament since he have fill the office of recorder of bombay for eight year and have discharge he duty with a most diligent and consistent avoidance of capital punishment which he have never inflict except for murder he lenity previously unexampled in that land have be attend with a marked diminution of crime he procure the substitution of milder penalty in several additional case and at last in 1822 he carry a resolution engage the house of common the next session to take into its serious consideration the means of increase the efficacy of the criminal law by abate its undue rigor and this success have the effect of induce the new minister to take the question into he own hand peel saw that it be one which if it be to be deal with at all ought to be regulate by the government itself and not be leave to independent member who could not settle it with satisfactory completeness and therefore in 1823 he introduce a series of bill to carry out the principle imply in mackintosh 's resolution of the preceding year not only simplify the law but abolish the infliction of capital punishment in above a hundred case he be unable to carry out he principle as fully as he could have desire the prejudice in favor of still retain death as a punishment for forgery be too strong for even he resolution as yet to overbear though many private banker supply he with the same argument against it in they case which have formerly be allege by the bleacher but the example which he now set enforce as it be with all the authority of the government be follow in many subsequent session till at last we code instead of the most severe have become the most humane in europe and death be now never inflict except for murder or crime intend or calculate to lead to murder it be worth remark however that neither romilly mackintosh nor peel ever entertain the slightest doubt of the right of a government to inflict capital punishment in the last address which mackintosh deliver to the grand-jury at bombay he have say : i have no doubt of the right of society to inflict the punishment of death on enormous crime wherever a inferior punishment be not sufficient i consider it as a mere modification of the right of self-defence which may as justly be exercise in deter from attack as in repel it -lrb- 187 -rrb- and in he diary when speaking of a death-warrant which he have just sign he say : i never sign a paper with more perfect tranquillity of mind i feel agitation in pronounce the sentence but none in subscribe the warrant i have no scruple of conscience on either occasion and it seem that he position be unassailable the party whose interest be to be keep in view by the legislature in impose punishment on offence be society the people at large not the offender the main object of punishment be to deter rather than to reform to prevent crime not to take vengeance on the criminal and if crime be more effectually prevent by moderate than by severe punishment society have a right to demand for its own security -lrb- as a matter of policy not of justice -rrb- that the moderate punishment shall on that ground be prefer that punishment disproportion in they severity to the magnitude of the offence often defeat they object be certain not only have jurymen be know to confess that they have prefer violate they oath to do still greater violence to they conscience by send a man to the gallows for a deed which in they opinion do not deserve it but the very person who have be injure by theft or forgery be often deter from prosecution of the guilty by the knowledge that the forfeiture of they life must follow they conviction it be almost equally certain that criminal calculate beforehand on the chance of impunity which the known prevalence of these feeling afford they wherever the sympathy of the public do not go along with the law it must to a great extent fail and that the terrible frequency of sanguinary punishment have fail in all its object be prove by the fact that in spite of the numerous execution which take place crime increase in a still greater proportion than the population under the reform system now first inaugurate on a extensive scale crime have become rarer detection and punishment more certain -- a combination of result which must be the object equally of the law-giver and the philanthropist it be not quite foreign to this subject to relate that a year or two before a mode of trial have be abolish which though long disuse by some curious oversight have still be allow to remain on the statute-book in the feudal time either the prosecutor or the prisoner in case of felony have a right to claim that the cause should be decide by wager of battle but it be a ordeal which with one exception in the reign of george ii have not be mention for century in 1817 however the relative of a woman who have be murder be dissatisfy with the acquittal of a man who have be indict as she murderer sue out a appeal of murder against he on which he claim to have the appeal decide by wager of battle and throw down a glove on the floor of the court to make good he challenge the claim be protest against by the prosecutor but lord ellenborough the chief-justice pronounced judgment that trial by battle have be demand it be the legal and constitutional mode of trial and must be award it be the duty of the judge to pronounce the law as it be and not as they might wish it to be -lrb- 188 -rrb- he give sentence accordingly and have the two party be of equal stature and strength the judge of the common plea might have be see in they robe preside from sunrise till sunset over a combat to be fight as the law prescribe with stout stave and leathern shield till one should cry craven and yield up the field fortunately for they the alleged murderer be so superior in bodily strength to he adversary that the latter decline the contest but the public advancement of the claim for such a mode of decision be fatal to any subsequent exercise of it and in spite of the common council of london who confide perhaps in the formidable appearance present by some of the city champion on lord mayor 's day petition parliament to preserve it the next year the attorney-general bring in a bill to abolish it and the judge be no longer compel to pronounce a absurd sentence in obedience to a obsolete law frame at a time when personal prowess be a virtue to cover a multitude of sin and might be the only right generally acknowledge the foundation too be lay for other reform lord liverpool be more thoroughly verse than any of he predecessor except pitt in the soundest principle of political economy and in one of the first speech which he make in the new reign he express a decide condemnation not only of any regulation which be design to favor one trade or one interest at the expense of another but generally of the whole system and theory of protection and one of he last measure make a alteration in the manner of tax corn import from foreign country which be greatly to the advantage of the consumer it be know as the sliding-scale the tax on import corn vary with the price in the market rise when the price fall and fall when it rise the design with which it be frame be to keep the price to the consumer at all time as nearly equal as possible at first however it be vehemently denounce by the bulk of the agriculturist who be re-enforce on this occasion by a large party from among the whig and especially by some of those connect with ireland but a more suitable period for discuss the establishment of free-trade as the ruling principle of we financial policy will occur hereafter the introduction of the sliding-scale be almost the last act of lord liverpool 's ministry at the beginning of 1827 he be prepare a fresh measure on the same subject the effect of which be intend to diminish still farther the protection which the former act have give and which be in consequence denounce by many landholder of great wealth and influence lead on this subject by the king 's favorite brother the duke of york -lrb- 189 -rrb- but a few day after the meeting of parliament he be strike down by a attack of paralysis from which he never recover in he post as prime-minister he be succeed by canning not without great reluctance on the part of the king not probably so much because he fear to find in he any desire to depart from the policy of lord liverpool except on the catholic question -lrb- for even on matter of foreign policy on which canning have always be suppose most to fix he attention he have adopt the line which lord liverpool have lay down for the cabinet with evident sincerity -rrb- -lrb- 190 -rrb- as because he majesty have never wholly forgive he for the attitude which he have take differ on one or two point from that of he colleague on the queen 's case and as have be mention in a former chapter he even with the object of evade the necessity of appoint he suggest to the duke of wellington the singular scheme of allow the remain member of lord liverpool 's cabinet to select they own chief -lrb- 191 -rrb- which the duke though coincide with he in he dislike of canning of whom he entertain a very causeless suspicion reject without hesitation as a abandonment of the royal prerogative in one of its most essential duty or privilege another of he majesty 's notion if it have be carry out would have be one of the strangest violation of constitutional principle and practice which it be possible to conceive the duke of york who have for many year be commander-in-chief die in January of the same year and on he death the king actually propose to take that office on himself for the moment lord liverpool be able to induce he to abandon the idea and to confer the post on the duke of wellington but it have take such possession of he mind that he recur to it again when on canning become prime-minister the duke resign the office and he press it on the cabinet with singular pertinacity till on canning 's death the duke be prevail on to resume the command it be evident that no arrangement could possibly be more inconsistent with every principle of the constitution the very foundation of parliamentary government be that every officer of every department be responsible to parliament for the proper discharge of he duty but the investiture of the sovereign with ministerial office of any kind must involve either the entire withdrawal of that department from parliamentary control or the exposure of the sovereign to constant criticism which however essential to the efficiency of the department and consequently to the public service would be wholly inconsistent with the respect due to the crown the first alternative it be certain that no parliament would endure for a moment the second by impair the dignity of the monarch could scarcely fail in some degree to threaten the stability of the monarchy itself canning 's ministry be too brief to give time for any transaction of internal importance that of lord goderich who succeed he though longer by the almanac be practically briefer still since it never meet parliament at all but be form and fall to piece between the prorogation and the next meeting of the house but that which follow under the presidency of the duke of wellington though after a few month its composition become entirely tory be memorable for the first great departure from those maxim of the constitution which have be reckon among its most essential principle ever since the revolution of the measure which bear that character one be carry against the resistance of the ministry the other by the minister themselves and it may at first sight appear singular that the larger measure of the two be propose by the duke after those member of he cabinet who have originally be suppose to give it something of a liberal complexion have quit it the reform bill of 1832 -- to which we shall come in the next chapter -- have be often call a peaceful revolution the toleration act as we may call the bill of 1828 and 1829 be scarcely less deserving of that character the constitution as it have exist for the last hundred and forty year have be not only a protestant but a church of england constitution not only all roman catholic but all member of protestant non-conforming sect all who refuse to sign a declaration against the doctrine of transubstantiation and also to take the sacrament accord to the rite of the one establish church be disqualify for any appointment of trust that the object with which the test act have be frame and support be rather political than religious be notorious indeed it be support by the protestant dissenter though they themselves be to suffer by its operation so greatly at that time do the dread of popery and the french king overpower every other consideration -lrb- 192 -rrb- on the roman catholic after the reign of jame ii have increase that apprehension the restriction be tighten but those which inflict disability on the protestant non-conformist have be gradually relax the repeal of two the five mile and the conventicle act have as we have see in the last chapter be recent measure of lord liverpool but the test act still remain though it have long be practically a dead letter the union with scotland where the majority of the population be presbyterian have render it almost impossible to maintain the exclusion of englishman resemble the scotch in they religious tenet from preferment and even from seat in the house of common to which scotchman be admissible and though one prime-minister -lrb- stanhope -rrb- fail in he attempt to induce parliament to repeal the test act and he successor -lrb- walpole -rrb- refuse he countenance to any repetition of the proposal even he do not reject such a compromise as be devise to evade it and in the first year of george ii 's reign -lrb- by which time it be notorious that many protestant non-conformist have obtain seat in municipal corporation and even in the house of common who yet have never qualify themselves by compliance with the act of 1673 -rrb- a bill of indemnity be introduce by the minister with at least the tacit consent of the english bishop to protect all such person from the penalty which they have incur and the bill which be only annual in its operation be renew almost every year till in respect of all such place or dignity -lrb- if a seat in the house of common can be describe by either of those name -rrb- no one thought of inquire whether a man so long as he be a protestant adhere to the established church or not member of the house of common even openly avow they nonconformity and at time found argument on the fact the practical nullification of the test act by these periodical bill of indemnity have be for some time use by two opposite party -- both that which regard the maintenance of the exclusive connection of the constitution with the church of england as of vital importance to both church and constitution and that which be oppose to all restriction or disqualiflcation on religious grounds -- as a argument in they favor the one contend that there could be no sufficient reason for repeal a law from which no one suffer the other that it be a needless provocation of ill-feeling to retain a law which no one ever dream of enforce hitherto the latter have be the weaker party one or two motion for the repeal of the test act which have be make in former year -lrb- 193 -rrb- have be defeat without attract any great notice but in the spring of 1828 lord john russel then a comparatively young member but rapidly rise into influence with he party carry a motion in the house of common for leave to bring in a bill to repeal the act so far as it concern the protestant non-conformist by a very decisive majority -lrb- 194 -rrb- in spite of all the effort of peel and he colleague the ministry be place in a difficult position by he success since the usual practice for a cabinet defeat on a question of principle be to resign and it be probable that they would not have depart from that rule now have not this defeat occur so early in they official life but on this occasion it seem to they that other question have to be consider besides the constitutional doctrine of submission on the part of a ministry to the judgment of the parliament -lrb- 195 -rrb- theirs be now the fourth administration that have hold office within twelve month and they resignation which would compel the construction of a fifth could hardly fail not only to embarrass the sovereign but to shake public confidence in government generally it be also certain that they could rely on a division in the house of lord be favorable to they if they choose to appeal from one house to the other under these circumstance they have to consider what they line of conduct should be and there never be two minister better suit to deal with a embarrassment of that kind than the duke of wellington and mr peel the duke 's doctrine of government be that the country be never govern in practice accord to the extreme principle of any party whatever -lrb- 196 -rrb- while peel 's disposition at all time incline he to compromise he be quite aware that on this and similar question public feeling have undergo great alteration since the beginning of the century there be a large and increase party numbering in its rank many man of deep religious feeling and many firm supporter of the principle of a established church be also sincere believer in the pre-eminent excellence of the church of england who have a conscientious repugnance to the employment of the most solemn ordinance of a religion as a mere political test of a person 's qualification for the discharge of civil duty in the opinion of the bishop of oxford -lrb- dr lloyd -rrb- this be the feeling of a very large majority of the church itself and of the university -lrb- 197 -rrb- peel therefore come to the conclusion -- to which he have no difficulty in bring he colleague the prime-minister -- that it might be more for the real interest of the church and of religion to consent to a alteration in the law than to trust to the result of the debate in the house of lord to maintain the exist state of thing accordingly after several conference with the most influential member of the episcopal bench he frame a declaration to be substitute for the sacramental test bind all who should be require to subscribe it -- a description which include all who should be appoint to a civil or corporate office -- never to exert any power or influence which they might thus acquire to subvert or to endeavor to subvert the protestant church of england scotland or ireland as by law establish the declaration be amend in the house of lord by the addition of the statement that this declaration be subscribe on the true faith of a christian introduce at the instigation of lord eldon who have not hold the great seal since the dissolution of lord liverpool 's administration but who be still look up to by a numerous party as the foremost champion of sound protestantism in either house not that the addition of these word at all diminish the dissatisfaction with which the great lawyer regard the bill on the contrary he believe it to be not only a weapon wilfully put into the hand of the enemy of the established church but a violation of the constitution of which as he regard it the exist security be a part he point out that the king himself be oblige to take the sacrament at he coronation and he argue from this and other grounds that the church of england combine with the state form together the constitution of great britain and that the act now to be repeal be necessary to the preservation of that constitution with every respect for that great lawyer he argument on this point do not appear sustainable for the bill in question do not sweep away security for the established church but merely substitute for one which long disuse and indemnity have render wholly inoperative a fresh security which as it would be steadily put in force might fairly be expect to prove far more efficacious and it can hardly be contend that it be not within the province of the legislature to modify a exist law in this spirit and with this object however important might be the purpose for which that law have originally be frame nay it might fairly be argue that the more important that object be the more be they who strengthen the means of attain that object entitle to be regard as faithful servant and supporter of the principle of the constitution the measure however relieve the protestant dissenter alone not only do lord eldon 's amendment preserve the christian character of the legislature but the requirement to sign the declaration against transubstantiation which be unrepealed leave the roman catholic still under the same disqualification as before but the day of those disqualification be manifestly number indeed many of those who have follow the minister in they original resistance to the repeal of the test act have be avowedly influence by the conviction that it could not fail to draw after it the removal of the disability affect the roman catholic as have be say before the disability in question have originally be impose on the roman catholic on political rather than on religious grounds and the political reason for they have be greatly weaken if not wholly sweep away by the extinction of the stuart line of prince they retention or removal have therefore now become almost wholly a religious question and the late bill have clearly establish as a principle that though the state have a right to require of member of other religious sect that they should not abuse the power which might arise from any position or employment to which they might be admit to the subversion or injury of the established church of england yet when security for they innocuousness in this respect be provide it be not justified in inquire into the detail of they faith and if this be to be the rule of government for the future the conclusion be irresistible that a similar security be all that the state be justify in demand from roman catholic and that it could have no warrant for investigate they opinion on transubstantiation or any other purely theological tenet there could be no doubt that the feeling of the public have be gradually and steadily come round to this view of the question the last house of common have not only pass a bill to remove roman catholic disability -lrb- which be afterward throw out in the house of lord -rrb- but have also pass by a still larger majority a resolution move by lord franci leveson gower -lrb- who be now the secretary for ireland -rrb- in favor of endow the roman catholic priest in ireland and at the late general election the opinion of the candidate on what be commonly call catholic emancipation have be the great cardinal question with a great number probably a majority of the constituency it may be remark that it be not the test act which exclude roman catholic from parliament but a bill which fifteen year later have be pass -lrb- probably under the influence of lord shaftesbury -rrb- at the time when the whole kingdom be excite by the daily expand revelation of the popish plot -lrb- 198 -rrb- and this bill have a loop-hole which be never discover till now but the discovery of which totally change the whole aspect of the question even before the bill repeal the test act have pass through all its stage sir franci burdett have again induce the house of common to pass a resolution condemn the continuance of the roman catholic disability to which however the peer by a far larger majority refuse they concurrence -lrb- 199 -rrb- but within a month of this division the aspect of the whole question be change by the shrewdness of a irish barrister who have discover the loop-hole or flaw in the bill of 1678 already allude to and by the energy and promptitude with which he avail himself of he discovery mr o'connell have a professional reputation scarcely surpass by any member of the irish bar he be also a man of ancient family in the county of kerry and be a roman catholic he have for several year be the spokesman of he brother roman catholic on most public occasion he now on examination of the bill of 1678 perceive that though it forbid any roman catholic from take a seat in either house of parliament it contain no prohibition to prevent any constituency from elect he its representative and when on the occasion of some change which be make in the cabinet the representation of the county clare be vacate by its member mr vesey fitzgerald accept the office of president of the board of trade o'connell instantly offer himself as a candidate in opposition to the new minister who of course seek re-election mr fitzgerald be a man who have always support the demand of the roman catholic he be also personally popular and have the undivided support of nearly all the gentleman and principal land-owner of the county in which he himself have large property but o'connell 's cause be take up by the entire roman catholic priesthood address in he favor be read at the altar of the different church and after five day ' polling mr fitzgerald withdraw from the contest the sheriff in great perplexity make a special return report that mr fitzgerald be propose be a protestant as a fit person to represent the county in parliament that mr o'connell a roman catholic be also propose that he mr o'connell have declare before the sheriff that he be a roman catholic and intend to continue a roman catholic and that a protest have be make by several elector against he return it be accept as a return of o'connell who however make no attempt to take he seat though when he first stand he have assure the elector that there be no law to prevent he from do so but the importance of he success be not to be measure by he actual presence or absence in the house of common for the remainder of a session it have make it absolutely impossible to continue the maintenance of the disability what one irish constituency have do other irish constituency might be depend on to do -lrb- 200 -rrb- and it be quite certain that as opportunity offer almost every constituency in munster and connaught and many in leinster would follow the example of clare and return roman catholic representative while to retain a law which prevent forty or fifty man duly elect by irish constituency from take they seat must have appear impossible to all but a few whom respect for the undoubted sincerity of they attachment to they own religion and to the constitution as they understand it be the only consideration which can save they from be regard as dangerous fanatic at all event the minister be not among they and the duke of wellington though he have previously hope by postpone the farther consideration of the question for a year or two to gain time for a calmer examination of it when the exist excitement have cool down -lrb- 201 -rrb- at once admit the conviction that the result of the clare election have render farther delay impossible in he view and that of those of he colleague whose judgment he estimate most highly the irish constituency and they probable action at future election be not the only party whose opinion or feeling must be regard by a responsible statesman but to they must be add the constituency of the larger island also since while to quote the language of mr peel the general election of 1826 have take place under circumstance especially calculate to call forth the manifestation of protestant feeling throughout the country they have return a majority of member in favor of concession as be prove by the recent division on sir f burdett 's motion moreover apart from the merit or demerit of concession take by itself there be a manifest danger that the keep up of the excitement on the subject by a continued adherence to the policy of restriction might especially among such a people as the irish so impulsive and in the lower class so absolutely under the dominion of the priest kindle a excitement on other subject also still more difficult to deal with it be even already certain that the roman catholic priest be endeavor to tamper with the loyalty of the soldier of they persuasion nor be it clerical influence alone that the government have to dread a year or two before a catholic association have be form which include among its member all the wealthiest and ablest of the roman catholic layman nobleman squire and barrister its organization have be so skilfully conduct and all its measure have be so carefully keep within the requirement of the law that the crown lawyer on be consult pronounce it impossible to interfere with it and by what may be call a peaceful agitation it have attain such extraordinary power over the mind of the bulk of the roman catholic that the lord-lieutenant report that he be quite certain that they could lead on the people to open rebellion at a moment 's notice and that they organization be such that in the hand of desperate and intelligent leader they would be extremely formidable -lrb- 202 -rrb- under all these circumstance the duke have no hesitation in decide that it have become absolutely necessary to concede the demand of the roman catholic and they supporter for a removal of they political disability and it be equally obvious that the more promptly the concession be make the more gracious it would seem and the greater be the probability of its have the conciliatory and tranquillizing effect the hope of which make it so desirable he be not a man to lose time when he have once make up he mind it be already too late in the session for anything to be do in 1828 but the parliament have scarcely be prorogue before he put he view on the subject before the king and begin in concert with the home-secretary to frame a bill such as he hope might settle the long-agitated question without do more violence than be necessary to the feeling of those whose opposition or reluctance he be aware he should have to encounter : among whom be the king himself who though thirty year before he have with a ostentation rather unbecome consider he position put himself forward as a advocate of emancipation have subsequently change he opinion and have recently take more than one occasion to declare that he have never doubt that as the head and protector of the protestant religion he be bind to refuse he assent to any relaxation of the exist law -lrb- 203 -rrb- the duke however be too well acquaint with he royal master 's character to apprehend any real firmness of resistance from he but he know that a great majority of the clergy and no small portion of the country gentleman be conscientiously and immovably fix in opposition to any concession at all some refuse to regard the question in any but a purely religious light and object to associate in the task of legislation for those whom they regard as adherent of a idolatrous superstition while those who mingle political reasoning with that found on theology dwelt also on the danger to be apprehend to the state if political power be give to those whose allegiance to the king be divide with another allegiance which they acknowledge to a foreign prelate and he have presently a unmistakable proof afford he how great be the strength of this party in the country peel be one of the representative of the university of oxford and as from he earliest enjoyment of a seat in parliament he have be a prominent opponent of the roman catholic claim he consider that it be to that maintenance of a policy identify in they eye with that protestant ascendency which he supporter take to be both the chief bulwark and one of the most essential part of the constitution that he owe he position as they member with a conscientiousness which be rather overstrain and not quite consistent with the legitimate position of a member of the house of common as a representative and not a delegate he now conceive that he change of view on the subject make it proper for he to give he constituent a opportunity of make choice of some one else who should more faithfully represent they he accordingly resign he seat offer himself at the same time for re-election but he be defeat by a very large majority though he competitor be one who could not possibly be put on a level with he either for university distinction or for parliamentary eminence not the less however for all they difficulty and discouragement do the minister proceed in the course on which they have resolve they insert in the speech with which the king open the session of 1829 a recommendation to the house to take into consideration the whole condition of ireland and to review the law which impose civil disability on he majesty 's roman catholic subject and with as little delay as possible they introduce a bill to remove those disability but there be another measure which they feel it to be indispensable should precede it a previous sentence of the royal speech have describe the catholic association as one dangerous to the public peace and inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution keep alive discord and ill-will among he majesty 's subject and one which must if permit to continue effectually obstruct every effort permanently to improve the condition of ireland and the minister naturally regard it as they first duty to suppress a body which could deserve to be so describe they feel too that the large measure of concession and conciliation which they be about to announce would lose half its grace and more than half its effect if it could possibly be represent as a submission to a agitation and intimidation which they have not the power nor the courage to resist they determine therefore to render such a imputation impossible by previously suppress the association it be evident that it could not be extinguish by any means short of a act of parliament and the course pursue with the discussion which take place respect it show in a very clear and instructive manner the view take by statesman of the difference between what be loyal or illegal constitutional or unconstitutional they apprehension that conduct may be entirely legal that be to say within the letter of the law but at the same time perfectly unconstitutional outside of and adverse to the whole spirit of the constitution the royal speech have not venture to describe the association as illegal the duke of wellington expressly admit that in the original institution and formation of the society there be nothing strictly illegal -lrb- 204 -rrb- and its founder and chief mr o'connell have be at all time careful to inculcate on he follower the necessity of avoid any violation of the law but the speech have also declare the association to be inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution and its act as the duke proceed to describe they certainly bear out that declaration those act consist principally in levy a tax upon certain of he majesty 's subject call catholic rent and this by means and act of extreme violence by appoint person to collect these rent and farther by adopt measure to organize the catholic population by appoint person to superintend that organization and by assume to themselves the government of the country and still more affect to assume it besides they expend this rent in a manner contrary to and utterly inconsistent with all law and order and the constitution of the country no member of either house deny the accuracy of this description of the association 's proceedings and if it be correct it be incontrovertible that the denunciation of it as a utterly unconstitutional body be not too strong indeed the fact of its levy a tax upon a portion of the king 's subject -lrb- to say nothing of the intimidation amounting to compulsion by which as be notorious it be in many instance exact -rrb- be the assumption of one of the most important function of the imperial parliament it be the erection of a _ imperium in imperio _ which no statesman intrust with the government of a country can be justify in tolerate and this be feel by the opposition as well as by the minister by the whig as fully as by the tory the most eloquent of the whig party mr stanley be as decide as mr peel himself in affirm that the existence of the association be inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution and that it be dangerous that the people of a country should look up to any public body distinct from the government oppose to the government and monopolize they attachment and obedience -lrb- 205 -rrb- it be therefore with the almost unanimous approval of both party that the bill frame for the suppression of the association be receive the framing of such a bill be not unattended by difficulty as peel acknowledge -lrb- 206 -rrb- since no one wish to declare that every political meeting be illegal while at the same time it be necessary to guard against have its enactment evade since a more dangerous precedent than the successful evasion of act of the legislature could scarcely be conceive but the measure as it be propose skilfully steer clear of these difficulty it meet they by intrust the enforcement of the law to be enact to one person alone the bill propose to give to the lord-lieutenant and to he alone the power of suppress any association or meeting which he might think dangerous to the public peace or inconsistent with the due administration of the law together with power to interdict the assembly of any meeting of which previous notice should have be give and which he should think likely to endanger the public peace or to prove inconsistent with the due administration of the law and farther to interdict any meeting or association which might be interdict from assemble or which might be suppress under this act from receive and place at they control any money by the name of rent or any other name but the act be not to be one of perpetual duration it could not be conceal that such a prohibition or limitation of the general right of public meeting and public discussion be a suspension of a part of the constitution and therefore the minister be content to limit its operation to one year and the end of the then next session of parliament feeling satisfy that there would be no objection to continue it if there should be any necessity for its continuance and this limitation be a substantial mitigation of its severity it make the bill as mr stanley correctly describe it not a permanent infringement on the constitution but a temporary deviation from it give those power which be necessary at the moment but not maintain they a hour longer than they be necessary and this seem to be the course most in accordance with the spirit of the constitution with former practice with common-sense deed which violate the letter of the law can be deal with by the law but action or course of action which even if they may be think to overstep the law transgress it so narrowly as to elude conviction can only be reach by enactment which also go in some degree beyond the ordinary law and so go beyond it be to that extent encroachment on the ordinary privilege and rights of the subject and suspension of the constitution but the very term suspension show that the power confer be but temporary otherwise it would be synonymous with abrogation and all party may wisely agree as they do in this instance to a temporary suspension of the people 's rights though there would be none to whom they permanent abrogation would not be intolerable the bill then for the suppression of the association pass with universal approval and it may be regard as furnish a model for deal with similar association if ever they should arise and as soon as it be pass mr peel introduce the greater measure that for the repeal of the disability in draw the necessary bill the minister have have two question of special importance to consider : firstly whether it should be unlimited concession which should be grant such as would throw open to the roman catholic every kind of civil office and secondly whether it should be accompany by any other measure which might render it more palatable to its adversary as diminish a portion at least of the danger which those who regard the question in a purely political light most apprehend on the first point it be determine that with the exception of three civil office those of the lord chancellor of england and ireland and the lord-lieutenant of ireland -lrb- 207 -rrb- and some of a purely ecclesiastical character such as the judge of the court of arch every kind of preferment should be open to the roman catholic -lrb- 208 -rrb- the declaration against transubstantiation and the oath of supremacy certain expression in which be the obstacle which have hitherto keep the roman catholic out of office and out of parliament be to be repeal and another to be substitute for they which should merely bind he who take it to defend the king to maintain the protestant succession and to declare that it be not a article of he faith and that he renounce reject and abjure the opinion that prince excommunicate or depose by the pope might be depose and murder and that he disclaim disavow and solemnly abjure any intention to subvert the present church establishment as settle by law within this realm and that he would never exercise any privilege to which he be or might become entitle to disturb or weaken the protestant religion or protestant government in this kingdom -lrb- 209 -rrb- the second question be it will probably be confess even more important pitt who have always contemplate and have encourage the irish roman catholic to contemplate the abolition of they political disability as a indispensable appendage to or it may be say part of the union have design farther not to confine he benefit to the layman but to endow the roman catholic clergy with adequate stipend a proposal which be receive with the greatest thankfulness not only by the irish prelate and clergy themselves but also by the head of they church at rome who be willing in return to give the crown a veto on all the ecclesiastical appointment of they church in the two island -lrb- 210 -rrb- the justice of grant such a endowment could hardly be contest the reformation in ireland if what have take place there could be call a reformation at all have be wholly different from the movement which have almost extinguish popery in england the great majority of the irish people have never cease to adhere to the romish form and the reformation there have be simply a transfer of the property of the romish church to the church of england unaccompanied by any corresponding change of belief in the people who have a undeniable right to claim that the state while make this transfer should not deprive of all provision the clergy to whose ministration they still cling with a zeal and steadiness augment rather than diminish by the discouragement under which they adhere to they the policy of grant such endowment be equally conspicuous no measure could so bind the clergy to the government and no such security for the loyalty and peaceful orderly behavior of the poorer class could be provide as might be expect from the attachment to the government of those who have over they a influence so powerful in its character and so unbounded in its strength as they priest and the duke of wellington who have at one time be himself the irish secretary and as a intimate friend of lord castlereagh who hold that office at the time of the union have a perfect knowledge of what have be intend at that time -- and who be of course aware of the very decide favor which the house of common have so lately show to the project -- propose to follow out pitt 's plan in that particular and to connect a provision -lrb- 211 -rrb- for the roman catholic clergy with the removal of they political disability from the layman unluckily peel who throughout the whole transaction be of all the cabinet the counsellor on whose judgment he most rely take a different view of the expediency of make such a provision have indeed no objection to it in point of principle but he see many practical difficulty which he press on the duke with great earnestness he argue that for the government to apply a sum of money to the payment of the minister of the church of rome in ireland grant a license for the performance of they spiritual function would be a virtual and complete supersession if not repeal of the law which prohibit intercourse with rome and ask could the state affect to be ignorant that the bishop whom it pay derive he right to be a bishop from the see of rome another difficulty he find in the apprehension that the admission of the right of the roman catholic clergy to a endowment might produce similar claim on the part of the dissenter in england who contribute in like manner to the support of they own religion and of the established religion also he suggest farther that if the roman catholic priest be allow in addition to he stipend to receive due easter offering etc from he parishioner he condition would then be better than that of the minister of the established church in many of the parish in ireland and finally he urge the practical objection that the endowment would greatly strengthen the opposition to the whole measure by the reluctance which on purely religious grounds many would feel to the endowment of the roman catholic faith who would yet be incline to acquiesce in the removal of the disability on grounds rather political than religious he be not insensible to the importance of establish some bond of connection between the roman catholic clergy and the state but he believe that the omission of a provision for they endowment be important to the ultimate success of the government in propose the measure before they it be not probable that the duke be greatly influence by the first or what may be call the constitutional objection -- that any concert with the papal court with respect to the appointment or endowment of its clergy would be a violation of the act which prohibit any intercourse with rome the removal of the disability require the repeal of one act of parliament and if the hold communication with rome on the subject of clerical appointment should be so construe as to require the repeal of another it would hardly seem that there could be any greater violation of or departure from the principle of the constitution in repeal two act than in repeal one as to the second of peel 's objection the english dissenter could not possibly be say to stand on the same ground as the irish roman catholic since they minister have certainly never be deprive by any act of the state of any provision which they have previously enjoy but they position as unendowed minister be clearly one of they own make the possible inferiority in point of emolument of some of the protestant cure in ireland to that which might be enjoy by some of the roman catholic clergy could hardly be regard as the foundation of any argument at all since no law have ever undertake or ever could undertake to give at all time and under all circumstance equal remuneration to equal labor but the consideration last suggest be exactly the one to influence such a mind as that of the duke of wellington generally contented to deal with a present difficulty he be determine to carry emancipation because he see that the clare election have make it impossible to withhold or even to delay it and be so determine he be desirous to avoid encumber it with any addition which might increase the opposition to it at the same time he be far from be sanguine of its effect with whatever guard or security it might be accompany to pacify the country or to avert rebellion -lrb- 212 -rrb- which in he apprehension be undoubtedly impending and under the influence of these combine feeling he eventually withdraw that clause from the bill it be accompany by another bill disfranchise the forty-shilling freeholder in ireland they be a class of voter sink in the deepest poverty and such as certainly could not well be suppose capable of form much less of exercise a independent judgment on political matter yet this bill be remarkable as have be the only enactment pass since the revolution to narrow the franchise it have no opposition to anticipate from english or scotch member and be accept by the irish member as the price of emancipation no measure that have ever be frame since the revolution have cause such excitement in the country but the preponderance of feeling in its favor be equally mark in both house of parliament in the house of common 320 support it while only 142 could be marshal against it in the house of lord 213 divide for it against 109 and in April it receive the royal assent the general policy of remove the disability it be not necessary to discuss here it be quite clear that the clare election have render it impossible to maintain they and if some of those who judge of measure solely by they effect still denounce this act as one which have fail in its object of tranquillize ireland many of those who admit the failure ascribe it to the omission to accompany it by one secure a state endowment for the roman catholic clergy pronounce it without that appendage a half measure such as rarely succeed and never deserve success however that may be it be certain that the measure couple with the repeal of the test act of the previous year be one which make a great and permanent change in the practical working of the constitution of the kingdom as it have be interpret for the last one hundred and fifty year of that constitution one of the lead feature ever since the restoration have be understand to be the establishment and maintenance of the political as well as the ecclesiastical ascendency of the church of england on that ascendency the repeal of the test act in 1828 have make the first and that a great inroad and the present statute entirely abolish it as a principle of government so far as political privilege go every christian sect be now place on a footing of complete equality but so to place they may fairly be regard as have be require not only by justice and expediency but by reason draw from the history of the nation and from the circumstance under which these disability have be impose before the rebellion no one be exclude from the english parliament on account of he religion whether he be a roman catholic a presbyterian or a member of any other of the various sect which be gradually arise in the country it be not till after the restoration that a recollection of the crime of the puritan when they have get the upper-hand and the fear of machination and intrigue incompatible with the freedom and independence of the people which be imputed to the roman catholic give birth to the statute deprive both protestant and roman catholic non-conformist of all legislative and political power the restriction thus impose on the presbyterian and other protestant sect have as we have see be gradually relax by a periodical act of indemnity indeed after the union with scotland it be impossible with any show of consistency to maintain they since as it have be already point out after presbyterianism have be recognize as the established religion of scotland it would have seem strangely unreasonable to regard it as a disqualification on the southern side of the border but as long as the stuart prince be from time to time disquieting the government by they open invasion or secret intrigue no such relaxation could with safety be grant to the roman catholic since it could hardly be expect that they would forbear to employ any power which they might acquire for the service of a prince of they own religion that danger however which ever since 1745 have be a very shadowy one have wholly pass away with the life of the last stuart lay prince charle edward and he death leave the ruler of the kingdom and adviser of the sovereign free to take a different and larger view of they duty to the nation as a whole it be notorious that the number of non-conformist be large in the middle of the last century it have receive a considerable accession through the institution of the new sect of wesleyan methodist which through the supineness of the clergy of the established church in that generation have gradually increase till it be estimate that the various dissent sect in england equal at least half the number of the member of the established church in wale they be believe to form the majority in scotland three-fourth of the people be presbyterian and in ireland the roman catholic outnumber the protestant in nearly the same proportion take england wale scotland and ireland together a calculation which reckon the different sect of protestant and roman catholic non-conformist unite at half the entire population would probably not have err very widely from the truth it must have be the aim of every statesman deserving of the name to weld these different religious party into one harmonious whole as far as they civil position go and measure which have that tendency could not be foreign to the constitution properly understand a constitution which confines its benefit to one-half of a nation hardly merit the title of a constitution at all for every constitution ought to extend its protection and its privilege equally to every portion of the people unless there be some peculiarity in the principle or habit of any one portion which make its participation in they dangerous to the rest it have undoubtedly be the doctrine of pitt and of the greater part of those who since he time have hold the rein of government that if any portion of the king 's subject do cherish a temper dangerous to the rest it be because they be debar from privilege to which they conceive themselves to have a just right and that they discontent and turbulence be the fruit of the restriction impose on they in propose to remove such a grievance pitt certainly conceive himself to be act in accordance with the strictest principle of the constitution and not so much innovate upon it as restore it to its original comprehensiveness and so of the measure as it be now carry it will apparently be correct to say that though it do make a important change in the practical working of the constitution it make it only by revert to the fundamental principle of civil and religious liberty to which every subject have a right which have only be temporarily restrain under the apprehension of danger to the state and which the cessation of that apprehension make it a duty to re-establish in all they fulness but it be by no means clear that in the conduct of the measure the constitution be not violate in one very important point the proper relation subsist between a constituency and its representative by mr peel 's resignation of he seat for the university of oxford that he be sensible that the act stand in need of explanation be prove by the careful statement of the motive and consideration that determine he to it which he draw up twenty year afterward they be of a twofold character to quote he own word : when i resolve to advise and to promote to the utmost of my power the settlement of that question i resolve at the same time to relinquish not only my official station -lrb- 213 -rrb- but the representation of the university of oxford i think that such decisive proof that i could have no object political or personal in take a course different from that which i have previously take would add to my influence and authority so far at least as the adjustment of the particular question at issue be concerned i can not deny that in vacate my seat i be act upon the impulse of private feeling rather than upon a dispassionate consideration of the constitutional relation between a representative and he constituent i will not seek to defend the resolution to which i come by argument draw from the peculiar character of the academic body or from the special nature of the trust confide to its member still less will i contend that my example ought to be follow by other to whom may be offer the same painful alternative of disregard the dictate of they own conscience or of act in opposition to the opinion and disappointing the expectation of they constituent i will say no more than that my position be a very peculiar one that i have many painful sacrifice to make and that it would have be a great aggravation of they if it could have say with truth that i be exercise a authority derive from the confidence of the university to promote measure injurious in she deliberate judgment either to she own interest or to those of the church no one would willingly censure too severely a act dictate by a sense of honor even if somewhat overstrained and too scrupulously delicate but when mr peel speak of defend or not defend he deed he clearly admit it to be one open to impeachment and when he forbear to contend that he example ought to be follow he seem practically to confess a consciousness that any defense against such impeachment must fail while the last sentence quote above involve a assertion that a constituency -lrb- in this instance one of the two most important constituency in the kingdom -rrb- could be justify in regard a measure require by the safety or at least by the welfare of the state as injurious to its own interest and so far admit a possible severance between the interest of a particular class or body and those of the whole community which can have no real existence that however be not the point to be investigate here the charge as it seem to which mr peel 's deed lay he open be that by it he lower the position and character of a member of parliament from those of a representative to those of a delegate it be a adoption of the principle lay down for he own guidance by a colleague of mr burke above fifty year before and indignantly repudiate by that great political philosopher as proceed from a entire misapprehension of the rights of a constituency and of a member -lrb- 214 -rrb- of parliament he tell the elector of bristol that when they have choose they member he be not a member of bristol but a member of parliament and that if the local constituent should have a interest or should form a opinion evidently opposite to the real good of the rest of the community the member for that place ought to be as far as any other from any endeavor to give it effect that a representative owe to he constituent not he industry only but he judgment and betray instead of serve they if he sacrifice it to they opinion and in so say he carry with he the concurrence and approval of all he contemporary whose sentiment on such a question be entitle to weight in the states-general of france each member be by the original constitution of that body a delegate and not a representative he could not even remonstrate against the most oppressive grievance of which the previous instruction of the constituent body have not instruct he to complain and this limitation of he duty and power be undoubtedly one very principal cause which lead to the states-general so rapidly fall into utter disrepute it be no light thing to take a step which have a tendency to bring down the british parliament to the level of the despise and long-disused states-general and it be the more necessary to put the case in a clear and true light because at the present day there be a evident disposition on the part of constituency to avail themselves of peel 's conduct in this instance as a precedent in spite of he protest against its be so regarded and to fetter they representative with precise instruction and a corresponding willingness on the part of candidate to purchase support at election by a submissive give of pledge on a variety of subject so numerous as to leave themselves no freedom of judgment at all on the great majority of subject which come before parliament a member of parliament if he be a sensible and a honest man have a far better opportunity of obtain correct information and form a sound opinion than can be within reach of any constituency whose proneness to misjudge be usually in exact proportion to the magnitude of its number every elector justifiably may and naturally will seek to ascertain that between the candidate whom he support and himself there be a general conformity of opinion a absolute identity he will never find and he have no right to ask -lrb- 215 -rrb- note : -lrb- footnote 182 : # 118776000 alison c lxxvi -rrb- -lrb- footnote 183 : see lord

which indeed after the conclusion of the war have be make at time the subject of earnest petition be one in which a far greater number of people have a lively interest than that excite by catholic emancipation the englishman who have advocate that measure have be strive for the adoption of a principle rather than for a concession from which they could expect any personal benefit since very few in any english or scotch constituency be roman catholic or desire to return a roman catholic representative but thousand in every county include the whole body of citizen of some of the largest and most flourishing town feel a personal concern in the attainment of parliamentary reform as the measure which would give they and which could alone give they that voice in the affair of the kingdom to which they feel themselves entitle but which they have never yet enjoy and before the end of the next session the prospect of the early success of they aspiration be greatly increase by the death of the king george iv who in he early manhood have attach himself to the whig with a ardor and ostentation altogether unbecome he position as heir to the throne have formally separated himself from they after the death of fox in 1806 and have gradually come to regard they adversary with a favor as exclusive as he have formerly show to themselves but the duke of clarence who now succeed to the throne have always show a lean toward the whig who of late have be commonly regard as the reform party while the war last and during the few remain year of the reign of george iii no active step toward reform be take in parliament but under george iv more than one borough convict of gross and habitual corruption as have be mention be disfranchise grampound be so punish in the time of lord liverpool

hint at the possibility of obviate that difficulty by allow poll to be take in different part of the county and since the duke have be in office two more borough penrhyn and east retford have also be disfranchise though the reformer fail in they endeavor to get the seat thus vacate transfer to manchester and birmingham with the accession of the new sovereign however they become more active they find encouragement in other circumstance also many of those who be commonly call the ultra tory have be so alienate from the duke 's government by the emancipation act that they be know to be ready to coalesce with almost any party for the sake of overturn he administration moreover as forty year before the french revolution of 1789 have cause great political excitement in england so now the new french revolution of July act as a strong stimulus on the movement party in this as well as in other country and altogether there be a very general feeling that the time for important change have come the duke of wellington be not blind to the prevalence of the idea and be by no means willing to admit that he own policy of the preceding year have in the least contribute to strengthen it he conceive it to be he duty to discountenance it by every means in he power but the step which he take with that object only invigorated and inflamed it as prime-minister he insert in the speech with which the new sovereign open he first parliament in the autumn after he accession a general panegyric on that happy form of government under which through the favor of divine providence this country have enjoy for a long succession of year a greater share of internal peace of commercial prosperity of true liberty of all that constitute social happiness than have fall to the lot of any other country of the world and in he own character a few night afterward he add a practical commentary on those sentence of the royal speech when in allusion to lord gray 's expression of a hope that the minister would prepare to redress the grievance of the people by a reform of the parliament he repudiate the suggestion altogether avow that the government be contemplate no such measure and add that he would go farther and say that he have never read or hear of any measure up to that moment which in any degree satisfy he mind that the state of the representation could be improve or render more satisfactory to the country at large than at that moment he be fully convince that the country possess at that moment a legislature which answer all good purpose of legislation to a greater degree than any legislature have ever answer they in any country whatever and he would at once declare that as far as he be concern as long as he hold any station in the government of the country he should always feel it he duty to resist any measure of reform when propose by other such uncompromising language be not unnaturally regard by the opposition in both house as a direct defiance and the challenge be promptly take up both in and out of parliament it happen that at this moment the ministry be extremely unpopular in the city not indeed on account of he hostility to reform but in consequence of the recent introduction by the home-secretary of a police force in london on the model of one which the duke himself when irish secretary have establish in dublin the old watchman have be so notoriously inefficient that it might have be expect that the change would have be hail with universal approval and gratitude but it meet with a very different reception many of the newspaper which have not yet forgive the passing of catholic emancipation make it a ground for the strongest imputation on the duke himself some of they even go the length of affirm that he aim at the throne and that the organization of this new force be the means on which he reckon for the attainment of he object no story be too gross for the credulity of the populace to hear of such a plot be to believe it to believe it be to resolve to defeat it and at the beginning of November the government receive several warning that a plan be in agitation to raise a formidable riot on lord mayor 's day when the king and the duke himself be expect to dine with the lord mayor the lord mayor even write to the duke to suggest the prudence of he come strongly and sufficiently guard and the result of this advice be certainly strange the duke care little enough about personal danger to himself but he regard himself as specially bind by he office to watch over the public tranquillity and to do nothing that might be expect to endanger it he be at least equally solicitous that a new reign should not open with a tumult which could in any way be regard as a insult to the king and under the influence of these feeling he take the responsibility of give the king the unprecedented advice of abandon he intention of be present at the guildhall banquet such a step have a inevitable tendency to weaken the ministry still farther by the comment which it provoke even he own brother lord wellesley do not spare he sarcasm pronounce it the boldest act of cowardice he have ever hear of while the reformer ascribe the unpopularity which it confess to the duke 's declaration against any kind or degree of reform and to test the correctness of this opinion mr brougham who in the house of common be the most eloquent champion of reform give notice of a motion on the subject for the 16th of November before that day come however the ministry have cease to exist on the precede evening it have be defeat on a proposal to refer to a select committee the consideration of the civil list a new settlement of which be indispensable at the beginning of a new reign and on the morning of the 16th the duke resign not only advise the king to intrust the formation of the new cabinet to lord gray -- who be universally recognize as the head of the whig party -- but recommend he majesty also to be prepare to consent to a measure of moderate reform which though he could not bring himself to co-operate in it he be satisfy that the temper of the house of common if not of the people out-of-door also render unavoidable -lrb- 216 -rrb- the advice be take lord gray have no difficulty in form a ministry in which the whig be aid by the junction of several of the more moderate tory who have regard canning as they leader and from the very begin parliamentary reform be proclaim to be the one great object of he government it would be more correct to call it a reform of the house of common since there be no idea of interfere with the house of lord even in those part of it which be of a representative character the scotch and irish peer but by whatever title the ministerial policy be designate no one misunderstand what be intend and as parliament be after a few day adjourn over the christmas holiday the recess be spend by a sub-committee of the cabinet in frame a measure the great extension of we trade which be the fruit partly of he wise commercial policy and partly of the long war the rapid and prodigious growth of we manufacture develop by the inventive ingenuity of we mechanic and engineer have give a consideration and influence to the commercial manufacturing and moneyed class which could not be disregard the land-owner who have previously almost monopolize the representation no longer constitute the wealthiest class of the community pitt himself have raise a banker to the peerage more recently man closely connect with the commercial class have become cabinet minister one of whom have even subsequently sacrifice office to he feeling of the propriety of enfranchise a single town birmingham but there be other town at least equal in importance to birmingham which be unrepresented and it be clearly impossible to maintain a system which give representative to borough like gatton old sarum or corfe castle -- where the elector scarcely outnumber the member whom they elect -- and withhold they from large and opulent manufacturing centre like manchester leed and sheffield the enfranchisement therefore of these town and of other whose population and consequent importance though inferior to theirs be still vastly superior to those of many which have hitherto return representative be so manifestly reasonable and consistent with the principle of we parliamentary constitution that it be impossible to object to it and they enfranchisement unavoidably lead to the disfranchisement of the smaller borough unless the house of common be to be enlarged to a number which be not likely to tend to the facilitation of business indeed in the opinion of the framer of the bill the house be _ already too large _ and they propose to reduce its number by upward of sixty -- a step to which it be probable that many of those whose opposition contribute to defeat it subsequently repent of they resistance nevertheless the line adopt by the duke of wellington 's ministry show that there be still a large party to whom reform on a large scale be altogether distasteful and accordingly the bill which under the influence of these consideration lord gray 's administration bring forward in the spring of 1831 give rise to the fiercest struggle in both house of parliament that have be witness for many generation one parliament be dissolve two session of that which follow be open in a single year once the ministry itself be dissolve though speedily reconstruct and three bill be frame each in some degree differ from its predecessor in some of its detail though all preserve the same lead principle of disfranchise wholly or partially the smaller borough of enfranchise several large and grow town of increase the number of county representative and of enfranchise also some class which previously have have no right of vote it would be a waste of time to specify the variation in the three bill it be sufficient to confine we attention to that which eventually become law fifty-six borough be wholly disfranchise those in which the population fall short of a certain number -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and where the amount of assess tax pay by the inhabitant be correspondingly small thirty more be deprive of one of they member be those in which the population be between 2000 and 4000 and the seat thus vacate be divide between the town which since the revolution have gradually grow into importance the suburb of the metropolis and the county the majority of which be now divide into two half each half return two member as many as have previously represent the whole the boundary of the borough too be in most case extend more important perhaps in its influence on subsequent legislation be the alteration make in the qualification which constitute a elector hitherto the franchise the right of voting at election have be base on property the principle have not indeed be uniformly adhere to in the borough where as lord john russell in the speech with which he introduce the bill point out a curious variety of course have be adopt in some as he describe the exist practice the franchise be exercise by ' a select corporation ' that be to say it be in the possession of a small number of person to the exclusion of the great body of the inhabitant who have property and interest in the place represent in ancient time he believe every freeman be a inhabitant householder resident in the borough be competent to vote as however this arrangement exclude villein and stranger the franchise always belong to a particular body in every town -- a body undoubtedly possess of property for they bear the charge of they member and on they be assess the subsidy and tax vote by parliament but when villeinage cease various and opposite course seem to have be pursue in different borough in some adopt the liberal principle that all freeman be to be admit householder of all kind down to the lowest degree and even sometimes beyond be admit in other adopt the exclusive principle that villein and stranger be no part of the burgess new corporation be erect and the elective franchise be more or less confine to a select body but all these diversity and variety be now sweep away and a uniform franchise be establish all tenant whose rent amount to # 10 receive the franchise in borough while by a kindred amendment which be force on the minister at a very early stage of the measure tenant at will whose tent amount to # 50 become entitle to vote in the county the arrangement for take the poll be also greatly change instead of the fifteen day which have of late be allow for a county election two be now think sufficient -lrb- 217 -rrb- in borough the time be abridged in a similar proportion and the arrangement be facilitate by a division of county into several convenient polling district so that no elector should require to travel more than a few mile to record he vote this last change be universally accept as a great practical improvement from its tendency to lessen the expense of election contest which have rise to a enormous and ruinous height but every other part of the scheme be view with the greatest repugnance not to say dread by the opposition and every one of the bill be fight step by step in the house of common the first bill be only carry by a majority of one the second be absolutely reject by the house of lord and on the third the minister after carry it triumphantly through the lower house be defeat in the upper house on a point of detail which though of no great importance in itself they regard as a indication that the peer though they have consent to read it a second time would insist on remodel it to a great degree and if they be not allow to do so would again reject it altogether meanwhile the people be work up to a pitch of frenzy absolutely unprecedented never have agitator among whom some of the minister themselves be not ashamed to appear be so unscrupulous in they endeavor to excite discontent one cabinet minister write inflammatory article in the newspaper another publicly call the legitimate opposition of the peer the whisper of a faction and they exertion soon bear fearful fruit in london some of the peer who have be most prominent in they objection to the bill be hoot and pelt and one lord londonderry be nearly murder the king and queen be insult by mob in the park some of the rioter even openly threaten the queen with death because she be believe to be favorable to the anti-reformer in some of the most important provincial town the discontent break out into actual insurrection at bristol a tumultuous mob whose number be swell by crowd of the worst ruffian of the metropolis seek to murder the recorder sir charle wetherall when he come down to that city to hold the quarter-session and when defeat in they attack on he storm the mansion house and set it with the bishop 's palace and other public building and score of private house on fire several of the rioter themselves who have get drunk perishing in the flame a similar mob rise in arm at derby but do less mischief as there the magistrate know they duty better but nottingham almost equal bristol in its horror because the duke of newcastle be a resolute anti-reformer a ferocious gang attack and set on fire the fine old castle and not content with commit fearful ravages in the town roam over the adjacent district attack the house of many of the leading country gentleman plunder and burn the dwelling and in more than one instance murder some of the inhabitant the king have hitherto bear himself between the contend party in the state with scrupulous fairness to both though he have probably be take by surprise by the sweeping character of the change he minister have propose he have give they a frank support consent even at a moment 's notice to dissolve the parliament after the unfavorable division in the house of common on the first bill but he have at the same time warn they that he would never consent to employ any means of coercion to overbear the free decision of the house of lord and he have more than once reject as unconstitutional they solicitation to allow they to make peer with that object at last they endeavor to compel he consent by resign they office though the ground for so decide a step can hardly be deem sufficient since the provocation which they allege be only lord lyndhurst 's success in carry a amendment to take the enfranchise clause of the bill before those of disfranchisement so as to give the latter a more gracious appearance as if the borough to be extinguish be make to suffer not so much for they own positive unworthiness as in order to make room for other which have become of undeniably greater importance the king take the strictly constitutional line of accept they resignation and intrust the duke of wellington with the task of form a new administration warn the duke at the same time that he consider himself now pledge to grant a large measure of reform but the duke find the task impracticable and then as the only means of avert farther insurrectionary tumult which bear no slight resemblance to civil war and might not impossibly end in it the king do at last consent to permit the creation of a sufficient number of peer to insure the passing of the bill but he could not overcome he repugnance to the measure as a severe blow to the constitution -- one which would in effect be tantamount to the extinction of the independence of the upper house as a legislative body and think no means unjustifiable that would avert the necessity of such a creation he conceive the idea of authorize he private secretary sir herbert taylor to request the chief peer on the opposition side to absent themselves from the division on the third reading it seem to he and indeed to many of they the only thing that could be do they judgment of the character and eventual consequence of the ministerial bill be unaltered but they see the violence of the public feeling on the subject and the danger to the state of too stubborn and uncompromising a resistance to it and yield loyal obedience to they royal master 's wish they retire from the house without vote those who remain pass the bill and in the beginning of June 1832 it become law we have venture in a previous chapter to call in question the propriety of the conduct of the king 's father george iii in use he personal entreaty to influence the house of lord against the indium bill of mr fox the transaction which have be relate here be the second and only other instance since the revolution of a sovereign have recourse to such a device to sway the vote of member of either house but the circumstance be so entirely different nay so diametrically opposite that a opinion of the impropriety of the sovereign 's deed in the former case impose no obligation on the ground of consistency to censure it in the later instance the interference of george iii be design to thwart and defeat he minister on a measure of which he have not previously intimate any disapproval william iv on the other hand be exert himself to support he minister not as it seem probable without some sacrifice of he own judgment he father act as he do to avert a inroad on he prerogative and independence which he have be persuade to apprehend but the danger of which can hardly be say to have be prove beyond all question so that even those who think the result of he action fortunate for the nation can not defend the action as one that on any constitutional principle can be justify the son at a far more critical moment adopt the course which he do adopt as the only means which he see of extricate the state and the nation from a alternative of great calamity : the extinction of or at least a deep wound to the legislative independence of the house of lord by the following of a single precedent -lrb- 218 -rrb- which have ever since be universally condemn or on the other hand a continuance of outrage and tumult which have already disgrace the nation in the eye of the world and which if renew and continue could not fail to imperil the safety of the state such a motive may certainly be allow to excuse the irregularity of the act when however we come to consider the proposal to create peer which drive the king to take such a step that be a question on which while it be still more important it be also more difficult to form a satisfactory judgment it be denounce by the duke of wellington and other peer as utterly unconstitutional and revolutionary as a destruction of the great principle of the equality of the two house as a denial to the peer of they right to form and act upon they own deliberate judgment and as a reduction of they position to that of a body exist merely to register the decree of the other house indeed that it have this character be admit by lord gray himself with no abatement beyond such mitigation as might be find in the idea that it be only intend to affect they decision on a single question so far it may be say that even while defend it he condemn it _ habemus confitentem reum _ but the task of a ruler or legislator be often but a choice between difficulty or even between manifest evil and even if a act or course be admit to be intrinsically evil take by itself yet if the evil which it be calculate or design to avert be a greater evil still the defense be complete or at all event sufficient and this in fact be the principle of the justification which lord gray allege he be perhaps unconsciously refer to a passage in mr hallam 's great work on constitutional history -lrb- then very recently publish -rrb- in which while discuss sunderland 's peerage bill and admit that the unlimited prerogative of augment the peerage be liable to such abuse at least in theory as might overthrow we form of government he proceed to point out that in the exercise of this as of every other power the crown have be carefully restrain by statute and by the responsibility of its adviser but that while the common if they transgress they boundary be annihilate by a proclamation -lrb- that be by a dissolution -rrb- against the ambition or what be much more likely the perverse haughtiness of the aristocracy the constitution have not furnished such direct security the resource of subdue a aristocratical faction by the creation of new peer could never be constitutionally employ except in the case of a nearly equal balance but it might usefully hang over the head of the whole body and deter they from any gross excess of faction or oligarchical spirit the nature of we government require a general harmony between the two house of parliament -lrb- 219 -rrb- in the present case no one could impute the difference between the two house to any perverse haughtiness on the part of the peer but the difference exist and be too deeply found on the cautious principle of the tory party to be surmountable by ordinary means it be certain also that the common would not give way that without danger to the public peace they could not give way and this be in fact lord gray 's contention : that a crisis have arise in which compulsion must be exercise on one or other of the disagree party and that coercion of the peer by a augmentation of they number or a threat of it be the only compulsion practicable in uphold this position however it must be remark that he be betray into the use of language which be as great a violation of constitutional and parliamentary principle and usage as the action which he be recommend language too which be quite unnecessary to strengthen he argument he accuse the lord of oppose the declare and decide wish both of the crown and the people of act adversely to the crown and this introduction of the sovereign 's name to overawe the assembly be unconstitutional in the highest degree for constitutionally the sovereign have no right to signify he opinion nor indeed any recognize means of signify it but by give or withhold he royal assent to measure which the two house have pass on any bill which have not yet be pass by they he have as have be already imply no legitimate means whatever of express he judgment the time have not come for he to do so moreover the statement be probably not believe by any one to be strictly true for it be pretty generally understand that the king would have prefer a far more moderate measure but indeed in the very speech in which the prime-minister make this use of the king 's name he presently add a observation which be a sufficient condemnation of he previous language for in denounce the vile attack which have be make on he majesty in the public press and disclaim all share in they -lrb- a disclaimer which however true of himself could not it be believe have be utter with equal truth by all he colleague -rrb- he point out that it ought always to be recollect that it be contrary to the principle of the constitution to arraign the personal conduct of the sovereign it follow as a matter of course that it be equally contrary to those principle to allege he personal opinion in either house on any measure before it since if allege they must be open to criticism unless indeed the mere allegation of the royal sentiment be to be take as decisive of the question in which case all freedom of discussion would be at once extinguish but this irregularity into which the prime minister be apparently betray by he desire of victory must not be allow to affect we verdict on the main question and now that the lapse of time have enable we to contemplate dispassionately the case on which he have to decide it will probably be think that he justification of he conduct in recommend a creation of peer be fairly make out that under any pressure short of that the peer would have again reject the reform bill or at least would have pare it down to much smaller proportion than would have satisfy the popular demand for reform may be regard as certain and equally certain that such a line of conduct would have lead to a renewal of disgraceful and dangerous tumult the minister therefore as have be say before have to choose between two evil it be a grievous dilemma but those who have to deal with it -lrb- even while it may be admit that they can not be hold wholly free from blame as have themselves contribute by they own language to the popular excitement and irritation -rrb- -lrb- 220 -rrb- may be excuse for think the wound inflict on the constitution by thus overbear the voice of one house of parliament on a single occasion less formidable in its immediate fruit and more capable of be remedy and retrieve than that which would have follow from a renewal of insurrectionary tumult even if they should have come short of actual civil war one critic of these transaction -lrb- 221 -rrb- whose experience and high reputation entitle he opinion to respectful consideration after remind he reader that although parliament be say to be dissolve a dissolution extend in fact no farther than to the common and that the peer be not affect by it no change can take place in the constitution of they body except as to a small number of scotch representative peer proceed to argue that so far as the house of peer be concern a creation of peer by the crown on extraordinary occasion be the only equivalent which the constitution have provide for the change and renovation of the house of common by a dissolution in no other way can the opinion of the house of lord be bring into harmony with those of the people but it may be fear that this comparison be rather ingenious than solid indeed the writer himself limit such a expedient as a creation of peer to insure the passing of a particular measure to extraordinary occasion but a dissolution of the house of common be so far from be so limited that it be the natural and inevitable end of every house of common after a existence which can not exceed seven year and which be very rarely so protracted and though it may be and probably have be the case that a house of common have pass measure to which it have no great inclination lest it should provoke a minister to a premature dissolution yet no submission on its part can long postpone it and a threat or apprehension of a dissolution would certainly fail to overcome the opposition of the house of common or of a party within it if the measure before they seem open to serious objection the presumed or presumable immortality of the one body and the limited existence of the other seem to constitute so essential a difference between they as must prevent the measure adopt toward one be fairly regard as any guide to a justification of those employ in the case of the other the reform bill of 1832 have sometimes be call a new revolution and to some extent it deserve the name for it be not like the catholic emancipation act a mere restoration of privilege to any class or class of the people which have once be enjoy by they and have subsequently be withdraw but it be a grant of a wholly new privilege to place and to class which have never enjoy it while it be manifest that the political power thus confer on these class involve a corresponding diminution of the power of those who have hitherto monopolize it it be also the introduction of a new principle the old doctrine of the constitution have be that the possession of freehold property as the only permanent stake in the country be the only qualification which could entitle a subject to a voice in the government and legislation of the kingdom the new doctrine be that as other besides owner of land contribute to the revenue by the payment of tax those who do so contribute to a sufficient amount have a right to a voice however indirect or feeble in the grant of those tax and so far it be the extension and application to subject at home of the principle for which lord chatham and burke have contend sixty year before in the case of the american colony that taxation and a right to representation go together a principle which many age before have be lay down by the greatest of we early king as the foundation of we parliamentary constitution and rights but this principle however generally it may have be assert have hitherto be but very partially carry out in practice and the old borough system have be skilfully devise by successive king and minister to keep the political power in the hand of the crown and the aristocracy it be with that object that most of the borough which be first allow to return member under the tudor have be enfranchise -lrb- 222 -rrb- a great noble or landholder whose affection to the government could not be doubt be often able to obtain the promotion of some village or petty town in the neighborhood of he estate to the dignity of a parliamentary borough and thus acquire a great addition to he political and social importance by he power of influence the election no one could deny that the existence of such borough be a abuse or at least a anomaly render the more conspicuous as time go on by the denial of representative to town which contain as many thousand of citizen as they could boast single burgess at the same time it be equally undeniable that the aristocracy generally speak exert they influence advantageously for the state a peer or great squire who could return the member for a borough take a worthy pride in the ability and reputation of those whom he thus send to parliament especially the leader of the two party seek out promising young man for they seat and it have often be point out that of the man who in the house of common have rise to eminence in the country before the reform bill there be scarcely one who have not owe he introduction to parliament to the patron of one of those borough which be now wholly or partially disfranchise while on one or two occasion these rotten borough as since lord chatham 's time they be often derisively call have prove equally useful in provide seat for distinguished statesman who for some reason or other have lose the confidence of they former constituent so when bristol have disgrace itself by the rejection of burke malton have avert the loss with which parliament and the country be threaten by again through the influence of lord rockingham return the great statesman as they representative so to take a later instance westbury under the influence of sir manasseh lope have provide a refuge for sir robert peel when the course which he have take on catholic emancipation have cost he he seat for oxford and these practical use of these small borough -- anomaly in a representative system as they be call in the debate on the subject and as they must be confess to have be -- be so important that some even of those who feel compel by they principle to vote for they parliamentary extinction have nevertheless confess a regret for the sacrifice lament especially that it have in a great degree close the door of the house of common against a class whose admission to it be on every account most desirable the promising young man of both party in one point of great importance the framer of the reform bill of 1832 prove to be mistake they justify the very comprehensive or sweeping range which they have give it by they wish to make it a final settlement of the question and by the expression of they conviction that the completeness with which it have satisfy all reasonable expectation have effectually prevent any necessity for ever re-open the question they anticipation on this head be not share by they opponent who on the contrary foretold that the very greatness of the change now effect would only whet the appetite for a farther extension of they nor by a grow party now begin to own the title of radical which till very recently have only be regard as a reproach and who even before the bill pass -lrb- 223 -rrb- express they discontent that it do not go farther but accept it as a instalment of what be require and as a instrument for secure a more complete improvement and they expectation have be verify by subsequent event indeed it may easily be see that the principle on which one portion of the bill -- that which enfranchise new class of voter -- be frame be such as in shrewd hand might easily be adduce as argument in favor of the necessity of reconsideration of the question from time to time so long as the right of voting be confine to owner of property or member of corporate body the line thus lay down be one which be not liable to be cross but the moment that tenancy be add to ownership and a line be draw distinguishing elector from non-elector not by the nature of they qualification but by the amount of they rent detail be substitute for principle and the proposer or maintainer of the rule that the qualification should be a yearly rental of # 10 might be call on to explain why if # 10 be a more reasonable limit than # 15 # 8 be not fairer than # 10 or again if the original argument be that a line must of necessity be draw somewhere and that # 10 be the lowest qualification which seem to guarantee such a amount of educate intelligence in the voter as would enable he to exercise the franchise confer on he judiciously and honestly such reasoning would from time to time invite the contention that the spread of education have render # 8 tenant now as enlighten as # 10 tenant have be some year before and thus the measure of 1832 instead of forever silence the demand for reform by the completeness of its concession do in fact lay the foundation for future agitation which have be farther encouraged and feed by farther submission to it and which its leader who have so far triumph show no purpose to discontinue to discuss whether such extension of the franchise as have already be adopt and those farther step in the same direction which be generally understand to be impend will eventually be find compatible with the preservation of we ancient monarchical constitution be a fitting task for the statesman and senator whose duty it be to examine in all they bearing the probable effect of the measure which may be propose but the historian 's business be rather to compile the record of the past than to speculate on the future -lrb- 224 -rrb- and the course which be too perilous or difficult for mr hallam to undertake we will follow he example in avoid but it can not be deny that if the reform bill of 1832 transfer the chief political power of the state from the aristocracy to the middle class a farther lowering of the qualification for the exercise of the franchise must transfer it from the middle to the lower class and that those who view such transfer with alarm and deprecate it as fraught with peril to all we ancient institution maintain they opinion by argument as old indeed as the day of the roman republic -lrb- 225 -rrb- but which have not lose strength by lapse of time if indeed they have not be fortify by event in the history of more than one modern nation even before the introduction of the first reform bill one measure have be pass of constitutional importance though the concurrence of both party in its principle and detail prevent it from attract much notice two daughter who have be bear to the king and queen have die in they infancy and the royal pair be now childless and as some year have elapse since the birth of the last it be probable that they might remain so the presumptive heiress to the throne be therefore the daughter of the deceased duke of kent the princess victoria we present most gracious sovereign and as she be as yet only eleven year of age it be evidently necessary to provide for the contingency of the death of the king before she should attain she majority a regency bill for that purpose have therefore be prepare by the duke of wellington 's cabinet and have be introduce by lord chancellor lyndhurst in the house of lord before the resignation of the ministry it could not be so simple in its arrangement as such bill have sometimes be since there be more than one contingency possible for which it be requisite to provide it be possible not only that william iv might die within the next seven year but also that at he death he might leave a child or he widow in a state which warrant the expectation of one the latter case be the more difficult to decide upon since no previous regency bill furnish any precedent for the minister ' guidance the first point however to be settle be who be the most proper person to administer the affair of the kingdom as regent in the event of the heiress to the crown be still a minor at the king 's death it be a question on which it be evidently most desirable that no difference of opinion should be express and in fact no difference exist the leader of both party -- the duke and he colleague who have frame the bill and lord gray with he colleague who adopt it -- agree that the mother of the young sovereign would be the fittest person to exercise the royal authority during the minority and farther that she should neither be fetter by any limitation to that authority nor by any councillor appoint by parliament nominally to advise and assist but practically to control she it be feel that a regent act for a youthful daughter would need all the power which could be give she while as she could never herself succeed to the throne she could be under no temptation from view of personal ambition to misuse the power intrust to she at first sight it seem a more difficult and delicate question what course should be pursue with reference to the possible event of the king die while the queen he widow be expect to become a mother as have be say above no precedent be to be find in any former bill yet it seem to be determine by the old constitutional maxim that the king never die not even for a moment could the throne be treat as vacant and therefore it be propose and determine that in such a case the princess victorium must instantly be proclaimed queen and the duchess of kent must instantly assume the authority of regent but that on the birth of a posthumous child to the queen dowager the princess and the duchess as a matter of course should resume they previous rank and queen adelaide become regent and govern in the name of she new-born infant and sovereign the strict constitutional correctness of the principle elaborately and eloquently expound to the peer by lord lyndhurst be unanimously admit and the precedent now set be follow with the needful modification when ten year afterward it become necessary to provide for the possibility of queen victorium die during the minority of she heir the parent of the infant sovereign prince albert be appoint regent with the cordial approval of the nation the dissent of the queen 's uncle the duke of sussex who with a very misplace ambition urge instead the appointment of a council of regency of which he hope to become the most influential member only serve to make the unanimity of the rest of the parliament more conspicuous a somewhat kindred question inasmuch as it affect the personal arrangement if they may be so term of the sovereign be settle in the same session and on a new principle what be call the civil list have hitherto be place on a footing which be at once unintelligible and mislead the expression be first use at the revolution and be apply not only to that portion of the revenue which be devote to the personal expense of the sovereign but also to many branch of the civil expenditure of the state with which in fact he have no concern whatever not only the salary of the great officer of the household but those also of the minister ambassador and of the judge be pay out of it as well as those of many place-holder of various class and pension to a large amount amount embrace such a variety of miscellaneous and unconnected expense could hardly be expect to be keep with regularity and there be lavish waste in every department burke 's bill have rectify some of the abuse and have also point out the way to some other reform which be gradually adopt but still number of charge be leave untouched and there be scarcely any one subject which afford more topic to unscrupulous demagogue than the amount of the civil list which the ignorant multitude be constantly assure that the king enjoy to squander on he own pleasure though in fact the greater part of it be expend in the service of the state and be entirely free from he control only a portion of the sum which go under this name be vote annually by the parliament a portion be derive from the crown land from duty know as droit of the crown and droit of the admiralty etc the amount of which fluctuate and with which parliament be admit to have no right to interfere but the working of the whole be satisfactory to no one -- neither to the king himself nor to those who uphold the right of the parliament to have a predominant control of every branch of expenditure of the public money the feeling that the whole of the royal income and expenditure should be place on a different footing be general and the fall of the duke of wellington 's ministry have be immediately cause by the success of a proposal that before fix the new sovereign 's civil list parliament should refer the matter to a committee that inquiry might be make into every part of it lord gray 's ministry be bind to act in conformity with a resolution on which they have as it be ride into office and the arrangement which they ultimately effect be one in which common-sense and the royal convenience and comfort be alike consult that portion of the civil list of he predecessor which be vote by parliament amount to nearly # 850000 a year but besides that sum george iv enjoy the income already mention as derive from crown land droit etc while a farther large sum be furnish by the ancient revenue of the crown of scotland and another be receive from ireland the minister now propose that all these source of income should be hand over to the treasury and that the civil list should henceforward be fix at # 510000 be at the same time relieve from all the foreign and extraneous charge on it which have invidiously swell the gross amount without be in any way under the control of the sovereign or in any way minister to he requirement either for

constitution that grant of money make by the parliament should express distinctly and unmistakably the object to which they be really to be apply and that the charge of department connect with the government the administration of justice or the foreign service of the country should not be mix up with other of a wholly different character so as to make what be in fact the expenditure of the nation wear the appearance of be the expenditure of the sovereign moreover the assignment of many of the charge to the civil list even give a false character to the appointment themselves if a sovereign be to pay ambassador and judge out of what seem to be he private income the logical conclusion could hardly be avoid that he have a right to lower those salary or even to diminish the number of those appointment and it may even be say that the less any real danger of such a right be so exercise be to be apprehend the more unadvisable be it to retain a arrangement which in theory could be describe as liable to such a abuse note : -lrb- footnote 216 : but it may be remark that till very recently the people out-of-door have cease to show any great anxiety about reform two or three year before lord althorp who in lord gray 's ministry be chancellor of the exchequer and leader of the house of common tell peel that the people have become so indifferent to it that he never mean to bring forward the question again and in the last seven year only fourteen petition have be present to parliament in favor of it in reality such a feeling in the people would have be eminently favorable to a calm framing of a moderate measure but this indifference be soon change into a more violent and widely diffused excitement than there be any record of since the day of the popish plot that excitement

apart from the consideration of the abstract principle on which the advocate of parliamentary reform have insist of the light of many class hitherto unrepresented to representation they have also dwell on the practical advantage which might be expect to ensue from the greater degree in which public opinion would henceforth be bring to bear on the action of the house and by a natural consequence on the administrative government also and the bill have hardly pass when this result begin to show itself not only in transaction of domestic legislation but in other which affect we most remote dependency both in the east and west we have see in a previous chapter how wilberforce after twenty year of labor and anxiety reap the reward of he virtuous exertion in the abolition of the slave-trade but he have not venture to grapple with the institution which give birth to that trade the employment of slave in we west indium island yet it be a evil indefensible on every ground that could possibly be allege it be not only a crime and a injustice but it be a anomaly and a glaring inconsistency in any british settlement the law as we have see have be lay down as absolutely settle that no man within the precinct of the unite kingdom could be a slave that even have such be he previous condition the moment he foot touch english soil he become a free man by what process of reasoning then could it be contend that he right to liberty accord to english law depend on what portion of the british dominion he be in -- that what be incompatible with he claim as a human be in kent cease to be so in jamaica the sentiment that what be just or unjust in one place be just or unjust in every place that a man 's right to freedom do not depend on the country of he birth or the color of he skin have naturally and logically be widely diffused and foster by the abolition of the slave-trade it be but a small step from admit that there could be no justification for make a man a slave to assert that there be a equal violation of all justice in keep one in slavery and this conclusion be strengthen by tale which be continually reach those most interested in the subject of oppression and cruelty practice by the master or oftener by they agent and overseer on the unfortunate being over whom they claim power and right as absolute as any owner could pretend to over any description of property they make so general a impression that ten year before the time at which we have now arrive a society have be form in london whose object be the immediate extinction of slavery in every british settlement and canning then secretary of state have enter warmly into the general object of the society not indeed think the instant abolition practicable but induce parliament to pass a body of resolution in favor of at once improve the condition of the slave as the best and necessary preparation for they entire enfranchisement -lrb- 226 -rrb- and the next year 1824 the subject be recommend to the attention of the house in the king 's speech and a order in council be issue enjoin the adoption of a series of measure conceive in the spirit of those resolution among which one be evidently mean as a precursor of the slave ' entire emancipation since it give the negro who have acquire sufficient property a title to purchase he own freedom and that of he wife and family and it be probably from regard it in this light that the planter -lrb- as the owner of estate in the west indy be generally call -rrb- select that provision as the object of they most vehement remonstrance but though they be not so open in they remonstrance against the other clause of the order they do worse they disregard they and the story of the ill-treatment of the slave be neither less frequent nor less revolting than before fresh order in council avowedly design as the stepping-stone to eventual emancipation be issue and one which reach the west indy at the end of 1831 be unhappily so misconstrue by the slave in jamaica who regard it as recognize they right to instant liberation that when they master refuse to treat it as do so they break out into a formidable insurrection which be not quell without great loss of life and destruction of property the planter be panic-stricken many of they indeed be almost ruin the colonial legislature -lrb- 227 -rrb- which have be establish in the greater part of the island address the minister with strong protest against the last order in council and the mischief which have confessedly be already do and the farther mischief which be not unreasonably dreaded be so great that the cabinet consent to suspend it for a while and the house of common make a practical confession that the planter be entitle to sympathy as well as the slave by vote nearly a million of money to compensate those of jamaica for they recent loss but out-of-door the feeling rather be that the insurrection have be cause not by the unreasoning though natural impatience for freedom entertain by the negro -- whom canning have truly describe as possess the form and strength of a man but the intellect of a child -- but by the slackness and supineness of the local legislature too much under the influence of the timid clamor of the planter to listen to the voice of justice and humanity which demand to the full as emphatically if somewhat less vociferously the immediate deliverance of the slave the object however thus desire be not so free from difficulty as it seem to those zealous but irresponsible advocate of universal freedom for in the first place the slave be not the only person to be consider the planter also have a undoubted right to have they interest protect since however illegitimate property in human being might be it be certain that its existence in that portion of the king 's dominion have be recognize by parliament and court of justice for many generation and that suddenly to withdraw a sanction and abrogate a custom thus establish and as it might fairly be believe almost legalize by time would be not only ruinous to the planter who would have no other means of cultivate they land but as be ruinous to they would also manifestly be most unjust even in the interest of the slave themselves instant emancipation before they be fit for it might prove to they a very doubtful blessing the state too and the general interest of the kingdom have to be consider for the shipping employ in the west indium trade and the revenue derive by the imperial exchequer from it be both of great amount it be a very complicated question and require very cautious handling but it be plain that the people be greatly excite on the subject one or two of the minister themselves have deeply pledge themselves to they constituent to labor for the cessation of slavery and eventually though by no means blind to the difficulty of arrive at a thoroughly safe solution of the question the ministry decide that delay be more perilous than decision and they bring in a bill in which they endeavor to combine the three great object -- justice to the slave by confer on he that freedom to which he in common with all mankind have a inviolable right justice to the slave-owner by compensate he fairly for the loss of what -lrb- however originally vicious the practice may have be -rrb- he be entitle by long usage and more than one positive law to regard as property and a farther justice to the slave that justice which consist in be careful so to confer benefit as to do the greatest amount of good to the recipient the first object be attain by enact that those who have hitherto be slave should be free the third be arrive at by make the freedom thus give not instantaneous but by lead they to it and prepare they for its proper and useful enjoyment by a system of apprenticeship the slave be to be apprentice to he master for seven year receive partly in money and partly in kind a certain fair amount of wages and have also one-fourth of he time absolutely at he own disposal and the second be secure by grant the planter the magnificent sum of twenty million of money as compensation for the injury do to they or in other word as purchase-money for the property they be compel to surrender the apprenticeship system do not wholly succeed the slave be not sufficiently enlighten to appreciate the character of the new arrangement and as the light in which it appear to they be rather that of defer than of secure they emancipation it make they impatient rather than thankful in the majority of case it prove difficult to induce they to work even three-fourths of they time and eventually the planter themselves be drive to the conclusion that it be best to abridge the period of apprenticeship by the act of the colonial legislature themselves it be shorten by two year and the emancipation be complete on the 1st of August 1838 still though on this single point the success of the scheme do not fully correspond to the hope of those who have frame it it be one which do great honor to they ingenuity as well as to they philanthropy -lrb- lord stanley as colonial secretary be the minister to whose department it belong -rrb- and the nation itself be fairly entitle to no small credit for its cordial ungrudging approval of a measure of such unprecedented liberality indeed the credit deserve be frankly allow it by foreign country to quote the language of a eloquent historian of the period the generous acquiescence of the people under this prodigious increase of they burden have cause the moralist of other nation to declare that the british act of emancipation stand alone for moral grandeur in the history of the world -lrb- 228 -rrb- and in respect of the personal liberty of the subject it may be say to have complete the british constitution establish the glorious principle that freedom be not limit to one part of we sovereign 's dominion to these island alone but that in no part of the world in which the british flag be erect can any sort of slavery exist for a single moment the abolition of the political authority of the east indium company which take place some year after the time at which we have arrive and which will be mention in a subsequent chapter would make it unnecessary to mention the renewal of its charter which take place at this time be it not that the force of public opinion again make itself feel in some important limitation of its previous rights the monopoly of the trade with china which the company have hitherto enjoy be resent as a injustice by the great body of we merchant and ship-owner who contend that all british subject have a equal right to share in advantage which have be win by british arm the government and parliament adopt they view and the renew charter extinguish not only that monopoly but even the company 's exclusive trading privilege in indium itself though these like the rights of the west indium planter over they slave be purchase of it by a annuity for forty year which be estimate as a equivalent for the loss of profit which must result to the proprietor of the company 's stock from the sudden alteration it can not be say that any constitutional principle be involve in what be merely a commercial regulation or relaxation of such regulation yet it may not be think inopportune to mention the transaction thus briefly as one important step toward the establishment of free-trade which at the end of fifty year from the time when pitt first lay the foundation of it be gradually force itself on all we statesman as the only sound principle of commercial intercourse between nation the laborious historian of europe during these year find fault with the arrangement now make but only on the ground that they do not go far enough in that direction that while everything be do to promote the commercial and manufacturing interest of england nothing be do for those of hindostan -lrb- 229 -rrb- that while english cotton goods be admit for a nominal duty into indium there be no corresponding advantage thought of to the industry of indium in supply the market of the country the objection be not unfounded but the system of which it complain be too one-sided to be long maintained and in less than ten year a great financial reform have sweep away the great mass of import duty and so far have place the indian manufacturer on the same level with he fellow-subject of english blood the disturbance which agitate the first year of the reign of william iv be not cause solely by the excitement attendant on the passing of the reform bill there have be extensive agricultural distress in england which have show itself in a outbreak of new crime the burning of rick in the farm-yard and the destruction of machinery to which the peasantry be persuade by design demagogue to attribute the scarcity of employment but statesman of both party be agree in believe that a great deal of the poverty which especially in the agricultural county have become the normal condition of the laborer might be ascribe to the pernicious working of the poor-law which subsist with scarcely any alteration as it have be originally enact in the reign of elizabeth there be even reason to doubt whether the slight change which have be make have be improvement if they have be in the direction of increase liberality to the poor man who need parish relief and have to some extent lessen he discomfort they have at the same time tend greatly to demoralize both he and he employer by introduce a system of out-door relief which couple with the practice of regard such relief as a legitimate addition to wages lead the former to feel no shame at underpay he workman and the workman to feel no shame at depend on the parish for a portion of he means of subsistence it be not to be wonder at that under such a system the poor-rate gradually rise to the prodigious amount of seven million and a quarter of money or that the rate-payer begin to clamor against such a state of thing as impose on they a burden beyond they power to bear it be evident that it be a evil which imperatively demand a remedy and accordingly one of the first object to which lord gray 's cabinet turn its attention after the completion of the reform bill be the amendment of the poor-law the scheme which in the spring of 1834 they introduce to parliament be the first instance of the adoption in this country of that system of centralization which have long be a favorite with some of the continental statesman but which be not equally in harmony with the instinct of we people generally more attach to local government but if ever centralization could commend itself to the english mind it might well be when a new law and a new principle of action be to be introduce in the carry out of which uniformity of practice over the whole kingdom be especially desirable accordingly the government bill propose the establishment of a board of commissioner to whom the general administration of the poor-law over the whole kingdom be to be intrust they be to have power to make rule and regulation as to the mode or mode of relief to be give subject to the approval of the secretary of state that thus the establishment of one uniform system over the whole country might be secure power be to be give to unite several parish into one union and to erect large workhouse for the several parish thus mass together -lrb- 230 -rrb- and every union be to be under the management of board of guardian elect by the rate-payer of the different parish with the addition of the resident magistrate as ex officio guardian lord althorp who introduce the bill admit that such extensive power as he propose to confer on the board of commissioner be a anomaly in the constitution but plead the necessity of the case as they justification since it be indispensable to vest a discretionary power somewhere and the government be too fully occupy with the business of the nation while the local magistrate would be destitute of the source of information requisite to form a proper opinion on the subject the commissioner alone be exclusively devote to the subject and be alone in possession of all the information that could be collect be really the only body who could fairly be trust to form correct opinion on it -lrb- 231 -rrb- the fact of the creation of such a board be a anomaly or as it might rather have be call a novelty in the constitution do not seem a insuperable objection unless it be also inconsistent or at variance with the fundamental principle of the constitution and that can hardly be allege in this instance it be true that local management whether its range be wide or narrow whether cover the business of a county or limit to a single parish have be the general rule but like every other arrangement for the conduct of affair of any kind that local management be inherently subject to the supreme authority and interference of parliament nor as the maintenance of this parliamentary authority as the supreme referee in the last resource be provide for by the subordination of the commissioner for the approval of they regulation to the secretary of state do it seem that the arrangement now propose and adopt can be say to have be inconsistent with constitutional principle and the necessity for some change of that nature be clearly make out by the abuse which undeniably have be suffer to grow up under the old system if the habitual condition of the irish peasant be to be take into account it would be correct to say that there be less distress at this time in england than in ireland but there be still greater discontent and infinitely more of dangerous disturbance catholic emancipation have stimulate the agitator not pacify they they regard it as a triumph over the english government and be so as at once a reason for demand and a means of extort farther concession but this notion of theirs when inculcate on the peasantry bear terrible fruit in such a increase of crime as have probably never be know in any country in the world in the province of leinster munster and connaught murder deed of arson and rapine be of far more than daily occurrence -lrb- 232 -rrb- lord althorp assert in the house of common that more life have be sacrifice in ireland by murder in the preceding year than in one of wellington 's victory and what be if possible a still worse symptom of the disposition of the common people be exhibit in the impossibility of bring the criminal even when well know to justice juror hold back from the assizes witness who have see murder commit refuse to give evidence the roman catholic prelate and the higher class of the roman catholic clergy -- most of whom greatly to they credit exert themselves to check this fearful progress of wickedness -- find they denunciation unheeded while o'connell in he place in the house of common use language which to a ignorant and ferocious peasantry look almost like a justification of it affirm it to be cause wholly by the unjust and ruinous policy of the government in refuse to abolish tithe it be not the first time that the existence of tithe have be allege as a irish grievance in the three southern province by far the greater portion of the tenantry be roman catholic and they have long be complain that they be force to pay for the support of the protestant clergyman of they parish whose ministration they could not attend as well as for the maintenance of they own priest whose livelihood depend on they contribution accord to strict political economy there could be no doubt that the burden of the tithe fall not on the tenant but on the landlord in the calculation of whose rent the amount of tithe to which each holding be liable be always take into consideration and that be the true doctrine it be equally plain that in reality the protestant clergy be pay not by roman catholic but by protestant since it be not dispute that by far the greater part of the land-owner in every province be protestant -lrb- 233 -rrb- but a ignorant peasant be no student of political economy or of logic and the fact that the payment of the tithe pass through he hand be in he eye a incontrovertible proof that it come out of he pocket the discontent have gradually beget a organize resistance to the payment and the mischief of allow the continuance of such a state of feeling and conduct which be manifestly likely to impair the respect for all law make such a impression on the government that in the royal speech with which he open the session of 1832 the king recommend the whole subject to the consideration of parliament urge the house to inquire whether it might not be possible to effect improvement in the law respect this subject in compliance with this recommendation committee be appoint by both house and the result of they investigation be a recommendation that a new arrangement should be make under which the tithe should be commute to a rent-charge accordingly the next year the minister proceed to give effect to this recommendation but they reasonably judge that a alteration of a particular law in compliance with the clamor raise against it would be a concession pregnant with mischief to the principle of all government if it be not accompany or rather precede by a vindication of the majesty of all law and therefore the first measure affect ireland which they bring in in 1833 be a coercion bill which empower the lord-lieutenant not only to suppress the meeting of any assembly or association which he might consider dangerous to the public peace but also to declare by proclamation any district in which tumult and outrage be rife to be in a disturbed state and in district thus proclaim no person be to be permit to be absent from he house from a hour after sunset to sunrise house might be search for arm martial law be to be establish and courts-martial hold for the trial of all offence except felony and the _ habea corpus _ act be suspend for three month o'connell and he party protest with great vehemence against such a enactment as a violation of every right secure to the subject by the constitution and a bill which suspend the ordinary court of justice must be admit to have be incompatible with the constitution as commonly understand and enjoy but if the measure thus propose be extraordinary the state of affair which have lead to its proposal be so also in a far greater degree the record of no nation have ever present such a fearful catalogue of crime as be now lay before the parliament and at such a crisis the statesman to whom the tranquillity of the country and the safety of the citizen be intrust be undoubtedly call upon to go back from the letter of the constitution to that which be the primary object of every constitution -- the safety of those who live under it _ salus populi suprema lex _ and the argument of necessity be regard and rightly regard by both house of parliament as a sufficient and complete justification of even so exceptional a enactment and concurrently with this enactment which however indispensable for the repression of crime no one could deny to be severe the minister endeavor also to remove the cause of discontent by a large measure of church reform not confine they aim to settle the tithe question but deal with the whole question of the irish church in such a way as to lay down as a undoubted principle of the constitution the doctrine that the church exist for the benefit of the nation that its property be bestow on it for the same object and that consequently the nation or in other word the parliament have a perfect right to deal with its property and endowment of all kind always keep the same end in view the general advantage of the whole nation proceeding on these maxim they introduce a church reform bill in which perhaps the most remarkable circumstance of all be that the evil which have be the original cause of they take up the subject at all be the last thing settle not indeed be finally arrange for four year while the principal detail in the way of reform which be complete in this first session be one which however reasonable have hitherto receive but little attention and have certainly provoke no great outcry it could not be deny that the episcopal establishment in ireland be out of all proportion to the extent of the country and the number of the protestant population or of the parish the entire population in communion with the church fall short of 900000 the number of parish scarcely exceed 1400 but over this comparatively scanty flock be set no fewer than eighteen bishop and four archbishop while england with 12000 parish be contented with twenty-four bishop and two archbishop it be propose to consolidate these bishopric into ten the archbishopric into two a reduction which could hardly fail to commend itself to all but with this reduction be combine a variety of other detail relate to the episcopal revenue to the right of the bishop to grant lease and other matter of finance which the minister propose so to remodel as to create a very large fund to be at the disposal of the state on this point the greater part of the ministerial scheme be wreck for the time they succeed in carry that part of it which consolidate the bishopric and in induce the house of common to grant first as a loan which be originally turn into a gift a million of money to be divide among the incumbent of the different parish who be reduce to the greatest distress by the inability to procure payment of they tithe the arrears of which amount to a far larger sum but the assertion that any surplus fund arise from redistribution of the episcopal revenue ought to belong to the state not only call forth a vigorous resistance from the whole of the tory party at its first promulgation but when the subject be revive the next year and one of the supporter of the ministry mr ward propose a resolution that any such surplus might be legitimately apply to secular purpose it produce a schism in the ministry itself the resolution be cordially accept by lord john russell but be so offensive to four of he colleague mr stanley and sir jame graham be among the number that they at once resign they office the breach thus make be not easily heal and before the end of the session other dissension of a more vexatious and mortifying character lead to the retirement of the prime-minister himself all attempt to deal with the tithe question fail for the time four more year elapse before it be finally settle but curtail as it be the bill of 1833 still deserve to be remember as a landmark in constitutional legislation since it afford the first instance of parliament affirm a right to deal with ecclesiastical dignity and endowment thus set a precedent which in the next reign be follow with regard to the church of england lord melbourne succeed lord gray at the treasury but every one saw that the ministry be greatly weaken the king too have become greatly dissatisfy both with they general policy especially in regard to the irish church -- which he take a opportunity of assure the irish bishop he be unalterably resolve to uphold -- and also with the language and conduct of one or two individual minister to which it be not necessary to refer more particularly and when on the death of lord spencer father of lord althorp the chancellor of the exchequer which take place in November 1834 it become necessary for lord melbourne to propose to he a re-arrangement of some of the cabinet office he at once dismiss the whole body of the minister it be a somewhat singular step to take for they have not be defeat in parliament and he do not himself allege any special dissatisfaction with anything which they have yet do though he do apprehend that some of they would press upon he measure disadvantageous to the clergy of the church of england in ireland to which he have a insuperable objection and moreover that the subject would cause fresh division in the ministry and the resignation of one or two more of its most important member he have indeed six month before give a practical proof of he distrust of the ability of lord melbourne and the colleague who remain to he to carry on the government of the kingdom satisfactorily by desire the new prime-minister to enter into communication with the leader of the opposition to endeavor at this crisis to prevail upon they to afford they aid and co-operation toward the formation of a administration upon a enlarged basis combine the service of the most able and efficient member of each party -lrb- 234 -rrb- nor have he relinquish the idea of bring about such a coalition till he learn that both lord melbourne and sir robert peel consider the difference which divide they to be too deeply found on principle to render they union in one administration either beneficial to the state or creditable to themselves and it may be say that the letter in which lord melbourne have in November announce to he majesty the death of lord spencer and the necessity for new arrangement which that event have create by the expression that in these new and altered circumstance it be for he majesty to consider whether it be he pleasure to authorize viscount melbourne to attempt to make such fresh arrangement as might enable he present servant to continue to conduct the affair of the country or whether he majesty deem it advisable to adopt any other course and that lord melbourne earnestly entreat that no personal consideration for he might prevent he majesty from take any measure or seek any other advice which he might think more likely to conduce to he service and to the advantage of the country do not only contemplate but to a certain degree even suggest the possibility of he majesty 's prefer to have recourse to fresh adviser the king 's subsequent act and they result however certainly take the kingdom by surprise he apply to the duke of wellington to undertake the formation of a new ministry and the duke explain to the king that the difficulty of the task consist in the state of the house of common earnestly recommend he to choose a minister in the house of common and name sir robert peel as the fittest object for he majesty 's choice sir robert be in italy at the time but on receive the royal summons he at once hasten to england the duke of wellington in the mean time accept the office of first lord of the treasury and secretary of state as a provisional arrangement till he should arrive in london sir robert reach england early in December and though if he have be consult beforehand he would have be incline to dissuade the dismissal of the last ministry as premature and impolitic he do not consider it compatible with he sense of duty to decline the charge which the king lay upon he and at once accept the office of prime-minister be fully aware that by so do he become technically if not morally responsible for the dissolution of the precede government though he have not have the remotest concern in it -lrb- 235 -rrb- in the formation of he ministry he so far endeavor to carry out the view which the king have suggest to lord melbourne in the summer as to invite the co-operation of mr stanley -lrb- who by the death of he grandfather have recently become lord stanley -rrb- and sir j graham who as have be mention before have retire from lord gray 's cabinet a new name that of conservative have recently be invent for the more moderate section of the old tory party and it be one which though lord gray have taunt they with it as betray a sense of shame at adhering to they old color peel be incline to adopt for himself as characteristic of he feeling and future object and perhaps he think it might help to smooth the way for a junction with he of those who would flinch from proclaim so decide a change in they opinion as would be imply by they become colleague of one who still cherish the name of tory but they decline he offer and consequently he be force to select he cabinet entirely from the party of anti-reformer he dissolve parliament a step as to which it seem to he that the universal expectation of and even preparation for a dissolution leave he practically scarcely any option -lrb- 236 -rrb- but he soon find as indeed he have fear he should find the attempt to establish a conservative government premature the party of the late ministry follow the example set by mr fox in 1784 with better fortune divide against he in the house of common on every occasion defeat he in every division and at the beginning of April he retire and lord melbourne and he former colleague resume they office with very little change they have as be natural not be contented with oppose the conservative ministry in its general policy but in both house they have attack it with great energy they have begin the battle in both house in the debate on the address in which they select three point in the recent transaction for special condemnation affirm that in every one of they the royal prerogative have be unconstitutionally exercise -- the dismissal of the late ministry the dissolution of parliament and the appointment of the duke of wellington to a variety of office in the house of common the attack be lead by lord morpeth and lord john russell in the house of lord by lord melbourne himself it be urge that though the prerogative of the sovereign to dismiss he minister be undoubted and inalienable yet the house have a clear right to sit in judgment on any particular exercise of it and that the circumstance of the late ministry have be but recently form of its possess in a conspicuous degree the confidence of the great majority of the house of common and of its be occupy at the moment of its dismissal with matter of high national concern justify the house in call on the new minister to show valid reason for its sudden dismissal as to the dissolution it be ask what misdemeanor the late house of common have commit no difference have occur between it and the other house of parliament it have pass no hostile vote against any administration it have be in existence but a very short time all these circumstance they affirm make it reasonable for the house to express to he majesty they disapprobation of the dissolution lord morpeth argue moreover that the right of the house of common to inquire into such a exercise of the royal prerogative be prove by the example of mr pitt who in 1784 have introduce into the speech from the throne a paragraph invite parliament to approve of the recent dissolution and what parliament could be ask to approve of it manifestly have a equal right to censure but the most vehement of the censure of the opposition be direct against what lord morpeth call the most unseemly huddling of office in the single person of the duke of wellington a unconstitutional concentration of responsibility and power at which there be hardly a old whig of the rockingham school whose hair do not stand on end he admit that in the present instance the arrangement have only be provisional and temporary and that no harm have be do but he ask what harm might not have be do if the country have be suddenly oblige to go to war who would have be responsible for the foreign department if a insurrection of the negro have occur who be responsible for the colonial office if in ireland any tithe dispute have arise who be responsible as home-secretary and lord melbourne though a speaker generally remarkable for moderation on this subject go much farther and after urge that if one person hold the situation of first lord of the treasury and also that of secretary of state for the home department it would not only place in he hand without any control the appointment to every great office in the state but a person so situate would also have the pecuniary resource of the state at he disposal without check or investigation he proceed to assert that a intention to exercise those office would amount to a treasonable misdemeanor he do not indeed go so far as he late attorney-general sir j campbell who in vexation at he loss of office have even threaten the duke with impeachment but though he admit that the duke have be free from the guilty intention of exercise the authority of these office he suggest that the lord ought to pass some resolution calculate to prevent so great a breach of the constitution from be draw into a precedent on the first point thus raise for the dismissal of the late ministry without any such cause as be usually furnish by a adverse vote of one of the house of parliament peel frankly admit that he acceptance of office render he constitutionally responsible though as he also say it be notorious that in fact he have and could have have no previous knowledge of it but he deny that any constitutional question whatever be involve in it since the king 's right be deny by no one and he could therefore only consent to discuss it as a question of policy and expediency and look at it in this light he regard he defense as easy and complete he contend that the event of the past year the resignation of several of the subordinate minister and finally of lord gray himself and the proposal which have be make to he -lrb- peel -rrb- and several of he friend to coalesce with lord melbourne render the act by which the late government have be remove perfectly justifiable on the part both of the king and of himself that the king be justify in think a wholly fresh arrangement preferable to a re-arrangement of lord melbourne 's cabinet and he himself in obey he sovereign 's command to form a new administration the wisdom and propriety of the dissolution too could only be examine as a question of expediency but in this instance every consideration not only recommend but compel it when he undertake the arduous duty now impose upon he he do determine that he would leave no constitutional effort untried to enable he satisfactorily to discharge the trust impose in he he do fear that if he have meet the late parliament he should have be obstruct in he course and obstruct in a manner and at a season which might have preclude a appeal to the people it be the constant boast of the late government that the late parliament have unbounded confidence in they and if that parliament be as have be constantly assert rely upon as ready to condemn he without a hearing could any one be surprise at he appeal to the judgment of another a higher and a fairer tribunal the public sense of the people precedent too be in he favor on this point since whenever a extensive change of government have occur a dissolution of parliament have follow and he refer to the year 1784 and to 1806 when the administration of which lord gray be the lead member at once dissolve the exist parliament on come into office though he believe the present to be the first occasion on which a house of common have be invite to express its dissatisfaction at the exercise of the prerogative of dissolution to the stricture of lord melbourne and lord morpeth on the duke of wellington 's temporary assumption of a combination of office it be reply by sir robert and the duke that though there might be inconvenience from the assumption of all those power by one individual it be so far from be unconstitutional that it be a common practice for the secretary for one department to act for another during interval of recreation or period of ill-health that there be ample precedent for such a proceeding in the last week of the life of queen anne the duke of shrewsbury have unite three of the greatest post of the kingdom those of lord treasurer lord chamberlain and lord-lieutenant of ireland with the sanction of that great constitutional lawyer lord somer and in 1827 mr canning have retain the seal of the foreign office for some week after he appointment as first lord of the treasury moreover there be actually a law which provide that when the office of chancellor of the exchequer be vacant the seal of that office shall be deliver to the chief-justice and under this rule in the latter part of the reign of george ii chief-justice lord mansfield have continue finance-minister for above three month and as to the practical result of what have be do in the present instance the duke affirm what indeed be universally admit that the arrangement have from the first be understand to be merely temporary that no inconvenience have result from it indeed that not a single act have be do in any one of the office which have not be essentially necessary for the service of the country the first two point on which the ministry be assail it seem superfluous to examine since it be clear that the position take up by sir robert peel be impregnable : that on every view of the principle and practice of the constitution there be no doubt of the right of the sovereign to dismiss he minister or to dissolve the parliament at he pleasure and that those act can only be judge of by a consideration of they expediency inexpedient indeed the dismissal of the precede ministry be generally consider to have be even in the interest of the conservative themselves but inexpedient the dissolution can hardly be pronounce to have be since though the new election fail to give they a majority in the house of common it beyond all doubt greatly strengthen they minority on the other hand though it can not be deny that the house of common have a perfect right to express its disapproval of any or every act of the minister it be not so clear that lord morpeth 's invitation to it to express its dissatisfaction with this particular act of dissolution be on general principle expedient or safe since such a vote be make a perilous approach to claim for the house the right of be ask for its consent to its own dissolution a claim the admission of which have be one of the most fatal if not the most fatal of all the concession of charle i as to the duke of wellington 's assumption of a variety of office it be probable that when he first propose to the king to confer they on he he anticipate no objection whatever from any quarter since he have so little idea of there be any impropriety in hold two office be they ever so apparently incongruous if he majesty should have direct he to do so that seven year before when he become prime-minister he have at first design permanently to retain the command of the army in conjunction with the treasury and have only be induce to abandon the intention by the urgent remonstrance of sir robert peel and constitutionally there do not seem to be any limitation of the sovereign 's power to confer office to unite or to divide they indeed the different secretary-ship of state seem to owe they existence entirely to he will and not to any act of parliament he can diminish the number if he should think fit as he do in 1782 when on the termination of the american war he forbear to appoint a successor to lord george germaine in lord rockingham 's administration or he can increase the number as he do in 1794 when he revive the third secretaryship which he have suppress twelve year before without any act of parliament be pass to direct either the suspension or the revival he can even leave the most important office vacant and intrust the performance of they duty to a commission as be do in this very year 1835 when the great seal be put in commission and the duty for above two year be perform by commissioner who have other duty also to discharge and these instance may perhaps warrant the conclusion that the distribution of the different post in what be generally know as the cabinet be dictate by consideration of what be practicable and expedient rather than by any positive and invariable rule or principle yet it do not follow that because the constitution be not violate or endanger by such a arrangement the leader of the opposition do other than they duty in call attention to it unquestionably it be historically true that the liberty of the people owe they preservation growth and vigor to the jealous watchfulness to check the first and slightest appearance of any attempt to encroach upon they which have be constantly exercise from the very earliest time by a almost unbroken series of fearless and independent patriot and in this instance the very novelty of such a arrangement as have take place do of itself make criticism a duty though it may also be think that the critic act wisely in content themselves with call notice to it and abstain from ask parliament to pronounce a formal judgment on it since any express censure would have be unwarranted either by the fact of the case or by any inference to be draw from previous usage while a approval of it would wear the appearance not only of sanction but even of invite a repetition of a arrangement which if ever attempt to be carry out in actual practice must tend to grave inconvenience if not to discredit lord melbourne resume office and be strengthen by the manifest inability of the opposite party to command the confidence of the house of common begin to apply himself with vigor to the carry out of several measure of internal reform some of which involve not only the property but the long-established rights of very considerable body and as so do have a importance in a constitutional point of view besides that arise from they immediate effect peel have be equally alive to the desirableness so cogent as almost to amount to a moral necessity of introduce reform into more than one old institution such as should bring they more into harmony with the spirit of the age remodelling or terminate some arrangement which be manifest abuse and other which though if dispassionately examine and properly understand they perhaps be not really grievance yet in they operation cause such discontent and heart-burning that they be as mischievous as many other far more indefensible in theory and short-lived as he administration have be he have find time to frame and introduce a extensive measure of church reform not only deal with the question of tithe the levy and collection of which in some of they detail have long be make subject of bitter complaint by the farmer but include also provision for the creation of two new bishopric those of ripon and manchester no part of he measure be more imperatively call for by the present circumstance of the nation or of greater importance in its future operation there have be no increase in the number of bishop since the reign of elizabeth but since she time not only have the population of the entire kingdom be quadruple but some district which have then be very scantily people have become exceedingly populous these district have hitherto be almost destitute of episcopal supervision which now be thus to be supply to they but the new legislation do more it might be expect that the growth of the population would continue and would in time require a farther and corresponding increase of the episcopate and the erection of these new diocese be therefore not only the supply of a present want but the foundation of a system for increase the efficiency of the church which should be capable of gradual progressive expansion as the growth of the population in various district might be find to require additional facility for supervision and the judgment with which the new arrangement meet the requirement of the community may be regard as prove by the circumstance that now after the lapse of nearly half a century it be maintain in active operation and be admit by all party not only to be of the greatest practical benefit but also to have a moral effect scarcely less valuable in the degree in which it have stimulate the application of private munificence to the great work of church extension but before lord gray quit office he government have also call the attention of parliament to the necessity of a large municipal reform which indeed it seem to they that the reform bill have bind they in all consistency to introduce in the speech with which the king have close the session of 1833 he have inform the house that he have direct commission to be issue for investigate the state of the municipal corporation throughout the unite kingdom the result of whose inquiry would enable they to mature some measure which might seem best fit to place the internal government of corporate city and town upon a solid foundation in respect of they finances they judicature and they police he remind they that they have recently pass act for give constitution upon sound principle to the royal and parliamentary borough of scotland and warn they that they attention would hereafter be call to the expediency of extend similar advantage to the unincorporated town in england which have now acquire the right of return member to parliament the commission of which he majesty thus speak have now present its report strongly condemnatory of the exist system in almost every point of view of the constitution and mode of election of the exist corporation and of they government of the town over which they preside it declare that even where they exist in they least imperfect form and be most rightfully administer they be inadequate to the want of the present state of society but they charge they also with positive offence of no venial kind they have pervert they power to political end sacrifice local interest to party purpose they have divert from they legitimate use revenue which ought to have be apply for the public advantage waste they in many instance for the benefit of individual sometimes even employ for purpose of corruption fund originally intend for charitable use and they assert that this too common misconduct of these body have engender among a great majority of the inhabitant of the incorporated town a general and just dissatisfaction with they municipal institution a distrust of the self-elected municipal council and of the municipal magistracy taint with suspicion the local administration of justice and therefore they feel it they duty to represent to he majesty that the exist municipal corporation of england and wale neither possess nor deserve the confidence and respect of he majesty 's subject and that a thorough reform must be effect before they could become what they ought to be useful and efficient instrument of local government it would be superfluous here to repeat the story of the rise of the borough whose gradual acquisition of charter with privilege and power of various degree have be sufficiently investigate by hallam -lrb- 237 -rrb- what the parliament have now to deal with be the way in which the system work in the nineteenth century and here it must be confess that the report of the commissioner severe as it be do in no degree exaggerate the prevail evil the corporation have gradually become self-elected oligarchy of the worst kind it must be admit that in pervert they authority to political purpose they might plead the excuse that they be but follow the example set they by the minister of william iii who introduce into they bill for restore the corporation which jame ii have suppress clause manifestly intend to preserve the ascendency of the whig party by keep the church or tory faction out of -lrb- 238 -rrb- they but no such palliation -lrb- if indeed that have any right to be call a palliation -rrb- could be allege for they abuse of the trust commit to they abuse which if commit by single individual would have be brand and perhaps punish as malversation and fraud of the deepest dye a sufficient specimen of the kind and extent of they misdeed in one branch of they duty be afford by a single paragraph of lord john russell 's speech in which he affirm that in some of the report of they management of charitable estate commit to they care it be prove that the property instead of be employ for the general benefit of the town have be consume for the partial benefit of a few individual and not unfrequently in the feasting and entertainment in which the mayor and other corporator have be in the habit of indulge in some not very large borough these expense have amount to # 500 and # 600 a year and the enjoyment have be confine to freeman of only one party and the perpetuity of this mismanagement be in most instance secure by the member of the corporation themselves elect they new colleague on the occasion of any vacancy to put a end to this discreditable state of affair the government have prepare a very sweeping scheme of reform though that it be not too sweeping be prove by the approval with which not only its principle but most of its detail be receive by the greater part of the opposition the lead principle be to quote the word of the minister in introduce the bill that there should be one uniform government institute applicable to all one uniform franchise for the purpose of election and a like description of officer in each with the exception of some of the larger place in which there would be a recorder or some other such magistrate the first thing to be amend be the mode of election to the corporation which be now to be intrust to all such rate-payer in each borough as have pay poor-rate for three year and reside within seven mile of the place lord john russell have consider he say whether this franchise should be limit to those pay a certain amount of rate to the ten-pound householder for instance to whom the parliamentary franchise be confine but he decide on propose to extend it to _ all _ rate-payer because accord to the established principle to the know and recognize principle of the constitution it be right that those who contribute they money should have a voice in the election of the person by whom the money be expend the old mode of acquire the freedom of a corporation such as birth apprenticeship etc be to be abolish as also be all exclusive rights of trade vested rights however be preserve the next point to be decide be the composition of the corporation which these rate-payer be to elect and the ministerial proposal be that each corporation should consist of a mayor alderman and councillor possess a certain amount of property as a qualification and vary in number accord to the population of the borough the larger town be also divide into ward with a certain number of common-councilman and alderman to be choose in each ward the mayor be to be a yearly officer of the alderman and councillor a certain number be to retire each year be however capable of re-election the mayor be to be elect by the council and be to be a magistrate during he year of office and the body thus constitute be to have the entire government of the borough of its police its charity and generally and most especially of the raising and expenditure of its fund -lrb- 239 -rrb- which have be too often deal with in a manner not only wasteful but profligate case have be bring forward in which corporation have be incur debt year by year while the member be actually divide among themselves the proceeds of the loan they raise the revenue derive from charitable estate have be no less scandalously mismanage and the bill provide for the appointment of finance committee trustee auditor and a regular publication of all the account as the only efficient remedy and preventive of such abuse the whole police of the town and administration of justice be also to be completely under the control of the council and for the appointment of magistrate the council be to have the power of recommend to the crown those whom they think fit to receive the commission of the peace and in the large town it should have power also to provide a salary for stipendiary magistrate another clause provide that town which could not as yet be include in the bill since they have never be incorporate might obtain charter of incorporation by petition to the privy council such be the general provision of this great measure of reform a bill similar in principle have already be enact for scotland and another be shortly after pass with such variation of detail as the difference in the circumstance of the country require for ireland some of the clause especially those which preserve the vested rights of freeman and they family and which require a certain amount of property or rating qualification in the town councillor be not originally include in the bill but be insert as amendment in the house of lord and it may be remark that the result of the discussion in that house afford a proof of the sagacity of those peer who though conscientiously oppose to the reform bill prefer allow it to pass by they own retirement from the final division to drive the minister to carry he point by a creation of peer since the avoidance of such a addition to they number as have be threaten enable they now to force the adoption of these amendment on a reluctant minister and it seem difficult to deny that the first be require by justice and that the second be most desirable in the interest of the measure itself without it the town councillor from among whom the mayor be to be choose might have be select from the poorest the least educate and least independent class of the rate-payer in some borough or in some ward of many borough it may be regard as certain that they would have be so choose and such a admixture of unfit person would have tend to bring some degree of discredit on the whole council while to the successful inauguration of a new system the establishment of a general feeling of respect for it and confidence in it be of primary importance the danger too of so ill-judged a selection would have be greatest in the larger borough those be at the same time the very place in which the occasional difficulty of maintain order and tranquillity make it even more necessary than in smaller town that the council should enjoy the esteem and confidence of they fellow-citizen the principle that every man who contribute to the rate have a right to claim a voice in the election of those who be to expend they which the minister lay down as the justification of the clause confer the municipal franchise on all the rate-payer be strongly contest by sir robert peel though neither he nor those of he party in the upper house propose any alteration of the bill in this respect but he point out that though lord john affirm it to be the known and recognize principle of the constitution he have not act on it in the reform bill and it be certainly open to question whether the adoption of some limitation would not have be a improvement on the present measure the doctrine establish in this instance by lord john give a preponderance at every municipal election to mere number since the poorest class be everywhere the most numerous and its admission lead almost inevitably to a reduction of the parliamentary franchise at some future day though certainly at this time and for many year afterward lord john be far from contemplate any alteration of the reform bill but on the contrary take every opportunity of proclaim he adherence to it as a final solution of the question but though in this particular it be possible that the bill might have be improve it must be allow to have be a measure very creditable to its framer few reform have be conceive in a more judicious and more moderate spirit few have be so carefully limit to the removal of real and prove abuse and the prevention of they recurrence while avoid any concession to the insidious demand of revolutionist or the ill-regulated fancy of metaphysical theorist it be a reform strictly in accordance with some of the most important principle of the constitution as they have be gradually develop by the practical experience of successive generation it combine with felicitous skill representative with local government it secure uniformity in work and that peculiarly english principle of publicity without which the best-devised system can not long be preserve from degeneracy the church reform in england and ireland which be carry out about the same time can not be say to have involve any constitutional principle though one of they greatly extend the principle of religious toleration and indulgence to the dissenter of various sect no alteration have be make in the marriage act of 1754 which declare it indispensable to the validity of a marriage that it should be perform in a church and by a clergyman of the established church and it be not strange that this should be feel as a grievance by those who be not in communion with that church but some of the dissent sect have a additional cause of discontent in the word of the marriage service which give a religious character to the ceremony while they regard it as a civil contract in he short administration sir robert peel have recognize the validity of the argument against the unmodified maintenance of the exist law and have frame a measure calculate in he view to give the dissenter the relief they title to which could not be deny but he bill have be extinguish by he retirement and lord john russell now avail himself of the machinery of another measure which he introduce at the same time to make the relief somewhat wider and more effective hitherto there be no record of birth and marriage beyond that which be preserve in the register of different parish which in former year have in many instance be carelessly and inaccurately keep but at the beginning of 1836 the minister justly urge that it be important in a national point of view both with regard to the security of title to property and to that knowledge of the state of population the value of which be recognize by the establishment of the practice of take a decennial census that there should be a general register of all such occurrence introduce a bill to establish a registry and registrar in every poor-law union with a farther registry for each county and a chief or still more general one in london for the whole kingdom subject to the authority of the poor-law commissioner and by a second bill they farther propose that the registry to be thus establish should be office at which those who desire to do so might contract purely civil marriage previous clause in it provide that member of any sect of protestant dissenter might be marry in they own chapel and by minister of they own persuasion after enactment remove all the civil disability under which nonconformist have labor for one hundred and fifty year have be place on the statute-book it be clearly inconsistent in the highest degree to retain still more offensive and unreasonable religious disability and to deny to they the right of be marry by they own minister accord to the rite most agreeable to they conscience or prejudice and though some of the detail of the ministerial measure be object to and slightly alter in its passage through parliament the general principle be admit by the warmest friend and most recognize champion of the established church who wisely feel that a bulwark which be too ill-placed or too unsubstantial to be defend be often a treacherous source of weakness rather than strength and that a temperate recognition of the validity of claim found on justice be the best protection against other which have no such foundation and that measure such as these adopt in a spirit of generous conciliation could only strengthen the church by take at least one weapon from the hand of its enemy another of the measure relate to the church of which peel have prepare a sketch have for its object the removal of a grievance of which the member of the church itself have long be complain the mode of the collection of tithe it would be superfluous here to endeavor to trace the origin of tithe or the purpose beyond the sustentation of the clergyman to which they be originally apply -lrb- 240 -rrb- they have undoubtedly be establish in england some time before the conquest and the principle that the land should support the national church be admit by a large majority of the population it may probably be say with something nearly approach unanimity on the part of those who really pay it namely the land-owner the objection to the tithe system be found rather on the way in which it work operate as lord john russell describe it as a discouragement to industry a penalty on agricultural skill a heavy mulct on those who expend the most capital and display the greatest skill in the cultivation of the land the present mode of levy the tithe force the clergy to forbearance at the expense of what they deem to be they rights or lead they to enforce they at the expense of the influence which they ought to possess with they parishioner compelling they to lose either they income by they indulgence or they proper weight and popularity in the parish by the exaction of what the law give they for the support of themselves and they family and this dilemma be feel so keenly by the clergy themselves that it have become a very general feeling with they that if any sort of commutation could be devise they would be delighted to be deliver from this objectionable mode of payment indeed sir robert peel whose measure of the preceding year have be chiefly direct to the encouragement of voluntary commutation have state to the house that there be already two thousand parish in the kingdom in which a commutation between the clergyman and he parishioner have be agree upon and establish as a durable settlement by separate act of parliament indeed arrangement of this kind exist very generally the parish in which the tithe be take in kind be comparatively few and the plan usually adopt be for the occupier of land to pay the incumbent a fixed annual sum bear a certain proportion to he rent but arrangement which be optional be of course liable to be rescind and peel desire to establish a system which should be universal and permanent and with this view he have design the appointment of a temporary commission one member of which should be nominate by the primate as the representative of the church under whose supervision the tithe of every parish in the kingdom should be commute into a rent-charge regulate partly by the composition which have hitherto be pay and partly by the average price of grain -- wheat barley and oats it be no new idea since as far back as 1791 pitt have propose a general commutation of tithe for a corn rent and have submit a plan with that object to the primate though circumstance of which we have no accurate knowledge prevent he from proceed with it -lrb- 241 -rrb- objection -lrb- 242 -rrb- be take to this last part of the arrangement chiefly because it would render perpetual the term of exist composition the extreme augmentation of they which be provide for in the bill be only ten per cent while it be notorious that the majority of incumbent have show such liberality in these matter that the composition rarely amount to two-third of the sum to which they be legally entitle and it be hardly deny that the measure do involve some sacrifice of the extreme legal rights of the clergy but it be urge and generally feel by the most judicious friend of the church that the peace and harmony which might be expect to be the fruit of the measure be worth some sacrifice and the bill be pass with very general approval a bill on similar principle with such variation as be require by the difference between the two country be also pass for ireland the last measure on ecclesiastical subject be also chiefly of a financial character though its detail be calculate some directly other indirectly to produce benefit of a still more important nature the condition of the property of the bishop and the ecclesiastical chapter have long be a subject of censorious remark the various diocese differ greatly in extent as do therefore the labor of the diocesan some see contain above 1000 one -lrb- london -rrb- even above 1200 parish other contain under 150 the revenue of some be very large in one or two instance approach # 20000 a year while those of other scarcely exceed # 1000 or # 1500 a year thus afford income palpably inadequate to the support of the episcopal dignity so inadequate indeed that they be generally supplement by the addition of some better endowed deanery or canonry it be universally feel that such a deficiency and such a mode of supply it be in themselves a scandal which be greatly augment by the system of translation to which it have give birth the poorer bishopric would hardly have be accept at all have they not be regard as stepping-stone to other of greater value and the hope of such promotion have in some case the not unnatural however deplorable effect of make the bishop anxious to please the minister of the day to whom alone he could look for translation by parliamentary subservience and the still more mischievous result -lrb- if possible -rrb- of render the whole bench liable to the same degrading suspicion while the canonry and prebend in the different chapter whose revenue also vary greatly be in every diocese so numerous that they have become nearly sinecure the duty rarely exceed residence for a month or at the outside six week in a year these abuse -lrb- for such they could not be deny to be -rrb- have attract the attention of sir robert peel who have appoint a commission of which many of the highest dignitary of the church be member and who after very careful investigation and deliberation present a series of report on which the ministry frame its measure they propose as have already be mention in connection with the labor of sir robert peel a amalgamation of four of the smaller bishopric at they next vacancy in order hereafter to provide for the addition of two new one at manchester or lancaster and ripon without augment the number of bishop lord melbourne apparently fear to provoke the hostility of some of the extreme reformer who have recently propose to deprive the bishop of they seat in the house of lord if he should attempt to increase the number of the spiritual peer though as they number have be stationary ever since the reformation while that of the lay peer have be quadruple such a objection hardly seem entitle to so much consideration another clause be direct toward the establishment of greater equality between the revenue of the different bishopric a step which besides its inherent reasonableness and equity would extinguish the desire of promotion by translation except in a few specify instance various reason sufficiently obvious and notorious render the two archbishopric and the bishopric of london durham and winchester more costly to the occupant than the other diocese and these be therefore leave in possession of larger revenue than the rest proportionate to they wider duty or heavier charge but all the other be to be nearly equal none exceed # 5500 and none fall below # 4500 while the five richer see be also the only one to which a prelate could be translate from another diocese it follow almost as a matter of course that the practice of allow a bishop to hold any other preferment be to cease with the cessation of the cause that have lead to such a abuse another part of the bill provide for the suppression of such canonry or prebend as might fairly be consider superfluous four be consider sufficient for the proper performance of the duty of each cathedral and the extinction -lrb- after the life of the present holder -rrb- of the rest be design to form a large fund to be at the disposal of the ecclesiastical commissioner -lrb- 243 -rrb- and to be apply by they chiefly to meet the want of the more populous parish in different large town for which it have hitherto be difficult to make any provision -lrb- 244 -rrb- by contribute to the erection of additional church by increase the income of the incumbent in case where it be insufficient or in any other way which the practical experience of the member of the commission might suggest one very important reform of a different kind be also provide for in the abolition of plurality the bill prohibit the holding of two living by the same person except they be within ten mile of each other the measure be object to by sir robert ingli who have represent oxford as the peculiar champion of protestant and church principle ever since 1829 and by a party which share he view as one calculate to be fatal to the best interest of the church they look on the property of the church and everything connect with it as invest with so peculiar a character that they not only contest the right of parliament to take any step to diminish its revenue or to change the employment of they but they even dispute its right to deprive one class of the clergy of any portion of they revenue for the purpose of distribute it among another but the distinction thus make between church property and that of any other public body seem one which can hardly be support the purpose for which ecclesiastical chapter or official have be endow with possession and revenue be undoubtedly of a more sacred character than the duty impose on lay corporation but that consideration can not be regard as affect the tenure of those possession or as inconsistent with the doctrine that they be national property bestow by the nation on the church for the service and advantage of the people deeply interested not only in the maintenance of a established church but in that church be in the highest possible degree efficient for its holy object be so bestow and appropriate that property must on every principle of the constitution be subject to the control of the national parliament and surely that control could never be more legitimately exert than in carry out the recommendation of a commission which number among its member several of the prelate of the church whose profession and position be a guarantee for they anxiety to preserve all the rights of the church which contribute to its credit or efficiency while they mature experience enable they better than any other man to judge how to reconcile the maintenance of its dignity with the extension of its usefulness note : -lrb- footnote 226 : the second resolution affirm

calculate to strengthen the crown by enlist the chivalrous feeling of all that be best in the nation in the support of a youthful queen and in a lesser degree it for a time strengthen the ministry also but with respect to the latter the feeling do not last long for the next three year the summer be very unfavorable to the farmer the harvest be bad the inevitable accompaniment of a rise in price have cause severe and general distress and distress have produce clamorous discontent and in some district formidable riot it have be greatly aggravate in the manufacturing county by the operation of the trades-union which have gradually put forth pretension to regulate the wages and other condition of work and have enforce they with such tyrannical violence not flinch from the foulest crime that in many instance they have drive the master to close they factory rather than submit to they mandate and in other have compel the workman themselves to discontinue they labor thus spread destitution among thousand whose earnings if they have be allow to consult they own wish would have be amply sufficient for the support of they family -lrb- 245 -rrb- and the evil have grow to such a height that in 1838 a committee be appoint by the house of common to investigate the whole subject of trade combination but the turbulent spirit excite by this distress do not now confine itself to single outbreak of violence but under the guidance of some demagogue of a more methodical turn of mind than usual develop itself in a systematic organization have for its object what they call the people 's charter which aim at a total revolution of the exist parliamentary system with the avowed design that when adopt it should eventually lead to a entire reconstruction of the government the chartist as they call themselves have advocate even in parliament who present they petition to the house of common and try though unsuccessfully to give they importance by the appointment of a committee to investigate the character of the reform which they demand they be not however contented with peaceful mode of press they demand but in the course of the summer of 1839 break out in formidable riot in different part of the country at birmingham they set fire to different part of the town carry on they work of pillage and destruction to such a pitch that the duke of wellington compare the condition of the town to one take by storm in regular warfare and at newport in monmouthshire they even plan and carry out a attack on the troops quarter in the district but this violence lead for a time to the suppression of the movement the leader in the newport riot be convict of high-treason and though the government forbore to put the extreme severity of the law in force against they those who remain unconvicted have be teach by they example the danger which they incur by such proceedings and some year elapse before a series of revolutionary trouble on the continent again give a momentary encouragement to those in this country who sympathize with the revolutionist and prompt they to another attempt to force they view upon the government and the people it have nearly however be another ministry on whom the task of quell these riot have fall though as have be already say lord melbourne 's cabinet derive a momentary strength from the accession of a young queen the support it thus acquire do not last and in may 1839 have be defeat on a measure of colonial policy which will be mention hereafter the cabinet resign the queen intrust the task of form a new administration to sir robert peel who undertake it with a reasonable confidence that he should be able to hold he ground better than formerly now that the retirement of he predecessor be they own act and admit by they to have be cause by a consciousness of the division among they supporter and they own consequent weakness he have the greater reason for such confidence since two of the colleague of lord gray who have refuse he offer in 1834 lord stanley and sir jame graham be now willing to unite with he and he have almost complete he arrangement when he be stop by a unexpected though not altogether unprecedented impediment it will be recollect that in 1812 some of the arrangement for the formation of a new administration on the death of mr perceval be impede by a doubt which be feel in some quarter whether the new minister would be allow to remove one or two officer of the household to whom the regent be generally understand to be greatly attach but who be hostile to the party which hope to come into power though it be afterward know that these officer have feel themselves bind to retire as soon as the arrangement in contemplation should be complete -lrb- 246 -rrb- sir robert peel be now meet by a difficulty of the same kind but one which the retire minister have the address to convert into a real obstacle the queen who have warm affection but who could not possibly have yet acquire any great knowledge of business have become attach to the lady whom lord melbourne have appoint to the chief place in she household it have never occur to she to regard they office in a political light and consequently when she find that sir robert consider it indispensable that some change should be make in those appointment she at once refuse she consent term he proposal one contrary to usage and repugnant to she feeling sir robert however feel bind to adhere to he request for the removal of some of the lady in question for in fact they be the wife and sister of he predecessor and a continuance of they daily intercourse with the queen might reasonably be expect to have some influence over she majesty 's judgment of the measure which he might feel it he duty to propose such a difficulty could not have arise under a male sovereign but lord melbourne himself have depart from the ordinary practice when he surround he royal mistress with lady so closely identify with he cabinet it be very possible that he have originally make the appointment without any such design from the careless indifference which be he most marked characteristic but he can not be so easily acquit when in reply to the queen 's application to he for advice on the subject he be join in he assertion by lord john russell assure she that sir robert peel 's demand be unjustifiable and unprecedented support by the positive dictum of the minister on whose judgment she have hitherto be bind to rely the queen naturally adhere to she decision of refuse to permit the removal of the lady in question and the result be that sir robert peel decline to take office under circumstance of difficulty beyond those to which every new minister must of necessity be expose and lord melbourne and he colleague resume they post the transaction be of course canvass in both house of parliament sir robert peel and the duke of wellington who be the spokesman of the party in the house of lord defend they refusal to undertake the government on any other condition than that for which they have stipulate on the ground that the authority to make such change in the household as they have propose be indispensable as a proof of they possession of she majesty 's confidence while lord melbourne with a strange exaggeration defend the advice which he have give she majesty by the assertion that to have comply with sir robert peel 's proposal would have be inconsistent with she personal honor other argument on the same side be base on the alleged cruelty of separate she majesty from the society of she earliest friend she old and constant companion a argument which be dispose of by lord brougham 's remark that till she have become queen -lrb- not yet two year before -rrb- she have have no acquaintance with they whatever -lrb- 247 -rrb- but it be needless to dwell at any length on the case in which all subsequent historian and political critic however generally prepossess in favor of the liberal minister have give up they position as untenable she majesty herself keep strictly on the path of the constitution in guide herself by the counsel of those who till they successor be appoint be still she responsible adviser but the course which they recommend be absolutely irreconcilable with one fundamental principle of the constitution -- the universal responsibility of the minister in deny the right of the incoming minister to remodel the household -lrb- or any other body of office -rrb- in whatever degree they might consider requisite they be clearly limit the ministerial authority to limit the ministerial authority be to limit the ministerial responsibility to limit the ministerial responsibility be to impose some portion of responsibility -lrb- that portion from which it relieve the minister -rrb- on the sovereign himself a dangerous consequence from which the constitution most carefully protect he in fact that the advice lord melbourne give be indefensible be tacitly confess by himself when on the recurrence of the same emergency two year later he be compel to recommend a different course -lrb- 248 -rrb- and the lady whom sir robert have consider it necessary to remove anticipate they dismissal by voluntary resignation it may be add that at the close of this same year lord melbourne himself insist on nominate the private secretary to the prince whom the queen be about to marry though no one could pretend that office in he household be as important as those in that of the sovereign and though if there be any post in which the prince might have be suppose to have a right to a unfettered choice that might have be suppose to have be the office of he private secretary -lrb- 249 -rrb- she majesty 's marriage with prince albert of saxe-coburg she first cousin -- one tend as greatly to the happiness of herself and the advantage of the nation as any royal marriage record in history -- take place in the beginning of 1840 and in the preparatory arrangement -- matter of far greater consequence to the queen 's feeling than any appointment in the household -- the ministry by singular mismanagement contrived to force the consideration of other constitutional question on parliament in such a way that the conclusion which be adopt however inevitable could hardly fail to be mortifying and vexatious to she majesty in whose cup of happiness at such a moment special care ought rather to have be take to prevent the admixture of any such alloy in the matter of the annuity to be settle on the young prince the opposition must indeed share the blame with the minister if it be unpardonable carelessness in the latter to omit the usual practice of previously consult the leader of the opposition on the amount of the grant to be propose it be not the less impolitic and unworthy of such man as the duke and sir robert peel to show they disapproval of the inattention by a curtailment of the grant the sum propose # 50000 a year be fairly justify by the fact of its be the same which twenty-four year before have be settle on the prince 's uncle leopold on he marriage with the princess charlotte indeed if there be to be any difference the circumstance might have be regard as warrant a increase rather than a diminution of it money be certainly more plentiful in 1840 than in 1816 and the husband of a actual queen occupy beyond all question a higher position than the husband of the heiress-presumptive who might never become queen and who in fact never do we can not think therefore that the reduction of # 20000 which sir robert peel propose and carry be reasonable or become but regard it as neither call for by the circumstance of the kingdom nor as befitting its liberality nor as in harmony with its practice but on the two other question -- one immediately affect the constitution and the other not absolutely unconnected with it -- no defense of the minister seem available at the opening of parliament in 1840 she majesty commence she speech by the announcement of she intended marriage describe the bridegroom simply as the prince of saxe-coburg and gotha the same expression which she have use in address the privy council a few week before that description of he have at once strike she uncle leopold -- who since the death of he english wife the princess charlotte have become king of belgium -- as so imperfect and insufficient that on read she address to the privy council he at once write to she to point out that it would have be desirable to mention the fact of the prince be a protestant -lrb- 250 -rrb- and that the omission would inevitably cause discontent but in spite of this warn lord melbourne refuse to advise the queen to insert a statement of the prince 's religion in she speech though it be by no means superfluous on such a occasion since if he be a roman catholic a marriage with he would have incur a forfeiture of the crown the duke of wellington on the other hand regard it as a positive duty to require that the fact of the prince be a protestant should be mention so as to show the care of parliament to prevent any constitutional precaution from be overlook such statement have indeed be usually make on similar occasion when he therefore move a amendment to insert the word protestant in the description of the prince lord melbourne do not venture to divide the house against it but still he management give a ungracious appearance to the transaction as if there have be in any quarter a unwillingness to recognize the fact of the prince 's protestantism till the recognition be force on the government by the action of the parliament the third question as affect the relative rank and position of the different member of the royal family can not be say to have be wholly unconnected with the provision of the constitution and the mismanagement of the minister be perhaps even more sure to attract notice in this case than in the other since to introduce into a bill a clause which have no connection whatever with its title have something of the appearance of a deliberate slight to the two house a bill to naturalize the prince be of course indispensable but into it the minister without any notice have introduce a clause enable he during he life to take precedence in rank after she majesty in parliament and elsewhere as she majesty might think fit and proper any law statute or custom to the contrary notwithstanding it be admit that no such precedence have be give to prince george of denmark nor to prince leopold and there be obvious difficulty in the way of confer such a life-long precedence because as lord brougham have point out it be possible that the queen might die without issue in which case the king of hanover would become king of england also and he son the prince of wale and it would have be a inconceivable anomaly that a foreign naturalized prince should take precedence of the prince of wale whose special rank and importance be recognize in many act of parliament this objection be so clearly insuperable that lord melbourne consent to alter the clause so as to give the prince precedence only after the heir-apparent but even this concession fail to satisfy the objector the king of hanover among other positively refuse to waive he precedence over any foreign prince and eventually the minister withdraw the clause altogether and the bill as it be pass be confine to the naturalization of the prince lord melbourne have thus contrived to make the queen and prince appear as if they be desirous to induce the two house by a sort of trick to confer on the prince a precedence and dignity to which he be not entitle and to render the refusal of parliament to be so cajole a fresh cause of mortification to the royal pair the course that be eventually adopt be understand to have be suggest by the duke of wellington -- to withdraw the affair altogether from the cognizance of parliament and to leave it to the queen to confer on the prince whatever precedence she might choose as it be certainly within she right to do and so a few day after the bill have pass she do by letters-patent give he precedence next to herself on all occasion and in all meeting except when otherwise provide by act of parliament as seventeen year later she in the same way with the cordial approval of the whole nation confer on he the title of prince consort and apart from its convenience as avoid all unseemly discussion this would seem to have be the most natural and proper mode of settle such a matter the queen be the fountain of honor in this kingdom and at she own court she can certainly confer on any of she own subject whatever precedence she may think fit while it may be doubt whether any act of a british parliament could give precedence at a foreign court it be probably not in he character of duke of cumberland but as a independent sovereign that the king of hanover maintain he claim to superior precedence and it be plain that the most illustrious subject could not possibly at any court be allow to rank above a king with reference to its possible effect on the subsequent relation of peel and he follower with the court it be perhaps well that a few month later they have the opportunity of prove that no personal objection to the prince himself have influence they course in these transaction by give a cordial assent to the ministerial proposal of confer the regency on he in the event of the queen give a heir to the throne and die while he be still a minor the principle be the same as that which have guide the arrangement for a regency ten year before but it be not inconceivable that parliament might have hesitate to intrust so large a authority to so very young a man and he a comparative stranger such as the prince still be have the leader of the opposition give the slightest countenance to such a objection lord melbourne 's ministry be hardly strengthen by the circumstance under which it resume office yet the close of the same year witness a reform of which it be hardly too much to say that no single measure of this century have contribute more to the comfort of the whole mass of the people with which it have also combine solid commercial benefit hitherto the post-office have be manage in a singular manner and the profit derive from it have be treat as something distinct from the ordinary revenue of the kingdom in the reign of charle ii it have be give to the duke of york and the grant be regard as confer on he such extensive rights that when some year afterward a enterprising citizen set up a penny post for the delivery of letter in the city and its precinct the duke complain of the scheme as a infraction of he monopoly and the court of law decide in he favor that grant cease as a matter of course on the duke 's accession to the throne and in the reign of queen anne a portion of the post-office proceeds be appropriate with the general consent of a grateful country to reward the great achievement of the duke of malborough a perpetual charge on it of # 5000 a year be annex to the dukedom in those day the postage of a letter be twopence for short distance and threepence for any distance beyond eighty mile -lrb- 251 -rrb- but those charge have be gradually increase about the middle of the century the lowest charge be fix at fourpence rise in proportion to the distance till the conveyance of a single letter from one extremity of the kingdom to the other cost eighteen-penny such a rate could not fail to be very profitable and by the beginning of the present reign the yearly profit exceed a million and a half of money the heaviness of the charge however have latterly attract attention and have be the cause of many complaint as be a great discouragement and in the case of the poorer class a complete obstacle to communication however neither the minister nor the parliament have succeed in devise any remedy since a system afford so large a return be not a thing lightly to tamper with when those who complain suddenly find a practical leader in mr rowland hill who publish a pamphlet on the subject in which he affirm the cost of the conveyance of each letter even for such a distance as from london to edinburgh to be infinitely less than a farthing and that consequently all the rest of the postage be a tax for the purpose of revenue when this fact be once establish it need no argument to prove that to increase the tax pay by each recipient of a letter in proportion to the distance at which he live from the writer be a indefensible unfairness and after much investigation and discussion mr hill succeed in convert the minister to he view accordingly the budget for 1839 introduce by mr spring rice then chancellor of the exchequer contain a clause which reduce the postage for every letter weigh less than a ounce to a uniform charge of a penny to be prepay by means of a stamp to be affix to each letter by the sender it be not without plainly-expressed reluctance that the scheme be consent to by the opposition nor can they hesitation be consider as unreasonable in the very unsatisfactory condition of the finances of the kingdom at the time the balance-sheet of the preceding year show a considerable deficiency there be a large unfunded debt and even mr hill 's most sanguine calculation admit a probable loss to the post-office of # 1200000 for the first year or two though he express he confidence that eventually the correspondence of the kingdom would be find to increase so largely as to make up for the greater part if not the whole of the deficiency he anticipation be far outrun by the reality in 1839 the postmaster-general estimate the number of letter send yearly by the post at less than twenty-five million they be now upward of a thousand million a number the conveyance of which -lrb- with the addition of newspaper whose circulation have also be greatly augment by a recent reduction of the tax to a penny -rrb- would have severely tax the whole carry power of the kingdom before the introduction of railroad nor have the benefit of the new system be confine to ourselves foreign nation have follow we example though not quite in the same degree till a international postage be at length establish throughout the whole of the civilized world and it have not be only the happiness of private individual that have be augment by this facility of communication in its gradual development it have largely promote the extension of trade of every kind and by facilitate a commercial intercourse between nation it can not but contribute to the maintenance of friendship and peace the full advantage of this reform could not be see at first but even have it be appreciate as fully as we appreciate it now no approval of it could have counterbalance the general dissatisfaction with which the ministry be regard at home the finances be fall into great disorder the expenditure of the year greatly exceed the income while the feeling that they irish policy be dictate by a wish to purchase at any price the support of o'connell be still more injurious to they for he be already begin to renew agitation in ireland inaugurate a new association which though its purpose be faintly veil for a time under the title of the precursor association be understand to point at a repeal of the union while the minister though they denounce such a measure as ruinous to every part of the kingdom seem willing to give it practical encouragement by a bill which they introduce which bear the name of a registration act for ireland but which be not confine to that object on the contrary it contain a provision for lower the qualification for the franchise by one-half so that it be in fact a new reform bill for ireland -lrb- 252 -rrb- calculate greatly to increase he influence by the number of voter of the poorer class whom it would create the bill be defeat but the odium of have propose it remain but besides these home difficulty there be trouble abroad both in the east and in the west in the east the complication inseparable from a dominion like that of ours in indium where constant expansion seem to have become a law of its existence have involve we in a war with a new enemy the warlike afghan nation in the west both jamaica and canada be in a state threatening insurrection indeed the trouble in jamaica have be the immediate cause of that resignation of the ministry in 1839 which have already be mention measure adopt in the english parliament with reference to the termination of that apprenticeship system which as we have see form a part of the bill for the abolition of slavery and another for the regulation of the prison in the island have give such offence to the colonial assembly never very manageable that the member pass a resolution that they legislative rights have be violate and that they would abstain from all exercise of they legislative function except such as might be necessary to preserve inviolate the faith of the island with the public creditor until -lrb- by the rescind of the resolution etc of which they complain -rrb- they should be leave to the free exercise of they inherent rights as british subject and this resolution be second by a insulting protest in which they draw a offensive comparison between the state of crime in the island and that which prevail in great britain taunt the british parliament with the murder and act of incendiarism which terrify ireland night and day with the murder of burke and hare in scotland with the law of divorce and _ crim con _ trial in england and a poor-law which have take million from the necessity of the destitute to add to the luxury of the wealthy the governor dissolve the assembly but that which succeed re-adopted the resolution of its predecessor and the minister in consequence bring in a bill to suspend the exist constitution of the island for a limited number of year and to provide that during that interval its legislative function should not be exercise by a governor a council and a house of assembly but should reside in the governor and council alone the emergency be too great and undeniable the remedy propose be also too unprecedented in its stringency to be deal with without the gravest deliberation and the house of common accordingly give the matter the patient consideration which become both it and themselves they allow the island to appear by counsel against the bill and listen for many hour to a elaborate defense of the conduct of the assembly which if it fail to change the intention of the minister convinced sir robert peel and he party that they measure be doubtful in its justification and impolitic in its severity he point out that the bill be neither more nor less than one for the establishment of a complete despotism -- one which would establish the most unqualified unchecked unmitigated power that be ever yet apply to the government of any community in place of that liberal system which have prevail for upward of one hundred and fifty year and though he do not for a moment question the power of parliament to pass such a measure he greatly doubt the policy of such a exertion of it a somewhat similar measure affect canada they have be compel to enact in the preceding year and he fear lest it might seem to be come to be a practice of parliament to suspend a constitution every session and he quote a speech of canning deliver fifteen year before in which that eloquent statesman a man by no means incline to a timorous policy have declare that no feeling of wounded pride no motive of questionable expediency nothing short of real and demonstrable necessity should ever induce he to moot the awful question of the transcendental power of parliament over every dependency of the british crown that transcendental power be a ordinance of empire which ought to be keep back within the penetralium of the constitution it exist but it should be veil it should not be produce on trifling occasion or in case of petty refractoriness or temporary misconduct and sir robert look at all the papers before the house could not say that there be here any vindication for bring forward this transcendental power he ask whether they have ever treat with so much severity a conquered colony amid the first heat of animosity after the contest and he trace the history of we government of the island back to the time of charle ii point out -lrb- as burke have formerly argue with respect to we colony in north america -rrb- that jamaica owe its colonization by british subject to the conquest that be make of it by the arm of cromwell that its first english population be compose of those who disgust with the excess of the civil war there find a refuge and who have carry with they that attachment to liberty which as early as 1678 have lead they successfully to repel the attack make on the privilege of they house of assembly by the minister of charle ii he warn the house also that if this measure be pass a sympathy for the people of jamaica would be excite throughout the other west indian possession of the crown and while fully admit that the conduct of the assembly have be foolish and unjustifiable he still recommend that it should be treat in a conciliatory spirit which as yet have not be show toward it the government carry they proposal by a majority of no more than five in a very full house a success which they regard as a defeat and as have be already mention resigned but as the state of the question and of the island do not admit of delay on they resumption of they office they introduce a fresh measure which the conservative again curtail of its most severe clause and which in the form in which it be eventually pass give the assembly time to reconsider its conduct and without the humiliation of confess itself guilty to give a practical recantation of they offensive resolution by resume its work of legislation any farther delay of which would on many subject be very mischievous to the island itself the distinct assertion by both party of the power of the parliament to inflict even the severest penalty enable the house to take this conciliatory course without loss of dignity while the stern disapproval of the conduct of the assembly which the conservative leader have express even when plead for a milder treatment of it convince the colonist that any protracted contumacy would be dangerous and would deprive they for the future of all title to even the modify protection which on this occasion have save they in the discussion of these transaction peel as we have see have allude to the affair of canada which have be of a still more serious complexion since there the discontent of the colonist in the lower province have develop into armed insurrection we have see that from the first moment after the country have pass into we possession there have be almost constant dissension between the old french colonist and the english immigrant who cross over both from england and from the colony on the southern side of the st lawrence in the early part of the reign of george iii the desire of terminate these division which have they root in a difference of religion as well as of race the french settler be roman catholic have be one of the chief motive which have lead pitt in 1791 to divide the country into two province -lrb- 253 -rrb- and for many year the scheme be fairly successful but toward the end of the reign of george iv the political excitement cause by the agitation in england of the question of catholic emancipation and subsequently of reform spread across the atlantic to the canada and the french portion of the colonist who almost monopolize the representation in lower canada begin to urge the adoption of change utterly inconsistent with the exist constitution of the colony in the hope of compelling the compliance of the home government with they demand in 1832 and the follow year they refuse to vote the necessary supplies and gain courage as it be from the contemplation of they own violence and under the guidance of a leader of french extraction a m papineau who scarcely conceal he hope of effect the complete severance of the lower province from the british dominion they proceed to put forth farther demand which they regard as plausible from the apparent resemblance of the change which they require to the system of the english constitution but which to use the word in which sir robert peel describe they would have establish a french republic the most important of they be that the upper or legislative council should like the assembly be render elective instead of as have hitherto be the case be nominate by the crown and another ask that the executive council should be make responsible to the assembly in the same manner as in england the minister of the crown be responsible to parliament as it be at once show that the ministry at home have no intention of grant these demand papineau collect a band of malcontent in arm with whom he take possession of one or two small town and venture even to measure he strength with the commander-in-chief of the province sir john colborne one of the most distinguish of wellington 's comrade and pupil he force be utterly route and he himself flee across the frontier to new york a similar outbreak excite in the upper province by a newspaper editor be crush with equal ease and rapidity -lrb- 254 -rrb- and the next year 1838 lord john russell bring forward a bill to suspend the constitution of the colony and to confer on a new governor who be at once to proceed thither very ample power for remodel the government of the province subject of course to the sanction of the home government in the previous year he have succeed in carry some resolution announce the determination of parliament not to concede the demand of the assembly of the lower province which have be already mention and the reason which he give for this course be worth preserve as express the view recognize by parliament of the relation properly exist between the mother country and a colony it be on a proper understanding of they that he base he refusal to make the executive council in canada responsible to the assembly he hold such a step to be entirely incompatible with those relation those relation require that he majesty should be represent not by a person removable by the house of assembly but by a governor send out by the king responsible to the king and responsible to the parliament of great britain this be the necessary constitution of a colony and if we have not these relation exist between the mother country and the colony we shall soon have a end of these relation altogether and he point out the practical difficulty which might reasonably be apprehend if such a change as be ask be concede the person send out by the king as governor and those minister in whom the assembly confide might differ in opinion and there would be at once a collision between the measure of the king and the conduct of the representative of the colony the plan of send out a new governor free from any previous association with either of the party or any of the recent transaction in the colony be probably the wisest that could have be adopt unfortunately it be in some degree mar by the choice of the statesman send out lord durham a man of unquestioned ability but of a extraordinarily self-willed and overbearing temper he draw up a most able report of the state of the province combine with recommendation of the course to be pursue toward they in future so judicious that subsequent minister though widely differ from he view of general politics see no better plan than that which he have suggest but unhappily the measure which he himself adopt especially with respect to the treatment of those who have be leader in the late rebellion be such manifest violation of law that the government at home have no alternative but that of disallow some of they and carry a bill of indemnity for other he take such offence at they treatment of he though it be quite inevitable that he at once resign he appointment and return home but the next year the queen send down a message to the house recommend a union of the two province -lrb- a measure which have be the most important and the very foundation of he suggestion -rrb- and lord john russell introduce a bill which as he describe its object he hope would lay the foundation of a permanent settlement of the affair of the entire colony the main feature of the government policy be the formation of a legislative union of the two province on the principle of a free and representative government and the establishment of such a system of local government as amount to a practical recognition of the principle so earnestly repudiate as we have see by lord john russell a year or two before it be not perhaps fully carry out at first lord sydenham who have succeed lord durham report to the home government as the result of a tour which he have take through a great part of the country that in the whole of the upper province and among the british settler of the lower province a excellent spirit prevail and that he have find everywhere a determination to forget past difference and to unite in a endeavor to obtain under the union those practical measure for the improvement of the country which have be too long neglect in the struggle for party and personal object but of the french canadian he could not give so favorable a report effort be still make by some of the old papineau party to mislead the people but he be satisfy they would not again be able to induce the peasantry to support any attempt at disturbance it be natural that that party should still feel some soreness at the utter failure of they recent attempt and the disappointment of they hope and affair take the longer time in be bring into perfect order and harmony through a strange mortality which take place among the first governors-general lord sydenham die the next year of lockjaw bring on by a fall from he horse sir charle bagot be force to retire in a state of hopeless bad health after a administration equally brief two year later sir charle metcalfe who succeed he return home only to die and it be not till a fourth governor lord elgin succeed to the government that it could be say that the new system though established five year before have a fair trial fortunately he be a man admirably qualify by largeness of statesman-like view and a most conciliatory disposition for such a post at such a time and he strictly carry out the scheme which be imply by the bill of lord john russell and to a certain extent inaugurate by lord sydenham select he adviser from the party which have the confidence of the legislative assembly and generally direct he policy in harmony with they counsel so that under he government the working of the colonial constitution be a nearly faithful reproduction of the parliamentary constitution at home such a policy be in reality only a development of the principle lay down by pitt half a century before and warmly approve by he great rival that the only method of retain distant colony with advantage be to enable they to govern themselves -lrb- 255 -rrb- and since that day similar constitution have be establish in we other distant dependency as they have become ripe for they -- in new zealand the cape and the australian colony -- almost the only power reserve to the home government in those colony in which such constitution have be establish be that of appoint the governor that of ratify or if necessary disallow measure adopt by the colonial government and in case of necessity that of prescribe measure for the adoption of the local legislature and even of compelling such adoption in the event of any persevere opposition the act of 1850 which establish a constitution in victorium go even farther in the privilege it confer on the colonist inasmuch as it give power to the legislative council to alter some of its provision and even to remodel the legislative council and assembly it may be doubt whether this last concession do not go too far since in more than one important instance the government of that great colony have avail itself of it so liberally as to render it necessary to pass a fresh act of parliament to enable she majesty to give she royal assent to some of the change which the assembly have enact -lrb- 256 -rrb- indeed it can not be say that the system have work in every part or on every occasion quite as well as might have be hope nor can it be deny that the colony have occasionally claim a power of independent action in opposition to the home parliament in a way to try severely the patience of the home government after the british parliament have adopt the policy and system of free-trade the canadian assembly adhere to the doctrine of protection so obstinately that it actually establish a tariff of import duty injurious to the commerce of the mother country and apparently intend as a condemnation of its principle but its contumacy show how wholly different be the spirit of the british government from that which have prevail in the last century for though the home government have unquestionably the right of disallow the offensive tariff it forbear to exercise it and probably by this striking proof that it consider a complete recognition of the principle of local self-government more important than any trifling financial or commercial advantage contribute greatly to implant in canada and all the colony that confidence in the affectionate moderation of the home government which must be the strongest if not the only indissoluble bond of union on the whole it be hardly too much to say that no more statesman-like and -lrb- if sentiment may be allow a share in influence the conduct of government -rrb- no more amiable spirit animate any act of we modern legislation than be display in these arrangement for the management of we colony they be a practical exemplification of the idea embody in the expression the mother country a hundred year ago burke seek to impress on the exist minister and parliament the conviction that so long as we colony keep the idea of they civil rights associate with we government they would cling and grapple to we and no force under heaven would be of power to tear they from they allegiance in the case of which he be speak he warning as we have see fall on deaf ear but the policy of the present reign be a willing and full adoption of they on a far larger scale than even he farseeing vision could then contemplate within the century which have elapse since he time the enterprise of britain have send forth she son to people another hemisphere and they she child still cling to the parent state with filial affection because they feel that though part from she by thousand of mile and more than one ocean they be still indissolubly unite to she by they participation in all the blessing of she constitution she generous toleration she equal law she universal freedom on one transaction of these year the leader of the opposition be find act in close agreement with the minister we have see how in the early part of the reign of george iii the house of common throw the sheriff of london into prison on account of they performance of what they conceive to be they duty as magistrate and in 1840 it subject the same official to the same treatment on a question of the same character -- the extent of the privilege of the house of common to overrule the authority of the court of law the question be in appearance complicate by the institution of several suit at law and by the fact that the house be not consistent in its conduct but allow its servant to plead to the first action and refuse the same permission in the second when the result of the first trial have prove adverse to they the case be this : some inspector of prison have present a report to parliament in which they allege that they have find in newgate a book of disgusting and obscene character publish by a london publisher name stockdale the house of common have order the report to be print and sell by messr hansard the parliamentary publisher and stockdale bring a action against messr hansard for libel chief-justice denman charge the jury that the fact of the house of common have direct messr hansard to publish they report be no justification to they for publish a parliamentary report contain a libel and stockdale obtain damages which be duly pay stockdale encourage by this success when in spite of the result of the late trial hansard continue to sell the report bring a fresh action but now the house forbid the publisher to plead to it and as they obey the prohibition and forbore to plead the case eventually come before the sheriff 's court fresh damages be give and in obedience to the writ of the queen 's bench the sheriff seize hansard 's goods and sell they to satisfy the judgment lord john russell as leader of the house move to bring to the bar of the house all the party concern in the action -- the plaintiff he attorney the sheriff and the under-sheriff he be oppose by nearly all the legal member of the house except the crown lawyer sir edward sugden especially warn the house that a resolution of the house be of no avail in a court of justice while other taunt the house with want of courage in not proceed against the judge themselves rather than against they officer which in this case the sheriff be there could be no doubt of the importance of the question since it be no less as the attorney-general sir j campbell put it than a question whether parliament or the court of law have the superiority and now sir robert peel as leader of the opposition come to the support of lord john russell declare he opinion to be first that the house possess every privilege necessary for the proper and effectual discharge of its function secondly that the publication of evidence which have lead the house to adopt any course be frequently essential to justify that course to the nation and thirdly that to judge of the extent of they privilege and to vindicate they by they own law belong to the house alone and he press strongly on the house that it be the duty of the house to fight the battle to the last though he confess that it be with pain that he have come to the determination of enter into a contest with the court of law on one point the judge agree with the house of common the house commit the sheriff but when they sue out they _ habea corpus _ the judge decide that the return of the sergeant-at-arm that they be commit by the house for breach of privilege be a sufficient return stockdale bring fresh action but meantime the case be arouse a strong excitement in the country -lrb- 257 -rrb- the singular hardship of the position of the sheriff excite general sympathy : if they obey the house of common which prohibit they from pay over to stockdale the damages which they have receive for he the court of queen 's bench would be bind to attach they for disobedience to its order if they obey the queen 's bench the house would imprison they for breach of privilege and the national feeling be always in favor of the strictly define authority of the court of law rather than of the somewhat indefinite claim of parliament to interpret and even to make privilege another consideration probably weigh a little with the champion of the house -- that they power of imprisonment end with the session as matter go on it be find that even the attorney and solicitor-general differ as to the course to be pursue and eventually lord john russell consent to adopt the advice which have be give by a former attorney-general sir f pollock and to bring in a bill to legalize all similar proceedings of parliament in future by enact that a certificate that the publication of any document have be order by either house should be a sufficient defense against any action the introduction of such a bill be in some degree a acknowledgment of defeat but it can hardly be deny to have be not only a judicious step but the only one practicable if the contest between parliament and the court of law be not to be everlasting and it meet with general approval if it be a compromise it be one that satisfy both party and both end it uphold the authority of the court of law and at the same time it practically assert the reasonableness of the claim advance by the house of common by give it for the future the power which it have claim nor be people in this day incline to be jealous of the privilege of parliament so long as they be accurately define they feel that it be for the advantage and dignity of the nation that its power and privilege should be large what they regard with distrust be a claim of power of which no one know the precise bound and which might therefore be expand as the occasion serve note : -lrb- footnote 245 : fifty-two mill and 30000 person be

for himself a reputation as the greatest financier of europe since the day of pitt it may be worth remark that in the memoirs of the prince consort it be mention that in the course of he administration peel find reason to change he judgment on the question of which house of parliament it be the more desirable for the prime-minister to be a member canning have more than once assert he conviction that the public business would be more satisfactorily conduct when the prime-minister be a commoner found he opinion chiefly on the paramount importance of financial question the discussion of which be almost confine to the house of common and conceive it to be support by the history of the administration of pitt from whom indeed he have imbibe the idea and in former year peel have more than once express he concurrence with that view of the subject but from papers which be intrust to he for the execution of he great work sir theodore martin learn that peel have subsequently find reason to come to the opposite conclusion not from any change in he view of the relative importance of the different department of administration but solely because the amount of work impose upon the first minister in the house of common in addition to what he have to go through elsewhere be too great for any human strength in the house of lord the prime-minister would escape the necessity for be in a position to vindicate all the detail of administration and to answer the multiplicity of question on all sort of subject the put of which have almost degenerate into a vice he have therefore come to the conclusion that it be there he ought to be -lrb- 260 -rrb- and indeed the subject which demand the care of the minister and attract the attention of parliament be constantly increase in number variety and importance to the very end of he administration not only be the financial difficulty of the country the depressed state of agriculture and commerce -lrb- the result of a succession of bad harvest -rrb- sufficient cause for grave anxiety but the terrible war of which mention have already be make which we have now be carry on for nearly three year in afghanistan and which before the end of this very year be about to be signalize by a disaster such as have never before befall a british army threaten to kindle the flame of war in europe also from the share which the intrigue of russium have have in foment the quarrel and the same danger be more than once in the course of the next five year imminent from the irritation with which france regard we and which commence in syrium while lord melbourne be still at the helm lose no opportunity of display itself whether in transaction in the remote pacific ocean or the old battle-field of the two nation the spanish peninsula and finally these embarrassing perplexity be crown by the appalling visitation of famine which at the end of the fourth year of the administration fall upon ireland with a severity surpass any similar event in modern history with all these multiform difficulty the new minister grapple with unflinching courage and with conspicuous success peace be preserved abroad and financial prosperity be restore at home into the detail of he measure devise for this last-mentioned object though the lead feature of he administration and those on which he fame chiefly rest it would be beside the purpose of the present work to enter it be sufficient to say here that in the spirit of pitt 's great financial reform of 1787 he revise the whole of the import duty of we commercial tariff especially reduce the duty on raw material -lrb- 261 -rrb- make up the deficiency so cause by a income tax which he describe as a temporary imposition since he doubt not that the great increase of lawful trade which would be the consequence of the reduction of duty would soon enable the revenue to dispense with a tax to the objection of which he be not blind in recommend this great change to the house he lay down as the soundest maxim of financial legislation in which all be now agree the principle that we should buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest a doctrine which when more fully carry out as it be sure to be lead almost inevitably to the great measure for which he administration be most celebrate the repeal of the corn-law there could be no doubt that in the most modify application of it it strike at the root of the principle of protection which have hitherto be the fundamental principle of we finance and make a farther extension of it inevitable and as he have be one of the lead member of the ministry which carry catholic emancipation so he now proceed on the same path of religious toleration and in the session of 1844 successfully recommend to the house of common a bill which have already be pass by the lord repeal a number of penal act affect the roman catholic which though they have long be practically obsolete still encumber and it may be say disgrace the statute book and be so to say a standing degradation of and insult to the roman catholic body one of they pass in the reign of william and mary still forbid any roman catholic to come within ten mile of london to have either sword or pistol in he house or to possess a horse worth more than five pound another enact under elizabeth still make every roman catholic who omit to take certain oath guilty of high-treason though no attempt to administer those oath have be make since the revolution another of the time of charle i deprive any roman catholic who should send he son to a foreign school of all protection of the law he could neither sue nor defend a action it may fairly be say that the credit of parliament and of the nation be concern in the abrogation of law so ridiculously oppressive and not the less obnoxious for be practically invalid and in the same spirit another measure be frame and carry by the lord chancellor whose object be the confirmation of religious endowment belong to different sect of protestant dissenter and they protection from vexatious and unjust litigation by make a continued possession of any kind of endowment or property for twenty year a valid title these enactment may be regard as indispensable supplement to the repeal of the test act and catholic emancipation they be the coping-stone of the great edifice of religious toleration of which the former act have lay the foundation and the next year peel carry out still farther the same principle by a measure which could not fail to be regard as a especial boon in ireland since the great majority of the population of that kingdom be of the roman catholic persuasion it have be see that when the troubled state into which the continent be throw by the french revolution throw hinderance in the way of the irish student design for the roman catholic priesthood go to one of the great continental college such as st omer or salamanca for they education pitt establish for they a college at maynooth for the endowment of which parliament be annually ask for a grant of about # 9000 the sum have long be feel to be altogether inadequate to the requirement of the foundation as early as the year 1807 lord liverpool then home-secretary have contemplate a large increase of the grant though the weakness of the government then preside over by the duke of portland prevent he from carry out that and other measure which he have conceive in a kindred spirit moreover the grant be rarely propose without give rise to a warm debate raise by a party whose too tender conscience forbid they to sanction any measure appear to foster a religion from which they dissent and to remedy the two evil -lrb- the one arise from the want of a sufficient provision the other from the spirit of religious controversy for which the house of common be certainly very ill-calculated -rrb- peel in 1845 propose to treble the grant so as to put the college on a more satisfactory footing by provide sufficient income for the professor and a revenue adequate to the respectable maintenance of a increase number of pupil and also to place the charge for the future on the consolidated fund by which step its yearly discussion in parliament would be altogether avoid the measure be vigorously resist partly on the religious ground already mention and partly by a argument urge with some plausibility that the design with which the college have originally be found have not be realize that in fact it have not prove a benefit to the country but rather the reverse by tempting into the service of the roman catholic church a humbler and poorer class of student than could devote themselves to it when the preliminary education involve the expense of a protracted residence in a foreign country but the obvious advantage of the change prevail over these consideration and the bill be carry by large majority -lrb- 262 -rrb- and now that the long cessation of controversy on the subject -- which indeed have be not the least beneficial fruit of this bill of 1845 -- permit a candid consideration of it in all its bearing it will probably be think that parliament have not often come to a wiser decision one more dictate by judicious liberality of sentiment and more imperatively require on every ground of statesman-like policy if the countervail objection and advantage be calmly weigh it may almost be say that there be no alternative between enlarge the endowment and put it on a new footing or suppress the college altogether in its exist condition it be notoriously inadequate to fulfil the design of its founder and any establishment visibly inadequate to its design tend to bring the design itself into some degree of contempt yet even if it should be grant that there might have be no fair ground of complaint if the college have never be found to close it after its benefit however scanty have be enjoy for half a century could not fail to have be regard as a unpardonable injustice and injury the other alternative therefore be practically the only one that remain and in embrace it peel be but carry out the original principle on which the college be found it have be intend to be efficient through lack of mean it have prove inefficient the obvious and just remedy be to supply such increase means as to create or bestow the efficiency originally aim at and it be a felicitous idea to place the charge for the future on such a footing as to combine with such a increase a avoidance of the irritation which its yearly discussion have never fail to excite and at the same time to carry still farther the principle of religious toleration or rather of religious equality he induce the parliament to find a new university consist of three college one in each of the three province of ulster munster and connaught -lrb- leinster as have trinity college and maynooth be regard as already sufficiently provide with university education -rrb- which should be open to student of every religious denomination and at which while every kind of secular education both literary and scientific should be give the stir up of religious controversy and animosity should be guard against by the absence of any theological professorship he do not indeed design that the still greater benefit of religious education should be withhold from the pupil but he propose to provide for that object by confide they religious education to the care of the clergy of each persuasion some of whom in each town which be the seat of a college -- belfast cork and galway -- might be trust for willingness to superintend it it be hope that one fruit of this scheme and that by no mean its least valuable result would be that the association of pupil of various creed in they study and amusement from a early age would lead they to maintain in they more mature year the harmony of which the foundation have thus be lay in they youth and that thus the religious animosity which be the principal obstacle to the prosperity of the country would be soften and in time extinguish and this object have be achieve to a great extent though the disfavor with which the roman catholic church regard any educational system which be not under the superintendence of its priesthood have prevent the scheme from attain the full development which be hope for the number of student of each of the principal sect -- the church of ireland the roman catholic and the presbyterian -- steadily increase -lrb- 263 -rrb- member of each religious body be among the professor in each college and all account represent the most perfect harmony and cordiality as exist throughout the whole body yet important as be the principle contain in these measure none of they perhaps cause such excitement at the moment as a exercise by the government of what be in point of fact one of its most ancient as well as most essential power : the occasional opening of letter which pass through the post in compliance with a warrant of the secretary of state england have at all time be the refuge of those unquiet spirit who in pursuit of they scheme of rebellion and revolution have incur the displeasure of they own government and have too easily find accomplice here and in the course of the summer some notorious offender of this class find a member of the house of common to present a petition in which they complain that some letter which they have post have be stop and open by the officer of the post-office the member who present the petition appear to have fancy it a unprecedented and wholly unlawful exercise of authority but sir jame graham the home-secretary not only at once avow that the statement be true and that he have issue he warrant for the opening of the letter mention but also show that the power to issue such a order be reserve to the secretary of state in all the statute which regulate the proceedings of the post-office the clause in the act which confer the power have be originally frame by lord somer a statesman certainly as little open as any of he time to the suspicion of desire to encroach on the rightful liberty of the subject and it have be exercise from time to time in every reign since the revolution it be a power intrust to the secretary of state for the public safety and exercise by they on they own responsibility the practice and its justification be assail in both house of parliament by member of the extreme liberal party but though no distinct motion on the subject be make the general feeling of both house be plainly evince that it be a power which might at time be highly useful for the prevention of crime or for the hinderance of conspiracy which might be dangerous to the general welfare and tranquillity and that the constitutional responsibility attach to every minister for every official act be a sufficient security against its be improperly use -lrb- 264 -rrb- and it will probably be generally admit that this be the statesman-like view of the subject there be no doubt that the practice in question do infringe the great constitutional right of every individual in these kingdom to absolute freedom of communication with he friend but the most important and the most cherish constitutional rights must possess something of elasticity it must be necessary at time to go back to the original object for which those rights have be confer and secure that original object be the safety and welfare of the whole body corporate -- of the entire nation and if that safety and welfare at time require the sacrifice a wise ruler will not hesitate to demand it of the people or to impose it on they for they own good so another principle of the constitution be the absolute freedom of action for all the subject of the sovereign yet that principle be infringe by more than one statute : factory act which limit the hour of even voluntary labor education act which compel the parent to a certain line of conduct toward he child each in they way substitute another rule for that entire freedom of action which as have be say before be the fundamental principle of the constitution but they make the substitution on the reasonable ground that the course of action which they compel be for the benefit not only of the individual constrain but of the whole community of which he be a member and for whose welfare all law and constitution exist one of the grounds of complaint against the exercise of this power which have be allege by some of the opponent of the government have be that sir jame graham 's conduct have be dictate by a unworthy subservience to some of the despotic sovereign of the continent the fact be indignantly deny in the house of lord by the duke of wellington and in the course of the session a remarkable proof be afford how little influence such motive have on the decision of we government when they acquiesce in the passing of a bill which be a virtual repeal of the alien act which have exist for more than half a century and of which more than one continental sovereign would certainly have desire the retention of late indeed it have be so modify that practically it have become little more than a dead letter and now in 1844 without be formally repeal it be virtually abrogate by a act which enable all foreigner to obtain letter of naturalization which confer on they every right of british subject except those of become member of parliament -lrb- 265 -rrb- or of the privy council generally speak few government have enjoy more of the confidence of the nation than peel 's do in 1844 yet in this year it be expose to two remarkable mortification the charter of the east indium company as frame by pitt in subsequent event which have lead to the entire extinction of the political power of the company make anything beyond this brief mention of the transaction superfluous at the present time the other mortification of the ministry to which allusion have be make fall upon it at home in the parliamentary discussion of the prime-minister 's financial measure on which he judgment be usually regard as pre-eminent and on which a large majority of the house be generally disposed implicitly to follow he guidance sir robert be not indeed himself chancellor of the exchequer that office be fill by mr goulburn but it be certain that the budget be inspire by a deference to the prime-minister 's view and among the arrangement which it propose one consist of a relaxation of the sugar-duty which be regard with dread by those interested in the west indy as a farther step in the direction of free-trade and as deprive they of the modify protection which they be as yet enjoy to preserve that protection to they mr mile the member for bristol propose a amendment which after a animated debate be carry by a majority of twenty three month before on the factory bill and the question whether the hour of labor should be limit to ten or to twelve the minister have also find himself defeat though by a much smaller majority but in that case the defeat have be the less pronounced from the inconsistency of the vote on the different limit -lrb- 266 -rrb- and he extricate himself from that difficulty by abandon the bill altogether and introduce a new one not without angry resistance on the part of lord john russell and other member of the opposition they denounce such a maneuver as alike unconstitutional and unparliamentary while he on the contrary insist that the house have always jealously retain the right of reconsider its own decision in that instance however the introduction of a new bill might have be regard as the simplest mode of harmonize the variety of view which have be represent by the discussion of and vote on the ministerial proposal and the amendment but no such expedient be practicable in this case that of the sugar-duty a defeat on a important clause in the budget by a majority of twenty be a far more serious matter it be such a blow as have generally be reckon sufficient to require a resignation of a ministry but on this occasion peel do not feel himself call on to take that step nor be he incline to dissolve parliament which some regard as he only legitimate alternative though he have little doubt that if he do so he should be support by the confidence of the country after careful reflection the course on which he eventually decide be to adhere to the principle of a relaxation of duty but to consent to a moderate variation from he original proposal as to the amount and in pursuit of this plan on the next discussion of the budget he propose a amendment to that effect make the adoption of it by the house a test of its confidence in the administration lord john russell oppose the amendment with great vehemence pronounce the acceptance of it if it should be accept and the house should thus consent to retract its previous vote a lamentable proof of subserviency which would disgrace it with the country what sir robert now ask be substantially that they should now declare that to be expedient which they have declare to be inexpedient only three night ago and lord palmerston insist that the proper course to be take by the government be to resign while mr labouchere who have also be a member of lord melbourne 's cabinet -lrb- 267 -rrb- though he admit that there might be circumstance under which a minister might without impropriety ask the house to reconsider a vote deny that the present be such a case and especially denounce the importation of the question of confidence or no confidence in the ministry into the discussion as dangerous and unconstitutional another section of the opposition agree in take the same line mr disraelus -lrb- then begin to lay the foundation of he reputation and influence -rrb- strongly denounce the conduct of the minister as degrading both to he own supporter and still more to the whole house and recommend he to say frankly to both we have gauge you independence and you may have a semblance of parliamentary freedom as far as this point but the moment you go farther you must either submit to public disgrace or we must submit to private life the end of the discussion be that the minister prevail by a majority a trifle larger than that which have defeat he before this be not the place to discuss the difference between one principle of taxation and another but the question whether a minister when defeat be justified in ask either house of parliament to reconsider its vote seem one that could only have be raise in a house under the influence of unusual excitement of some kind the charge that such a request be unconstitutional only serve to show how loosely the word constitution and unconstitutional be often use even by those from whom precision of language might most be expect for sir robert peel 's proposal that the house should retract its vote be not unprecedented the very same demand have be make in 1833 by lord althorp then chancellor of the exchequer of lord gray 's ministry of which those very man be member who be now loudest in denounce the conduct of the present government and on that occasion it be worth remark that though lord althorp 's demand be resist in one or two quarter he be vigorously support by sir robert peel on the ground that though to rescind one night a vote pass on a former one might be not altogether free from objection it would be a far greater evil that question of importance should be hold to be in all case finally decide by a single vote pass it might be in a thin house or in obedience to some sudden impulse and this seem to be the view of the case commend not only by constitutional and parliamentary practice but by common-sense it would be strange indeed when the question submit to the british parliament and the decision of that parliament on they be so often of paramount importance to the whole world if the parliament should be the only body in the world deny the right of revise its own judgment the only one whose first resolution be so irrevocable that even itself may not change or modify it to rescind a recent vote be no doubt as sir robert peel say a step not wholly free from objection it should be a exceptional act as one which if often repeat would give a appearance of capricious fickleness and instability to the opinion of parliament calculate to impair that respect for it which the whole state and nation be deeply concern in uphold but to refuse under any circumstance to confess a change of judgment would lay the parliament open to a imputation at least equally dangerous to that respect -- that of a obstinacy which refuse to confess the possibility of be mistaken or to hear reason it would not be well therefore that the abrogation of a previous vote should become a ordinary practice but it would be equally undesirable that any fix or unchangeable rule should be interpose to prevent a second discussion of a important question with the possibility of its lead to a reversal of the opinion first express in the same year -lrb- 1844 -rrb- the minister feel compel to raise a constitutional point of singular refinement which have the effect of arrest the progress of a bill in which one part of the kingdom take a lively interest which a division in its favor prove to be fully share by the house of lord -lrb- 268 -rrb- it have be already mention that in the last year of the precede reign a bill have pass for create when opportunity offer by the see affected become vacant two new bishopric at ripon and manchester the income of which be to be provide by the union of some of the smaller exist bishopric gloucester with bristol st asaph with bangor but the welsh regard with great disapproval any reduction of the number of bishopric in the principality and lord powi now bring in a bill to repeal so much of the act as provide for the union of two welsh see urge not only they great extent which he state at 3000 square mile of very mountainous country but the fact that the population of north wale be steadily and largely increase the bill as have be intimate be favorably receive by the lord who pass the second reading by a majority of twelve but before it could be read a third time the duke of wellington as leader of the ministry in that house announce that the bill be one which touch the prerogative of the crown and therefore could not be proceed with without the consent of she majesty which he be not authorize to express as the matter be explain by the chancellor lord lyndhurst the manner in which the bill touch the royal prerogative be this : as during the vacancy of any see its temporality belong to the crown any alteration in a see affect the direct pecuniary interest of the crown and he as speaker of the house doubt whether he should be justify in put a question which so touch the royal prerogative without the sovereign 's consent a committee which be appoint to investigate the case fully confirm the view thus take by the minister and the bill be drop it be however a exercise of the royal prerogative which be receive by the house in general with great dissatisfaction certainly since the civil list and royal income have be place on they present footing it be only by a very forced construction that the pecuniary interest of the sovereign could be say to be affect and it seem a very insufficient plea for evoke the exercise of a power which as it be say have certainly never be exert before since the accession of the hanoverian dynasty nor be it make more acceptable by the explanation of lord brougham who on this occasion come to the support of the minister that the refusal of the crown 's consent at this stage be a warning as it be a polite and courteous communication between the sovereign as guardian of the privilege of the crown and the two house of parliament that if they pass a certain bill it would not receive the royal assent for though the right to refuse the royal assent to any bill be incontestable it have not be exercise since the time of william iii and to put it in force for the protection of a imaginary interest of the crown itself would have be so unpopular a exercise of it that no administration could have venture to advise it one of the argument which the duke of wellington bring forward in the discussion and which probably contribute to induce he thus to strangle lord powi 's bill have have a influence on subsequent legislation he urge that its adoption -- since the resolution to establish bishopric at manchester and ripon be one which every one desire to carry out -- would increase the number of bishop and thus make a organic change in the constitution of the house of lord it be not very clear how the addition of a single spiritual peer could have that effect but the duke have dwell upon the same argument before in the debate on the propose union of the see affected urge that there be such a jealousy of the church in many quarter and especially in some of the large town that it would be very undesirable to pass any measure the effect of which would be to increase the number of episcopal peer even if there be any general reluctance at that time to see such a increase -lrb- a fact which be by no means ascertain -rrb- it may be doubt whether it be found on any sufficient reason it be not easy to see why when there be no limit to the augmentation of the number of lay peer it should be judge impolitic or unjust to make even so small a addition to the number of spiritual peer at the restoration the spiritual peer be probably more than a fifth of the entire house from the great number of subsequent creation of lay peer they be now less than a sixteenth so that there could be no ground for apprehend that a slight re-enforcement of the episcopal bench would disturb the balance or give the church a undue preponderating weight in the decision of the house the difficulty however such as it appear to the duke then have have such weight with subsequent administration that a new principle have be establish of create bishopric which shall not at first confer seat in the upper house till they holder become entitle to they by seniority as they be peer from the moment of they consecration it may be doubt whether this creation of peer without seat in parliament do not deserve the name of a organic change in the constitution far more than the addition of one or two ecclesiastical peer to the episcopal bench and also whether it have not establish a dangerous principle and precedent the disconnection of bishopric from seat in parliament in even a single instance seem to furnish a argument in favor of the exclusion of the whole order a measure which if unjust and injurious to the church would be at least equally injurious to parliament itself and to the whole state but all question of this kind be presently lose sight of in the excitement produce by the measure which more than any other have stamp sir robert peel 's administration with a lasting character the repeal of the corn-law many statesman even of those who be most in favor of free-trade in other article of commerce make a exception in the case of corn partly from a feeling of the necessity of encouraging agriculture and partly from a conviction of the danger of in any way contribute to create or increase a dependence on foreign country for the food of the people both whig and tory be generally thus agree on the necessity of maintain the principle of protection the dispute between the two party be whether it be best achieve by a fix duty on import corn or by what be commonly know as a slide scale : a scale that be which vary inversely with the price of the grain itself rise as the price in the home market fall and fall as it rise in the manufacturing district a different feeling have prevail for some year in the first year of the present reign severe distress in manchester and other of the chief manufacturing town have lead to the formation of a association whose chief object be sufficiently indicate by its title of the anti-corn-law league at first mr villier the member for wolverhampton be its principal spokesman in the house of common but at subsequent election two manufacturer of great eloquence obtain seat and year after year urge the entire repeal of all duty on corn with great earnestness though for some time they argument make but little impression on the house they motion be reject in 1842 by a majority of 300 in 1843 by one exceed 250 in 1844 by above 200 and in 1845 by one of more than 130 in a much smaller house but this last division have scarcely be take when a unprecedented calamity -- the almost entire failure of the potato crop which be attack in nearly every part of both island by a new disease the cause of which be not to this day fully ascertain -- suddenly change the aspect of the subject to the english farmer and laborer it be a severe loss to the irish farmer it be ruin to the irish peasant famine the grain harvest too be generally deficient and it be evident that rigorous measure promptly take be indispensable if a large portion of the peasantry in the southern and western province of ireland be not to be leave to perish of actual starvation in the face of so terrible a emergency peel act with great decision on he own responsibility he authorize the purchase of a large supply of indian corn from the united state hope among other indirect effect of such a step to accustom the irish to the use of other kind of food besides the root on which hitherto they have too exclusively rely -lrb- 269 -rrb- and he lay before he colleague in the cabinet a proposal to suspend the exist corn-law for a limited period a measure which all see must lead to its eventual repeal it would be superfluous now to recapitulate the discussion which take place the various alternative proposal which be suggest or the dissension in the cabinet to which he proposal give birth the resignation of the ministry and its subsequent resumption of office when lord stanley and lord john russell have find it impossible to form a administration it be sufficient to say that as soon as parliament meet sir robert bring forward a bill to reduce the duty on corn to four shilling a price only half of the lowest fixed duty that have ever be propose before that reduction too be a stepping-stone to the abolition of all duty at the end of three year beyond a shill a quarter which be to be retain in order to acquire a accurate knowledge of the quantity of grain import the diminution however of this duty be not the whole object of he new measure it include other arrangement which would serve as a compensation to the agriculturist by relieve they from some of the peculiar burden to which the land be subject and it contain farther a reduction or abolition of import duty hitherto levy on many other article especially on such as form the clothing of the country on the fair ground that if the removal of protection from the agriculturist be a sacrifice for the common good the commercial and manufacturing interest might justly be require to make a similar sacrifice for the same patriotic object though oppose in both house with unusual bitterness the ministry carry they measure which indeed in all probability even if the destruction of the potato crop have not come to accelerate the movement could not have be long delay the continual and rapid increase of the population add yearly strength to the argument of those who denounce the imposition of any tax which have the effect of increase the price of the people 's food but however inevitable it may have be we be not the less compel to regard it as indirectly bring about a great constitutional change or rather as consummate that which have be commence by the reform bill till the year 1832 the territorial aristocracy have exert a predominate influence in the government of the state the reform bill which deprive the wealthier land-owner of the greater part of they power at election strike the first blow at that influence the abolition of the corn-laws inflict on it a still more decisive wound by its extinction of the doctrine that there be any such peculiar sacredness about the land and its produce as entitle they to protection beyond that enjoy by other kind of property place in that respect the commercial and manufacturing interest on a level with the land interest it make we in a farther and a somewhat different sense from that in which napoleon have use the phrase a nation of shopkeeper -lrb- 270 -rrb- the repeal of the corn-law have another result : it divide the conservative party and as a necessary consequence lead to the downfall of the ministry the same session which witness its success in carry that repeal witness also its defeat on a coercion bill which they regard as indispensable for the protection of life in ireland where actual murder have reach the appalling amount of nearly three hundred in two year the ministry at once resign and lord john russell have no difficulty in form a administration now that the question of the corn-law be finally settle it be however no bed of rose to which the new ministry succeed the famine in ireland exceed the worst anticipation and though prodigious effort be make by the government and parliament to relieve it though large sum be place at the disposal of the lord-lieutenant aid by contribution from private source in england to a enormous amount though the small remnant of the import duty on corn which have be leave on it by the measure of the preceding year be take off and the navigation law suspend in order that no obstacle interpose to the acquisition of food from every available quarter it be estimate that more than half a million of people perish through actual famine or the disease which scarcity bring in its train -lrb- 271 -rrb- a severe monetary crisis be one not unnatural result of this distress so severe that the fund fall to a price below any that have be quote for many year and the reserve in the bank of england to a amount lower than it have be at any period since 1828 and these difficulty have hardly be surmount when a new revolution in france overturn the dynasty of loui philippe and establish a republic the revolutionary contagion spread to italy where indeed the movement have begin the pope -- pius ix -- who have but lately succeed to the tiara be force to flee from rome in the disguise of a foreign courier after he prime-minister have be murder by the mob germany be scarcely less disturbed the administration of metternich who have govern austrium with authority little less than absolute for nearly forty year be overthrow in a tumult in which he himself escape with difficulty from the violence of the populace dangerous riot take place at munich at berlin and at the capital of most of the smaller principality and for some time everything seem to portend the outbreak of a general war likely to be the more formidable as be a war of the revolutionary and republican against the monarchical principle happily that danger be avert the only war which break out between different nation be a brief contest in the north of italy which the superior number of the austrian army and the skill of marshal radetsky a veteran who have learn the art of war under suvarof nearly sixty year before decide in favor of austrium and which in the spring of 1849 be terminate by a peace on less unfavorable term to sardinium than she could well have expect and in the same season tranquillity be re-establish even at rome which from the peculiar character of the papal power contain special element of provocation and danger but though peace be thus generally maintain these various event have produce a ferment of spirit which require some time to calm down and so greatly embarrass the government that in the spring of 1852 lord john russell 's administration be dissolve and a new ministry be form by lord derby -lrb- 272 -rrb- but the cause which have overthrow he predecessor remain to weaken he so that for some time it seem impossible to form a ministry which afford any promise of stability such a rapid succession of change as ensue have have no parallel since the first year of george iii between February 1852 and February 1855 the country have no fewer than four different prime-minister a fact which be at once both the proof and the parent of weakness in every administration lord john russell have attempt to procure a factitious support in the country by stimulate a fresh demand for parliamentary reform a year or two before he have provoke the dissatisfaction of the advanced liberal as they call themselves by insist on the finality of the reform bill of 1832 and by advise he follower to rest and be thankful for what have be then obtain but now he begin to advance a opinion that that act require some amendment to carry into more complete effect the principle on which it be found he insert a intimation of that doctrine in the queen 's speech and endeavor to give effect to it by bring in a bill to lower the franchise have it seem persuade himself that a five-pound franchise would create a more conservative class of voter -lrb- 273 -rrb- he have scarcely introduce it when the fall of he ministry lead to its abandonment but though it be coldly receive by the house of common the idea be take up by the other political party who can hardly be acquit of have use the question merely as a instrument of party warfare try with a unstatesmanlike indifference to the danger of re-awaken the old frenzy on the subject to rouse the nation to take a interest in it but try in vain the nation be no longer in the same temper as it have display twenty year before the reform bill of 1832 have be demand and carry with a frantic vehemence of enthusiasm such as could only have be excite by real defect and grievance but those grievance have be remove and redress and the bulk of the people could take no interest in scheme whose sole end seem to be either to satisfy the theory of some political doctrinaire or to embarrass a adversary till at last as reform bill after reform bill be frame bring in and defeat or drop it become plain as the prince consort note in a private memorandum at the end of 1859 that what the country want in fact be not reform but a bill to stop the question of reform -lrb- 274 -rrb- and at last the prevalence of this feeling lord john russell could not conceal even from himself but confess to lord palmerston then prime-minister who have always silently discourage the movement that the apathy of the country be undeniable nor be it a transient humor it seem rather a confirm habit of mind four reform bill have be introduce of late year by four different government and for not one of they have there be the least enthusiasm the conclusion to which he have come be that the adviser of the crown of all party have offer to the country various measure of reform and the country have show itself indifferent to they all the best course which could now be take be to wait till the country should show a manifest desire for a amendment of the representation -lrb- 275 -rrb- there be however in these year one subject in which the country do take a real interest that be the development and extension of the principle of free-trade on that the national view have become so decide that in 1848 the parliament even abolish the navigation law which have subsist so long the first act on the subject date from the reign of richard ii that the adherence to the principle contain in they of confine both the export and the import trade of the kingdom with but few exception to british shipping seem almost a essential article of the constitution it be the dearer too to the national prejudice from the sense universally entertain of the paramount importance of maintain the pre-eminence of we navy and from the belief that the commercial marine be a nursery for the royal fleet with which they could not dispense but latterly the law have become unpopular even with some of those who have formerly be suppose to derive the greatest benefit from they many of we colony have complain of they operation and several of the ablest of we colonial governor have recommend they repeal they have be find too to present frequent and considerable difficulty in we commercial negotiation with other country and many naval officer of large experience and sound judgment express a decide belief that they be of no practical use to the naval service the result of a long and able debate be that the law be repeal with the exception of that portion of they which preserve the monopoly of the coast trade to we own seaman and vessel that exception be chiefly dictate by consideration connect with the prevention of smuggling the ground on which the minister rely in propose this repeal of law so ancient be that when protection have be remove from every other trade those concern in these different trade have a irresistible claim for its removal from the shipping and on general principle both of commerce and statesmanship the claim be as they urge irresistible unless some object of greater importance still than uniformity of legislation -- namely the national safety bind up as it unquestionably be in the perpetual pre-eminence of the national navy -- require a exception to be make but for the maintenance of we maritime supremacy it be as burke have preach three-quarter of a century before better to trust to the spirit of the people to they attachment to they government and to they innate aptitude for seamanship which they seem to have inherit from the hardy rover of the dark age and which no other nation share with they in a equal degree and if that may safely be trust as undoubtedly it may to maintain the supremacy of we warlike fleet the preponderance of argument seem greatly on the side of those who contend that we commercial fleet need no such protection to which it may be add that exception to a general rule and principle be in themselves so questionable that the burden of proof seem to lie upon those who would establish or maintain they but the advocate of free-trade be not content even with this triumph though it might have be think a crowning one and in the course of the next year they succeed in carry a resolution which -lrb- though lord derby and the opponent of the act of 1846 be now in office -rrb- be not resist even by the ministry be in fact the result of a compromise between the different party and which assert that the improve condition of the country and especially of the industrious class be mainly the result of recent legislation which have establish the principle of unrestricted competition and that it be the opinion of the house that this policy firmly maintain and prudently extend would without inflict injury on any important interest best enable the industry of the country to bear its own burden and would thereby most surely promote the welfare and contentment of the people such a resolution be in fact the adoption of free-trade as the permanent ruling principle of all future commercial legislation and even before the adoption of this resolution the feeling in favor of free-trade have be greatly strengthen by the great exhibition which not only delighted the world for six month with a spectacle of such varied and surpassing beauty as even its original projector the prince consort have not picture to himself but which have also the farther and more important effect of instruct the british workman in every branch of manufacture by bring before he eye the workmanship of other nation and as we may well believe

decision in strict uniformity with the principle that rule we conduct toward foreign nation be to instruct we ambassador in pari lord normanby to avoid any act or word which could wear the appearance of a act of interference of any kind in the internal affair of france but on lord normanby report these instruction to the french foreign secretary m guizot he learn to he surprise and perplexity that lord palmerston have interfere already by express to the french ambassador in london m de walewskus he warm approval of the president 's conduct -lrb- 276 -rrb- and lord normanby greatly annoy at be direct to hold one language in pari while the head of he department be take a widely different tone in down street -- a complication which inevitably subject he to misrepresentation and suspicion -- naturally complain to the prime-minister of be place in so embarrassing a situation both the queen and the prime-minister have for some time be discontent at the independent manner in which lord palmerston apparently consider himself entitle to transact the business of he department carry it so far as even to claim a right to send out despatch without give they any intimation of either they contents or they object and the queen in consequence above a year before -lrb- 277 -rrb- have draw up a memorandum in which she express with great distinctness she desire to have every step which the foreign secretary might recommend to be take lay clearly before she with sufficient time for consideration that she might know distinctly to what she have give she royal sanction and to be keep inform of what pass between he and the foreign minister before important decision be take etc etc and after such a intimation of she wish she not unnaturally feel great annoyance at learn that in a transaction so important as this coup d'etat -lrb- to give it the name by which from the first it be describe in every country -rrb- lord palmerston have take upon himself to hold language to the french ambassador in complete contradiction to the line of strict neutrality and passiveness which she have express she desire to see follow with regard to the late convulsion at pari and which be approve by the cabinet -lrb- 278 -rrb- the prime-minister seem to have take the same view of the act and remonstrate with lord palmerston who treat the matter very lightly and justify he right to hold such a conversation which he characterize as unofficial in such a tone and on such grounds that lord john consider he leave he no alternative but to advise the queen to place the foreign office in other hand a careful and generally impartial political critic have recently express a opinion that lord palmerston make good he case -lrb- 279 -rrb- but he argument on the transaction seem to overlook the most material point in it lord palmerston 's own defense of he conduct be that he conversation with walewskus be of a unofficial description that he have say nothing to he which would in any degree or way fetter the action of the government and that if it be to be hold that a secretary of state could never express any opinion to a foreign minister on pass event except as the organ of a previously consult cabinet there would be a end of that easy and familiar intercourse which tend essentially to promote good understanding between minister and government and he even add as a personal justification of himself as against the prime-minister that three day afterward lord john russell himself lord lansdowne -lrb- the president of the council -rrb- and sir charle wood -lrb- the chancellor of the exchequer -rrb- have all discuss the transaction with m de walewskus at a dinner-party and they opinion be if anything rather more strongly favorable than he have be this personal aspect of the case it be impossible to discuss since there be no means of know whether the minister mention would have admit the correctness of this report of they language if it be confess to be accurate it would only show they to have be guilty of equal impropriety and to a great extent justify he as against the prime-minister whose condemnation of he language if he be conscious that he have hold the same himself would be inexplicable but it certainly do not justify he in respect of she majesty or the cabinet collectively since the queen 's complaint be not that he hold unofficial conversation as a private individual and not as the organ of a previously consult cabinet but that the tenor of the conversation which he have hold be in direct contradiction to the tone which the cabinet have decide should be take on the subject that he language be calculate to draw the government into a course of action which it have be deliberately resolve to avoid and in spite of the deference due to lord palmerston 's great experience it be hard to see how a conversation between we foreign secretary and the french ambassador on a action the result of which be as yet undecided can be wholly unofficial in the sense of have no influence on the conduct of affair or as he express it in no degree or way fetter the action of the government the result be as have be mention before that the prime-minister recommend the removal of lord palmerston from he office and that he be remove accordingly and this conclusion of the case seem to show that the statement of the position of the prime-minister in the cabinet be rather understate by mr gladstone in one of he essay -lrb- 280 -rrb- where he say : the head of the british government be not a grand vizier he have no power properly so call over he colleague on the rare occasion when a cabinet determine its course by the vote of its member he vote only count as one of theirs he admit at the same time that they be appoint and dismiss by the sovereign on he advice and surely to have the right of give this advice be to have the greatest possible power over he colleague not power perhaps to change they opinion -lrb- though it possibly at time have have power to prevent the expression of they -rrb- but power to compass they immediate removal from the administration as be exercise in this instance and as have be exercise by pitt with regard to lord thurlow that a difference of opinion even on a important subject be not always regard as a sufficient cause for such a dismissal that a prime-minister especially if conscious of he strength occasionally consent to retain colleague who differ from he on some one subject the same work to which we be partly indebted for we knowledge of the detail of this affair -- the life of the prince consort -- furnish two remarkable instance in which the prime-minister then lord palmerston himself submit to be overrule we read there that on one occasion when count persigny seek the active intervention of england by the way of ` moral support ' to a demand which france propose to address to austria lord palmerston and lord john russell -lrb- then foreign secretary -rrb- be dispose to accede but a different view be take both by she majesty and by the cabinet and count persigny 's request be accordingly decline -lrb- 281 -rrb- on this occasion it be true he be yield to a overwhelming majority of he colleague -lrb- she majesty 's approval must of course have be express subsequently to they decision -rrb- but in another instance we find the same prime-minister consent to the introduction of a bill by one of he colleague mr gladstone then chancellor of the exchequer of which he disapprove so highly that after it have be pass by a very slender majority of the house of common -lrb- 282 -rrb- he express to the queen a hope that the closeness of the division might encourage the house of lord to throw out the bill when it should come to they house and that he be bind in duty to say that if they should do so they would perform a good public service and after they have reject it by a majority of eighty-nine he pronounce that they have do a right and useful thing report to she majesty as a corroboration of this opinion and as a proof that it be largely share by the public out-of-door that the people in the gallery of the house of lord be say to have join in the cheer which break out when the number of the division be announce -lrb- 283 -rrb- and on a third occasion also he bear with the same colleague 's opposition to a measure which he and all the rest of the cabinet justly think of vital importance to the best interest of the country the fortification of we great seaport allow he to object for a time in private and even to threaten public opposition to it the next year since he feel assure that he opposition if carry out which he doubt would be wholly ineffectual -lrb- 284 -rrb- the personal interest in politics which this laudable habit of judge of everything for herself naturally engender in the queen 's mind lead however to the adoption by she majesty in more than one instance of a course at variance not only with all historical precedent but with deference be it say with constitutional principle sanction though it be by more than one ministry when the first napoleon after he elevation to the head of the french government as first consul propose by a autograph letter to george iii to treat with that sovereign for the conclusion of peace between the two nation pitt to whom he majesty communicate the letter have no difficulty in decide that it would be unseasonable for the king to depart from the form long establish in europe for transact business with foreign state -lrb- 285 -rrb- and under he guidance the cabinet instruct lord grenville as foreign secretary to address the reply to the first consul 's letter to the french foreign secretary m de talleyrand but this reign have witness several departure from the old and convenient rule its violation be not begin by she majesty but by the emperor nichola of russium in the year precede the crimean war he write to the queen herself to discuss some of the point in dispute and she answer he letter with she own hand -lrb- 286 -rrb- the outbreak of war which soon ensue prevent any continuation of that correspondence but the close alliance which that war for a time produce between england and france strengthen as it be by a interchange of visit between the royal and imperial family which lead to the establishment of a strong mutual friendliness and regard lead also to a occasional interchange of letter on some of the gravest question affect the policy of the two nation the correspondence be sanction by successive english cabinet every letter which the queen either receive from or send to any foreign prince on political affair be invariably communicate by she either to the prime-minister or to the foreign secretary and they in one instance even suggest to she majesty to write to loui napoleon -lrb- 287 -rrb- with a object so delicate as that of influence the language with which he be about to open he chamber but we must think the line recommend by pitt to george iii both more constitutional and more safe a letter from one sovereign to another on political subject can not be divest of the character of a state-paper and for every state-paper some one must be responsible the sovereign can not be but for every one of he action the minister be and it follow therefore that they be thus make responsible for document of which they have not be the original author of which be it not for the courtesy of the sovereign they might by possibility be wholly ignorant and with part of which even with the knowledge which that courtesy have afford they they may not fully coincide since they could hardly venture to subject a composition of they royal mistress to a vigorous criticism such a correspondence therefore place they so far in a false position and it run the risk of place the sovereign himself in one equally false and unpleasant since if the opinion express or the advice give fail of they effect the adviser be so far lower in the eye of he correspondent and of the world as have be incidentally mention in the spring of 1854 war break out with russium nominally on account of the sultan 's refusal to concede some of the czar 's demand concern the condition of the greek church in palestine but more really because believe the turkish empire to be in the last stage of decay he hope by hasten its destruction to obtain the lion 's share of its spoil and for the first time for two century a english and french army stand together in a field of battle as ally in the field we army be invariably victorious inflict severe defeat on the enemy at alma and inkerman and wrest from they the mighty fortress of sebastopol in the crimea which hitherto they have believe to be absolutely impregnable we fleet be if possible still more triumphant destroy bomarsund and sweaborg in the baltic without the russian ship daring to fire a single gun in they defense while they black sea fleet be even sink by its own admiral as the only expedient to save it from capture and in the spring of 1856 the war be terminate by a treaty of peace in which for the first time since the day of peter the great russium be compel to submit to a cession of territory but -lrb- it may almost be say -rrb- to the credit of the nation these success glorious and substantial as they be make at the time scarcely so great a impression on the people as the hardship which in the first winter of the war we troops suffer from the defective organization of we commissariat want of shelter and want of food prove more destructive than the russian cannon presently we gallant soldier be report to be perish by hundred for lack of common necessaries and the news awaken so clamorous a discontent throughout the whole of the unite kingdom as lead to another change of ministry and lord aberdeen be succeed by lord palmerston while a war on so large a scale be be wage there be but little time to spare for the work of the legislator though it be not foreign to we subject to relate that in 1855 the last of those tax which the political economist denounce as tax on knowledge the tax on newspaper be abolish originally it have be fourpence in 1836 mr spring rice chancellor of the exchequer in lord melbourne 's ministry have reduce it to a penny and now with a very general acquiescence it be abolish altogether the entire abolition of a tax be not properly to be call a financial measure that epithet belong rather to those which aim at a augmentation of revenue by a increase in the number of contributor to a tax while lessen the amount pay by each but the abandonment of the tax in question should rather be regard as a sacrifice of revenue for the instruction of the people in political knowledge a price pay to enable and induce the poorer class to take a well-instructed interest in the affair of the state and the general condition of the country and view in this light the abolition of this tax must be allow to have be a political measure of great importance and to have contribute greatly to the end which be aim at till 1836 a daily paper cost sevenpence be the luxury of the few and the sale even of those which have the largest circulation be necessarily limited but the removal of the tax at once give birth to a host of penny newspaper conduct for the most part with great ability and soon attain a circulation which reach down to all but the very poorest class so that the working-man have now a opportunity of see the most important question of the day discuss from every point of view and of thus acquire information and form a judgment on they which the subsequent extension of the franchise make it more than ever desirable that he should be able to form for himself every movement in that direction render it the more necessary to raise the intelligence of the great mass of the people to a level which may enable they to make a safe and salutary use of the power place in they hand and no mode of implant a wholesome political feeling in the mass can equal candid political discussion : discussion one ruling principle of which shall be to teach that the greatest difference of opinion may be honestly entertain that with scarcely a exception the lead man of each party those who have any title to the name of statesman be animated with a honest patriotic desire to promote the best interest of the nation and that the elucidation of truth be not aid by unreasoning invective and the undeserved imputation of base motive one of the last topic discuss by mr hallam be the introduction of a bill to limit for the future the prerogative of the crown in a field in which its exercise have previously be unrestrained the creation of peer -lrb- 288 -rrb- and among the last which we shall have to examine be one of a exactly opposite character though relate to the same subject the creation of a life peerage in the winter of 1855 sir jame parke one of the baron of the exchequer be create lord wenslydale by letters-patent which confer the title limit it also to the new peer 's own life the profess object of the measure be to strengthen the judicial power of the house of lord but it be not deny that the limitation of the peerage confer on he for he own life -lrb- a limitation which make no practical difference to sir jame himself since he have no child -rrb- be intend to raise the question whether the crown could or could not create a life peerage with a seat in the house of lord a creation so limited be so novel or at all event so long disuse a proceeding that it inevitably provoke examination and discussion and as it be find that the lawyer in general regard it as indefensible at the beginning of the session of 1856 lord lyndhurst bring the matter before the house of lord by a motion for the appointment of a committee of privilege to investigate and report upon it there be two aspect of the case which naturally come to be consider in the debate on it which ensue : the advantage or disadvantage in other word the political expediency of such a form of letters-patent and they legal or constitutional propriety it be of course with the latter alone that the committee of privilege have to deal and this part of the question be examine with great legal and antiquarian learning though as be almost inevitable it be argue as a party question except indeed by the lawyer they with the exception of the chancellor lord cranworth who have advise the measure be unanimous in they condemnation of it the whig peer lord brougham and lord campbell then chief-justice be as positive in they denial of the right so to exercise the prerogative as those on the opposition side of the house lord lyndhurst or lord st leonard -lrb- 289 -rrb- the argument against the measure be chiefly these : the objector draw a distinction between what be legal accord to the strict letter of the law and what be constitutional contend that there might be exercise of the prerogative which could not be affirm to be illegal but which no one would deny to be altogether inconsistent with the principle and practice of the constitution since a great part of the constitution rest on unwritten law on long-continued usage _ lex et consuetudo parliamenti _ and they affirm that this measure be so oppose to that usage that no instance have occur within a period of four hundred year in which a commoner have be raise to a seat in the house of lord by a patent of peerage contain only a estate for life -lrb- 290 -rrb- one most essential if not the most essential character of the peerage be that it be a hereditary dignity and one which combine with its rank a hereditary seat in the house of lord that one or two instance of life peerage be to be find in the annals of the plantagenet king be not deny though none exactly similar in character -lrb- 291 -rrb- but lord lyndhurst argue that precedent which have occur at a time when the constitution of the country be neither understand nor fully form be entitle to but little respect and lord derby limit the age of valid precedent a little more strictly say frankly that he have no respect for any precedent affect the prerogative of the crown that date farther back than the year 1688 and since that time or indeed since the time of henry viii it be certain that no life peerage have ever be grant except by charle ii jame ii and george i and ii to some of they mistress instance wholly beside the present case since of course none of those lady could claim seat in the house of lord indeed it be believe that both mr pitt at the time of the union and lord gray in 1832 have consider the question and have both decide against the propriety of advise a creation of life peerage in defense of the measure lord granville refuse to admit the distinction between what be legal and what be constitutional if a measure be both legal that be warrant by the letter of the law and also expedient these two concurrent quality he contend make it constitutional he deny also that any legal prerogative of the crown could be hold to have lapse through disuse _ nullum tempus occurrit regus _ and he challenge any peer to assert that the sovereign have lose the right of refuse he royal assent to a measure pass by the two house merely because no sovereign since william iii have so exercise he royal prerogative and against the authority of mr pitt and lord gray he quote that of lord john russell who in 1851 have offer a life peerage to a eminent judge who though he have decline the offer have be influence in he refusal by no doubt of the right of the crown to make it on the expediency of the measure its opponent have urge that it would effect a remodelling of the house of peer a total change of its constitution by the introduction of a second and distinct class of peerage and lord campbell with a not unbecoming jealousy for what he regard as the interest of he brother lawyer argue that it would henceforth prevent any lawyer however eminent he might have be as a advocate whatever service he might have render to the state in the house of common whatever fame or fortune he might have acquire from aspire to a hereditary peerage or to become the founder of a family since to make a distinction between the chancellor and the chief-justice between one chancellor or chief-justice and another when come into the upper house as to the tenure of they honor would be intolerable all must be under the same rule ` no son of theirs succeed ' and lord lyndhurst close he argument by draw a comparison between the house of lord and the french senate : it be but a few week since he have read a official comment in the _ moniteur _ come from the highest source on the inefficiency the want of patriotism energy and the backwardness to fulfil the high destiny to which they be call that characterize that illustrious body the senate of france he have no disposition to cut down we tribunal to that life interest on which the senate of france be base as he believe the hereditary character of the house of lord to be one from which great and important advantage be derive the hereditary principle he add be intwine in every part of we constitution we in this house enjoy we hereditary rights in common with the crown we mutually support and assist each other and we form a barrier and defense to protect both those branch of the constitution against any by whom they may be assail as lord granville have make the expediency of any measure the quality which combine with legality be sufficient to establish its constitutional character he naturally labor this point with especial diligence he dwell upon the great importance of strengthen the judicial element in the house since it be the great ultimate court of appeal he produce a letter of the great chancellor lord eldon which quote instance in which various administration have find difficulty in the way of introduce eminent lawyer into the house because they want of adequate fortune to support the rank have disincline they to encumber they descendant with a hereditary peerage he show also that that difficulty have make so great a impression on they own chairman of committee lord redesdale that on one occasion he have intimate a feeling in favor of allow the law in the same way as the church to be to a certain extent represent in the house by the holder of certain office who should be admit to that house as peer of parliament during the continuance of hold such office -lrb- to which argument earl gray add another that the instance of bishop who be but life peer prove that the holder of life peerage be not consider inferior to hereditary peer -rrb- he dwell too on the evil consequence of the lord place themselves before the country as seek to limit the prerogative of the crown when that prerogative be exercise with a view to remedy something that be weak and to remove a certain imminent danger what the danger be he certainly do not explain but lord gray in support he take wider ground and apply the argument derive from lord eldon 's letter to other profession extol the idea of institute life peerage as one whose effect would be more easily to open the door of the house to man whom it be desirable should be admit -- to distinguish officer to eminent writer to member of the house of common who in they different line might have render good service to the state but who though possess means amply sufficient to support they rank during they own life yet from have only a life income or a numerous family to be provide for might be unable to accept a hereditary peerage without injury to they family in such instance he contend it would be most desirable to grant peerage for life only such a proceeding would he be convince by no means disincline other in different circumstance to accept hereditary title nor indispose the ministry to confer they nor do he see any reason for fear that the practice of create life peerage would be more likely to be abuse for the purpose of increase the power of the minister than the creation of hereditary peerage the committee of privilege be appoint and report it as the opinion of the member that neither the letters-patent by themselves or with the addition of the usual writ of summons could entitle the grantee to sit and vote in parliament and the house by a majority of ninety-two to fifty-seven adopt they report the minister yield to its judgment and ennoble lord wenslydale by a new patent in the usual form as lord derby have suggest but lord derby desire to show that he objection have be found on principle only and as he be willing to admit that apart from the principle involve some advantage in certain case and under certain modification might arise from peerage for life he propose the appointment of a select committee to consider the expediency of make provision for the more efficient discharge of the duty of the house as a court of appeal the committee be appoint and after careful consideration recommend the creation of two new office to be hold by two law lord as deputy speaker of the house of lord who should be judge of at least five year ' standing and should be enable by authority of parliament to sit and vote in the house and enjoy all the rights and privilege of a peer of parliament under a patent confer a peerage for life only if the crown may have grant or shall grant the same to such person in preference to a hereditary peerage provide always that not more than four person shall have seat in the house at one time as peer for life such a arrangement would have introduce a new practice but not a new principle since the annexation of a seat in the house of lord to certain office have exist from time immemorial in the case of the bishop and the bill be carry in the house of lord but defeat in the common by a motion to refer it to a committee which be adopt by a small majority in a not very full house -lrb- 292 -rrb- toward the end of the session those who look at the question apart from all preference of one minister or one party to another will probably be of opinion that the decision of the committee that a life peerage thus create by the crown could not confer a seat in parliament be conformable to the most legitimate view of the constitution it be indeed matter of history that in the middle age the crown have exercise its prerogative in many way which it have since abandon borough have be enfranchise and again disfranchise apparently from no motive but pure caprice writ of summons have be withhold from peer -lrb- 293 -rrb- but no one would have justify the repetition of such act now and common-sense as well as recognize usage favor the doctrine that long disuse be a sufficient and lawful barrier against they revival that the power of confer life peerage with a seat in parliament -- of which perhaps the only undeniable instance be the case of the brother of henry v whose royal blood would in those day probably have be hold to warrant a exception in they favor -- have not be exercise for full four hundred year be admit and the assumption that so long a disuse of a power be tantamount to a tacit renunciation of it be quite compatible with a loyal and due zeal for the maintenance of other part of the prerogative which have suffer no such abatement if however we consider the expediency of the measure or in other word the possible advantage that might ensue from the existence of a power to create life peerage with a seat in parliament opinion will probably be more divide we have see that lord derby allow that there might be advantage in such a exercise of power under certain limitation and the exist system do undoubtedly appear open to improvement in certain case at present the only mode of rewarding naval or military commander who have perform brilliant and useful service or a speaker of the house of common whose public career though less showy and glorious may at time have be scarcely less valuable and have certainly be by far more irksome be the grant of a peerage with a pension for life without the peerage they can not have the pension -lrb- 294 -rrb- and consequently many most distinguished officer whose conspicuous merit well deserve conspicuous honor have go unrewarded except by some promotion of knighthood which carry with it no substantial benefit while the descendant of some of those who have be ennoble have openly lament that the only mode which could be find of honor they father prove a punishment to they heir by encumber they with a empty title which they be unable adequately to support and practically close against they avenue to possible wealth and distinction which custom pronounce derogatory to they rank so not to mention the name of live worthy no reward could be find for sir w parker that brave and skilful seaman who conduct a british fleet two hundred mile up a chinese river and crown he exploit by the capture of a mighty city which have never before behold a european flag nor for ingli who when the safety of we indian empire hang upon he gallantry successfully sustain a siege whose hardship and danger be surpass by none in ancient or modern history many will probably be of opinion that it be not for the honor of england that such service should want due recognition and that for man like those life peerage with liberal pension would be a appropriate recompense it would of course be impossible to limit the number of they beforehand but it would also be needless since the nature of the service by which alone they could be deserve would act of itself as a sufficient limitation one of the expedient which have be mention in this discussion have be the annexation of peerage to certain office to which it have be regard as a unanswerable objection that this would be the creation of a absolutely unheard-of tenure the peer thus create be able at pleasure to lay down he peerage or even it might be be removable but before the end of the session a emergency arise which induce parliament to sanction the principle novel though it be that a official peerage if a bishopric may be so call might be lay down with the sanction of parliament when the holder be no longer able to discharge its duty two of the most eminent member of the episcopal bench dr blomfield bishop of london and dr maltby bishop of durham have become wholly incapable of discharge they duty the one have be strike down by paralysis and the other be almost blind and they now propose to the prime-minister that he should make some arrangement by which they might be allow to relinquish they office retain a certain portion of the income of they see as a retire pension there be no precedent for such a arrangement but the necessity of the two case be so manifest the injury which the church must suffer if the superintendence of two such important diocese be to be neglect be so palpable and the condition of the retire pension ask be so moderate and equitable that lord palmerston have no hesitation in sanction the introduction of a bill to give effect to the arrangement propose it do not pass without vigorous resistance from more than one quarter the bishop of exeter complain of it as incompatible with the great church principle that a bishop could only resign he office to the archbishop of he province other oppose it as a violation of the common law which forbid any bargain be make for the resignation of a office while some refer to the prohibition of simony -lrb- a word perhaps as much misunderstand and as often misapply as any in the language -rrb- denounce the arrangement that the retire prelate be to have pension as simoniacal -lrb- 295 -rrb- the most reasonable objection make to the proceeding be that such exceptional legislation to meet a isolate case tend to establish a dangerous precedent and that as there be other man of great age on the bench it would be better to effect the end now aim at by a large general measure provide means for the retirement of all clergyman those of inferior rank as well as bishop whom age or infirmity might incapacitate but the general feeling be against delay the bill pass and serve in some degree as a model for that general measure which be soon afterward introduce and which as be suggest on this occasion provide for a arrangement similar in principle be carry out whenever a priest hold any kind of ecclesiastical preferment should become disabled for the performance of its duty there can be no doubt that such legislation be absolutely necessary in the interest of the church take that expression to include not the clergy alone but the whole congregation of churchman but it introduce a remarkable change into the system of ecclesiastical peerage and so far into the constitution of the house of lord what be resign by the two prelate be not the peerage -lrb- they have still the right to be style my lord -rrb- but the seat in the house of lord which be a part and which have hitherto be regard as a inseparable part of it or at least -lrb- as it should perhaps rather be say since the recent regulation that the junior bishop should not have a seat be a clear violation of that principle -rrb- which hitherto no one have be able to dissociate from the peerage after it have be once enjoy the treaty which terminate the war with russium be not conclude till the spring of 1856 and it be well indeed that the country have no longer a foreign war on she hand for a twelvemonth have scarcely elapse when the very continuation of she existence as a great eastern power be suddenly imperil by what regard in one aspect be a mutiny of she troops on a most extensive scale in another a civil war wage by a combination of native prince hindoo as well as mohammedan -lrb- 296 -rrb- for the total extinction of we power and the expulsion of the british race from bengal as early as the first week of February several commander of regiment and other authority receive warning of the organization of a wide conspiracy against we power and in the second week of may the troops at meerut break into open mutiny set fire to the public building murder they officer and even they wife and child and then march off to delhi where the garrison be prepare to receive they with open arm and to imitate they atrocity the contagion spread and in a few week nearly all bengal be in arm in one or two instance the native chief stand by we but the greater number join the insurgent some from the desire to throw off we yoke but other probably from constraint and through fear whatever be they motive before the end of June nearly all the principal city and fortress of bengal up to the very gate of calcutta be in the hand of the insurgent the chief exception be at the great city of lucknow where though the mutineer get possession of the city a british garrison hold the residency in the center and maintain themselves with heroic fortitude unsurpassed in all the history of war for nearly nine month contribute more than any other body of man to the final suppression of the revolt it would be beside we purpose here to dwell upon the great deed by which in that terrible year we army in all its branch maintain its old renown upon the recapture of delhus the deliverance of the incomparable defender and preserver of lucknow the exploit of lawrence and ingli and havelock and outram and peel and campbell and if we be force to deny ourselves the proud gratification of dwelling on they combined heroism and wisdom we may for the same reason be spare the pain of recount the horrid cruelty wreak in too many instance not only on the officer who fall into the rebel ' hand and on the civil magistrate but on the helpless woman and child in the first excitement of fear and horror those cruelty be no doubt greatly exaggerate but still enough remains prove to stamp the insurrection as one brand with the foulest disgrace the race which perpetrate and exult in they it be not till the last week of 1858 that the last spark of rebellion be finally extinguish by the defeat in oude of the last body of rebel who remain in arm and the flight of the remnant of they force across the frontier of nepaul but even before that day come the ministry at home have be lead to see the necessity of put the government of the country for the future on a different footing it could hardly be doubt that the prompt suppression of a revolt of so unprecedented a magnitude and the proof give in the course of we operation that the british soldier still maintain the same superiority over the native trooper as in the day of clive have heighten we reputation and the belief of we power among the native tribe but speedily and decisively crushed though it have be the revolt have give too terrible a proof of the inconstancy and treachery of the native tribe not to act as a warn to we statesman and the reflection that be thus force upon they show that a company of merchant however distinguish by general courage and sagacity they have show themselves be no longer qualify to exercise imperial dominion over a territory which now extend over more than a million of square mile and more than a hundred and fifty million of native subject accordingly in the first week of the session of 1858 lord palmerston as prime-minister introduce a bill to transfer the government of british indium from the east indium company to the crown it be natural that the principle of such a measure should be oppose by the director of the company though it be support by more than one person who have hold high civil office in indium and equally natural that the arrangement of its detail should call forth a minute and rigorous examination and on many point a very determine opposition we need not however say more about this bill since circumstance prevent its be proceed with and the history of those which succeed it be now only worth refer to as show the extreme difficulty of the task of frame a government on new principle for a dependency of such vast magnitude and importance -lrb- 297 -rrb- lord palmerston 's bill be drop in consequence of the fall of he ministry before the time come for its second reading but the discussion on it have to some extent smooth the way for that of he successor lord derby a great impression on the parliament and on the country in general have be make by a very able speech of sir gc lewi chancellor of the exchequer he trace the whole history of the indian government from the day of plassy and substantiate the right of the home government and parliament to remodel it as they might judge best by prove that ever since the passing of pitt 's first bill in 1784 the company have be constantly subject to parliamentary control he show too most convincingly that a petition which the company have present to the house of common deprecate any change in the exist system which should tend to diminish the authority of the director be base on one great fallacy -- speak as it do of the company as one and indivisible and unchanged in character function and influence down to the date of the last renewal of its charter only five year previously whereas the truth be that in the one hundred year since plassy the system have undergo as many change as the english constitution between the heptarchy and the reign of queen victorium he have thus remove some of the obstacle out of the way of the measure of the new government though lord derby would have prefer postpone it till tranquillity should have be restore to the country by the complete suppression of the revolt have not the large majority -lrb- 298 -rrb- which have sanction the introduction of lord palmerston 's bill in he opinion place the company in such a situation that they could no longer command the same amount of public confidence and public support as they be entitle to receive previously to that vote of the house of common it may be add that the first bill on the subject which be introduce by he government bear evident mark of the difficulty under which it be frame -- difficulty exist from the unexpected suddenness of he accession to office so that after a not very short discussion it be eventually withdraw and it be not till the end of June that the measure which be finally adopt be introduce the lead enactment of the measure -lrb- 299 -rrb- provide that for the future the government of indium describe as have be hitherto vest in or exercise by the company in trust for she majesty should be vest in she majesty and exercise in she name that one of she majesty 's principal secretary of state should have and perform all such power and duty relate to the government or revenue of indium as have formerly belong to the court of director as the court of proprietor of the company that a council of the governor-general should be establish consist of fifteen member seven of whom should be appoint by the court of director be person who be or have formerly be director of the company and eight should be nominate by the crown and as to both class it be provide that the majority should consist of person who have serve or reside in indium for ten year at the least and should not have leave india more than ten year when appoint they be to hold they office during good behavior to receive salary and to be entitle to retire pension but to be incapable of sit in parliament the appointment of governor-general and governor of each presidency be to belong to the crown the expenditure of the revenue of indium both in indium and elsewhere be to be subject to the control of the secretary of state in council other clause provide for the dividend of the company for the admission of person into the civil service and with reference to exist establishment one clause provide that the indian military and naval force should remain under exist condition of service this last clause be strongly object to by the queen -lrb- 300 -rrb- as inconsistent with she constitutional position as head of the army which require that the commander-in-chief should be put in communication with the new secretary of state for indium in the same manner in which he be place with regard to the troops at home or in the colony toward the secretary of state for war with regard to the whole army whether english or indian there could with due regard to the public interest be only one head and one general command she yield she opinion however to the resolute objection of the prime-minister with whom on this point he predecessor -lrb- 301 -rrb- lord palmerston agree but the result prove the superior soundness of she majesty 's view it be not only a most anomalous arrangement since the supreme control of all the warlike force be one of the most inalienable prerogative of the crown but it have the strange fault of preserve the double government in the case in which above all other unity of system and unity of command be most indispensable and what weigh more than either consideration with the generally practical view of english statesman it be from the begin find to work badly create as it do great and mischievous jealousy between the two division the royal and the indian army it be find that all the general then in the highest command in indium -- lord clyde -lrb- sir colin campbell have be ennoble by that title -rrb- sir hugh rise and sir william mansfield -- strongly disapprove of it and recommend a change and consequently in the summer of 1860 lord palmerston who in the mean while have return to the treasury come round to the queen 's view of the subject and a new act be pass which amalgamate the two army into one imperial army take its turn of duty throughout all part of the british empire -lrb- 302 -rrb- a letter address by lord palmerston to the queen in the autumn of 1857 which appear to have be he first statement to she majesty of the opinion which he have form of the necessity of abolish the govern authority of the company state the principal argument in favor of such a measure with great clearness as arise from the inconvenience and difficulty of administer the government of a vast country on the other side of the globe by means of two cabinet the one responsible to the crown and parliament the other only responsible to the holder of indian stock meeting for a few hour three or four time a year which have be show by the event of the year to be no longer tolerable he disapproval of part of lord ellenborough 's policy probably prevent he from allude to he recall from indium by the director in direct defiance of the opinion of the government -lrb- 303 -rrb- though that strange step can hardly have be absent from he mind but in fact the case for take the whole rule of so vast a dominion wholly into the hand of the queen 's government at home be so irresistible that it do not require to be strengthen by reference to any individual instance of inconvenience when the double government be originally establish the english in indium be still but a small mercantile community with very little territory beyond that in the immediate neighborhood of its three chief city of the conduct of the affair of such a body still almost confine to commerce the chief share might not unreasonably be leave to the merchant themselves subject to such supervision on the part of the government at home as be imply in the very name of the department invest with that supervision the board of control which as pitt explain the name be mean to show that it be not to be like the measure propose by the coalition ministry a board of political influence -lrb- 304 -rrb- but the case be wholly alter when british indium reach from point de galle to the himalaya and spread beyond the gange on the east to beyond the indus on the west when the policy adopt in indium often influence we dealings with european state and when the force require for the protection of those vast interest exceed the number of the royal army indium too be a country the climate of which prevent we countryman from emigrate to it as settler as they do to canada or australium and where consequently the english resident be and always must be a mere handful in comparison with the million of native in such a case they government must at all time rest mainly on opinion on the belief in the pre-eminent power of the ruler and it be obvious that that belief would be greatly fortify by the sovereign of britain become that ruler -lrb- 305 -rrb- the great raja cordially recognize the value of the transfer of power consider in this light and feel they own dignity enhance by become the vassal of the sovereign herself turn to french affair a brilliant french writer have remark that he countryman be of all people the least suit to be conspirator since none of they can ever keep a secret but it be the ill-fortune of loui napoleon that he have provoke enmity not only among he own countryman but among the republican fanatic of other nation also who see in he zeal for absolute authority the greatest obstacle to they design which aim at the overthrow of every established government on the continent and shrink from no crime which they conceive to be calculate to promote they object to free themselves from such a antagonist the most wholesale murder seem by no means too large a price and in the middle of January as the emperor and empress be go to the opera a prodigious explosion take place almost beneath the wheel of they carriage from the effect of which they themselves have a most narrow escape both be strike in the face by splinter the aide-de-camp in they carriage also be severely wound on the head while they escort and attendant be strike down on all side ten be kill and above one hundred and fifty wound -lrb- 306 -rrb- it be soon find out that the author of this atrocious crime be four italian of whom a man name orsinus be the chief and that he who have but recently escape from a prison in mantua have flee from that town to england and have there concoct all the detail of he plot and have procure the shell which have be he instrument it be not unnatural that so atrocious a crime cause such wide-spread destruction should awaken great excitement in france and in many quarter violent reclamation against england and she law which enable foreign plotter to make she a starting-place for they nefarious scheme even in the french chamber very bitter language be use on the subject by some of the most influential deputy for which we minister be dispose to make allowance lord clarendon the foreign secretary write to the prince consort that it be not to be expect that foreigner who see that assassin go and come here as they please and that conspiracy may be hatch in england with impunity should think we law and policy friendly to other country or appreciate the extreme difficulty of make any change in we system -lrb- 307 -rrb- but a different feeling be rouse by a despatch of the french secretary of state to the ambassador here which seem to impute to this country that it deliberately sheltered and countenanced man by whose writings assassination be elevated into a doctrine openly preach and carry into practice by reiterate attack upon the person of the french sovereign and ask in language which have rather a imperious tone ought the english legislature to contribute to the design of man who be not mere fugitive but assassin and continue to shelter person who place themselves beyond the pale of common right and under the ban of humanity she britannic majesty 's government can assist we in avert a repetition of such guilty enterprise by afford we a guarantee of security which no state can refuse to a neighboring state and which we be justified in expect from a ally fully rely moreover on the profound sagacity of the english cabinet we refrain from indicate in any way the measure which it may seem fit to take in order to comply with this wish we confidently leave it to decide on the course which it shall deem best fit to the end in view still though the charge that we legislature contribute to the design of assassin be some departure from the measure language more usual in diplomatic communication between friendly power under the circumstance this remonstrance might have be bear with unluckily it be not all nor the worst that we be call upon to bear a few day afterward some address to the emperor from different military corps be publish in the _ moniteur _ which not only pour forth bitter reproach against the whole english nation but demand to be lead to a invasion of the country as a infamous haunt for the carry out of infernal machination political address seem to we idea inconsistent with military discipline but the army have be permit and even encourage to make they ever since the day of the consulate though such address never receive the recognition of a publication in the official journal till they have be subject to careful revision and if necessary expurgation on this occasion however that supervision have be carelessly perform and the offensive passage be leave stand though when the emperor learn the indignation which they have excite even among he well-wisher in england he instruct he ambassador to apologize for they retention and publication as a act of inadvertence on the part of the official whose duty it have be to revise such document so far all be well and have the english minister reply to the despatch of m de persigny in firm and temperate language they would have escape the difficulty which eventually overthrow they there be no doubt that accord to diplomatic usage a write despatch formally communicate to the secretary of state require a written reply unfortunately a written reply be not give lord clarendon be too apprehensive of the mischief which might possibly arise from a protracted discussion lead perhaps to a angry controversy and under the influence of this feeling contented himself when the despatch be present with give the ambassador a verbal answer that no consideration on earth would induce parliament to pass a measure for the extradition of foreign political refugee that we asylum could not be infringe and that we adhere to certain principle on that subject which be so old and so sacred that they could not be touch -lrb- 308 -rrb- add however at the same time a assurance that the attorney-general be already at he request examine we law of conspiracy to see whether it be sufficiently comprehensive or stringent the purport of this answer be all that could have be desire but there be a very general impression that the omission to reply by a write despatch be a sacrifice of the national dignity if not a unworthy submission to scarcely disguise menace though at the same time there be also a feeling among both party in parliament that we law with respect to the conduct of foreigner reside among we be perhaps susceptible of improvement on the very first night of the session in allusion to the attack on the french emperor lord derby have say that he could wish to hear the opinion of the minister whether the exist law of this country be adequate to afford security for the life of foreign prince against plot contrived in this country and if they be not whether they might not be amend so as to meet the case of such crime as have recently be perpetrate which be so heinous and revolting to every feeling of humanity and even before that speech the minister have apply themselves to frame a measure to amend the law which in the second week of February the prime-minister himself introduce to the house of common it be read a first time though not without some opposition but before it arrive at the second reading though only a week afterward the feeling of the country reflect in this instance by the house have become so inflamed that the measure be not discuss on its own merit but on the point whether since no other answer have be give to the french despatch this must not be regard as the ministerial answer and therefore whether it be such a answer as it befit england to send have it be examine on its own merit solely it could hardly have provoke much adverse criticism it be entitle a bill to amend the law with relation to the crime of conspiracy to commit murder and it merely propose to establish in england a law which have long exist in ireland hitherto as lord palmerston explain the matter england have treat conspiracy to murder as a misdemeanor punishable with fine and imprisonment in ireland it have long be a capital crime and though he do not propose to assimilate the english to the irish statute in all its severity he propose to enact that conspiracy to murder should be a felony punishable with penal servitude by whomsoever the conspiracy might be concoct or wherever the crime might be design to be commit the principle of such a law support as it be by the precedent of ireland could hardly be resist and mr walpole who have be home-secretary in lord derby 's ministry avow he determination to support the bill as be right in principle but even he limit he promise of support by a condition that the honor of england should be previously vindicate argue that the french despatch bear the character of a demand base upon allegation which be contrary to truth and which therefore the minister be bind to repudiate and that to pass such a bill without put on record a formal denial of those allegation would in the general view of europe imply a confession that to they we have no answer to give and it be this consideration which eventually determine the decision of the house mr disraelus who close the debate on he side condemn the conduct of the minister as perplexed timid confused want in dignity and self-respect in not reply to the despatch they have lose a great opportunity of assert the principle of public law the house take he view of they conduct throw out the bill by a majority of nineteen -lrb- 309 -rrb- and the ministry resign and be succeed by one under the presidency of lord derby many of those who on this occasion combine to form the majority have denounce the bill as a infringement of the principle of we constitution it be however evident that have it pass it would not have deserve such a description it would in no degree whatever have deprive a foreign resident of safety and the protection of english law so long as he should obey that law and that be all the indulgence that the constitution ever give or ought to give foreigner have always be amenable to we court of justice for any violation of the law and lord palmerston 's bill not only go no farther than remove a certain class of offence from the category of misdemeanor to that of felony but it also impose no liability in that respect on foreigner which it do not at the same time impose on all the queen 's subject indeed the bill be so moderate and the improvement it propose so desirable that in a subsequent discussion in the house of lord lord campbell the chief-justice express a hope that lord derby 's government would take it up though lord derby in view of the exist feeling of the country on the subject prudently forbore to act on that suggestion but as one of orsinus 's most guilty accomplice a man name bernard be still in london he cause he to be indict for murder as have incur that guilt as accessary to the death of some whom the explosion have kill the excitement on the question have however not die away when the trial come on and though it will probably be generally admit that the evidence be sufficiently clear bernard be acquit lord derby however do not long retain he office indeed the earl be so conscious that on question of general policy the house of common be incline to view differ from he own that he would have prefer decline the task of form a ministry have he not conceive that in the difficulty in which the queen be place by recent circumstance he be bind by he duty to make the attempt even if the result of it be merely to obtain a kind of respite for he sovereign and the country which might give time for the present excitement of feel to calm down he be not deceive in he foreboding of he inability to maintain he position in the course of the next spring he be twice defeat in the house of common -- once by the house which he find in existence and a second time in one which be the fruit of a general election and in the summer of 1859 lord palmerston return to office with power increase by the junction of many of those who have help to overthrow he in 1858 but who now combine with he to strike a similar blow at he conservative successor yet brief as be lord derby 's tenure of power it be make memorable by the commencement of a movement which can not be regard as devoid of constitutional importance since though originally it be only design to supply a temporary re-enforcement to we ancient constitutional force the regular army and the militia it have eventually create a force which to the great honor of those who constitute it have become a permanent addition to they in the great war against revolutionary france when it be generally believe that those who hold rule in pari be contemplate a invasion of these island pitt as we have see have encourage the formation of corps of volunteer which continue to be of great use till the very end of the war by perform in conjunction with the militia a great portion of the home duty which must otherwise have fall on the line regiment and thus disengage the regular army for service on the continent there be now no such formidable enemy to be dread as the first napoleon but in every part of europe affair be in a state so unquiet that every kingdom seem at time on the very brink of war and since if it should once break out no one could feel confident that we should not be involve in it or if we should be who would be we ally or we enemy measure of precaution and self-defence seem as needful now as they have be sixty year before we boldest statesman be disquiet and anxious and the nation at large share they uneasiness kindle with the feeling that it be a time to show that the present generation inherit the self-denying patriotism of they father leader be not want again to prompt the formation of a volunteer force the government at once see the value of the scheme fortunately the secretary for war colonel peel happen to be a old soldier a veteran who have learn the art of war under wellington himself and he have great talent for organization place the force from its infancy on a sound footing how thoroughly the movement harmonize with the martial spirit of the nation -- to which indeed it owe its birth -- be show by the history of the force which now above twenty year after its original formation maintain its full number and yearly improve its efficiency though there have not for many year be any apprehension of war above one hundred and twenty thousand man still annually devote no small portion of they time to the acquisition of military discipline and science and that so successfully that by the testimony of the most experienced judge they have attain a degree of efficiency which if the necessity for they service should ever arise would render they valuable and worthy comrade to the more regularly train army lord derby retire from office while the force be still in its infancy but lord palmerston be equally sensible of its value and give a farther proof of he appreciation of the vast importance of measure of national defense by the vigor with which he carry out the recommendation of a royal commission which have be appoint by the precede ministry to investigate the condition of we national defence its report have point out the absolute necessity of a improved system of protection for we great dockyard and arsenal which from they position on the coast be more liable to attack than inland fortress would have be have we have such and in accordance with that warning in the summer of 1860 lord palmerston propose the grant of a large sum of money for the fortification of we chief dockyard it be oppose on a strange variety of grounds some argue that the propose fortification be superfluous because we navy be the defense to which the nation be wont deservedly to trust some that they be needless because no other nation be in a condition to attack we other that they be disgraceful because it be un-english and mean to skulk behind stone wall and because lycurgus have refuse to trust to stone wall for the safety of sparta and one member the chief spokesman of a new and small party commonly know as the peace-at-any-price party boldly denounce the member of the commission as a set of lunatic for frame such a report and the minister as guilty of contemptible cowardice for suggest to the nation that there be any danger in be undefended but the ministry prevail by a large majority -lrb- 310 -rrb- the money be vote and the nation in general warmly approve of the measure as lord palmerston subsequently express it the government the parliament and the nation act in harmonious concert -lrb- 311 -rrb- on the subject one of the argument against it which the objector have bring forward be that the ministry be not unanimous in the conviction of the necessity and we learn from the life of the prince consort -lrb- 312 -rrb- that mr gladstone the chancellor of the exchequer be vehement in he resistance to it threaten even to carry he opposition so far as to resign he office if it be persevere in and as have be intimate on a previous page this be not the only question on which in the course of this year the prime-minister do in he heart differ from he chancellor of the exchequer though he do not think it expedient to refuse he sanction to he proposal on a matter belong to he own department the exchequer the subject on which he secretly doubt he colleague 's judgment be one of the proposal make in the budget of the year as have already be mention the transaction throw a rather curious light on the occasional working of we ministerial system and the fate of the measure in the two house of parliament be also deserving of remark and recollection as re-open the question which have not be agitate for nearly a century as to the extent of the power of the house of lord with respect to vote of money in a former chapter -lrb- 313 -rrb- we have have occasion to mention the angry feeling on the part of the house of common which in the year 1772 have be evoke by the act of the house of lord in make some amendment on a bill relate to the exportation of corn which have come up to they from the common a somewhat similar act have as we have also see revive the discussion a few year later when the minister of the day have show a more temperate feeling on the subject on neither occasion however have the question of the privilege of the lord be definitively settle and no occasion have since arise for any consideration of the subject but the budget of 1860 contain a clause which in spite of the deserve reputation of the chancellor of the exchequer as a skilful financier be not regard with general favor there be a large deficiency in the revenue for the year but while among he expedient for meet it mr gladstone propose a augmentation of the income-tax he propose also to repeal the excise duty on paper which produce about a million and a quarter it be now know that the prime-minister himself highly disapprove of the sacrifice at such a time of so productive a tax -lrb- 314 -rrb- and if that have be suspect at the time the house of common would certainly not have consent to it even when the ministry be suppose to be unanimous in its approval of it it be only carry by a majority of nine and when the bill embody it come before the house of lord a whig peer who have himself be formerly chancellor of the exchequer in lord melbourne 's administration move its rejection and it be reject by a majority of eighty-nine the rejection of a measure relate to taxation cause great excitement among a large party in the house of common -- so violent indeed that the only expedient that present itself to the prime-minister if he would prevent the proposal of some step of a extreme and mischievous character be to take the matter into he own hand have he be able to act entirely on he own judgment it may perhaps be think that with he sentiment on the inexpediency of the measure which have be reject he would have prefer a silent acquiescence in the vote of the lord but he would have be quite unable to induce the majority of he own supporter and even some of he own colleague to adopt so moderate a course and accordingly he move the appointment of a committee to examine and report on the practice of parliament in regard to bill for impose or repeal tax and when it have make its report which be purely of a historical character set forth the precedent bear on the subject he propose three resolution assert that the right of grant aid and supplies to the crown be in the common alone as a essential part of they constitution etc that although the lord have exercise the power of reject bill of several description relate to taxation by negative the whole yet the exercise of that power by they have not be frequent and be justly regard by the common with peculiar jealousy as affect they rights etc and that to guard for the future against a undue exercise of that power by the lord and to secure to the common they rightful control over taxation and supply the common have it in they power so to impose and remit tax and to frame bill of supply that they right etc might be maintain inviolate in the debate which ensue he chief opponent come from he own party and even he own colleague the chancellor of the exchequer display a fundamental difference of feeling from he on the subject a difference which be express by one of the most eloquent supporter of the resolution mr horsman mp for stroud say that lord palmerston wish to make the independence of the house of lord a reality while mr gladstone seem to desire that it should be a fiction lord palmerston indeed show the feeling thus attribute to he in a statesman-like declaration that if this nation have enjoy a greater amount of civil political social and religious liberty than as he believe any other people in the world that result have be accomplish not by vest in either of the three estate the crown the lord or the common exclusive or overrule power over the other but by maintain for each its own separate and independent authority and also by the three power combine together to bear and forbear endeavoring by harmonious concert with each other to avoid those conflict and clashing which must have arise if independent authority and independent action have be exert by each or by all he enter into the history of the question explain that though each branch of the legislature retain its respective power of reject any measure the common have claim from time immemorial particular privilege in regard to particular measure and especially the exclusive right of determine matter connect with the taxation of the people they claim for themselves and deny to the lord the right of originate alter or amend such measure but as long ago as 1671 the attorney-general in a memorable conference between the two house have admit that the lord though they could not originate or amend have nevertheless power to reject money-bill and this admission he regard as consistent with common-sense for it be well know that though the common contend for the right of originate measure for the grant of supply and of frame bill with that object accord to they belief of what be best for the public interest yet such bill could not pass into law without the assent of the lord and it be clear that a authority whose assent be necessary to give a proposal the force of law must by the very nature of thing be at liberty to dissent and refuse its sanction the committee have enumerate a large number of precedent -lrb- above thirty -rrb- in which since that conference the lord have reject such bill but the case be not in general exactly similar to that now under consideration since the bill which they have reject have commonly if not in every case be for the imposition and not for the repeal of a tax and in most case some question of national policy have be involve which have influence they vote but the view which lord palmerston press on the house be that the present be a case in which party feeling ought to be cast aside it be one in which higher and larger interest than those of party be concerned and in which the course that the house now take would be a precedent to guide future parliament he point out moreover that the smallness of the majority in the house of common have be to the lord some encouragement to take this particular step and that he be himself lead to think that they have take it not from any intention to step out of they province and to depart from the line of constitutional right which the history of the country have assign they but from motive of policy dependent on the circumstance of the moment and therefore he think it would be wise if the common forbear to enter into a conflict with the lord on a ground which might really not exist but satisfied themselves with a declaration of what be they own constitutional power and privilege it be of the utmost importance in a constitution like ours where there be different branch independent of each other each with power of its own and where cordial and harmonious action be necessary that care should be take to avoid the commencement of a unnecessary quarrel and the party that act otherwise would incur a grave responsibility mr gladstone however though he end by express he concurrence in the resolution propose by he chief use very different language respect the vote of the house of lord characterize it as a gigantic innovation the most gigantic and the most dangerous that have be attempt in we time since the origination of a bill for the imposition of a tax or the amendment of a money-bill be a slight thing compare with the claim to prevent the repeal of a tax and deal with assertion which he have hear that in this instance the house of common have be very foolish and the house of lord very wise he ask whether that really describe the constitution under which we live the house of common could not be infallible in matter of finance more than in other matter it might make error but he demand to know whether those error in finance be or be not liable to correction by the house of lord if they be what become of the privilege of the common on the other hand mr disraelus as leader of the opposition or conservative party support the resolution and applaud the speech of the prime-minister as a wise calm and ample declaration of a cabinet that have carefully and deliberately consider this important subject it have acknowledge that the conduct of the lord be justify by law and precedent and sanction by policy and he maintain that it show that the charge make by the chancellor of the exchequer be utterly untenable and have no foundation and mr horsman take a large general view of the legitimate working of the parliamentary constitution argue that while it be a undoubted rule that all tax should originate with the common as that elective and more immediately responsible assembly that be constantly refer back to the constituency the review power of a permanent and independent chamber be no less essential and that consider that the reform bill of 1832 have give a preponderance of power to the common and that the tendency of any farther reform act must be in the same direction so far from narrow the field of action for the peer the wiser alternative might be to adopt a generous construction of they power with a view to preserve the equilibrium that be hold to be essential to the safety and well-working of the constitution the house of common he conclude be perpetually assume fresh power and establish new precedent virtually all bill now originate with the common but this be not the consequence of any aggressive spirit in they but be the necessary and inevitable result of the historic working of the constitution and so this act of the lord be but the natural working of the constitution to meet a definite emergency the resolution be pass the first and third without a division the second to which a amendment have be propose design to limit the force of the precedent allege as justify the act of the lord by a majority of nearly four hundred -lrb- 315 -rrb- in they form and language the resolution can not be say to have greatly affect the power claim by the lord and exercise by they in this instance the first two be simply declaratory of acknowledged principle or fact and the third intimate no desire to guard against anything but a undue exertion by the lord of the right which they be admit to possess but it can hardly be doubt that the intention even of lord palmerston dictate by the strong feeling which he perceive to prevail in the house of common on the subject be to deter the lord from any future exercise of they power of review and rejection of measure relate to taxation when perhaps the common might be under less prudent guidance nor that the effect of the resolution will correspond with the design rather than with the language of the mover and will prevent the lord unless under the pressure of some overpowering necessity from again interfere to control the common in such matter at the same time it seem superfluous to point out that one claim advance by the chancellor of the exchequer who be apparently carry beyond he usual discretion by he parental fondness for the reject bill be utterly unreconcileable with the maintenance of any constitution at all that can deserve the name when there be three body so concerned in the legislation that the unite consent of all be indispensable to give validity to any act to claim for any one of they so paramount a authority that even if it should adopt a manifestly mischievous course neither of the other should have the right to control or check or correct the error would be to make that body the irresponsible master of the whole government and nation to invest it with that overrule power which lord palmerston with such force of reasoning have deprecate and to substitute for that harmonious concert of all to which in he view the perfection of we liberty be owe a submission to one and that the one most liable to be act upon by the violence or caprice of the populace he be a wise man who say that he look on the tyranny of one man as a evil but on the tyranny of a thousand as a thousand time worse and for this reason also the resolution which be now adopt seem to have be conceive in a spirit of judicious moderation since while render it highly improbable that the lord would again reject a measure relate to taxation it avoid absolutely to extinguish they power to do so lord palmerston it may be think foresee the possibility of a occasion arise when the notoriety that such a power still exist might serve as a check to prevent its exercise from be require in the very case which have give rise to this discussion he regard it as certain that the feeling of the majority of the nation approve of the action of the peer and as what have occur once might occur again it be certainly within the region of possibility that another such emergency might arise when the lord might interfere with salutary effect to save the country from the evil result of ill-considered legislation finance be above all other the subject on which a rash or unscrupulous minister may find the greatest facility for exciting the people by plausible delusion there be moreover another reason why it would not only be impolitic but absolutely unfair to deprive the lord altogether of they power of rejection even in case of taxation namely that the common when impose tax be tax the lord themselves as well as the other class of the community while the lord alone of the whole nation be absolutely unrepresented in the house of common there be a frequent cry for a graduate income-tax and surely if a unscrupulous demagogue in office be to contrive such a graduation as would subject a peer to three time the income-tax bear by a commoner it would be a monstrous iniquity if the peer be to have no power of protect themselves in they own house in the last sentence of he speech the chancellor of the exchequer have respectfully reserve to himself the freedom of act in such a way as should appear to offer any hope of success in give effect by a practical measure to the principle contain in the first resolution and it be probably a exemplification of the power of which he thus bespeak the use that he the next year strike out a scheme for insure the repeal of the paper-duty include it in one bill with all he other financial proposition instead of divide they in the ordinary way in several distinct bill it be a maneuver which too much resemble the system of tack which have be so justly denounce as one of the most unseemly maneuver of faction in the previous century -lrb- 316 -rrb- but as some of the principal reason which in the preceding year have lead the lord to condemn the repeal have cease to exist and the deficiency of the revenue have be convert into a surplus they think it wiser to prove they superiority of wisdom to the house of common by show a more conciliatory spirit and pass the bill though the course adopt which have the effect of deprive the lord of that power of examination of the detail of the financial scheme of the government which they have hitherto enjoy without any question or dispute be strongly protest against in both house and by some member who be not generally unfriendly to the administration a hundred year have now elapse since george iii ascend the throne it have be a period full of transaction of great importance develop the constitution in such a manner and to such a extent as to make a change in its character but little inferior to those which have be produce by the contest of the preceding century one principal result of the revolution of 1688 have be describe as have be the placing of the political power of the state chiefly in the hand of the aristocracy the reform bill of 1832 which have be sometimes call a second revolution transfer that power to the middle class -lrb- 317 -rrb- and what may be call the logical sequence of the later measure be the contrary of that which be design to flow from the earlier one the change which be effect in 1688 be intend to promote and be believe to have insure stability to have establish institution of a permanent character as far as human affair can be invest with permanency and down to the death of george ii the policy of succeed minister of whom walpole may be take as the type as he be unquestionably the most able aim chiefly at keep thing as they be _ quieta non movere _ the peerage bill propose by a prime-minister thirty year after the revolution be but a exaggerated instance of the perseverance with which that object be keep in view but the reform bill of 1832 like the emancipation act which precede it on the contrary contain in itself in its very principle the seed and element of farther change the emancipation act follow and combine with the repeal of the test act render it almost inevitable that religious toleration would in time be extend to all persuasion even to those adverse to christianity and the reform bill as have be already point out by the principle on which it base its limitation of the franchise lay the foundation for farther and repeat revision and modification -lrb- 318 -rrb- the consequence be that the aim of statesman of the present day differ from that which be pursue by they predecessor the statesman of the present day can no longer hope to avoid farther change and must therefore be content to direct he energy to the more difficult task of make they moderate and safe consistent with the preservation of that balance of power to which the country owe the liberty and happiness which it have hitherto enjoy it be in this point of view that the diffusion of education beyond the blessing which it confer on the individual be of especial importance to the state political theorist affirm that all man have a equal right to political power -- to that amount at least of political power which be confer by a vote at election man of practical common-sense affirm that no one have a right to power of any kind unless he can be trust to forbear employ it to the injury of he fellow-creature or of himself and the only safeguard and security for the proper exercise of political power be sound and enlighten education it be unnecessary to dwell on this point because we statesman of both party -lrb- to they honor -rrb- give constant proof of they deep conviction of its importance but in close we remark it may be allowable to point out the political lesson which above all other the teacher of the mass should seek to inculcate on they pupil the art of government and each measure of government be above all other thing the two-sided shield there be so many plausible argument which may be advance on each side of almost every question of policy that no candid man will severely condemn he who in such disputable matter form a opinion different from he own age and experience be worse than valueless if they do not teach a man to think better of he kind and the history of the period which we have be consider teach no lesson more forcibly than this that the great majority of educate man and especially of we lead statesman be actuate by honest and patriotic motive and we would presume to urge that more important than a correct estimate of any one transaction of the past or even of any one measure to influence the future be the habit of put a candid and therefore a favorable construction on the character and intention of those to whom from time to time the conduct of the affair of the nation be
