the undertone one hear in the other day-coach or the pullman near the entrance of the car two negro in soldier ' uniform have turn a seat over to face the door and now they sit talk loudly and laugh the loose laugh of the half intoxicate as they watch the inflow of negro passenger come out of the white car the window of the jim crow car be shut and already it have become noisome the close air be faintly barb with the peculiar penetrate odor of dark sweating skin for four year peter siner have not know that odor now it come to he not so much offensively as with a queer quality of intimacy and reminiscence the tall carefully tailor negro spread he wide nostril vacillate whether to sniff it out with disfavor or to admit it for the sudden mental association it evoke it be a faint pungent smell that play in the back of he nose and somehow remind he of he mother caroline siner a thick-bodied black woman whom he remember as always bend over a wash-tub this be only one unit of a complex the odor be also connect with negro protracted meeting in hooker 's bend and the harvard man remember a lanky black preacher wave long arm and wail of hell-fire to the chant groan of he dark congregation and he peter siner have groan with the other peter have know this odor in the press-room of tennessee cotton-gin over a river packet 's boiler where he and other roustabout be bed in bunk-house in the wood it also recall a certain octoroon girl name ida may and a intimacy with she which it still move and saddened peter to think of indeed it resurrect innumerable vignette of he life in the negro village in hooker 's bend it be link with innumerable emotion this pungent unforgetable odor that fill the jim crow car somehow the odor have a queer effect of appear to push he conversation with the two white northern man in the drawing-room back to a distance a indefinable distance of both space and time the negro put he suitcase under the seat hang he overcoat on the hook and place he hand-bag in the rack overhead then with some difficulty he open a window and sit down by it a stir of traveler in the cairo station drift into the car against a broad murmur of hurry foot move truck and talk there stand out the thin flat voice of a southern white girl call good-by to some one on the train peter could see she wave a bright parasol and tiptoe a sandwich boy hurry past shrill he wares siner lean out with fifteen cent and signal to he the urchin hesitate and be about to reach up one of he wrap parcel when a peremptory voice shout at he from a lower car with a sort of start the lad desert siner and go trot down to he white customer a moment later the train bell begin ring and the dixie flier puff deliberately out of the cairo station and move across the ohio bridge into the south half a hour later the blue-grass field of kentucky be spin outside of the window in a vast green whirlpool the distant tree and house move forward with the train while the foreground with its telegraph pole its culvert section-house and shrubbery rush backward in a blur now and then into the jim crow window whip a blast of coal smoke and hot cinder for the engine be only two car ahead peter siner look out at the interminable spin of the landscape with a certain wistfulness he be come back into the south into he own country here for generation he forebear have toil endlessly and fruitlessly yet the fat green field hurtle past he tell with what skill and patience they black hand have labor the negro shrug away such thought and with a certain effort replace they with the constructive idea that be bring he south once more it be a very simple idea siner be return to he native village in tennessee to teach school he plan to begin he work with the ordinary public school at hooker 's bend but in the back of he head he hope eventually to develop a institution after the plan of tuskeegee or the hampton institute in virginium to do what he have in mind he must obtain aid from white source and now as he travel southward he begin con in he mind the white man and white woman he know in hooker 's bend he want first of all to secure possession of a small tract of land which he know adjoin the negro school-house over on the east side of the village before the negro 's mind the different villager pass in review with that peculiar intimacy of vision that servant always have of they master indeed no white southerner know he own village so minutely as do any member of its color population the color villager see the whites off they guard and just as they be and that be a attitude in which no one look he best the negro might be call the black recording angel of the south if what they know should be shout aloud in any southern town its social life would disintegrate yet it be a strange fact that gossip seldom penetrate from the one race to the other so peter siner sit in the jim crow car muse over half a dozen villager in hooker 's bend he think of they in a curious way although he be now a ba of harvard university and although he know that not a soul in the little river village unless it be old captain renfrew could construe a line of greek and that scarcely two have ever travel farther north than cincinnatus still as peter recall they name and foible he involuntarily feel that he be tell over a roll of the mighty the white villager come march through he mind as being austere and the very crank and quirk of they character somehow hold that austerity there be the brownell sister two old maid molly and pattus who live in a big brick house on the hill peter remember that miss molly brownell always dole out to he mother at Monday 's washday dinner exactly one biscuit less than the old negress want to eat and she always pay she in old clothes peter remember a dozen time in he life he mother come home and wonder in a impersonal way how it be that miss molly brownell could skimp every meal she eat at the big house by exactly one biscuit it be miss brownell 's thin-lipped boast that she understand negro she have tell peter so several time when as a lad he go up to the big house on errand peter siner consider this remembrance without the faintest feeling of humor and mentally remove miss molly brownell from he list of possible subscriber yet he recall the whole brownell estate have be rear on negro labor then there be henry hooker cashier of the village bank peter know that the banker subscribe liberally to foreign mission indeed at the cashier 's behest the white church of hooker 's bend keep a pay missionary on the upper congo but the banker have sell some village lot to the negro and in two instance where a streak of commercial phosphate have be discover on the property the lot have revert to the hooker estate there have be in the deed something concern a mineral reservation that the negro purchaser know nothing about until the phosphate be discover the whole matter have be perfectly legal a hand shake siner 's shoulder and interrupt he review peter turn and catch a alcoholic breath over he shoulder and the blur voice of a southern negro call out above the rumble of the car and the roar of the engine : ` fo ' gawd ef di be not peter siner i 's be lookin ' at de las ' twenty mile a ' not knowin ' he wid sich skeniptious clo'e on wha you fum nigger siner take the enthusiastic hand offer he and study the heavily set powerful man bend over the seat he be in a soldier 's uniform and he broad nutmeg-colored face and hot black eye bring peter a vague sense of familiarity but he never would

he remember he mother 's write he something about tump pack go to france and get crown before the army he have puzzle a long time over what she mean by crown before he guess she meaning now the medal

for you country tump it be war then you be fight for you country \* \* \* \* \* at jackson tennessee the two negro be force to spend the night between train tump pack pilot peter siner to a negro cafe where they could eat and later they search out a negro lodging-house on gate street where they could sleep it be a grimy smelly place with its own odor spike by a phosphate-reducing plant two block distant the paper on the wall of the room peter sleep in look scrofulous there be no window and peter 's four-year régime of open window and fresh - air sleep be break he arrange he clothing for the night so it would come in contact with nothing in the room but a chair back he feel dull next morning and could not bring himself either to shave or bathe in the place but get out and hunt up a negro barber-shop furnish with one greasy red-plush barber-chair a few hour later the two negro journey on down to perryville tennessee a village on the tennessee river where they take a gasolene launch up to hooker 's bend the launch be about fifty foot long and have two cabin a color cabin in front of and a white cabin behind the engine-room this unremitting insistence on he color this continual shunt he into obscure and filthy way gradually give peter a loathly sensation it increase the unwashed feeling that follow he lack of a morning bath the impression grow upon he that he be be handle with tong along back-alley route that he and he race be something to be keep out of sight as much as possible as careful housekeeper manoeuver they slop at perryville a number of passenger board the up-river boat two or three drummer a yellowed old hill woman return to she wayne county home a red-headed peanut-buyer a well-groomed white girl in a tailor suit a youngish man barely on the right side of middle age who seem to be attend she and some negro girl with lunch the passenger trail from the railroad station down the river bank through a slush of mud for the river have just fall and have leave a layer of liquid mud to a height of about twenty foot all along the littoral the passenger pick they way down carefully step into one another 's track in the effort not to ruin they shoe the drummer grumble the youngish man pilot the girl down hold she hand although both could have manage better by themselves follow the passenger come the trunk and grip on a truck a negro deck-hand the truck-driver and the white master of the launch shove aboard the big sample trunk of the drummer with grunt profanity and much stamp of mud presently without the formality of bell or whistle the launch clack away from the landing and stand up the wide muddy river the river itself be monotonous and depressing it be perhaps half a mile wide with flat willowed mud bank on one side and low shelf of stratified limestone on the other trading-point lay at ten - or fifteen-mile interval along the great waterway the typical landing be a dilapidated shed of a store half cover with tin tobacco sign and ancient circus poster usually only one man meet the launch at each landing the merchant a democrat in he shirt-sleeve and without a tie he voice be always a flat weary drawl but he eye wrinkle against the sun usually hold the shrewdness of those who make they living out of two-penny trade at each place the red-headed peanut-buyer slog up the muddy bank and bargain for the merchant 's peanut to be ship on the down-river trip of the first st loui packet the loneliness of the scene embrace the trading-point the river and the little gasolene launch struggle against the muddy current it permeate the passenger and be a finish touch to peter siner 's melancholy the launch clack on and on interminably sometimes it seem to make no headway at all against the heavy silty current tump pack the white captain and the negro engineer begin a game of crap in the negro cabin presently two of the white drummers come in from the white cabin and begin bet on the throw the game be listless the master of the launch point out place along the shore where wildcat still be located the crap-shooter negro and white squat in a circle on the cabin floor snap they finger and call they point monotonously one of the negro girl in the negro cabin take a apple out of she lunch sack and begin eat it hold it in she palm after the fashion of negro rather than in she finger as be the custom of white woman both door of the engine-room be open and peter siner could see through into the white cabin the old hill woman be doze in she chair she bonnet bob to each stroke of the engine the youngish man and the girl be engage in some sort of intimate lover ' dispute when the engine stop at one of the landing peter discover she be try to pay he what he have spend on get she baggage truck down at perryville the girl keep press a bill into the man 's hand and he avoid receive the money they keep up the play for sake of occasional contact when the launch come in sight of hooker 's bend toward the middle of the afternoon peter siner experience one of the profoundest surprise of he life somehow all through he college day he have remember hooker 's bend as a proud town with important store and unapproachable white residence now he see a skum of negro cabin high pile of lumber a sawmill and a ice-factory behind that on a little rise stand the old brownell manor maintain a certain shabby dignity in a grove of oak behind and westward from the negro shack and lumber - pile range the village store they roof just visible over the top of the bank moor to the shore lay the wharf-boat in weathered green and yellow as a background for the whole scene rise the dark-green height of what be call the big hill a eminence that separate the negro village on the east from the white village on the west the hill itself hold no house but appear a solid green-black with cedar the ensemble be merely another lonely spot on the south bank of the great somnolent river it look dead desert a typical river town unprodded even by the hoot of a jerk-water railroad as the launch chortle toward the wharf peter siner stand try to orient himself to this unexpected and amazing minifying of hooker 's bend he have leave a metropolis he be come back to a tumble-down village yet nothing be change even the two scraggly locust-tree that cling perilously to the brink of the river bank still hold they toe-hold among the stratum of limestone the negro deck-hand come out and pump the hand-power whistle in three long discordant blast then a queer thing happen the whistle be answer by a faint strain of music a little later the passenger see a line of negro come march down the river bank to the wharf-boat they march in military order and from afar peter recognize the white apron and the sword and spear of the knight and lady of tabor a color burial association siner wonder what have bring out the knight and lady of tabor the singing and the drum gradually grow upon the air the passenger in the white cabin come out on the guard at this unexpected fanfare as soon as the white traveler see the march negro they begin joke about what cause the demonstration the captain of the launch think he know and begin a oath but stop it out of deference to the girl in the tailor suit he say it be a dead nigger the society be go to ship up to savannah the girl in the tailor suit be much amuse she say the darky look like a string of caricature march down the river bank peter notice she northern accent and fancy she be come to hooker 's bend to teach school one of the drummer turn to another do you ever hear bob taylor 's yarn about uncle ` rastus 's funeral funniest thing bob ever get off he proceed to tell it every one on the launch be laugh except the captain who be swearing quietly but the line of negro march on down to the wharf - boat with the unshakable dignity of black folk in a important position they come sing a old negro spiritual the woman 's soprano thrill up in high weird phrasing against a organ-like background of male voice but the black man carry no coffin and suddenly it occur to peter siner that perhaps this celebration be give in honor of he own home - come the mulatto 's heart beat a trifle faster as he begin plan a suitable response to this ovation sure enough the singing rank disappear behind the wharf-boat and a minute later come march around the stern and line up on the outer guard of the vessel the skinny grizzly-headed negro commander hold up he sword and the knight and lady of tabor fall silent the master of the launch toss he head-line to the wharf-boat and yell for one of the negro to make it fast one do then the commandant with the sword begin he address but it be not direct to peter he say : -lrb- illustration : peter recognize the white apron and the sword and spear of the knight and lady of tabor -rrb- brudder tump pack we de hooker 's ben ' lodge uv de knight a ' lady uv tabor welcome you back to yo ' native town we be proud

interrupt the speaker just then a shrivel old negress give a scream and come run and half stumble out of the line hold out she arm to the barrel-chested soldier on the gang-plank she seize he and begin shriek : bless gawd my son 's do come home praise de lawd bless he holy name here she laudation break into sob and choke and laugh and she squeeze herself to she son tump pat she bony black form i 's heah mammy he stammer uncertainly i 's come back mammy half a dozen other negro catch the joyful hysteria they begin a religious shout clap they hand fling up they arm shriek one of the drummer grunt : good god all this over a nigger get back at the extreme end of the dark line a tall cream-colored girl weep silently as peter siner stand blinking he eye he see the octoroon 's shoulder and breast shake from the sob which she white blood repress to silence a certain sympathy for she grief and its suppression keep peter 's eye on the young woman and then with the queer effect of one picture melting into another the strange girl 's face assume familiar curve and softness and he be look at ida may a quiver travel deliberately over peter from he crisp black hair to the sole of he foot he start toward she impulsively at that moment one of the drummer pick up he grip and start down the gang-plank and with its leathern bulk press tump pack and he mother out of he path he move on to the shore through the negro who divide at he approach the captain of the launch see that other of he white passenger be become impatient and he shout for the darky to move aside and not to block the gangway the youngish man draw the girl in the tailor suit close to he and start through with she peter hear he say they will not hurt you miss negley and miss negley in the brisk nasal intonation of a northern woman reply : oh i be not afraid we waste a lot of sympathy on they back home but when you see they -- at that moment peter hear a cry in he ear and feel arm throw about he neck he look down and see he mother caroline siner look up into he face and weep with the general emotion of the negro and this joy of she own caroline have change since peter last see she she eye be a little more wrinkled she kinky hair be thinner and very gray something warm and melting move in peter siner 's breast he caress he mother and murmur incoherently as have tump pack presently the master of the launch come by and touch the old negress not ungently with the end of a spike-pole you 'll have to move aunt can ` line he say we be goin ' to get the freight off now the black woman pause in she weep yes mass ' bob she say and she and peter move off of the launch onto the wharf-boat the knight and lady of tabor be already up the river bank with they hero peter and he mother be leave alone now they walk around the guard of the wharf-boat to the bank hold each other 's arm closely as they go peter keep look down at he old black mother with a grow tenderness she be so worn and heavy he recognize the very dress she wear a old black silk which she have wash out for miss pattus brownell when he be a boy it have be then it be now she best dress during the year the old negress have register she increase bulk by let out seam and put in panel some of the panel do not agree with the original fabric either in color or in texture and now the seam be stretch again and threaten a rip peter 's own immaculate clothes reproach he and he wonder for the hundredth or for the thousandth time how he mother have obtain certain remittance which she have forward he during he college year as peter and he mother creep up the bank of the river stop occasionally to let the old negress rest he impression of the meanness and shabbiness of the whole village grow from the top of the bank the single business street run straight back from the river it be stony in place muddy in place strew with goods-box break plank excelsior and straw that have be use for pack char rubbish - pile lay in front of every store which the clerk have sweep out and attempt to burn hog roam the thoroughfare pick up decay fruit and paring and nose tin can that have be throw out by the merchant the store that peter have once look upon as show-place be poor two-story brick or frame building defile by time and wear and weather the white merchant be coatless listless man who sit in chair on the brick pavement before they store and who move slowly when a customer enter they door and strange to say it be this fall of he white townsman that move peter siner with a sense of the greatest loss it seem fantastic to he this sudden land-slide of the mighty as peter and he mother come over the brow of the river bank they see a crowd collect at the other end of the street the main street of hooker 's bend be only a block long and the two negro could easily hear the loud laughter of man hurry to the focus of interest and the blurry expostulation of negro voice the laughter spread like a contagion merchant as far up as the river corner become infected and move toward the crowd look back over they shoulder at every tenth or twelfth step to see that no one enter they door presently a little short man fairly yip with laughter stumble back up the street to he store with tear of mirth in he eye a belated merchant stop he by clap both hand on he shoulder and shake some composure into he what be it what be so funny damn it i miss ever ` thing i-i-it 's that f-fool tum-tump pack bobb 's arrest he the inquirer be astounded how the hell can he arrest he when he hit town this minute wh-why bobb have a old warrant

handcuffs on tump 's wrist and stand with he prisoner amid a crowd of argue negro bobb be a big fleshy red-faced man with chilly blue eye and a little straight slit of a mouth in he wide face he be

eye at the crowd in general but hit 's out o ' date mr bobb the old gray-headed minister parson ranson be plead may be that parson but hit 's easier to come up before the jp and pay off than to fight it through the circuit court siner push he way through the crowd how much do you want mr bobb he ask briefly the constable look with reminiscent eye at the tall well-tailored negro he be plainly go through some mental card-index hunting for the name of peter siner on some long-forgotten warrant apparently he discover nothing for he say shortly : how do i know before he be try come on tump the procession move in a long noisy line up pillow street the white residential street lie to the west it stop before a large shaded lawn where a number of white man and woman be play a game with card the

lawn glitter some piece of silver plate which form the first second and third prize for the three lead score the constable halt he black company before the lawn where they stand in the sunshine patiently wait for the justice of the peace to finish he game and hear the case of the state of tennessee plaintiff versus tump pack defendant chapter ii on the eastern edge of hooker 's bend draw in a rough semicircle around the big hill lie niggertown in all the half-moon there be perhaps not two upright building the grimy cabin lean at crazy angle some prop with pole while other hold out against gravitation at a hazard up and down its street flow the slow negro life of the village here child of all color from black to cream fight and play deep-chested negress loiter to and fro some on errand to the white section of the village on the other side of the hill where they go to scrub or cook or wash or iron other go down to the public well with a bucket in each hand and one balance on the head the public well itself lie at the southern end of this miserable street just at a point where the drainage of the big hill collect the rainfall run down through niggertown under its sty stable and outdoor toilet and the well supply the negro with water for cooking wash and drink or rather what be once a well supply this water for it be a well no longer its top and curb cave in long ago and now there be simply a big hole in the soft water-soaked clay about fifteen foot wide with water standing at the bottom here come the unhurried colored woman who throw in they bucket and with a dexterity that come of long practice draw they out full of water black mother shout at they child not to fall into this pit and now and then when a pig fail to come up for its evening slop a black boy will go to the public well to see if perchance he porker have meet misfortune there the inhabitant of niggertown suffer from diver disease they develop strange ailment that no amount of physicking

sovereign state of tennessee the siner home be a three-room shanty about midway in the semicircle peter siner stand in the sunlight just outside the entrance watch he old mother clean the bug out of a tainted ham that she have buy for a pittance from some white housekeeper in the village it have be too high for white people to eat old caroline patiently tap the honeycombed meat to scare out the last of the little green householder and then she wash it in a solution of soda to freshen it up the sight of he bulky old mother work at the spoil ham and of the negro woman in the street move to and from the infected well fill peter siner with its terrible pathos although he have see these surroundings all of he life he have a queer impression that he be look upon they for the first time during he boyhood he have accept all this without question as the way the world be make during he college day a criticism have arise in he mind but it come slowly and be temper by that tenderness every one feel for the spot call home now as he stand look at it he wonder how human being live there at all he wonder if ida may use water from the niggertown well he turn to ask old caroline but check himself with a man 's instinctive avoidance of mention he intimacy to he mother at that moment oddly enough the old negress bring up the topic herself ida may wuz ` quirin ' ` bout you las ' night peter a

remember a smaller sister of ida may 's a little squalling yellow wet-nosed nuisance that have annoy he adolescence so that little spoil-sport have grow up into the girl he have mistake for ida may this fact increase he sense of strangeness -- that sense of great change that have fall on the village in he absence which form the groundwork of all he renew association peter 's prolonged silence arouse certain suspicion in the old negress she glance at she son out of the tail of she eye cissie dildine be tump pack 's gal she state defensively with the jealousy all mother feel toward all son a diversion in the shout of the child up the mean street and a sudden furious bark of dog draw peter from the discussion he look up and see a negro girl of about fourteen come down the curved street with long quick step and a occasional glance over she shoulder from across the thoroughfare a small chocolate-colored woman with she wool do in outstanding spike thrust she head out at the door and call : whut 's de matter ofeely the girl lift a high voice : oh miss nan it be that constable goin ' th ` ugh the house the girl veer across the street to the safety of the open door and one of she

twelve-o'clock meal be call in hooker 's bend and so end he meditation the harvard man go back into the kitchen and sit down at a rickety table cover with a red - check oil-cloth on it be spread the spoil ham a dish of poke salad a corn pone and a pot of weak coffee a quaint old bowl hold some brown sugar the fat old negress make a slight habitual settling movement in she chair that mark the end of she cooking and the beginning of she meal then she bent she grizzled woolly head and mumble off one of those queer old-fashioned grace which consist of a swift string of syllable without pause between either word or sentence peter sit watch he mother with a muse gaze the kitchen be illuminate by a single small square window set high up from the floor now the disposition of its single ray of light over the dish and the bow head of the massive negress give peter one of those sharp tender apprehension of formal harmony that lie back of the genre in art it stir he emotion in a odd fashion when old caroline raise she head she find she son stare with impersonal eye not at herself but at the whole room include she the old woman be perplexed and a little apprehensive why son she ejaculate didn ' you bow yo ' haid while yo ' mammy ast de grace peter be a little confused at he remissness then he lean a little forward to explain the sudden glamour which for a moment have transfigure the interior of they kitchen but even as he start to speak he realize that what he mean to say would only confuse he mother therefore he cast about mentally for some other explanation of he behavior but find nothing at hand i hope you be not forget yo ' ` ligion up at de ` versity son oh no no indeed mother but just at that moment just as you bow you head you know it strike I that -- that there be something noble in we race that be the best he could put it to she noble -- yes you know he go on a little quickly sometimes i -- i have think my father must have be a noble man the old negress become very still she be not look quite at she son or yet precisely away from he uh -- uh noble nigger -- she give she abdominal chuckle why -- yeah i reckon yo ' father wuz putty noble as -- as nigger go she sit look at she son oddly with a faint amusement in she gross black face when a careful voice a very careful voice sound in the outer room glide up politely on the syllable : ahnt carolin ' oh ahnt carolin ' may i enter the old woman stir da '' s cissie peter go ast she in to de fambly-room when siner open the door the vague resemblance of the slender creamy girl on the threshold to ida may again strike he but cissie dildine be younger and she polished black hair lay straight on she pretty head and be do in big shine puff over she ear in a way that ida may 's unruly curl would never have permit she eye be the most limpid brown peter have ever see but she oval face be faintly unnatural from the use of negro face powder which color woman insist on and which give they yellow and brown a barely perceptible greenish hue cissie wear a fluffy yellow dress some three shades deeper than the throat and the glimpse of bosom reveal at the neck the girl carry a big package in she arm and now she manipulate this to put out a slender hand to peter this be cissie dildine mister siner she smile up at he i just come over to put my name down on you list there be such a mob at the benevolence hall last night i could not get to you the girl have a certain finical precision to she english that tell peter she have be away to some school and have be teach to guard she grammar very carefully as she talk peter help she inside amid the handshake and say he would go fetch the list as he turn cissie offer she bundle here be something i think might be a little treat for you and ahnt carolin ' she pause and then explain remotely sometimes it be hard to get good thing at the village market peter take the package vaguely amuse at cissie 's patronage of the hooker 's bend market it be a attitude instinctively assume by every girl white or black who leave the village and return the bundle be rather large and wrap in newspaper he carry it into the kitchen to he mother and then return with the list the sheet be greasy from the handling of black finger the girl spread it on the little center-table with a certain daintiness seat herself and hold out she hand for peter 's pencil she make rather a graceful study in cream and yellow as she lean over the table and sign she name in a handwriting as perfect and as devoid of character as a copy - book she begin discuss the speech peter have make at the benevolence hall i do not know whether i be in favor of you project or not mr siner she say as she rise from the table no peter be surprised and amuse at she attitude and at she precise voice no i be rather incline toward mr duboi 's theory of a literary culture than toward mr washington 's for a purely industrial training peter break out laugh for the love of mike cissie you talk like the instructor in sociology b and have not we meet before somewhere this ` mister siner ' stuff -- the girl 's face warm under its faint greenish powder if i be not careful with my language peter she say simply i 'll be talk just as badly as i do before i go to the seminary you know i never hear a proper sentence in hooker 's bend except my own a certain resignation in the girl 's soft voice bring peter a qualm for laugh at she he lay a impulsive hand on she young shoulder well that be true certainly but it will not always be like that cissie more of we go off to school every year i do hope my school here in hooker 's bend will be of some real value if i could just show we people how badly we fare here how ill house and unsanitary -- the girl press peter 's finger with a woman 's optimism for a man you 'll succeed peter i know you will some day the name siner will mean the same thing to color people as tanner and dunbar and braithwaite do anyway i have put my name down for ten dollar to help out she return the pencil i 'll have tump pack come around and pay you my subscription peter i 'll watch out for tump promise peter in a lighten mood -- and make he pay he 'll do it i do not doubt it you ought to have he under perfect control i mean to tell you what a pretty frock you have on the girl dimpled and drop he a little curtsy half ironical and wholly graceful peter be charm now keep that way cissie smile and human not so grammatical i wish i have a brooch a brooch i would give it to you you dress need a brooch a old gold brooch at the bosom just a glint there to balance you eye cissie flush happily and make the feminine movement of conceal the v-shaped opening at she throat it be a pleasure to doll up for a man like you peter you see a girl 's good point -- if she have any she tack on demurely oh just any man -- do not think it do not think it wave down cissie humorously but cissie how be it possible -- just blind cissie ripple into a boarding-school laugh i could wear the whole rue del opera here in niggertown and nobody would ever see it but you cissie be move toward the door peter try to detain she he enjoy the implication of tump pack 's stupidity in they badinage but she would not stay he be finally reduce to thank she for she present then stand guard as she trip out into the grimy street in the sunshine she glossy black hair and canary dress look as trim and brilliant as the plumage of a chaffinch peter siner walk back into the kitchen with the fix smile of a man who be think of a pretty girl the black dowager in the kitchen receive he in silence with she thick lip pout when peter observe it he feel slightly amuse at he mother 's resentment well you sho have a lot o ' chatter over signin ' a lil ole paper she sign for ten dollar say peter smile huh she 'll never pay it say tump pack would pay it huh the old negress drop the subject and nod at a huge double pan on the table dat 's whut she brung you she grunt disapprovingly and it be for you too mother ya-as i ` magine she brung somp 'n fuh I peter walk across to the double pan and see they hold a complete dinner -- chicken hot biscuit cake pickle even ice-cream the sight of the food bring peter a realization that he be keenly hungry as a matter of fact he have not eat a palatable meal since he have be evict from the white dining-car at cairo illinoi siner serve he own and he mother 's plate the old woman sniff again seem to I lak you be mighty onobsarvin ' fuh a nigger whut 's be off to college anything else peter look into the pan again be not you see whut it be all in what it be in yeah whut it be in you hear whut i say what be it in why it be in miss arkwright 's tukky roaster dat 's whut it be in the old negress drive she point home with a acid accent peter siner be too loyal to he new friendship with cissie dildine to allow he mother 's jealous suspicion to affect he nevertheless the old woman 's observation about the turkey roaster do prevent a complete and care-free enjoyment of the meal certainly there be other turkey roaster in hooker 's bend than mr arkwright 's cissie might very well own a roaster it be absurd to think that cissie in the midst of she almost pathetic struggle to break away from the uncouthness of niggertown would stoop to -- even in he thought peter avoid nominate the charge and then somehow he memory fish up the fact that year ago ida may accord to village rumor be light-fingered at that time in peter 's life light-fingeredness carry with it no opprobrium whatever it be simply a fact about ida may as be she sloe eye and curl black hair he reflection renew he perpetual sense of queerness and strangeness that hall-mark every phase of niggertown life since he return from the north \* \* \* \* \* cissie dildine 's contribution tail out the one hundred dollar that peter need and after he have finish he meal the mulatto set out across the big hill for the white section of the village to complete he trade it be peter 's program to go to the planter 's bank pay down he hundred and receive a deed from one elia tomwit which the bank hold in escrow two or three day before peter have try to borrow the initial hundred from the bank but the cashier henry hooker after go into the transaction have decline the loan and therefore siner have be force to await a meeting of the son and daughter of benevolence at this meet the subscription have go through promptly the land the negro purpose to purchase for a industrial school be a timbered tract tie southeast of hooker 's bend on the head-water of ross creek a purchase price of eight hundred dollar have be agree upon the timber on the tract sell on the stump would bring almost that amount it be siner 's plan to commandeer free labor in niggertown work off the timber and have enough money to build the first unit of he school a number of negro man already have subscribe a certain number of day ' work in the timber it be a modest and entirely practical program and peter feel set up over it the brown man turn briskly out into the hot afternoon sunshine down the mean semicircular street where piccaninny be kick up cloud of dust he hurry through the dusty area and presently turn off a by-path that lead over the hill through a glade of cedar to the white village the glade be gloomy but warm for the shade of cedar somehow seem to hold heat a carpet of needle hushed siner 's footfall and spread a sabbatical silence through the grove the upward path be not smooth but be break with outcrop of the same reddish limestone that mark the whole stretch of the tennessee river here and there in the grove be circle eight or ten foot in diameter brush perfectly clean of all needle and pebble and twig these place be crap-shooter ' circle where black and white man squat to shoot dice under the big stone on the hillside peter know be cache illicit whisky and at night the boot-legger carry on a brisk trade among the gambler more than that the glade on the big hill be use for still more demoralizing end it become a squalid grove of ashtoreth but now in the autumn evening all the petty obscenity of white and black slough away amid the religious implication of the dark-green aisle the sight of a white boy sit on a outcrop of limestone with a strap of school-book drop at he foot rather surprise peter the negro look at the hobbledehoy for several seconds before he recognize in the lanky youth a little arkwright boy whom he have know and play with in he pre-college day now there be such a exaggerated wistfulness in young arkwright 's attitude that peter be amuse hello sam he call what you do out here the arkwright boy turn with a start aw be that you siner before the negro could reply he add : be you on the harvard football team siner guess the white feller have a pretty gay time in harvard do not they siner geemenettie but i git tired o ' this dern town d' reckon i could make the football team look like i could if a nigger like you could siner none of this juvenile outbreak of question require answer peter stand look at the hobbledehoy without smile be not you go to school he ask arkwright shrug aw hell he say self-consciously we get march down to the protracted meetin ' while ago -- whole school do my seat happen to be close to a window when they all stand up to sing i crawl out and skip do not mention that siner i will not when a fellow go to college he do not git march to preachin ' do he siner i never do we-e-ll mused young sam doubtfully you be a nigger i never

yeah on hobbett 's corner say be cissie dildine at home i believe she be she cook for we explain young arkwright and mammy want she to come and git supper too the phrase get supper too refer to the custom in the white home of hooker 's bend of have only two meal cook a day breakfast and the twelve-o'clock dinner with a hot supper optional with the mistress peter nod and pass on up the path leave young arkwright seat on the ledge of rock a prey to all the boil erratic impulse of adolescence the negro sense some of the innumerable difficulty of this white boy 's life and once as he walk on over the silent needle he feel a impulse to turn back and talk to young sam arkwright to sit down and try to explain to the youth what he could of this hazardous adventure call life but then he reflect very likely the boy would be offend at a serious talk from a negro also he think that young arkwright be white be really not within the sphere of he ministry he peter siner be a worker in the black world of the south he be part of the black world which the white south be so meticulous to hide away to keep out of sight and out of think a certain vague sense of triumph trickle through some obscure corner of peter 's mind it be so subtle that peter himself would have be the first in all good faith to deny it and to affirm that all he motive be altruistic once he look back through the cedar he could still see the boy hunch over chin in fist stare at the mat of needle as peter turn the brow of the big hill he see at its eastern foot the village church a plain brick building with a decaying spire its side be perforated by four tall arched window each be a memorial window of stain glass which give the build a black look from the outside as peter walk down the hill toward the church he hear the and somewhat nasal singing of uncultivated voice mingle with the snore of a reed organ when he reach main street peter find the whole business portion virtually desert all the store be close and in every show-window stand a print notice that no business would be transact between the hour of two and three o'clock in the afternoon during the two week of revival then in progress beside this notice stand another card give the minister 's text for the current day on this particular day it read : go ye into all the world come hear rev eb blackwater 's great missionary address on christianize africa eloquent profound heart-searching illustrate with slide half a dozen negro lounge in the sunshine on hobbett 's corner as peter come up they be amusing themselves after the fashion of black with mock fight feint sudden wrestling they would seize one another by the head and grind they knuckle into one another 's wool occasionally one would leap up and fall into one of those grotesque shuffle call breakdown it all hold a certain rawness a irrepressible juvenility as peter come up tump pack detach himself from the group and give a pantomime of thrust he be clearly reproduce the action which have win for he he military medal then suddenly he fall down in the dust and writhe he be mimic with a ghastly realism the death-throe of he four victim he audience howl with mirth at this dumb show of the bayonet-fight and of kill four man tump himself get up out of the dust with tear of laughter in he eye peter catch the end of he sentence sho put it to 'em black boy fo ' white man -- he audience roar again sway around and pound one another in a excess of mirth siner shout from across the street two or three time before he catch tump 's attention the ex-soldier look around sober abruptly whut-chu want nigger he inquiry be not over-cordial peter nod he across the street the heavily build black in khaki hesitate a moment then start across the street with the drag foot of a reluctant negro peter look at he as he come up what be the matter tump he ask playfully be not nothin ' matter wid I nigger peter make a guess at tump 's surliness look here be you puff up because cissie dildine strike you for a ten tump 's expression change be she strike I fuh a ten yes on that school subscription be dat whut you two nigger wuz a-talkin ' ` bout over thaiuh in yo ' house exactly peter show the list with cissie 's name on it she tell I to collect from you tump brighten up so dat wuz whut you two nigger wuz a-talkin ' ` bout over at yo ' house he run a fist down into he khaki and draw out three or four one-dollar bill and about a pint of small change it be the usual crap-shooter 's offer the two negro sit down on the ramshackle porch of a old jeweler 's shop and tump begin a complicated tally of ten dollar by the time he have he dime quarter and nickel in separate stack service in the village church be finish and the congregation come file up the street first come the school-child run and chatter and swing they book by the strap then the business man of the hamlet rather uncomfortable in coat and collar hurry back to they store finally come the woman surround the preacher tump and peter walk on up to the entrance of the planter 's bank and there await mr henry hooker the cashier presently a skinny man detach himself from the church crowd and come angling across the dirty street toward the bank mr hooker wear somewhat shabby clothes for a banker in fact he never could recover from certain personal habit form during a penurious boyhood he have a thin hatchet face which just at this moment be shine though from some inward glow although he be a unhandsome little man he expression be that of one at peace with man and god and be pleasant to see he have be so excite by the minister that he be constrain to say something even to two negro so as he unlock the little one-story bank he tell tump and peter that he have be listen to a man who be truly a man of god he say blackwater could touch the hardest heart and sure enough mr hooker 's rather pop and narrow-set eye look as though he have be cry all this encomium be give in a high crack voice as the cashier open the door and turn the negro into the bank tump who stand with he hat off listen to all the cashier have to say say he think so too the shabby interior of the little bank the shabby little banker renew that sense of disillusion that pervade peter 's home-coming in boston the mulatto have do he slight banking business in a white marble structure with teller of machine-like briskness and neatness mr hooker stroll around into he grill-cage when he be thoroughly ensconce he begin business in he high voice : you come to see I about that land peter yes sir sorry to tell you peter you be not back in time to get the tomwit place peter come out of he musing over the boston bank with a sense of bewilderment how 's that why i buy that land -- but you pay nothing for you option siner i have a clear-cut understanding with mr tomwit -- mr hooker smile a smile that bring out sharp wrinkle around the thin nose on he thin face you should have pay he a earnest siner if you want to bind you trade you color folk be always stumble over the law peter stare through the grate not know what to do i 'll go see mr tomwit he say and start uncertainly for the door the cashier 's falsetto stop he : no use peter mr tomwit surprise I too but no use talk about it i do not like to see such a important thing as the education of we color people hold up myself i have be think about it especially when i have make a fair square trade put in peter warmly exactly squeak the cashier and rather than let you project be delay i be go to offer you the old dillihay place at exactly the same price peter -- eight hundred the dillihay place yes that be west of town it be bigger by twenty acre than old man tomwit 's place peter consider the proposition i 'll have to carry this before the son and daughter of benevolence mr hooker the cashier repeat the smile that bracket he thin nose in wrinkle that be with you but you know what you say go with the nigger here in town and besides i will not promise how long i 'll hold the dillihay place real estate be brisk around here now i do not want to delay a good work on account of not have a location mr hooker turn away to a big ledger on a breast-high desk and apparently be about to settle himself to the endless routine of bank work peter know the dillihay place well it lack the timber of the other tract still it be fairly desirable he hesitate before the tarnished grill what do you think about it tump you will not make a mistake in buy answer the high voice of mr hooker at he ledger i don ' think you 'll make no mistake in buyin ' peter repeat tump 's bass peter turn back a little uncertainly and ask how long it would take to fix the new deed he have a notion of make a fly canvass of the officer of the son and daughter in the interim he be surprise to find that mr hooker already have the deed and the note ready to sign in anticipation of peter 's desire here the banker bring out the set of papers i 'll take it decide peter and if the lodge do not want it i 'll keep the place myself i like to deal with a man of decision pipe the cashier a wrinkled smile on he sharp face peter push in he bag of collection then mr hooker sign the deed and peter sign the land note they exchange the instrument peter receive the crisp deed bind in blue manuscript cover it rattle unctuously to peter it be he first step toward a second tuskegee the two negro walk out of the planter 's bank fill with a sense of well-doing tump pack be openly proud of have be connect even in a casual way with the purchase as he walk down the step he turn to peter don ' reckon nobody could git a deed off on you wid stopper in it do you we do not know any such word as ` stop ' tump declare peter gaily for peter be gay the whole incident at the bank be begin to please he the meeting of a sudden difficulty he quick decision -- it hold the quality of leadership napoleon have it the two color man step briskly through the afternoon sunshine along the mean village street here and there in front of they doorway sit the merchant yawn and talk or watch pig root in the pile of waste in peter 's heart come a wonderful thought he would make he industrial institution such a model of neatness that the whole village of hooker 's bend would catch the spirit the white people should see that something clean and uplifting could come out of niggertown the two race ought to live for a mutual benefit it be a fine generous thought for some reason just then there flicker through peter 's mind a picture of the arkwright boy sit hunch over in the cedar glade stare at the needle all this musing be brush away by the sight of old mr tomwit cross the street from the east side to the livery-stable on the west that human desire of want the person who have wrong you to know that you know you injury move peter to hurry he step and to speak to the old gentleman mr tomwit have be a confederate cavalryman in the civil war and there be still a faint breeze and horsiness about he he be a hammered-down old gentleman with hair thin but still jet-black a seamed sunburned face and a flatten nose he voice be always a friendly roar now when he see peter turn across the street to meet he he halt and call out at once : now peter i know what be the matter with you i do not do you right peter go closer not care to take the whole village into he confidence how come you to turn down my proposition mr tomwit he ask after we have agree and draw up the papers we-e-ell i have to do it peter explain the old man loudly why mr tomwit a white neighbor want I to peter boom the cavalryman who mr tomwit henry hooker talk I into it peter it be a mean trick peter i do you wrong he stand nod he head and rub he flatten nose in a impersonal manner yes i do you wrong peter he acknowledge loudly and look frankly into peter 's eye the negro be immensely surprise that henry hooker have do such a thing a thought come that perhaps some other henry hooker have move into town in he absence you do not mean the cashier of the bank old mr tomwit draw out a plug of black mule tobacco set some gapped discolor tooth into corner nod at peter silently at the same time utilize the nod to tear off a large quid he roll tin about with he tongue and after a few moment adjust it so that he could speak yeah he proceed in a muffle tone they be not but one henry hooker he be the one and only henry he say if i sell you my land you would put up a nigger school and bring in so many blackbird you would run I clean off my farm he say it would ruin the whole town a nigger school would peter be astonished why he do not talk that way to I natchelly natchelly agree the old cavalryman dryly -- henry have a different way to talk to ever ' man peter in fact proceed peter mr hooker sell I the old dillihay place in lieu of the deal i miss with you old mr tomwit move he quid in surprise the hell he do that at least show he do not think a negro school would ruin the value of he land he own farm all around the dillihay place old mr tomwit turn he quid over twice and spat thoughtfully that you deed in you pocket with the air of a man certain of be obey he hold out he hand for the blue manuscript cover protrude from the mulatto 's pocket peter hand it over the old gentleman unfold the deed then move it carefully to and from he eye until the typewriting be adjust to he focus he read it slowly with a movement of he lip and a drool of tobacco-juice finally he finish remark i be damned in a deliberate voice return the deed and proceed across the street to the livery-stable which be front by a old mulberry-tree with several chair under it in one of these chair he would sit for the remainder of the day make a occasional loud remark about the weather or the crop and watch the horse pass in and out of the stable siner have vaguely enjoy old mr tomwit 's discomfiture over the deed if it be discomfiture that have move the old gentleman to he sententious profanity but the negro do not understand henry hooker 's action at all the banker have abuse he position of trust as holder of a deed in escrow snap up the sale himself then he have sell peter the dillihay place it be a queer shift tump pack catch he principal 's mood with that chameleon-like mental quality all negro possess dat henry hooker criticize tump allus be a lil ole dried-up snake in de grass he abuse he position of trust say peter gloomily i must say he motive seem very obscure to I dat sho be a fine way to put hit say tump admiringly why do you suppose he buy in the tomwit tract and sell I the dillihay place ask for a opinion tump begin twiddle military medal and corrugated the skin on he inch-high brow now you put it to I lak dat peter he answer with importance i wonder ef dat gimlet-haided white man be not put some stopper in dat deed he guv you he mout of such remark as that from tump always annoyed peter tump 's intellectual method be to talk sense just long enough to gain he companion 's ear and then produce something absurd and quash the tentative interest siner turn away from he and say piffle tump be defensive at once ' t be not piffle either i 's talkin ' sense nigger peter shrug and walk a little way in silence but the soldier 's nonsense stick in he brain and worry he finally he turn rather irritably stopper -- what do you mean by stopper tump open he jet eye and they yellowish whites i mean nigger - stopper he reiterate amaze in he turn negro-stopper -- peter begin to laugh sardonically and abruptly quit the conversation such rank superiority irritated the soldier to the nth power look heah black man i know i _ be _ right heah lonme look at dat-aiuh deed maybe i can find 'em i know i suttinly be right peter walk on pay no attention to the request until tump catch he arm and draw he up short look heah nigger say tump in a different tone i fade dad deed fuh ten iron man a ' i reckon i get a once-over comin ' fuh my money the soldier be plainly mobilize and ready to attack to fight tump to fight any negro at all would be peter 's undoing it would forfeit the moral leadership he hope to gain moreover he have no valid grounds for a disagreement with tump he pass over the deed and the two negro move on they way to niggertown tump trudge forward with eye glue to paper he face pucker in the unaccustomed labor of read he thick lip move at the individual letter and construct they bunglingly into syllable and word he be try to uncover the verbal camouflage by which the astute white brush away all rights of all black man whatsoever to peter there grow up something sadly comical in tump 's effort the big negro might well typify all the color folk of the south struggle in a web of law and custom they do not understand misplace they suspicion befog and fearful a certain penitence for have be irritated at tump softened peter that be all right tump there be nothing to find at that moment the soldier begin to bob he head eh eh eh w-wait a minute he stammer whut di b ` lieve i do foun ' it i sho be heah she be heah 's di nigger-stopper je lak i tol ' you tump mark a sentence in

deal every one agree that the cashier 's chicanery be a droll and highly original turn to give to a negro exclusion clause draw into a deed then too it involve several legal point highly congenial to the hooker 's bend intellect could the son and daughter of benevolence recover they hundred dollar could henry hooker force they to pay the remain seven hundred could not siner establish he school on the dillihay place regardless of the clause since the cashier would be estop from obtain a injunction by he own instrument as a matter of fact the son and daughter of benevolence send a committee to wait on mr hooker to see what action he mean to take on the note that pay for he spurious deed this bring another harvest of rumor street gossip report that henry have compromise for this that and the other amount that he would not compromise that he have persuade the fool nigger into signing still other instrument peter never know the truth he be not on the committee but high above the legal phase of interest lay the warm fact that peter siner a negro graduate of harvard on he first tilt in hooker 's bend affair have ride to a fall this pleased even the village woman whose mind could not follow the subtle trickery of legal disputation the whole affair simply prove what the white village have know all along : you can not educate a nigger hooker 's bend warm with pleasure that half of its population be ineducable white sentiment in hooker 's bend react strongly on niggertown peter siner 's prestige be no more the cause of higher education for negro take a mighty slump junius gholston a

offspring she say she have throw away year of self - sacrifice year of wash a thousand little comfort she money would have buy all for nothing for less than nothing to ship a fool nigger up north and to ship he back of all niggertown caroline be the most unforgiving because peter have wound she in she pride every other negro in the village feel that genial satisfaction in a great man 's downfall that be balm to small soul but the old mother know not this consolation peter be she proxy it be she who have fall the only person in niggertown who continue amiable to peter siner be cissie dildine the octoroon perhaps have other criterion by which to judge a man than he success or mishap deal with a pettifogger two or three day after the catastrophe cissie make a excursion to the siner cabin with a plate of cookie cissie be careful to place she visit on exactly a normal footing she bring she little cake in the role of one who see no evil speak no evil and hear no evil but somehow cissie 's visit increase the old woman 's wrath she remain obstinately in the kitchen and make remark not only audible but arrest through the thin partition that separate it from the poor living-room cissie be hardly inside when a voice state that it hate to see a gal run after a man try to bait he with a lot of fum-diddle cissie give peter a single wide-eyed glance and then attempt to ignore the bodiless comment here be some cookie mr siner begin the girl rather nervously i think you and ahnt carolin ' -- yeah i ` magine dey 's fuh I jeer the spectral voice might like they conclude the girl with a little gasp i suttinly don ' want no light-fingered hussy ma ` yin ' my son proceed the voice a ' de whole dildine fambly 'll bear watchin ' -lrb- illustration : in the siner cabin old caroline siner berate she boy -rrb- will not you have a seat ask peter exquisitely uncomfortable cissie hand he she plate in confusion why no mr siner she hasten on in she careful grammar i just -- run over to -- to fling herse ' f in a nigger 's face 'cause he be be north and get make a fool uv boom the hidden censor i must go now gasp cissie peter make a harry gesture wait -- wait till i get my hat he put the plate down with a swift glance around for he hat he find it and stride to the door follow the girl the two hurry out into the street follow by indistinct stricture from the kitchen cissie breathe fast with open lip they move rapidly along the semicircular street almost with a sense of flight the heat of the early autumn sun sting they through they clothes for some distance they walk in a nervous silence then cissie say : you mother certainly hate I peter no say peter try to soften the situation it be I she be terribly hurt about -- he nod to-ward the white section -- that business cissie open she clear brown eye you own mother turn against you oh she have a right to be begin peter defensively i ought to have read that deed it be amazing i do not but i -- i really be not expect a trick mr hooker seem so -- so sympathetic -- he come to a lame halt stare at the dust through which they pick they way of course you be not expect trick cry cissie warmly the whole thing show you be a gentleman use to deal with gentleman but of course these hooker 's bend negro will never see that peter surprised and grateful look at cissie she construction of the swindle be more flattering than any apology he have be able to frame for himself still cissie i ought to have use the greatest care -- i be not talk about what you ` ought ' state the octoroon crisply i be talk about what you be when it come to ` ought ' we color people must get what we can any way we can we fight from the bottom the speech hold a viperish quality which for a moment catch the brown man 's attention then he say : one thing be sure i have lose my prestige whatever it be worth the girl nod slowly with the other you have i suppose peter glance at cissie the temptation be strong to give the conversation a personal turn but he continue on the general topic : well perhaps it be just as well my prestige be a bit too flamboyant cissie all i have to do be to mention a plan the son and daughter do not even discuss it they put it right through that be not healthy we whole system of society all democracy be base on discussion we old witenagemot -- but it be not _ we _ old witenagemot say the girl well -- no admit the mulatto that be true they move along for some distance in silence when the girl ask : what be you go to do now peter teach and keep work for that training-school state peter almost belligerently you do not expect a little thing like a hundred dollar to stop I do you no-o-o concede cissie with some reserve of judgment in she tone presently she add you could do a lot better up north peter for whom why yourself say the girl a little surprised siner nod i think all that out before i come back here cissie a friend of mine name farquhar offer I a place with he up in chicago -- a string of garage you would like farquhar cissie he be a materialist with a absolutely inexorable brain he mechanize the universe i tell he i could not take he offer ` it be like this ' i argue : ` if every negro with a little ability leave the south we people down there will never progress ' it be really that way cissie it take a certain mental atmosphere to develop a people as a whole a few individual here and there may have the strength to spring up by themselves but the run of the people -- no i believe one of the greatest curse of the color race in the south be the continual drain of its best individual north farquhar argue -- just then peter saw that cissie be not attend he discourse she be walk at he side in a respectful silence he stop talk and presently she smile and say : you have not notice my new brooch peter she lift she hand to she bosom and twist the face of the trinket toward he you ought not to have make I show it to you after you recommend it yourself she make a little _ moue _ of disappointment it be a pretty bit of old gold that compliment the creamy skin peter begin admire it at once and negro fashion rather overstep the limit white beau set to they praise as he lean close to she at the moment the two be pass one of the oddest house in niggertown it be a two-story cabin build in the shape of a steamboat a little cupola represent a pilot-house and two iron chimney serve for smoke-stack this queer building have be build by a negro stevedore because of a deep admiration for the steamboat on which he have make he living instead of step at the front door this boat-like house have a stage - plank as peter stroll down the street with cissie admire she brooch and suffuse with a sense of she nearness he happen to glance up and see tump pack walk down the stage-plank come out and wait for they at the gate there be something grim in the ex-soldier 's face and in the set of he gross lip as the two come up but the aura of the girl prevent peter from pay much attention to it as the two reach tump peter have just lift he hand to he hat when tump make a quick step out at the gate in front of they and swing a furious blow at peter 's head cissie scream siner stagger back with flame dance before he eye the soldier lunge after he topple man with gorilla-like blow hot pain shoot through peter 's body he head roar like a gong the sunlight dance about he in flash the air be full of black fist smash he and not five foot away the bullet head of tump pack bob this way and that in the rapid shift of he attack a stab of pain cut off peter 's breath he stand with he diaphragm muscle tense and paralyzed make convulsive effort to breathe at that moment he glimpse the convexity of tump 's stomach he drop-kick at it with foot-ball desperation come a loud explosive groan tump seem to rise a foot or two in air turn over and thud down on he shoulder in the dust the soldier make no attempt to rise but curl up twist in agony peter stand in the dust-cloud wabbly with roar head he open mouth be full of dust then he become aware that negro be run in from every direction shout they voice whoop out what have happen who it be who have lick tump pack 's agonize spasm bring howl of mirth from the black fellow negro woman be in the crowd grin a little frightened but curious some be in mother-hubbard one have she hair half comb one side in a kinky mattress the other lie flat and grease down to she scalp when peter gradually become able to breathe and could think at all there be something terrible to he in tump 's silent attack and in this extravagant black mirth over mere suffering cissie be go -- have flee no doubt at the beginning of the fight the prostrate man 's tortured abdomen finally allow he to twist around toward peter he eye be pop and seem all yellow and streak with swollen vein i 'll git you fuh dis he wheeze spit dust you do n ' fight fair you -- the black chorus roll they head and pound one another in a gale of merriment peter siner turn away toward he home fill with sick thought he have never realize so clearly the open sore of niggertown life and its great need of healing yet this very episode would further bar he peter from any constructive work he foresee too plainly how the white town and niggertown would react to this fight there would be no discrimination in the scandal he peter siner would be group with the boot-legger and crap-shooter and women-chaser who fill niggertown with they brawl as a matter of simple fact he have be fight with another negro over a woman that he be subject to a attack without warn or cause would never become a factor in the analysis he know that very well two of peter 's tooth be loose he left jaw be swell he head throb with that queer perversity of human nerve he keep bite he sore tooth together as he walk along when he reach home he mother meet he at the door thanks to the swiftness with which gossip spread among black folk she have already hear of the fight and incidentally have form she judgment of the matter now she look in exasperation at she son 's swell face i ` clum ' ` fo ' gawd -- be not be home a week befo ' he be fightin ' over a nigger wench lak a roustabout peter 's head throb so he could hardly make out the detail of caroline 's face but mother -- he begin defensively i -- I sweatin ' over de wash-pot the negress go on so 's you could go up north a ' learn a lil sense heah you come back chasin ' a dutty slut but mother he beg thickly i be simply walk home with miss dildine miss dildine miss dildine explode the ponderous woman with a erase gesture ef you mean dat stuck-up fly-by-night cissie dildine say so and don ' stan ' thaiuh mouthin ' ` miss dildine miss dildine ' mother ask peter thickly through he swell mouth do you want to know what do happen i know i tol ' you to keep away fum dat hussy she be a fool ` bout she bright color a ' straight hair need not be givin ' herse ' f no air peter stand in the doorway steadying himself by the jamb the world still sway from the blow he have receive on the head what girl would you be willing for I to go with he ask in faint satire heah in niggertown peter nod the movement increase he headache none a-tall no niggertown wench a-tall when you mu ' ma ' y i 's ` speckin ' you to go off summuh a ' pick yo ' gal lak you go off to pick yo ' aidjucation she swing out a thick arm and look at peter out of the corner of she eye she head tilted to one side as negress do when they become dramatically serious peter leave he mother to she stare and go to he own room this constant implication among niggertown inhabitant that niggertown and all it hold be worthless mean unhuman depressed peter the mulatto know the real trouble with niggertown be it have adopt the white village 's estimate of it the sentiment of the white village be overpower among the imitative negro the black folk look into the eye of the whites and see themselves reflect as chaff and skum and slime and no human being ever suggest that they be aught else peter 's room be a rough shed paper with old newspaper all sort of yellow scare-head streak he wall hang up be a crayon enlargement of he mother she broad face as unwrinkled as a egg and draw almost white for the picture agent have discover the only way to please they black patron be to make they enlargement as nearly white as possible in one corner on a home-made book-rack stand peter 's library -- a greek book or two a old calculus a sociology a psychology a philosophy and a score of other volume he have accumulate in he four college year as peter he head ache look at these he realize how immeasurably remove he be from the cool abstraction of the study the brown man sit down in a ancient rocking-chair by the window lean back and close he eye he blood still whisper in he ear from he fight notwithstanding he justification he gradually become fill with self-loathing to fight -- to hammer and kick in niggertown 's dust -- over a girl it be a indignity peter shift he position in he chair and he thought take another trail tump 's attack have be sudden and silent much like a bulldog 's the possibility of a simple friendship between a woman and a man never enter tump 's head it never enter any niggertown head here all attraction be reduce to the simplest term of sex niggertown hold no delicate intimacy or reserve two youth could not go with the same girl black woman have no very great power of choice over they suitor the strength of a man 's arm isolate he sweetheart that do not seem right rest the power of successful mating entirely upon brawn as peter sit think it over it come to he that the progress of any race depend finally upon the woman have complete power of choose she mate it be woman alone who consistently place the love accent upon other matter than mere flesh and muscle only woman have much sex selectiveness or be incline to select individual with quality of mind and spirit for million of year these instinctive spiritualizer of human breed stock have be hamper in they choice of mate by the unrestrained right of the fight male indeed the great constructive work of chivalry in the middle age be to lay unconsciously the corner-stone of modern civilization by resign to the woman the power of choose from a group of male siner stir in he chair surprise at whither he reverie have lead he he wonder how he have stumble upon these thought have he read they in a book in point of fact a beating administer by tump pack have bring the brown man the first original idea he have entertain in he life by this time peter 's jaw have reach its maximum swell and be ease somewhat he look out of he little window wonder whether cissie dildine would choose he -- or tump pack peter be surprise to find blue dusk peer through he pane all the scare-head on he wall have lapse into a common obscurity as he rise slowly so as not to start he head hurt again he hear three rapid pistol shot in the cedar glade between niggertown and the white village he know this to be the time-honored signal of boot-legger announce that illicit whisky be for sale in the blackness of the glade chapter iv next day the siner-pack fight be the focus of news interest in hooker 's bend white mistress extract the story from they black maid and be amuse by it or deprecate cissie dildine 's moral as the mood move they along main street in front of the village store the merchant and hanger-on discuss the affair it be divert that a graduate of harvard should come back to hooker 's bend and immediately drop into such a fracas old captain renfrew one-time attorney at law and representative of he county in the state legislature sit under the mulberry in front of the livery-stable and plunge into a long monologue with old mr tomwit as listener on the uneducability of the black race take a horse sir expound the captain a horse can be train to add and put its name together out of a alphabet but no horse could ever write a promissory note and figure the interest on it sir take a dog i have know dog sir that could bring you mail from the post - office but i never see a dog stop on the way home sir to read a post - card here the old ex-attorney spat and renew the tobacco in a black brier then proceed to draw the parrallel between dog and horse and peter siner newly return from harvard god ` lmighty have set he limit on dog horse and nigger mr tomwit thus far and no farther take a nigger baby at birth a nigger baby have no fontanelle it have no window toward heaven its skull be seal up in darkness the nigger brain can never expand and absorb the universe sir it can never rise on the wing of genius and weigh the star nor compute the swing of the pleiade thus far and no farther it be congenital now take this peter siner and he disgraceful fight over a nigger wench would you expect a educate stud horse to pay no attention to a mare sir you can educate a stud till -- but hold on interrupted the old cavalryman i have know as gentlemanly stallion as -- as anybody the old attorney clear he throat momentarily take aback at this failure of he metaphor however he rally with legal suppleness : you be talk about thoroughbred sir i be sir good god tomwit you do not imagine i be compare a nigger to a thoroughbred sir on the street corner or pile around on cotton-bale down on the wharf the negro man of the village discuss the fight it be for the most part a purely technical discussion of blow and counter and kick and of the strange fact that a college education fail to enable siner utterly to annihilate he adversary jim pink stagg a dapper gentleman of ebony blackness of pin-stripe flannel and blue serge coat -- altogether a gentleman of many part -- sit on one of the bale and indolently watch a old black crone fishing from a ledge of rock just a little way below the wharf-boat around jim pink lounge and sprawl black man and youth stretch on the cotton-bale like cat in the sunshine jim pink be discuss peter 's education i ` fo ' gawd kaus not see no use goin ' off lak dat a ' den comin ' back a ' lettin ' a white man cheat you out 'n yo ' hide a ' taller a ' lettin ' a black man beat you up tull you have to ` kick he in the spivit ef a aidjucation do you any good a-tall you would be boun ' to beat de white man at one en ' uv de line or de black man at de udder ef peter be not to be foun ' at eider en ' wha be he um-m-m eh-h-h you sho speak a moufful jim pink come a assent chorus from the bale eventually such gossip die away and take another flurry when a report go abroad that tump pack be carry a pistol and mean to shoot peter on sight then this in turn cease to be news and of human interest it cling to peter 's mind longer than to any other person 's in hooker 's bend and it present to the brown man a certain problem in casuistry should he accede to tump pack 's possession of cissie dildine and give up see the girl such a course cut across all he fine-spun theory about woman have free choice of they mate however the harvard man could not advocate a socialization of courtship when he himself would be the first beneficiary the prophet whose finger point selfward be damned furthermore all niggertown would side with tump pack in such a controversy it be no uncommon thing for the very negro woman to fight over they beau and husband as for any social theory change this régime in the first place the negro could not understand the theory in the second it would have no effect if they could action never grow out of theory theory grow out of action a theory be a look - glass that reflect the past and make it look like the future but the glass really hide the future and when humanity come to a turn in its course there be always a smash-up and a blind groping for the lose path now in regard to cissie dildine peter be not precisely afraid of tump pack but he could not clear he mind of the fact that tump have be present with a medal by the congress of the united state for kill four man good sense and a care for he reputation and he skin tell peter to abandon he theory of free courtship for the time be this mean a renunciation of cissie dildine but he tell himself he renounce very little he have no reason to think that cissie care a picayune about he peter 's work keep he indoors for a number of day follow the encounter he be review some primary school work in order to pass a teacher 's examination that would be hold in jonesboro the county seat in about three week to the uninitiated it may seem strange to behold a harvard graduate stick down day after day pore over a pile of dog-eared school-book -- third arithmetic primary grammar beginner ' history of tennessee of the united state of england physiology hygiene it may seem queer but when it come to stand a wayne county teacher 's examination the specific answer to the specific question on a dozen old examination slip be worth all the degree harvard ever do confer so in he newspapered study peter siner look up long list of question and attempt to memorize the answer but the series of misstep he have make since return to hooker 's bend besiege he brain and draw he thought from he catechism it seem strange that in so short a time he should have wander so far from the course he have set for himself he career in niggertown form a record of slight mistake but they be not to be undo and they combined force have swing he a long way from the course he have plot for himself there be no way to explain hooker 's bend would judge he by the sheer surface of he work what he have mean to do he dream and altruism they would never surmise that be the irony of the thing then he think of cissie dildine who do understand he this thought might have be cissie 's cue to enter the stage of peter 's mind she oval creamy face float between peter 's eye and the dog-eared primer he think of cissie wistfully and of she lonely fight for good english good manners and good taste there be a pathos about cissie peter get up from he chair and look out at he high window into the early afternoon he have be pore over primer for three day stuff the most heterogeneous fact he head feel thick and slightly feverish through he window he see the side of another negro cabin but by look at a angle eastward he could see a field yellow with corn a valley and beyond a hill wood and glowing with the pageantry of autumn he think of cissie dildine again of walk with she among the burning maple and the golden elm he think of the restfulness such a walk with cissie would bring as he muse peter 's soul make one of those sharp liberating movement that occasionally visit a human be the danger of tump pack 's jealousy the loss of he prestige the necessity of learn the specific answer to the examination question all drop away from he as trivial and inconsequent he turn from the window put away he book and question-slip pick up he hat and move out briskly through he mother 's room toward the door the old woman in the kitchen must have hear he for she call to he through the partition and a moment later she bulky form fill the kitchen entrance she wipe she hand on she apron and look at he accusingly wha you gwine son for a walk the old negress tilted she head aslant and look fixedly at he you 's gwine to dat cissie dildine 's peter peter look at he mother surprised and rather disconcert that she have guess he intention from he mere footstep the young man change he plan for he walk and begin a diplomatic denial : no i be go to walk by myself i be tired i be play out tired repeat he mother doubtfully you be not do nothin ' but set a ' turn th ` ugh book a ' write on a lil piece o ' paper peter be vaguely amuse in he weariness but think that he conceal he mirth from he mother that get tiresome after a while she grunt she skepticism as peter move for the door she warn he : peter you know ef tump pack see you

old negress turn back to the kitchen huh boy you be fotch up on lef ' - over she say and disappear through the door peter walk to the gate let himself out and start off on he constitutional he tiff with he mother renew all he nervousness and sense of failure he litany of mistake renew they dolor in he mind a autumn wind be blow and long plume of dust whisk up out of the curving street and sweep over the ill-kept yard past the cabin and toward the sere field and chromatic wood the wind beat at the brown man the dust whisper against he clothes make he squint he eye to a crack and tickle he nostril at each breath when peter have go two or three hundred yard he become aware that somebody be walk immediately behind he tump pack pop into he mind he look over he shoulder and then turn through the veil of fly dust he make out some one and a moment later identify not tump pack but the gangling form of jim pink stagg clothe in a dark-blue sack-coat and white flannel trousers with pin stripe it be the sort of costume affect by interlocutor of minstrel show it have a minstrel trigness about it as a matter of fact jim pink be a sort of semi-professional minstrel ordinarily he run a pressing-shop in the niggertown crescent but occasionally he impress all the dramatic talent of niggertown and really do take the road with a minstrel company these barn-storming expedition reach down

humorous and tump 's mishap be slap-stick to he nevertheless he do smile the incident fill he with extraordinary relief and buoyancy at the next corner he make some excuse to jim pink and turn off up a alley \* \* \* \* \* peter walk along with he shoulder square and the dust pepper he back not till tump be lift from he mind do he realize what a incubus the soldier have be peter have be force into a position where if he have kill tump he would have be ruin if he have not he would probably have murder now he be free -- for thirty day he swing along briskly in the warm sunshine toward the multicolored forest the day have suddenly become glorious presently he find himself in the back alley near cissie 's house he be pass chicken-house and stable hog in open pen grunt expectantly at he footstep peter have not mean to go to cissie 's at all but now when he see he be right behind she dwelling she seem radiantly accessible to he still it strike he that it would not be precisely the thing to call on cissie immediately after tump 's arrest it might look as if -- then the thought come that as a neighbor he should stop and tell cissie of tump 's misfortune he really ought to offer he service to cissie if he could do anything at cissie 's request he might even aid tump pack himself peter get himself into a generous glow as he charge up a side alley around to a rickety front gate let niggertown criticize as it would he be brace by a high altruism peter do not shout from the gate as be the fashion of the crescent but walk up a little graveled path line with dusty box-shrub and tap at the unpainted door door in niggertown never open straight away to visitor a covert inspection first take place from the edge of the window-blinds peter stand in the whipping dust and the caution of the inmate spur he impatience to see cissie at last the door open and cissie herself be in the entrance she stand quite still a moment look at peter with eye that appear frightened i -- i be not expect to see you she stammer no i come by with news cissie news she seem more frightened than ever peter you -- you have not -- she pause regard he with big eye tump pack 's be arrest explain peter quickly sense the tragedy in she thought i come by to tell you if there be anything i can do for you -- or he i 'll do it he altruistic offer sound rather foolish in the actual say he could not tell from she face whether she be glad or sorry what do they arrest he for carry a pistol she pause a moment will he -- get out soon he be sentence for thirty day cissie drop she hand with a hopeless gesture oh be not this all sickening -- sickening she exclaim she look tired ghost of sleepless night circle she eye suddenly she say come in oh do come in peter she reach out and almost pull he in she be so urgent that peter might have fancy tump pack at the gate with he automatic he do glance around but see nobody pass except the arkwright boy the hobbledehoy walk down the other side of the street hand thrust in pocket with the usual discontented expression on he face cissie slam the door shut and the two stand rather at a loss in the sudden gloom of the hall cissie break into a brief mirthless laugh peter it be hard to be nice in niggertown i -- i just happen to think how folk would gossip -- you come here as soon as tump be arrest perhaps i would better go suggest peter uncomfortably cissie reach up and catch he lapel oh no do not feel that way i be glad you come really here let 's go through this way to the arbor it be not a bad place to sit she lead the way silently through two dark room before she open the back door peter could hear cissie 's mother and a younger sister move around the outside of the house to give up the arbor to cissie and she company the arbor prove a trellis of honeysuckle over the back door with a bench under it a film of dust lay over the dense foliage and a few withered bloom prick its grayish green the earthen floor of the arbor be beat hard and bare by the naked foot of child cissie sit down on the bench and indicate a place beside she i have be so uneasy about you i have be wonder what on earth you could do about it it be a snarl all right he say and almost immediately begin discuss the peculiar _ impasse _ in which he difficulty with tump have land he cissie sit listen with a serious almost tragic face give a little nod now and then once she remark in she precise way : the trouble with a gentleman fight a rowdy the gentleman have all to lose and nothing to gain if you do not live among you own class peter you life will simmer down to a endless diplomacy you mean deceit i suppose no i mean diplomacy but that be not a very healthy frame of mind -- always to be suppress and guard yourself peter do not know about that he be incline to argue the matter but cissie would not argue she seem to assume that all of she statement be axiom truth reduce to the simplest possible mental term and that proof be unnecessary if not impossible so the topic go into the discard be bake my brain over a lot of silly little exam question complain peter can you trace the circulation of the blood i think it leave the grand central station through the right aorta and then after a schedule run of nine minute you can hear it come up the track through the left ventricle with all the passenger eager to get off and take some refreshment at the lung i have the general idea but the exact route get I cissie laugh accommodatingly i wonder why it be necessary for everybody to know that once i do i could follow the circulation the right way or backward must have be harder backward go against the current cissie laugh again a girl 's part in a witty conversation might seem easy at first sight she have only to laugh at the proper interval however these interval be not always distinctly mark some girl take no chance and laugh all the time cissie 's appreciation be the sedative peter need the relief of she laughter and she presence run along he nerve and unkinked they like a draft of kentucky special after a debauch the curve of she cheek the tilt of she head and the lift of she dull-blue blouse at the bosom weave a great restfulness about peter the brooch of old gold glint at she throat the heavy screen of the arbor give they a sweet sense of privacy the conversation meander this way and that and become quite secondary to the feeling of the girl 's nearness and sympathy they talk drift back to peter 's mission here in hooker 's bend and cissie be say : the trouble be peter we be out of we _ milieu _ some portion of peter 's brain that be not bask in the warmth and invitation of the girl answer quite logically : yes but if i could help these people cissie reconstruct we life here culturally -- cissie shake she head not culturally this opposition shunt more of peter 's think to the topic in hand he pause interrogatively racially say cissie racially repeat the man quite lose cissie nod look straight into he eye you know very well peter that you and i be not -- be not anything near full blood you know that racially we do not belong in -- niggertown peter never know exactly how this extraordinary sentence have come about but in a kind of breath he realize that he and this almost white girl be not of niggertown no doubt she have be argue that he peter who be one sort of man be try to lead quite another sort of man move by different racial impulse and such lead could only come to confusion he see the implication at once it be a extraordinary idea a explosive idea such as cissie seem to have the faculty of touch off he sit stare at she it be the white blood in he own vein that have send he struggle up north that have bring he back with this flame in he heart for he own people it be the white blood in cissie that keep she struggle to stand up to speak a unbroken tongue to gather around she the delicate atmosphere and charm of a gentlewoman it be the caucasian in they bury here in niggertown it be they part of the tragedy of million of mixed blood in the south they common problem a feeling of they joint isolation bring peter to a sense of keen and tingling nearness to the girl she be talk again very earnestly almost tremulously : why do not you go north peter i think and think about you stay here you simply can not grow up and develop here and now especially when everybody doubt you if you would go north -- what about you cissie you say we be together -- oh i be a woman we have not the chance to do as we will a kind of titillation go over peter 's scalp and body then you be go to stay here and marry -- tump he utter the name in a queer voice tear start in cissie 's eye she bosom lift to she quick breathing i -- i do not know what i be go to do she stammer miserably peter lean over she with a drum heart he hear she catch she breath you do not care for tump he ask with a dry mouth she gasp out something and the next moment peter feel she body sink limply in he groping arm they cling together closely quiveringly three night of vigil each think miserably and wistfully of the other have wear the nerve of both man and girl until they be ready to melt together at a touch she soft body cling to he own the little nervous pressure of she arm she ease breathing at he neck wipe away siner 's long sense of strain strength and peace seem to pour from she be into he by a sort of spiritual osmosis she resign she head to he palm in order that he might lift she lip to he when he please after all there be no way for a man to rest without a woman all he can do be to stop work for a long time they sit transport amid the dusty honeysuckle and withered bloom but after a while they begin talk a little at a time of the future they future they feel so indissolubly join that they could not imagine the future find they apart there be no need for any more trouble with tump pack they would marry quietly and go away north to live peter thought of he friend farquhar he wonder if farquhar 's attitude would be just the same toward cissie as it be toward he north be the burden of the octoroon 's dream they would go north to chicago there be two hundred and fifty thousand negro in chicago a city within itself three time the size of nashville up north she and peter could go to theater art gallery could enter any church could ride in street-cars railroad-train could sleep and eat at any hotel live authentic life it be cissie plan she emancipation plan to escape she lifelong disability oh i 'll be so glad so glad so glad she sob and draw peter 's head passionately down to she deep bosom chapter v peter siner walk home from the dildine cabin that night rather dread to meet he mother for it be late cissie have serve sandwich and coffee on a little table in the arbor and then have keep peter hour afterward around he still hang the glamour of cissie 's little supper he could still see she rounded elbow that bent softly backward when she extend a arm and the glimpse of she bosom when she lean to hand he cream or sugar she have accomplish the whole supper in the white manner with all poise and daintiness in fact no one be more exquisitely polite than a octoroon woman when she desire to be polite when she elevate the subserviency of she race into graciousness however the pleasure and charm of cissie be fading under the approach abuse that caroline be sure to pour upon the girl peter dread it he walk slowly down the dark semicircle planning how he could best break to he mother the news of he engagement peter know she would begin a long bill of complaint -- how badly she be treat how she have sacrifice herself she comfort how she have wash and scrub she would surely charge cissie with be a thief and a drab and all the announcement of engagement that peter could make would never induce the old woman to soften she abuse indeed they would make she worse so peter walk on slowly smell the haze of dust that hang in the blackness out on the big hill in the glade peter catch a occasional glimmer of light where crap-shooter and boot-legger be begin they nightly carousal these evidence of illicit trade bring peter a thrill of disgust in a sort of clear moment he see that he could not keep cissie in such a sty as this he could not rear in such a place as this any child that might come to he and cissie he thought drift back to he mother and he dread of she tongue the siner cabin be dark and tightly shut when peter let himself in at the gate and walk to the door he stand a moment listening and then gently press open the shutter a faint light burn on the inside a night-lamp with a old-fashioned brass bowl it sit on the floor turn low at the foot of he mother 's bed the mean room be mainly in shadow the old-style four-poster in which caroline sleep be a indistinct mound the air be close and foul with the bad ventilation of all negro sleeping-room the brass lamp turn low add smoke and gas to the tight quarter the odor catch peter in the nose and throat and once more stir up he impatience with he mother 's disregard of hygiene he tiptoe into the room and decide to remove the lamp and open the high small window to admit a little air he move noiselessly and have stoop for the lamp when there come a creaking and a heavy sigh from the bed and the old negress ask : be dat you son peter be tempt to stand perfectly still and wait till he mother doze again thus put off she inevitable tirade against cissie but he answer in a low tone that it be he whut you gwine do wid dat lamp son go to bed by it mother well bring hit back she breathe heavily and move restlessly in the old four-poster as peter stand up he see that the patched quilt be all askew over she shapeless bulk evidently she have not be rest well peter 's conscience smite he again for worry he mother with he courtship of cissie yet what could he do if he have woo any other girl in the world she would have be equally jealous and grieve it be inevitable that she should be disappointed and bitter it be bind up in the very part and parcel of she sacrifice a great sadness come over peter he almost wish he mother would berate he but she continue to lie there breathe heavily under she disarrange cover as peter pass into he room the old negress call after he to remind he to bring the light back when he be through with it this time something in she tone alarm peter he pause in the doorway be you sick mother he ask the old woman give a yawn that change to a groan i -- i be not feelin ' so good what be the matter mother my stomach my -- but at that moment she sentence change to a inarticulate sound and she double up in bed as if catch in a spasm of acute agony peter hurry to she thoroughly frightened and see sweat streaming down she face he stare down at she mother you be sick what can i do he cry with a man 's helplessness she open she eye with a effort panting now as the edge of the agony pass there be a movement under the quilt and she thrust out a rubber hot-water bottle fill it -- fum de kittle she wheeze out then relax into groan and wipe clumsily at the sweat on she shine black face peter seize the bottle and run into the kitchen there he find a brisk fire pop in the stove and a kettle of water boil it show he to he further alarm that he mother have be try to minister to herself until force to bed the man scald a finger and thumb pour water into the flare mouth but after a moment twist on the top and hurry into the sick-room he reach the old negress just as another knife of pain set she writhe and sweating she seize the hot-water bottle push it under the quilt and press it to she stomach then lay with eye and tooth clench tight and she thick lip curl in a grin of agony peter set the lamp on the table say he be go for the doctor and start the old woman hunch up in bed with the penuriousness of she station and sacrifice she beg peter not to go then groan out go tell mar ' renfrew but the next moment do not want peter to leave she peter say he would get nan berry to stay while he be go the berry cabin lay diagonally across the street peter run over thump on the door and shout he mother 's need as soon as he receive a answer he start on over the big hill toward the white town peter be seriously frightened he run to dr jallup 's across the big hill be a series of renew striving for speed every segment of he journey seem to seize he and pin he down in the midst of the night like a bug catch in a black jelly he seem to progress not at all now he be in the cedar glade he muffle flight drive in the sentry of the crap-shooter and gamester blink out they light and listen to he foot stumble on through the darkness after a endless run in the glade peter find himself on top of the hill amid boulder and outcrop limestone and cedar-shrub he flash - light pick out these object limn they sharply against the blackness then drop they into obscurity again he try to run faster he impatience subdivide the distance into yard and foot now he be approach that boulder now he be pass it now he be ten foot beyond twenty thirty perhaps he mother be die alone save for stupid nan berry now he be go down the hill past the white church all that be visible be its black spire set against a web of star he be make no speed at all he pant on he heart hammer he leg drum with lilliputian pace now he be among the village store all utterly black at one point the echo of he foot chatter back at he as if some other futile runner strain amid vast space of blackness after a long time he find himself run up a residential street and presently far ahead he see the glow of dr jallup 's porch light its beam have the appearance of come from a vast distance when he reach the place he fling he breast against the top panel of the doctor 's fence and hold on exhaust he draw in he breath and begin shout hello doctor peter call persistently and as he command more breath he call louder and louder hello doctor hello doctor hello doctor in tone edge on panic the doctor 's house might have be dead somewhere a dog begin bark high in the southern sky a star look down remotely on peter 's frantic haste the black man stand in the black night with cry : hello doctor hello doctor hello doctor at last in despair he try to think of other doctor he think of telephone to jonesboro just as he decide he must turn away there come a stir in the dead house a flicker of light appear on the inside now here now there it steady into a tiny beam and approach the door the door open and dr jallup 's head and breast appear illuminate against the black interior my mother 's sick doctor begin peter in immense relief who be it inquire the half-clad man impassively caroline siner she be be take with a -- the physician lift he light a trifle in a effort to see peter lemme see : she be that fat nigger woman that live in a three-roomed house -- i 'll show you the way say peter she be very ill the half-dressed man shake he head no can ` line siner owe I a five-dollar doctor 's bill already we county medical association make a rule that no nigger should -- with a dry mouth peter siner stare at the man of medicine but my god doctor gasp the son i 'll pay you -- have you get the money there in you pocket ask jallup impassively a sort of chill travel deliberately over peter 's body and shake he voice n-no but i can get it -- yes you can all get it state the physician in dull irritation i be tired of you nigger run up doctor ' bill nobody can collect you never have more than the law allow you wages never get big enough to garnishee he voice grow querulous as he relate he wrong no i be not go to see can ` line siner if she want I to visit she let she send ten dollar to cover that and back debt and i 'll -- the end of he sentence be lose in the closing of he door the light he carry decline from a beam to a twinkling here and there and then vanish in blackness dr jallup 's house become dead again the little porch light in its glass box might have be a candle burning before a tomb peter siner stand at the fence lick he dry lip with nerve vibrate like a strike bell he push himself slowly away from the top plank and find he leg so weak that he could hardly walk he move slowly back down the unseen street the dog he have disturb give a few last growl and settle into silence peter move along wet he dry lip and stir feebly among he dazed thought hunting some other plan of action there be a tiny burning spot on the left side of he occiput it feel like a heated cambric needle which have be slip into he scalp then he realize that he must go home get ten dollar and bring they back to dr jallup he start to run but almost topple over on he leaden leg he plod through the darkness retrace the endless trail to niggertown as he pass a dark mass of shrubbery and tree he recall he mother 's advice to ask aid of captain renfrew it be the old renfrew place that peter be pass the negro hesitate then turn in at the gate in the bare hope of obtain the ten dollar at once inside the gate peter 's foot encounter the scatter brick of a old walk the negro stand and call captain renfrew 's name in a guard voice he be not at all sure of he action peter have call twice and be just about to go when a lamp appear around the side of the house on a long portico that extend clear around the building bath in the light of the lamp which he hold over he head there appear a old man wear a worn dress gown who be it he ask in a wavery voice peter tell he name and mission the old captain continue hold up he light oh peter siner caroline siner 's sick all right i 'll have jallup run over i 'll phone he peter be begin he thanks preparatory to go when the old man interrupt no just stay here until jallup come by in he or he 'll pick we both up it 'll save time come on inside what be the matter with old caroline the old dressing-gown lead the way around the continuous piazza to a room that stand open and brightly light on the north face of the old house a great relief come to peter at this unexpected succor he follow around the piazza try to describe caroline 's symptom the room peter enter be a library a rather stately old room line with book all around the wall to about as high as a man could reach space for door and window be let in among the book-case the volume themselves seem compose mainly of history and old-fashioned scientific book if peter could judge from a certain severity of they binding on a big library table burn a gasolene-lamp which throw a brilliant whiteness all over the room the table be pile with book and periodical book and papers be heap on every chair in the study except a deep morri chair in which the old captain have be sit a big meridional globe about two and a half foot in diameter gleam through a film of dust in the embrasure of a window the whole room have the womanless look of a bachelor 's quarter and be flavor with tobacco and just a hint of whisky old captain renfrew evidently have be read when peter call from the gate now the old man go to a telephone and ring long and briskly to awaken the boy who sleep in the central office peter fidget as the old captain stand with receiver to ear hard to wake the old gentleman speak into the transmitter but be talk to peter do not be so uneasy peter human being be harder to kill than you think there be a kindliness even a fellowship in captain renfrew 's tone that spread like oil over peter 's raw nerve it occur to the negro that this be the first time he have be address as a authentic human be since he conversation with the two northern man on the pullman up in illinois it surprise he it be sufficient to take he mind momentarily from he mother he look a little closely at the old man at the telephone the captain wear few index of kindness line of settle sarcasm net he eye and droop away from he old mouth the very swell of he full temple and they crinkly vein mark a sardonic old man at last he rouse central over the wire and impressed upon he the necessity of create a stridor in dr jallup 's dead house and a moment later a continue buzz in the receiver betoken the operator 's effort to do so the old gentleman turn around at last hold the receiver a little distance from he ear i understand you go to harvard peter yes sir peter take he eye momentarily from the telephone the old southerner in the dressing-gown scrutinize the brown man he clear he throat you know peter it give I a -- a certain satisfaction to see a harvard man in hooker 's bend i be a harvard man myself peter stand in the brilliant light astonished not at captain renfrew 's be a harvard man -- he have know that -- but that this old gentleman be tell the fact to he peter siner a negro graduate of harvard it be extraordinary it be tantamount to a offer of friendship not patronage such a offer in the south disturbed peter 's poise it touch he queerly and it seem to explain why captain renfrew have receive peter so graciously and be now arrange for dr jallup to visit caroline peter be move to the conventional query ask in what class the captain have be graduate but while he very voice be ask it peter think what a strange thing it be that he peter siner a negro and this lonely old gentleman he benefactor be spiritual brother both spring from the loin of harvard that ancient mother of soul -lrb- illustration : the old gentleman turn around at last -rrb- from the darkness outside dr jallup 's horn summmon the two man captain renfrew get out of he gown and into he coat and turn off he gasolene light they walk around the piazza to the front of the house in the street the head-light of the roadster shot divergent ray through the darkness they go out the old captain take a seat in the car beside the physician while peter stand on the running-board a moment later the clutch snarl and the machine putter down the street peter cling to the standard of the auto top peer ahead the man remain almost silent once dr jallup watch the dust that lay model in sharp light and shadow under the head-lights mention lack of rain they route do not lead over the big hill they turn north at hobbett 's corner drive around by river street and presently enter the northern end of the semicircle the speed of the car be reduce to a crawl in the bottomless dust of the crescent the head-light sweep slowly around the cabin on the concave side of the street bring they one by one into stark brilliance and drop they into obscurity the smell of refuse of uncleaned stable and sty and outhouse hang in the darkness peter bent down under the top of the motor and point out he place a minute later the machine come to a noisy halt and be choke into silence at that moment in the sweep of the head-light peter see viny berry one of nan 's younger sister come up from niggertown 's public well carry two bucket of water viny be hurry plash the water over the side of she bucket the importance of she mission be write in she black face she be awful thirsty she call to peter in guard tone nan call I to fetch some fraish water fum de

evict man go into peter 's room and shut the door peter unnerve grope and presently find and light a lamp he put it down on he little table among he primary papers and examination papers he indicate to captain renfrew the single chair in the room but the old gentleman stand motionless in the mean room with its head - line streak wall sound of the heavy lifting of peter 's mother come through the thin door and partition with painful clearness peter open he own small window for the air in he room be foul captain renfrew stand in silence with a remote sarcasm in he wrinkled eye what be in he heart why he have subject himself to the noisomeness of fail flesh peter have not the faintest idea once out of studently habit he glance at peter 's philosophic book but apparently he read the title

stare a queer terror seize she she begin such a wail that it arouse other in niggertown at the sound they get out of they bed and come to the siner cabin they eye big with mystery and fear at the sight of old caroline 's motionless body they lift they voice through the night the lamentation carry far beyond the confines of niggertown the last gambler in the cedar glade hear it and it break up they gaming and drinking white person live near the black crescent be wake out of they sleep and listen to the eerie sound it rise and fall in the darkness like a melancholy organ chord the wail of the woman quiver against the heavy grief of the man the half-asleep listener be move by its weirdness to vague and sinister fancy the dolor veer away from what the anglo-saxon know as grief and be shoot through with the uncanny and the terrible white child crawl out of they small bed and grope they way to they parent the woman shiver and ask of the darkness _ what _ make the negro howl so nobody know -- least of all the negro nobody suspect that the bedlam hark back to the jungle to black folk in african kraal beat tom-tom and howl not in grief but in a ecstasy of terror lest the soul of they dead might come back in the form of tiger or python or devil and work woe to the tribe through the night the negro wail on perform through custom a ancient rite of which they know nothing they suppose themselves heartbroken over the death of caroline siner amid this din peter siner sit in he room stun by the sudden take off of he mother the reproach that she have express to old captain renfrew cling in peter 's brain the brown man have never before realize the faint amusement and condescension that have flavor all he relation with he mother since he return home but he know now that she have feel he disapproval of she lifelong habit that she see he never explain or attempt to explain he thought to she assume she to be too ignorant as she put it a fool the pathos of he mother 's last day what she have expect what she have receive come to peter with the bitterness of what be finish and irrevocable she have be dead only a few minute yet she could never know he grief and remorse she could never forgive he she be utterly remove in a few minute in a moment in the fail of a breath the finality of death overpower he into he room through the thin wall come the catch of numberless sob the long-drawn open wail and the spasm of sob blur voice call o gawd gawd hab mercy hab mercy now word be lose in the midst of confusion the clamor boom through the thin partition as if it would shake down he newspapered wall with wet cheek and a ache throat peter sit by he table stare at he book-case in silence like a white man the dim light of he lamp fall over he psychology and philosophy these be the book that have give he precedence over the old washwoman who keep he in college it be read these book that have make he so wise that the old negress could not even follow he thought now in the hour of he mother 's death the back of he metaphysics blink at he emptily what signify they endless page about dualism and monism about phenomenon and noumenon he mother be dead and she have die embittered against he because he have read and have be bewilder by these empty wordy volume a sense of profound defeat of be ultimately fool and cozen by the subtlety of white man fill peter siner he have eat at they table but they meat be not he meat the uproar continue stand out of the din arise the burden of negro voice hab mercy gawd hab mercy in the morning the lady of tabor come and wash and dress caroline siner 's body and make it ready for burial for twenty year the old negress have pay ten cent a month to she society to insure she burial and now the lodge make ready to fulfil its pledge after many coming and going the black woman call peter to see they work as if for he approval the huge dead woman lay on the four-poster with a sheet spread over the lower part of she body the ministrant have clothe it in the old black - silk dress with its spreading seam and panel of different material it remind peter of the new dress he have mean to get he mother and of the modish suit which at that moment mold he own shoulder and waist the pitifulness of she sacrifice tremble in peter 's throat he press he lip together and nod silently to the black lady of tabor presently the white undertaker a silent little man with a brisk yet sympathetic air come and make some measurement he talk to peter in undertone about the finish of the casket how much the knight of tabor would pay what peter want then he speak of the hour of burial and mention a somewhat early hour because some of the negro want to ship as roustabout on the up-river packet which be due at any moment these decision ask of peter keep prick he and break through the stupefaction of this sudden tragedy he keep nod a mechanical agreement until the undertaker have arrange all the detail then the little man move softly out of the cabin and go step away through the dust of niggertown with professional briskness a little later two black grave-digger set out with pick and shovel for the negro graveyard numberless preparation for the funeral be go on all over niggertown the knight of tabor be put on they regalia negro woman be send out hurry notice to white mistress that they would be unable to cook the noonday meal dozen of negro girl flock to the hair-dressing establishment of miss mallylou speer all be bent on have they wool straighten for the obsequy and as only a few of they could be accommodate the little room be pack a smell of burn hair pervade it the girl sit around wait they turn most of they already have they hair down -- or rather loose for it stand out in thick mat the hair-dresser have a small oil stove on which lay heating half a dozen iron comb with a hot comb she tease each strand of wool into perfect straightness and then plaster it down with a greasy pomade the result be a stiff effect something like the hair of the japanese it require about three hour to straighten the hair of one negress the price be a dollar and a half by half-past nine o'clock a crowd of negro man in lodge apron and with spear and negro woman with sash of ribbon over they shoulder and across the breast assemble about the siner cabin in the dusty curving street be range half a dozen battered vehicle -- a hearse a delivery wagon some rickety buggy and a hack presently the undertaker arrive with a dilapidated black hearse which he use especially for negro he jump down get out he strap and coffin stand direct some negro man to bring in the coffin then hurry into the cabin with he air of brisk precision he place the coffin on the stand near the bed then a number of man slip the huge black body into it the undertaker settle old caroline 's head against the cotton pillow run he hand down beside she cheek and tip she face just so then he put on the cover which leave a little oval opening just above she dead face the sight of old caroline 's face see through the little oval pane move some of the woman to renew sob eight black man take up the coffin and carry it out with the slow wide-legged step of roustabout parson ranson in a rusty prince albert coat take peter 's arm and lead he to the first vehicle after the hearse it be a delivery wagon but it be the best vehicle in the procession as peter follow the coffin out he see the knight and lady of tabor line up in march order behind the van the man hold they spear and sword at attention the woman carry flower behind the marcher come other old vehicle a sorry procession at fifteen minute to ten the bell in the steeple of the color church toll a single stroke the sound quiver through the sunshine over niggertown at its signal the poor procession move away through the dust at interval the bell toll after the vanish train as the negro pass through the white town the merchant loll in they door ask passer-by what negro have die the idler under the mulberry in front of the livery-stable nod at the old negro preacher in he long greenish-black coat and dawson bobb remark : well old parson ranson 's go to tell 'em about it to-day and he shift he toothpick with a certain effect of humor old mr tomwit ask if he companion have ever hear how newt bodler a wit famous in wayne county once break up a negro funeral with a hornet ' nest the idler nod a smile affirmative as they watch the cortège go past they have all hear it but mr tomwit would not be deny he sally forth into humorous reminiscence another loafer contribute a anecdote of how he have tie rope to a dead negro so as to make the corpse sit up in bed and frighten the mourner all they tale be of the vintage of the year immediately succeed the civil war -- pioneer humor such as convulse the reader of peck 's bad boy mr bowser sut lovingood the favorite dramatic property of such writer be the hornet ' nest the fall ladder the banana peel they cultivate the humor of contusion the wit of impact this style still hold the stage of hooker 's bend in tell these tale the white villager mean no special disrespect to the negro funeral it simply remind they of humorous thing so they tell they joke like the naïve child of the soil that they be at last the poor procession pass beyond the white church around a bend in the road and so vanish presently the bell in niggertown cease toll \* \* \* \* \* peter always remember he mother 's funeral in fragment of intolerable pathos -- the lifting of old parson ranson 's hand toward heaven the song of the black folk the murmur of the first shovelful of dirt as it be lower to the coffin and the final raw mound of earth litter with a few die flower with that he mother -- who have be so near to and so disappointed in she son -- be blot from he life the other event of the funeral flow by in a sort of dream : he move about the negro be speak to he in the queer overtone one use to the bereaved he be be drive back to niggertown he reenter the siner cabin one or two of he friend stay in the room with he for a while and say vague thing but there be nothing to say later in the afternoon cissie dildine and she mother bring he dinner to he vannie dildine a thin yellow woman utter a few disjointed word about sister can ` line be a good woman and stop amid sentence there be nothing to say death have cut a wound across peter siner 's life not for day nor week nor month would he existence knit solidly back together the poison of he ingratitude to he faithful old black mother would for a long long day prevent the healing chapter vii during a period follow he mother 's death peter siner 's life drift emptily and without purpose he have the feeling of one convalesce in a hospital he day pass unconnected by any thread of purpose they be like card scatter on a table meaning nothing at time he struggle against he lethargy when he awake in the morning and find the sun shine on he dusty primer and examination papers he would think that he ought to go back to he old task but he never do in he heart grow a conviction that he would never teach school at hooker 's bend he would rise and dress slowly in the still cabin think he must soon make new plan and take up some work he never decide precisely what work he thought trail on in vague idle design in fact during peter 's reaction to he shock there begin to assert itself in he that capacity for profound indolence inherent in he negro blood to a white man time be a cumulative excitant continuous and absolute idleness be impossible he must work hunt fish play gamble or dissipate -- do something to burn up the accumulate sugar in he muscle but to a negro idleness be a increase balm it be a stretch of he leg in the sunshine a cat-like purring of he nerve while he thought spread here and there in inconsequence like water without a channel make little humorous eddy wind this way and that into oddity and fantasy without ever feel that constraint of sequence which continually operate in a white brain and it be this quality that make negro the entertainer of child _ par excellence _ peter siner 's mental slacken make he understandable and give he a certain popularity in nigger-town black man fall into the habit of drop in at the siner cabin where they would sit outdoors with chair prop against the wall and philosophize on the desultory life of the crescent sometimes they would relate they adventure on the river packet and around the dock at paducah cairo st joe and st loui usually a recountal of drunkenness gaming fight venery arrest jail sentence petty peculation and escape through these iliad of vagabondage run a irresponsible gaiety a non-morality and a kind of unbrave zest for adventure they tell of they defeat and flight with as much relish and humor as of they charge and victory and while the spirit be thoroughly pagan these account be full of the clichés of religion a roustabout whom every one call the persimmon confide to peter that he mean to cut loose some log in a raft up the river float they down a little way tie they up again and claim the prize-money for salvage they god willing the persimmon be so call from a scar on he long slanting head a steamboat mate have once find he asleep in the passageway of a lumber pile which the boat be lading and he wake the negro by hit he in the head with a persimmon bolt in this there be nothing unusual or worthy of a nickname the point be the mate have be mistake : the persimmon be not work on he boat at all in time this become one of the stock anecdote which pilot and captain tell to passenger travel up and down the river the persimmon be a queer-looking negro he head be a long diagonal from its peak down to he pendent lower lip for he have no chin the salient point on this black slope be the persimmon 's sad protrude yellow eyeball over which the lid always droop about half close a habitual tipping of this melancholy head to one side give the persimmon the look of one ponder and deplore the amount of sin there be in the world this saintly impression the persimmon 's conduct and language never bear out at the time of the persimmon 's remark about the raft two of peter 's caller jim pink stagg and parson ranson take the roustabout to task jim pink base he objection on the grounds of glut the labor market ef we nigger keep turnin ' too many raf 's loose fuh de prize-money he warn somebody 's goin ' to git ` spicious a ' you 'll ruin a good thing the persimmon absorb this with a far-away look in he half-closed eye it be a ticklish job argue parson ranson a ' i would not want to wuck at de debbil 's task aroun ' de ribber can ` se you mout fall in persimmon a ' git drownd i would not do sich a thing a-tall admit the persimmon but i jes ' natchelly get to git ten dollar to he ' p pay on my divo ` ce i kai not see whut you want wid a divo ` ce say jim pink yawning when you be ma'ie

a time lak my lawyer say on what grounds ask peter curiously desuhtion desertion uh huh i desuhted 'em jim pink shake he head pick up a pebble and begin idly juggle it make it appear double single treble then single again too many divo ` ce in di country now persimmon he moralize well whut 's de cause uv 'em ask the persimmon suddenly bring he protrude yellow eye around on the sleight-of-hand performer jim pink be slightly take aback then he say : ` spicion nothin ' but ` spicion yeah ` spicion growl the persimmon ` spicion a ' de husban ' leadin ' a irreg ` lar life jim pink look at he companion curiously the husban ' -- leadin ' a irreg ` lar life yeah -- the persimmon nod grimly -- the husban ' comin ' home at onexpected hour you know whut i mean jim pink jim pink let he pebble fall and lower the fore leg of he chair softly to the ground now look heah persimmon you don ' want to be draggin ' no foreign disco ` se into yo ' talk heah befo ' mr siner a ' parson ranson the persimmon rise deliberately all i want to say be i drapp off 'n de matrimonial tree three time a ` ready jim pink a ' i think i feel somebody shakin ' de limb ag ` in the old negro preacher rise too a little behind jim pink now boy boy he placate you jes think dat persimmon yeah admit persimmon i jes think it but ef i b ` lieve ever ` thing be so whut i think be so i would part jim pink 's wool wid a brickbat parson ranson try to make peace but the persimmon spread he hand in a gesture that include the three man now i be not sayin ' nothin ' he state solemnly a ' i be not makin ' no threat but ef anything happen you-all kai not say that nobody didn ' tell nobody about nothin ' with this the persimmon walk to the gate let himself out still look back at jim pink and then start down the dusty street mr stagg seem uncomfortable under the persimmon 's protrude yellow stare but finally when the roustabout be go he shrug regain he aplomb and remark that some nigger spend they time in studyin ' ` bout thing they have not no info ` mation on whatever then he stroll off up the crescent in the other direction all this would have make fair minstrel patter if peter siner have share the white conviction that every emotion express in a negro 's patois be humorous unfortunately peter be too close to the negro to hold such a tenet he know this quarrel be none the less rancorous for have be couch in the queer circumlocution of black folk and behind it all shine the background of racial promiscuity out of which it spring it be like look at a open sore that touch all of niggertown man and boy young girl and woman it cause tragedy murder fight and desertion in the black village as regularly as the rotation of the calendar yet there be no public sentiment against it peter wonder how this attitude of he whole people could possibly be with the query the memory of ida may come back to he with its sense of dim pathos it seem to peter now as if they young and uninstructed hand have destroy a safety-vault to filch a penny the reflex of a thought of ida may always bring peter to cissie it always stir up in he a desire to make this young girl 's path gentle and smooth there be a fineness a delicacy about cissie that it seem to peter ida may have never possess then too cissie be move by a passion for self-betterment she deserve a cleaner field than the niggertown of hooker 's bend peter take parson ranson 's arm and the two move to the gate by common consent it be no longer pleasant to sit here the quarrel they have hear somehow have flavor they surroundings peter turn he step mechanically northward up the crescent toward the dildine cabin nothing now restrain he from call on cissie he would keep no dinner wait he would not be warn and berate on he return home the nagging jealous love of he mother have end as the two man walk along it be bear in upon peter that he mother 's death definitely end one period of he life there be no reason why he should continue he present unsettled existence it seem best to marry cissie at once and go north further time in this place would not be good for the girl even if he could not lift all niggertown he could at least help cissie he have have no idea when he first plan he work what a tremendous task he be essay the white village have look upon the negro so long as non-moral and non - human that the negro with the flexibility of they race have assimilate that point of view the whites try to regulate the negro by endless law the negro have come to accept this and it seem that they verily believe that anything not discover by the constable be permissible mr dawson bobb be niggertown 's conscience it be best for peter to take from this atmosphere what be dearest to he and go at once the brown man 's thought come trail back to the old negro parson hobble at he side he look at the old man hesitate a moment then tell he what be in he mind parson ranson 's face wrinkle into a grin you be gwine to git ma'ied and i think i would have you perform the ceremony this suggestion throw the old negro into excitement I mr peter yes why not why mr peter i kai not jine you a ' miss cissie dildine peter look at he astonished why can not you why not you git a white preacher well deliberate peter gravely it be a matter of principle with I parson ranson i think we color people ought to be more self-reliant more self-serving we ought to lead we own life instead of be mere echo of white thought he make a swift gesture move by this passion of he life i do not mean racial equality to my mind racial equality be a empty term one might as well ask whether pink and violet be equal but what i do insist on be autonomous development the old preacher nod stare into the dust sho ` tonomous ` velopment peter see that he language if not he thought be far beyond he old companion 's grasp and he lack the patience to simplify himself why do not you want to marry we parson parson ranson lift he brow and fill he forehead with wrinkle well i dunno you a ' miss cissie act too much lak white folk fuh a nigger lak I to jine you mr peter peter make a sincere effort to be irritated but he be not that be no way to feel it be exactly what i be talk about -- racial self-reliance you have marry hundred of color couple ya-as suh -- the old fellow scratch he black jaw -- i kin yoke up a pair uv ordina ' y nigger all right sometimes dey stick sometimes dey do not the old man shake he white kinky head i 'll bust in a ' try to hitch up you-all i -- i dunno whedder de cer ` mony will hol ' away up north or not it 'll be all right anywhere parson say peter seriously you name on the marriage-certificate will -- can you write n-no suh after a brief hesitation peter repeat determinedly : it 'll be all right and by the way of course this will be a very quiet wedding yas-suh the old man bob importantly i would not mention it to any one no suh no suh i don ' blame you a-tall mr peter wid dat tump pack gallivantin ' roun ' wid a forty-fo ' hit would keep ` mos ' anybody 's weddin ' ve ' y quiet onless he wuz lookin ' fuh a short cut to heab 'n as the two negro pass the berry cabin nan berry thrust out she spiked head and call to peter captain renfrew want to see he peter pause with quicken interest in this strange old man who have come to he mother 's death-bed with a doctor peter ask nan what the captain want nan do not know wince washington have tell nan that the captain want to see peter bluegum frake have tell wince jerry dillihay have tell bluegum but any further meanderings of the message when it start or what its detail might be nan could not state it be a typical message from a resident of the white town to a denizen of niggertown such message be deliver to any black man for any other black man not only in the village but anywhere in the outlying country it may be pass on by a dozen or a score of mouth before it reach its objective it may be a day or a week in transit but eventually it will be deliver verbatim this queer system of communication be a relic of slavery when the master would send out word for some special negro out of two or three hundred slave to report at the big house however as peter approach the dildine cabin thought of he approach marriage drive from he mind even old captain renfrew 's message he heart beat fast from have make he first formal step toward wedlock the thought of have cissie all to himself sweep he nerve in a gust he open the gate and run up between the dusty line of dwarf box eager to tell she what he have do he thump on the crack unpainted door and impatiently wait the skirmish of observation along the edge of the window-blind this be unduly draw out presently he hear woman 's voice whisper to each other inside they seem urgent almost angry voice now and then he catch a sentence : what difference will it make i could not why could not you because -- that be because you have be to nashville oh well -- a chair be move over a bare floor a little later footstep come to the entrance the door open and cissie 's withered yellow mother stand before he vannie offer she hand and inquire after peter 's health with a stop voice that instantly recall he mother 's death after the necessary moment of talk the mulatto inquire for cissie the yellow woman seem slightly ill at ease cissie be not so well peter she be not ill n-no but the excitement a ' ever ` thing -- answer vannie vaguely in the flush of he plan peter be keenly disappointed it be very important mr dildine vannie 's dry yellow face frame the ghost of a smile ever ` thing a young man 's get to say to a gal be ve ' y important peter it seem to peter a poor time for a jest he face warm faintly it -- it be about some of the detail of we -- we wedding if you 'll excuse she to-day peter a ' come after supper -- peter hesitate and be about to go away when cissie 's voice come from a inner room tell she mother to admit he the yellow woman glance at the door on the left side of the hall cross over and open it stand to one side while peter enter and close it after he leave the two alone the room into which peter step be dark after the fashion of negro house only after a moment 's survey do he see cissie sit near a big fireplace make of rough stone the girl start to rise as peter advance toward she but he solicitously forbid it and hurry over to she when he lean over she and put he arm about she he ardor be slightly dampen when she give he she cheek instead of she lip to kiss surely you be not too ill to be kiss he rally faintly you kiss I i think we have agree peter you be not to come in the daytime any more oh be that it peter pat she shoulder cheerfully do not worry i have just remove any reason why i should not come any time i want to cissie look at he she dark eye large in the gloom what have you do get a preacher to marry we on my way now for a license drop in to ask if you 'll be ready by tomorrow or next day the girl gasp but peter -- peter draw a chair beside she in a serious argumentative mood yes i think we ought to get marry at once no reason why we should not get it over with -- why what be the matter so soon after you mother 's death peter it be to get away from hooker 's bend cissie -- to get you away i do not like for you to stay here it be all so -- he break off not care to open the disagreeable subject the girl sit stare down at some fagot smolder on the hearth at that moment they break into flame and illuminate she sad face you 'll go will not you ask peter at last with a faint uncertainty the girl look up oh

somehow stir he he take she in he arm press she cheek to he and after a moment kiss she lip with the tremble ardor of a bridegroom cissie remain passive a moment then put up he hand turn he face away and slowly release herself peter be take aback what _ be _ the matter cissie i can not go peter peter look at she with a feeling of strangeness can not go the girl shake she head you mean -- you want we to live here cissie sit exceedingly still and barely shake she head the mulatto have a sensation as if the portal which disclose a new and delicious life be slowly close against he he stare into she oval face you do not mean cissie -- you do not mean you do not want to marry I the fagot on the hearth burn now with a cheerful flame cissie stare at it breathe rapidly from the top of she lung she seem about to faint as peter watch she the jealousy of the male creep over he look here cissie he say in a queer voice you -- you do not mean after all that tump pack be -- oh no no she face show

throw I off i -- now i have forget how i mean to say it tear of frustration well up in she eye she mood be alarming almost hysterical peter begin comforting she there there dear dear cissie what be the matter do not say it at all then inconsistently he add : you say i copy white man well what of it cissie breathe she relief at have be give the thread of she discourse she sit silent for a moment with the air of one screw up she courage it be this she say in a uncertain voice : sometimes we -- we -- girl -- here in niggertown copy the wrong thing first peter look blankly at she the wrong thing first cissie oh yes we -- we begin on clothes and -- and hair and -- and that be not the real matter why no-o-o that be not the real matter say peter puzzle cissie look at he face and become hopeless oh _ do not _ you understand lot of we -- lot of we make that mistake i -- i do so -- so peter i can not go with you she fling out the last phrase and suddenly collapse on the arm of she chair sob peter be amaze he get up sit on the arm of he own chair next to hers and put he arm about she bend over she mother she she distress be so great that he say as earnestly as he ignorance permit : yes cissie i understand now but he tone belie he word and the girl shake she head yes i do cissie he repeat emptily but she only shake she head as she lean over he and she tear slowly form and trickle down on he hand then all at once old caroline 's accusation against cissie flash on peter 's mind she have steal that dinner in the turkey roaster after all it so startle he that he sit up straight cissie also sit up she stop cry and sit look into the fire you mean -- moral say peter in a low tone cissie barely nod she wet eye fix on the fire i see i be stupid the girl sit a moment draw deep breath at last she rise slowly well -- i be glad it be over i be glad you know she stand look at he almost composedly except for she breathing and she tear-stained face you see peter if you have be

expression i find out when you kiss I under the arbor it be too late then she stand erect with dismissal very clearly write in she attitude peter walk out of the room chapter viii with a certain feeling of clumsiness peter grope in the dark hall for he hat then as quietly as he could let himself out at the door outside he be surprise to find that daylight still linger in the sky he think night have fall the sun lay behind the big hill but its red ray pour down through the bole of the cedar tint long delicate avenue in the dusty atmosphere above he head a sharp chill in the air presage frost for the night somewhere in the crescent a boy yodel for he dog at about half-minute interval with the persistence of child peter walk a little distance but finally come to a stand in the dust look at the negro cabin not know where to go or what to do cissie 's confession have destroy all he plan it have leave he as adynamic as have he mother 's death it seem to peter that there be a certain similarity between the two event both be sudden and desolating and just as he mother have vanish utterly from he reach so now it seem cissie be no more cissie the clear-eyed cissie the ambitious cissie the refine have vanish away and in she place stand a thief the thing be grotesque peter begin a sudden shuddering in the cold then he begin move toward the empty cabin where he sleep and keep he thing he move along talk to himself in the dusty emptiness of the crescent he decide that he would go home pack he clothes and vanish a st loui boat would be down that night and he would just have time to pack he clothes and catch it he would not take he book he philosophy he would let they remain in the newspapered room until all crumble into uniform philosophic dust and the teaching of aristotle blow about niggertown then as he think of travel north the vision of the honeymoon he have just plan revive he numb brain into a dismal ache he look back through the dusk at the dildine roof it stand black against a opalescent sky out of the foreground bend over it arise a clump of tall sunflower in whose silhouette hang a suggestion of yellow and green the whole scene quiver slightly at every throb of he heart he think what a fool he be to allow a picaresque past to keep he away from such a woman how easy it would be to go back to the soft luxury of cissie to tell she it make no difference and somehow just at that moment it seem not to then the point of view which peter have be four year acquire sweep away the impulse and it leave he move toward he cabin again empty cold and planless he be draw out of he reverie by the soft voice of a little negro boy ask he apprehensively whom he be talk to peter stop draw forth a handkerchief and dab the moisture from he cold face in the meticulous fashion of college man with the boy come a dog which be cautiously smell peter 's shoe and trousers both boy and dog be investigate the phenomenon of peter peter in turn look down at they with a feeling that they have materialize out of nothing what do you say he ask vaguely the boy be suddenly overcome with the excessive shyness of negro child and barely manage to whisper : i -- i ast wh-who you wuz a-talkin ' to be i talk the little negro nod undecided whether to stand he ground or flee peter touch the child 's crisp hair i be talk to myself he say and move forward again the child instantly gain confidence at the slight caress take a fold of peter 's trousers in he hand for friendliness and the two trudge on together wh-whut you talkin ' to yo ' se ' f for peter

aware during he walk over the big hill and through the village be he last scene with cissie he go over it again and again repeat they conversation invent new reply frame new action question more fully into the octoroon 's vague confession and he benumbed acceptance of it the moment he mind complete the little drama it start again from the very begin at captain renfrew 's gate this mental mummery pause long enough for he to vacillate between walk in or go around and shout from the back gate it be a point of etiquette in hooker 's bend that negro shall enter a white house from the back stoop peter have no desire to transgress this custom on the other hand if captain renfrew be receive he as a fellow of harvard the back door in its way would prove equally embarrassing after a certain indecision he compromise by enter the front gate and call the captain 's name from among the scatter brick of the old walk the house lay silent half smother in a dark tangle of shrubbery peter call twice before he hear the shuffle of house slipper and then see the captain 's dressing-gown at the piazza step be that you peter come a querulous voice yes captain i be tell you want to see I you have be deliberate in come criticize the old gentleman testily i send you word by some black rascal three day ago i just receive the message to-day peter remain discreetly at the gate yes well come in come in see if you can do anything with this damnable lamp the old man turn with a dignified drawing-together of he dress - gown and move back apparently the renovation of a cranky lamp be the whole content of the captain 's summons to peter there be something so characteristic in this incident that peter be move to a vague sense of mirth it be just like the old régime to call in a negro a special negro from ten mile away to move a jar of fern across the lawn or trim a box hedge or fix a lamp peter follow the old gentleman around to the back piazza face he study there lay out on the floor be all the part of a gasolene lamp together with a pipe-wrench a hammer a little old-fashioned vise a bar of iron and a envelop contain the mantel and the more delicate part of the lamp it be extraordinary to I criticize the captain why they can not make a gasolene lamp that will go and remain in a go condition have it be out of fix for three day ask peter sorry that the old gentleman should have lack a light for so long no growl the captain it start gasp at four o'clock last night so i put it out and go to bed i have be work at it this evening there be a little hole in the tip -- if i could see it -- a hair - size hole painfully small why any man want to make gasolene lamp with microscopic hole that ordinary intelligence must inform he will become clogged i can not conceive peter venture no opinion on this trait of lampmaker but say that if the captain know where he could get a oil hand-lamp for a little more light he think he could unstop the hole the captain look at he helper and shake he head i be surprise at you peter when i be you age i could see a aperture like that hole under the last quarter of the moon in this strong light i could have -- er -- lunge the cleaner through it sir you must have strain you eye in college he pause then add : you 'll find hand-lamp in any of the room front this porch i do not know whether they have oil in they or not -- the shiftless nigger that come around to take care of this building -- no dependence to be put in they when i try it myself i do even worse the old gentleman 's tone show that he be thaw out of he irritable mood and peter sense that he mean to be amusing in a austere unsmiling fashion the captain rub he delicate wrinkled hand together in a pleased fashion and sit down in a big porch chair to await peter 's assemble of the lamp the brown man start down the long piazza in search of a hand-light he find a lamp in the first room he enter return to the piazza sit down on the edge of it and begin he tinker the old captain apparently watch he with profound satisfaction presently after the fashion of the senile he begin endless and minute instruction as to how the lamp should be clean take the wire in you left hand peter -- that be right -- now hold the tip a little closer to the light -- no place the mantel on the right side -- that be the way i do it system the old man 's monologue run on and on and become a murmur in peter 's ear it be rather soothing than otherwise now and then it hold tremulous vibration that might have be from age or that might have be from some deep satisfaction mount even to joy but to peter that seem hardly probable no doubt it be senility the captain be a tottery old man past the age for any fundamental joy night have fall now and a darkness musky with autumn weed hem in the sphere of yellow light on the old piazza a black-and-white cat materialize out of the gloom purr and arch against a pillar the whole place be fill with a sense of endless leisure the old man the cat the perfume of the weed soothe in peter even the rawness of he hurt at cissie indeed in a way the old manor become a sort of apology for the octoroon girl the height and the reach of the piazza exaggerate by the darkness suggest a time when retinue of negro pass through its dignified colonnade those black folk be a part of the place they come and go pick up and use what they could and that be all life hold for they they be without wage without rights even to the possession of they own body so by necessity they take what they could that be only fifty-odd year ago thus in a way peter 's surroundings begin a subtle explanation of and apology for cissie the whole racial training of black folk in petty thievery and that this should have touch cissie -- the meanness the pathos of she fate move peter the negro be arouse from he reverie by the old captain 's get out of he chair and say very good and then peter see that he have finish the lamp the two man rise and carry it into the study where peter pump and light it a bit later its brilliant white light flood the room quite good the old captain stand rub he hand with he odd air of continued delight how do you like this place anyway peter he wrap he gown around he sit down in the old morri chair beside the book-piled table and indicate another seat for peter the mulatto take it aware of a certain flexing of hooker 's bend custom where negro unless old or infirm be not suppose to sit in the presence of whites do you mean the study captain yes the study the whole place it be very pleasant reply peter it have the atmosphere of age captain renfrew nod these old place pursue peter always give I a impression of statesmanship somehow i always think of grave old gentleman busy with the care of public policy the old man seem gratify you be sensitive to atmosphere if i may say it every southron of the old régime be a statesman by nature and training the complete care of two or three hundred negro a regard for they bodily moral and spiritual welfare inevitably lead the master into the impersonal attitude of statecraft it be a training sir in leadership in social thinking in if you please altruism the old gentleman thump the arm of he chair with a translucent palm yes sir negro slavery be god 's great lesson to the south in altruism and loving-kindness sir my boy i do believe with all my heart that the institution of slavery be place here in god 's country to rear up giant of political leadership that we nation might weather the revolution of the world oh the yankee be necessary i know that the old captain hold up a palm at peter as if repress a imminent retort i know the yankee be the martha of the nation they furnish food and fuel to the ship of state but my boy the reservoir of we country 's spiritual and mental strength the mary of we nation must always be the south virginia be the mother of president the captain 's oration leave he rather breathless he pause a moment then ask : peter have you ever think that we man of the leisure class owe a debt to the world peter smile i know the theory of the leisure class but i have have very little practical experience with leisure well that be a subject close to my heart as a scholar and a thinker i feel that i should give the fruit of my leisure to the world er -- in fact peter that be why i send for you to come and see I why you send for I peter be surprise at this turn precisely you here the old gentleman get himself out of he chair walk across to one of a series of drawer in he bookcase open it and take out a sheaf of papers and a quart bottle he bring the papers and the bottle back to the table make room for they put the papers in a neat pile and set the bottle at a certain distance from the heap now peter please hand I one of those wineglass in the religious section of my library -- i always keep two or three glass among my religious work in memory of the fact that we lord and master work a miracle at the feast of cana especially to bless the cup indeed peter thinking of that miracle at the wedding-feast i wonder sir how the prohibitionist can defend they conduct even to they own conscience because logically sir logically the miracle of we gracious lord completely cut away the ground from beneath they foot no wonder when the mikado send a japanese envoy to america to make a tentative examination of christianity as a proper creed for the state religion of japan -- no wonder with this miracle flout by the prohibitionist the embassy carry back the report that american really have no faith in the religion they profess shameful shameful place the glass there on the left of the bottle a little farther away from the bottle please just a trifle more thank you the captain pour himself a tiny glassful and its bouquet immediately fill the room there be no guess how old that whisky be i will not break the law of my country peter no matter how godless and sacrilegious those law may be therefore i can not offer you a drink but you will observe a second glass among the religious work and the bottle sit in plain view on the table -- er -- em he watch peter avail himself of he opportunity and then add now you may just drink to I stand as you be like that they drink peter stand the old gentleman seat it be just as necessary pursue the old connoisseur when peter be reseat it be just as necessary for a gentleman to have a delicate palate for the tint of the vine as it be for he to have a delicate eye for the tint of the palette nature bestow a taste both in art and wine on man which he should strive to improve at every opportunity it be a gift from god perhaps you would like another glass no then accommodate I he drain this one with peter standing work he withered lip back and forth to experience its full taste then swallow and smack now peter he say the reason i ask you to come to see I be that i need a man about this house that will be one phase of you work the more important part be that you shall serve as a sort of secretary i have here a manuscript he pat the pile of papers my handwriting be rather difficult i want you to copy this matter out and get it ready for the printer peter become more and more astonished be you offer I a permanent place captain renfrew he ask the old man nod i need a man with a certain liberality of culture i will no doubt have you run through book and periodical and make note of any point germane to my thesis peter look at the pile of script on the table that be very flattering captain but the fact be i come by you place at this hour because i be just in the act of leave here on the steamboat to-night the captain look at peter with concern on he face leave hooker 's bend yes sir why peter hesitate well my mother be dead -- yes but you -- you -- you work be still here peter the captain fall into a certain confusion a man 's work peter a man 's work do you mean my school-teaching then come a pause the conversation somehow have manage to leave they both somewhat at sea the captain begin again in a different tone : peter i wish you to remain here with I for another reason i be a old man peter anything could happen to I here in this big house and nobody would know it i do not like to think of it the old man 's tone quite paint he fear i be not afraid of death peter i have walk before god all my life save in one or two point which i believe in he mercy he have forgive I but i can not endure the idea of be find here some day in some unconsidered posture fall out of a chair or a-sprawl on the floor i wish to die with dignity peter as i have live then you mean that you want I to stay here with you until -- until the end captain the old man nod that be my desire peter for a honorarium which you yourself shall designate at my death you will receive some proper portion of my estate in fact the bulk of my estate because i leave no other heir i be the last renfrew of my race peter peter grow more and more amaze as the old gentleman unfold this strange proposal what queerer pleasanter berth could he find than that offer he here in the quietude of the old manor among book tend the feeble flame of this old aristocrat 's life a air of scholasticism hang about the library in some corner of this dark oaken library he philosophy would rest comfortably then it occur to peter that he would have to continue he sleep and eat in niggertown and since he mother have die and he rupture with cissie the squalor and smell of the crescent have become impossible he tell the old captain he objection as diplomatically as possible the old man make short work of they he want peter to sleep in the manor within call distance and he might begin this very night and stay on for a week or so as a sort of test whether he like the position or not the captain wait with some concern until peter agree to a trial after that the old gentleman talk on interminably of the south of the suffrage movement the destructive influence it would have on the home the irish question the indian question whether the mound-builder do not spring from the two lose tribe of israel -- a endless outpouring of curious fact quaint reasoning and extraordinary conclusion all deliver with the great dignity and in the flow period of a orator it be fully two o'clock in the morning when it occur to the captain that he new secretary might like to go to bed the old man take the hand-lamp which be still burn and lead the way out to the back piazza past a number of door to a corner bedroom he shuffle along in he carpet slipper follow by the black-and-white cat which run along make futile effort to rub itself against he lean shank peter follow in a sort of stupor from the flood of word idea and strange fancy that have be pour into he ear the captain turn off the piazza into one of those old-fashioned southern room with full-length window which be really glazed door a ceiling so high that peter could make out only vague concentric ring of stucco-work among the shadow overhead and a floor space of ball - room proportion in one corner be a huge canopy bed across from it a clothes-press of dark wood and in another corner a large screen hide the bathing arrangement peter 's bedroom be a sleep apartment in the old sense of the word before the term apartment have lose its dignity the captain place the lamp on the great table and indicate peter 's possession with a wave of the hand if you stay here peter i will put in a call-bell so i can awaken you if i need you during the night now i wish you healthful slumber and pleasant dream with that the old gentleman withdraw ceremoniously when the captain be go the mulatto remain standing in the vast expanse marveling over this queer turn of fortune why captain renfrew have select he as a secretary and companion peter could not fancy the magnificence of he surroundings revive he late dream of a honeymoon with cissie certainly in he fancy he have vision a honeymoon in pullman parlor car and suburban bungalow he have be mistake this great chamber rise about he like a correct proof of he desire into just such a room he would like to lead cissie into this great room that breathe pride and dignity what a glowing heart the girl would have make for its somber magnificence he walk over to the full-length window and open they then he unbolt the jalousy outside and swing they back the musk of autumn weed breathe in out of the darkness peter draw a long breath with a sort of wistful melting in he chest chapter ix a turmoil arouse peter siner the next morning and when he discover where he be in the big canopy bed in the great room he listen curiously and hear a continuous chattering and quarrel after a minute or two he recognize the voice of old rise hobbett rise be cook the captain 's breakfast and she perform this function in a kind of solitary rage she bang the vessel slam the stove-eye on and off fling the stove-wood about and keep up a snarl animadversion upon every topic that drift through she kinky head she call the kitchen a rat-hole state the captain must be as mean as the devil to live as long as he do complain that no one ever pay any attention to she that she might as well be a stray cat and so on as peter grow wider awake the monotony of the old negress 's rancor fade into a unobserved noise he sit up on the edge of he bed between the parted curtain and divine there be a bath behind the screen in the corner of he room sure enough he find two fray but clean towel a pan a pitcher and a small tub all make of tin peter assemble he find and begin splash he heavily molded chest with a feeling of well-being as he splash on the water he amuse himself by listen again to old rise she be now complain that some white young ` un have call she raving rise she hope god ` lmighty would send down two she bear and eat 'em up peter be amaze by the old crone 's ability to maintain a unending flow of concentrated and aimless virulence the kitchen of the renfrew manor be a separate building and presently peter see old rise carry great platter across the weed-grown compound into the dining-room she bear plate after plate pile high with cookery -- enough for a company of man a little later come a clangor on a rusty triangle as if she be summon a house party old rise do thing in a wholesale spirit peter start for he door but when he have open the shutter he stand hesitate breakfast introduce another delicate problem he decide not to go to the dining-room at once but to wait and allow captain renfrew to indicate whether he peter should break he fast with the master in the dining-room or with old rose in the kitchen a moment later he see the captain come down the long back piazza peter almost address he host but the old southerner proceed into the dining-room apparently without see peter at all the guest be gather he breath to call good morning but take the cue with a negro 's sensitiveness and let he eye run along the weed in the compound the dry stalk be weave with endless spider-web all white with frost peter stand regard they delicate geometry a moment longer and then reenter he room not know precisely what to do he could hear rise walk across the piazza to and from the dining - room and the clink of tableware a few minute later a knock come at he door and the old woman enter with a huge salver cover with steam dish the negress come into the room scowl and seem doubtful for a moment just how to shut the door and still hold the tray with both hand she solve the problem by back against the door tremendously then she see peter she straighten and stare at he with outraged dignity well ` fo ' gawd be i bringin ' dish-here breakfus ' to a nigger i suppose it be mine agree peter amuse but whuffo whuffo nigger be it dat you be not come to de kitchen a ' eat off 'n de shelf be you sick peter admit fair bodily vigor den whut de debbil be i

anger go over peter yes i do you ought to be ashamed to speak ill of the dead the crone toss she malicious head a little abashed perhaps yet very glad she have succeed in hurt peter she turn and go out the door mumble something which might have be apology or renew invective peter watch the old virago close the door and then sit down to he breakfast he anger presently die away and he sit wonder what could have happen to rise hobbett that have corrode she whole existence do she enjoy she vituperation she continual malice he try to imagine how she feel the breakfast rise have bring he be delicious : hot biscuit of feathery lightness three wide slice of ham a bowl of scramble egg a pot of coffee some preserved raspberry and a tiny glass of whisky the plate which captain renfrew have set before he guest be a delicate dawn pink ringed with a wreath of holly it be old worcester porcelain of about the decade of 1760 the coffee-pot be really a old whieldon teapot in broad cauliflower design age and careless heating have give the surface a fine reticulation he cup and saucer on the contrary be thick piece of ware such as the cabin-boy toss about on steamboat the whole ceramic mélange tell of the fortuity of english colonial and early american life of the migration of family westward no doubt once upon a time that dawn-pink worcester have marry into a whieldon cauliflower family a queer sort of genealogy might be trace among southern family through they mixture of tableware as peter muse over these implication of long ancestral line it remind he that he have none over he own past over the lineage of nearly every negro in the south hang a curtain even the name of the color folk mean nothing and give no hint of they kin and clan at the end of the war between the state peter 's people have select name for themselves casually as child pick up a pretty stone they mean nothing it occur to peter for the first time as he sit look at the chinaware that he know nothing about himself whether he kinsman be valiant or recreant he do not know even he own father he know little about except that he mother have say he name be peter like he own and that he have go down the river on a tie boat and be drown a faint sound attract peter 's attention he look out at he open window and see old rise make off the back way with something conceal under she petticoat peter know it be the unused ham and biscuit that she have cook for once the old negress hurry along without railing at the world she move with a silent but in a way self-respecting flight peter could see by the tilt of she head and the set of she shoulder that not only do she spoil gratify she enmity to mankind in general and the captain in particular but she be well within she rights in she acquisition she disappear around a syringa bush and be hear no more until she reappear to cook the noon meal as vitriolic as ever \* \* \* \* \* when peter enter the library old captain renfrew greet he with morning wish thus sustain the fiction that they have not see each other before that morning the old gentleman seem pleased but somewhat excite over he new secretary he move some of he book aimlessly from one table to another place they in exact pile as if he be just about to plunge into heroic labor and could not give time to such detail once he have begin as he arrange he book just so he clear he throat now peter we want to get down to this he announce dynamically do this thing shove this work out he start with tottery briskness around to he manuscript drawer but veer off to the leave to aline some magazine system peter system without system one may well be hopeless of perform any great literary labor but with system the constant pile up of brick on brick stone on stone -- it be the way rome be build my boy peter make a murmur suppose to acknowledge the correctness of this view eventually the old captain draw out he drawer of manuscript stand fumble with it uncertainly now and then he glance at peter a genuine secretary who stand ready to help he in he undertake the old gentleman pick up some sheet of he manuscript seem about to read they aloud but after a moment shake he head and say no we 'll do that to-night and restore they to they place finally he turn to he helper now peter he explain in do this work i always write at night it be quieter then -- less distraction my morning i spend downtown in conversation with my friend if you should need I peter you can walk down and find I in front of the livery-stable i sit there for a while each morning the gravity with which he give this schedule of he personal habit amuse peter who bow with a serious very well captain and in the meantime pursue the old man look vaguely about the room you will do well to familiarize yourself with my library in order that you may be properly qualify for you secretarial labor peter agree again and now if you will get my hat and coat i will be off and let you go to work conclude the captain with a air of continued urgency peter become thoroughly amuse at such a outcome of the old gentleman 's headlong attack on he work -- a stroll down to the village to hold conversation with friend the mulatto walk unsmilingly to a little closet where the captain hang he thing he take down the old gentleman 's tall hat a gray greatcoat worn shiny about the shoulder and tail and a finely carve walnut cane some reminiscence of the manners of butler which peter have see in theater cause he to swing the overcoat across he left arm and polish the thin nap of the old hat with he right sleeve he present it to he employer with a certain duplication of a butler 's obsequiousness he offer the overcoat to the old gentleman 's arm with the same air then he hold up the collar of the greatcoat with one hand and with the other reach under its skirt and draw down the captain 's long day coat with little jerk as if he be go through a ritual peter grow more and more hilarious over he barber 's manners it be he contribution to the old gentleman 's literary labor and he be do it beautifully so he think he be just make some minute adjustment of the collar when to he amazement captain renfrew turn on he damn it sir he flare out what do you think you be i do not engage you for a kowtow valet in wait sir i ask you sir to come under my roof as a intellectual co-worker as one gentleman ask another and here you be make these niggery motion they be disgust they be defile they be beneath the dignity of one gentleman to another sir what make it more degrading i perceive by you mannerism that you assume a specious servility sir as if you would flatter I by it the old lawyer 's face be white he angry old eye jerk peter out of he slight mummery the negro feel oddly like a grammar-school boy catch make face behind he master 's back it shock he into sincerer manners captain he say with a certain stiffness i apologize for my mistake but may i ask how you desire I to act simply naturally sir thunder the captain as one alumnus of harvard to another it be quite proper for a young man sir to assist a old gentleman with he hat and coat but without frippery and genuflection and absurdity the old man 's hauteur touch some spring of resentment in peter he shake he head no captain we lack of sympathy go deeper than manners my position here be anomalous for instance i can talk to you sit i can drink with you stand but i can not breakfast with you at all i do that _ in camera _ like a disgraceful divorce proceed it be precisely as i be treat come down here south again it be as i have be treat ever since i have be back it be -- he pause abruptly and swallow down the rancor that fill he no he repeat in a different tone there be no earthly excuse for I to remain here captain or to let you go on measure out you indulgence to I there be no way for we to get together or to work together -- not this far south let I thank you for a night 's entertainment and go peter turn about mean to make a end of this queer adventure the old captain watch he and he pallor increase he lift a unsteady hand no no peter he object not so soon this have be no trial no fair trial the little -- little -- er -- detail of we domestic life here they will -- er -- arrange themselves peter gossip -- talk you know we must avoid that the old lawyer stand stare with strange eye at he protégé i -- i be interested in you peter my action may seem -- odd but -- er -- a negro boy go off and do what you have do -- extraordinary i -- i have speak to you mother caroline about you often in fact peter i -- i make some little advance in order that you might complete you study now now do not thank I it be purely impersonal you seem bright i have often think we gentle people of the south ought to do more to encourage we black folk -- not -- not as social equal -- here the old gentleman make a wry mouth as if he have taste salt stay here and look over the library he break off abruptly we can arrange some ground of -- of common action some -- he settle the lapel of he great-coat with precision address he palm to the knob of he stick and march stiffly out of the library around the piazza and along the dismantle walk to the front gate peter stand utterly astonished at this strange information suddenly he run after the old lawyer and round the turn of the piazza in time to see he walk stiffly down the shaded street with tremulous dignity the old gentleman be much the same as usual a little shakier perhaps he tall hat a little more polished he shiny gray overcoat set a little more snugly at the collar chapter x the village of hooker 's bend amuse itself mainly with questionable jest that range all the way from the slightly brackish to the hopelessly obscene now in use this type of anecdote the hooker 's - bender must not be think to design a attack upon the decency of life on the contrary they be rely on the fact that they hearer have in the depths of they being a profound reverence for the object of they sally and so by take advantage of the moral shock they produce and link it to the idea of a absurdity they convert the whole psychical reaction into a explosion of humor thus the ring of raconteur tell blackguardly story around the stove in hooker 's bend store be in reality exercise one another in the more delicate sentiment of life and may very well be class as a round table

telephone mr cicero throgmartin for whom tump be work caution throgmartin to make sure that tump pack be in the sleeping-shack every night as he might get wind of the wedding and take a notion to bolt and stop it you know you can not tell what a fool nigger 'll do finish bobb throgmartin be mildly amuse promise the necessary precaution and say : it look like peter have put one over on tump and maybe a college education do help a nigger some after all the constable thought it be just luck well i dunno say throgmartin who be a philosopher and incline to view every matter from various angle

be funny damn thing nigger be never know a care nor trouble lord i wish i be as care-free as they be do not you though agree the constable with the weight of the white man 's burden on he shoulder for this be a part of the southern credo -- that all negro be gay care-free and happy and that if one could only be like the negro gay care-free and happy -- ah if one could only be like the negro none of this gossip reach peter directly but a sort of back-wash do catch he keenly through young sam arkwright and serve as a conundrum for several day one morning peter be bring a armful of grocery up the street to the old manor and he meet the boy come in the opposite direction the negro 's mind be center on a peculiar problem he have find in the renfrew library so accord to a habit he have acquire in boston he take the right-hand side of the pavement which chance to be the inner side this violate a hooker 's - bend convention which decree that when a white and a black meet on the sidewalk the black man invariably shall take the outer side for this _ faux pa _ the gangling youth stop peter fall to abuse and cursing he for he impudence he egotism he attempt at social equality -- all of which charge no doubt be echo from the round table such wrath over such a offense be unusual ordinarily a white villager would have think several uncomplimentary thing about peter but would have say nothing peter stop with a shock of surprise then listen to the whole diatribe with a rise sense of irritation and irony finally without a word he correct he mistake by retrace he step and pass sam again this time on the outside peter walk on up the street outwardly calm but he ear burn and the queer indignity stick in he mind as he go along he invent all sort of ironical remark he might have make to arkwright which would have be unwise then he think of sober reasoning he could have use which would perhaps have be just as ill-advised still later he wonder why arkwright have fall into such a rage over such a trifle peter feel sure there be some contribute rancor in the youth 's mind perhaps he have receive a scolding at home or a whipping at school or perhaps he be in the midst of one of those queer attack of megalomania from which adolescent be chronic sufferer peter fancy this and that but he never come within hail of the actual reason when the brown man reach the old manor the quietude of the library with its blacken mahogany table its fade green axminster the meridional globe with its dusty twinkle banish the incident from he mind he return to he work of card-index the captain 's book he take half a dozen at a time from the shelf dust they on the piazza then carry they to the embrasure of the window which offer a pleasant light for reading and for write the card he go through volume after volume -- speech by clay calhoun yancy prentiss breckenridge a old life of general taylor foxe 's book of martyr a collection of the old middle-english dramatist such as lillo garrick arthur murphy charle macklin george colman charle coffey man whose play have long since decline from the board and disappear from the reading-table the captain 's collection of book be strongly color by a religious cast -- john wesley 's sermon charle wesley 's hymn a treatise present a biblical proof that negro have no soul a little book call flower gather which purported to be a compilation of the saying of ultra-pious child all of whom die young a old book call element of criticism by henry home of kame another tome entitle study of nature by st pierre this last be a long argument for the miraculous creation of the world as set forth in genesis the proof offer be a résumé of the vegetable animal and mineral kingdom show they perfect fitness for man 's use and the immediate induction be that they be design for man 's use still another work calculate the exact age of the earth by the naïve method of count the generation from adam to christ to the total add eighteen hundred and eighty-five year -lrb- for the book be write in 1885 -rrb- and the original six day it require the lord to build the earth by refer to genesis and find out precisely what the creator do on the morning of the first day the writer contrived to bring he calculation of the age of the earth and everything in the world to a precision of six hour give or take -- a somewhat closer schedule than that make by the tennessee river boat come up from st loui these and similar volume form the scientific section of captain renfrew 's library and it be this paucity of the natural science that form the problem which peter try to solve all scientific addition come to a abrupt stop about the decade of 1880-90 that be the date when charle darwin 's great fructifying theory enunciate in 1859 begin to seep into the south in the captain 's library the only notice of evolution be a book call darwinism dethrone as for the elaboration of the darwinian hypothesis by spencer fiske devry weismann haeckel kidd bergson and every subsequent philosophic or biologic writer all these man might never have write a line so far as captain renfrew 's library be inform now why such extraordinary occlusion why should captain renfrew deny himself the very commonplace of thought theory familiarly hold by the rest of america and indeed by all the rest of the civilized world muse by the window peter succeed in state he problem more broadly : why be captain renfrew a intellectual reactionist the old gentleman be the reverse of stupid why should he confine he selection of book to a few old oddity that have lose they battle against a theory which have capture the intellectual world fifty year before nor be it captain renfrew alone now and then peter see editorial appear in lead southern journal seriously attack the evolutionary hypothesis minister in respectable church still fulminate against it peter know that the whole south still cling in a way to the miraculous and special creation of the earth as describe in genesis it cling with a intransigentism and bitterness far exceed other part of america why to peter the problem appear insoluble he sit by the window lose in he reverie just outside the ledge half a dozen english sparrow abuse one another with chirp that come faintly through the small diamond pane they quick movement hold peter 's eye and they endless quarrel presently recall he episode with young arkwright it occur to he casually that when arkwright grow up he would subscribe to every reactionary doctrine set forth in the library peter be indexing with that thought come a sort of mental flare as if he be about to find the answer to the whole question through the concrete attack make on he by sam it be a extraordinary feeling -- the sudden joyful dawn of a new idea peter sit up sharply and lean forward with a sense of be right on the fringe of a new and a great perception young arkwright the old captain the whole south be unfold themselves in a vast answer when a movement outside the window catch the negro 's introspective eye a girl be pass a girl in a yellow dress be pass the renfrew gate even then peter would not have waver in he synthesis have not the girl pause slightly and give a swift side glance at the old manor then the man in the window recognize cissie dildine a slight shock travel through siner 's body at the sight of cissie 's colorless face and darkened eye he stand up abruptly with a feeling that he have some urgent thing to say to the young woman he sharp movement topple over the big globe the crash cause the girl to stop and look for a moment they stand thus the girl in the chill street the man in the pleasant window look at each other next moment cissie hurry on up the village street toward the arkwright house no doubt she be on she way to cook the noon meal peter remain standing at the window with a heavily beat heart he watch she until she vanish behind a wing of the shrubbery in the renfrew yard when she have go he look at he book and card sit down and try to resume he indexing but he mind play away from it like a restive horse it have be two week since he last see cissie two week he nerve vibrate like the string of a pianoforte he have scarcely think of she during the fortnight but now have see she he find himself powerless to go on with he work he potter a while longer among the book and card but they be meaningless they appear a utter futility why index a lot of nonsense somehow this recall he flare he adumbration of some great idea connect with young arkwright and the old captain and the south he put he tremble nerve to work try to recapture he line of thought he sit for ten minute follow this mental train then that lose one grope for another he thought be jumpy they play about arkwright the captain cissie he mother 's death tump pack in prison the quarrel between the persimmon and jim pink stagg the whole of niggertown come rush down upon he seize he in its passion and dustiness and greasiness put to flight all he cultivate white-man idea after half a hour 's search he give it up before he leave the room he stoop and try to set up again the globe that the passing of the girl have cause he to throw down but its pivot be out of plumb and he have to lean it against the window-seat the sight of captain renfrew come in at the gate send peter to he room the hour be near twelve and it have become a little point of household etiquette for the mulatto and the white man not to be together when old rise jangle the triangle by this mean they forestall the mute discourtesy of the old captain 's walk away from he secretary to eat the subject of they separate meal have never be mention since they first acrimonious morning the matter have drop into the abeyance of custom just as the old gentleman have predict peter have leave open he jalousy but he window be close and now as he enter he find he apartment flood with sunshine and fill with that equable warmth that come of strain sunbeam through glass he prepare for dinner with he mind still hover about cissie he remove a book and a lamp from the lion-footed table and draw up a old chair with which the captain have furnish he room it be a delicate old heppelwhite of rosewood it have lose a finial from one of its back standard and a round be go from the left side peter never move the chair that vague plan sometime to repair it do not occur to he when he have clear he table and place he chair beside it he wander over to he tall west window and stand look up the street through the brilliant sunshine toward the arkwright home no one be in sight in hooker 's bend every one dine precisely at twelve and at that hour the street be empty it would be some time before cissie come back down the street on she way to niggertown she first would have to wash and put away the arkwright dish it would be somewhere about one o'clock nevertheless he keep stare out through the radiance of the autumn sunlight with a irrational feeling that she might appear at any moment he be afraid she would slip past and he not see she at all the thought disturb he somewhat it keep he sufficiently on the alert to stand tap the ball of he finger against the glass and look steadily toward the arkwright house presently the watcher perceive that a myriad spider-web fill the sunshine with a delicate dancing glister it be the month of voyage spider invisible to peter the tiny spinner climb to the tip-most twig of the dead weed list they abdomen and lasso the wind with gossamer lariat then they let go and sail away to a hazard of new fortune the air be full of the tiny adventurer as he stare up the street peter catch the glint of these invisible airship whisk away to whatever chance might hold for they there be something epic in it it recall to the mulatto 's mind some of fabre 's lovely description it remind he of two or three book on entomology which he have leave in he mother 's cabin he feel he ought to go after they while the spider be migrate he suddenly make up he mind he would go at once as soon as he have have dinner somewhere about one o'clock he look again at the arkwright house the thought of walk down the street with cissie to get he book quicken he heart he be still at the window when he door open and old rise enter with he dinner she growl under she breath all the way from the door to the table on which she place the tray only a single phrase detach itself and stand out clearly amid she muttering hope it choke you peter arrange he chair and table with reference to the window so he could look up the street while he be eat he dinner the ill-wishing rise have again furnish a gourmet 's meal but peter 's preoccupation prevent its careful and appreciative gustation a irrational feeling of the octoroon 's imminence spur he to fast eating he have hardly begin he soup before he find himself drink swiftly look up the street over he spoon as if he mean to rush out and swing aboard a pass train siner check he precipitation annoy at himself he begin again deliberately with a attempt to keep he mind on the savor of he food he even think of abandon he little design of go for the book or he would go at a different hour or to-morrow or not at all he tell himself he would far better allow cissie dildine to pass and repass unspoken to instead of try to arrange a accidental meeting but the brown man 's nerve would not hear to it that automatic portion of he brain and spinal column which physiologist assert perform three fourth of a man 's action and condition nine tenth of he volition -- that part of peter would not consider it it begin to get jumpy and scatter havoc in peter 's thought at the mere suggestion of not see cissie imperceptibly this radical left wing of he emotion speed up he meal again he catch himself stop he knife and fork in the act of rend apart a broil chicken confound it i 'll start when she come in sight no matter whether i have finish this meal or not he promise himself and suddenly he feel unhurried in the midst of a large leisure with a savory broiled chicken dinner before he -- not exactly before he either most of it have be stuff away only the fag-end remain on he plate a perfectly good meal have be ruin by a ill-timed resistance to temptation the glint of a yellow dress far up the street have just prompt he to swift action when the door open and old rise put she head in to say that captain renfrew want to see peter in the library the brown man come to a shocked standstill what right now he ask yeah right now carp rise ever ` thing he want he want right now he be be re ` less as a cat in a bulldog 's den ever sence he come home fuh dinner dunno whut 's come into he ole bone runnin ' th ` ugh he dinner lak a razo ' - back she withdraw in a continued mumble of censure peter cast a glance up the street time cissie 's arrival at the front gate pick up he hat and walk briskly to the library in the hope of finish any business the captain might have in time to encounter the octoroon he even begin make some little conversational plan with which he could meet cissie in a simple unstudied manner he recall with a certain satisfaction that he have not say a word of condemnation the night of cissie 's confession he would make a point of that and be prepare to argue that since he have say nothing he mean nothing in fact he be prepare to throw away the truth completely and enter the conversation as a out-and-out opportunist allege whatever appear to fit the occasion as all man talk to all woman the old captain be just get into he chair as peter enter he pause in the midst of lower himself by the chair-arm and get erect again he begin speak a little uncertainly : ah -- by the way peter -- i send for you -- yes sir peter look out at the window the old gentleman scrutinize peter a moment then he fade eye wander about the library still work at the book cross-index they -- yes sir peter could divine by the crinkle of he nerve the very locus of the girl as she pass down the thoroughfare very good say the old lawyer absently he be obviously preoccupy with some other topic very good he repeat with rack deliberation quite good how do that globe get bent peter look at it do not remember either knock it over or set it up i do not know he say rapidly i have not notice it old rise do it meditate the captain aloud but it be no use to accuse she of it she would deny it and yet on the other hand peter she 'll be nervous until i do accuse she of it she 'll be drop thing break up my china i dare say i would best accuse she at once storm at she some to quiet she nerve and get it over this monologue spur peter 's impatience into a agony i believe you be want I captain he suggest with a certain urge for action the captain 's little pleasantry fade he look at peter and become uncomfortable again well yes peter downtown i hear -- well a rumor connect with you -- such a extraordinary turn catch the attention of even the fidgety peter he look at he employer and wonder blankly what he have hear i do not want to intrude on you private affair peter not at all -- not -- not in the least -- no-o-o agree peter completely at a loss the old gentleman rub he thin hand together lift he eyebrow up and down nervously be -- be you about to -- to leave I peter peter be greatly surprise at the slightness and simplicity of this question and at the evidence of emotion it carry why no he cry not at all who tell you i be it be a deep gratification to I -- to be exact proceed the old man with a vague fear still in he eye i hear you be go to marry marry this flaw take peter 's sail even more unexpectedly than the other captain who in the world -- who could have tell -- be you no you be not indeed no i hear you be go to marry a negress here in town call cissie dildine a question be audible in the silence that follow this statement the obscure emotion that charge all the old man 's query affect peter i be not captain he declare earnestly that be settle oh -- you say it be settle pick up the old lawyer delicately yes then you have think of it immediately however he correct this breach of courtesy into which he old legal habit of cross-questioning have lead he well at any rate he say in quite another voice that ease my mind peter it ease my mind it be not only peter the thought of lose you but this girl you be think of marry -- let I warn you peter -- she be a negress the mulatto stare at the strange objection a negress the old man pause and make that queer movement with he wrinkled lip as if he taste some salty flavor i -- i do not mean exactly a -- a negress stammer the old gentleman i mean she be not a -- a good girl peter she be a -- a thief in fact -- she be a thief -- a thief peter i could not endure for you to marry a thief peter it seem to peter siner that some horrible compulsion keep the old captain repeat over and over the fact that cissie dildine be a thief a thief a thief the word cut the very viscera in the brown man at last when it seem the old gentleman would never cease peter lift a hand yes yes he gasp with a sickly face i -- i have hear that before he draw a shake breath and moisten he lip the two stand look at each other each profoundly at a loss as to what the other mean old captain renfrew collect himself first that be all peter he try to lighten he tone i think i 'll get to work let I see where do i keep my manuscript peter point mechanically at a drawer as he walk out at the library door once outside he run to the front piazza then to the front gate and with a racing heart stand look up and down the sleepy thoroughfare the street be quite empty chapter xi old captain renfrew be a trustful credulous soul as indeed most gentleman who lead a bachelor 's life be such man lack that moral hardening and whet which be obtain only amid the vicissitude of a home they be not actively and continuously engage in the employment and detection of chicane want of intimate association with a woman and some child beget in they a soft and simple way of believe what be say to they and they faith easily raise be just as easily shatter they judgment lack training peter siner 's simple assertion to the old captain that he be not go to marry cissie dildine completely allay the old gentleman 's uneasiness even the further information that peter have have such a marriage under advisement but have reject it do not put he on he guard from long non-intimacy with any human creature the old legislator have forget that human life be one long succession of do the thing one be not go to do he have forget if he ever know that the human brain be primarily not a master but a servant its function be not to direct but to devise scheme and apology to gratify impulse it be the way and mean committee to the great legislature of the body for several day after he fear that peter siner would marry cissie dildine old captain renfrew be as felicitous as a lover newly reconcile to he mistress he amble between the manor and the livery - stable with a abide sense of well-being when he approach he home in the radiance of high noon and see the roof of the old mansion lie a bluish gray in the shadow of the tree it fill he heart with joy to feel that it be not a old and empty house that await he come but that in it work a busy youth who would be glad to see he enter the gate the fear of some unattended and undignified death which have beset the old gentleman during the last eight or ten year of he life vanish under peter 's presence when he think of it at all now he always prevision himself be lift in peter 's athletic arm and lay properly on he big four-poster at time when peter sit work over the book in the library the captain feel a prodigious urge to lay a hand on the young man 's broad and capable shoulder but he never do again the old lawyer would sit for minute at a time watch he secretary 's regular feature as the brown man pursue he work with a trained intentness the old gentleman derive a deep pleasure from such long scrutiny it please he to imagine that when he be young he have possess the same vigor the same masculinity the same capacity for persistent labor indeed all old gentleman be prone to choose the most personable and virile young man they can find for themselves to have be like the two man have little to say to each other they thought beat to such different tempo that any attempt at continued speech discover unequal measure as a matter of fact in all comfortable human conversation word be use as mere buoy drop here and there to mark well-known channel of thought and feeling similarity of mental topography be necessary to mutual understanding between any two generation the landscape be so change as to be unrecognizable we father be monarchist we son bolshevikus old rise hobbett be more of a age with the captain and these two talk very comfortably as the old virago come and go with food at meal-time for instance the captain always ask he servant if she have feed he cat and old rise invariably would sulk and poke out she lip and put off answer to the last possible moment of insolence then would grumble out that she be je ` bout to feed the varmint a ' ' t wuz funny nobody could not give a hard-wuckin ' color woman breathin ' - space to turn roun ' in this reply be satisfactory to the captain because he know what it mean -- that rise have half forget the cat and have mean wholly to forget it but since she have be snap up so to speak in the very act of forget she would dole it out a piece or two of the meat that she have mean to abscond with as soon as the dish be do while rose be fulminate the old gentleman recall he bent globe and decide the moment have come for a lecture on that point it always vaguely embarrass the captain to correct rose and this increase he dignity now he clear he throat in a certain way that bring the old negress to attention so well they know each other by the way rise in the future i must request you to use extraordinary precaution in cleanse and dust article of my household furniture or in case of damage i shall be force to withhold a indemnification out of you pay eight or ten year ago when the captain first repeat this formulum to he servant the roll and swing of he rhetoric and the last word pay have build up lively hope in rise that the old gentleman be announce a increase in she regular wage of a dollar a week experience however have long since correct this faulty interpretation she come to a stand in the doorway with she kinky gray head swing around half puzzle wholly rebellious whut be i bruk now my globe the old woman turn about with more than usual innocence why i be not tech yo ' globe i foresee that agree the captain with patient irony but in the future do not touch it more carefully you bent its pivot the last time you refrain from handle it but i tell you i be not tech yo ' globe cry the negress with the anger of a illiterate person who feel but can not understand the satire level at she i agree with you say the captain glad the affair be over this verbal duck into the cellar out of the path of she storm stir up a tempest but i tell you i be not bruk it that be what i say yeah yeah yeah she flare you say i be not but when you say i be not you mean i be a ' when you say i be you mean i be not dat 's de sort o ' flapjack i 's wuckin ' fur the woman flirt out of the dining-room and the old gentleman draw another long breath glad it be over he really have little reason to quarrel about the globe bent or unbent he never use it it sit in he study year in and year out its dusty twinkle brighten at long interval by old rose 's spiteful rag the captain eat on placidly there have be a time when he be dubious about such scene with rise once he feel it beneath he dignity as a southern gentleman to allow any negro to speak to he disrespectfully he use to feel that he should discharge she instantly and during the first year of they entente have do so a number of time but he could get no one else who suit he so well she biscuit she corn-light - bread she lye-hominy which only the old darky know how to make and to tell the truth he miss the old creature herself she understanding of he and he idea she contemporaneity and no one else would work for a dollar a week presently in the course of he eat the old gentleman require another biscuit and he want a hot one three mildly heated disk lay on a plate before he but they have be out of the oven for five minute and have be reduce to a unappetizing tepidity a little hand-bell sit beside the captain 's plate whose special use be to summon hot biscuit now the old lawyer look at its worn handle speculatively he be not at all sure rose would answer the bell she would say she have not hear it he feel faintly disgruntle at not foresee this exigency and butter two biscuit while they be hot or even three he consider momentarily a project of go after a hot biscuit for himself but eventually put it by south of the mason-dixon line self - help be half-scandal at last quite dubiously he do pick up the bell and give it a gentle ring so if old rise choose not to hear it she probably would not : thus he could believe she and not lose he temper and so widen a already uncomfortable breach to the captain 's surprise the old creature not only bring the biscuit but she do it promptly no sooner have she serve they however than the captain see she really have return with a new line of defense she mumble it out as usual so that she employer be force to guess at a number of word : dat nigger peter mu ' ` a ' busted yo ' gl -- no he do not mu ' uv no he do not i ask he and he say he do not the old harridan stare and she speech suddenly become clear-cut : well ` fo ' gawd i say i do not too at this point the captain make a unintelligible sound and spread the butter on he hot biscuit he be je a nigger lak i be state the cook warmly the captain butter a second hot biscuit we 's je two nigger the captain hope she would presently sputter herself out now look heah cry the crone grow angrier and angrier as the reach of the insult spread itself before she be you gwine to put one o ' we nigger befo ' de udder can ` se ef you be i mus ' say it be kady - lock-a-do ' wid I the captain look up satirically what do you mean by katie-lock-the-door with you he ask though he have a uneasy feeling that he know you know whut i mean i mean i 's gwine to leab di place now look here rise protest the lawyer with dignity peter siner occupy almost a fiduciary relation to I the old negress stare with a slack jaw a relation o ' yo 's the lawyer hesitate some seconds look at the hag he high-bred old face be quite inscrutable but presently he say in a serious voice : peter occupy a position of trust with I rise yeah mumble rise i see you trus ' he one day he be go to do I a service a very great service rise the hag continue look at he with a stubborn expression you know better than any one else rise my dread of some -- some unmannerly death -- the old woman make a sound that might have mean anything and peter have promise to stay with I until -- until the end the old negress consider this solemn speech and then grunt out : which en ' which end the captain be irritated yeah yo ' en ' or peter 's en ' by every law of probability peter will outlive I yeah but peter 'll come to a en ' wid you when he ma'ie dat stuck-up yellow fly-by-night cissie dildine he be not go to marry she say the captain comfortably huh peter tell I he do not intend to marry cissie dildine shu then whut fur dey go roun ' peepin ' at each other lak a couple o ' nigger roun ' a haystack the old lawyer be annoyed peeping where why right in front o ' dis house dat 's wha ever ' day when dat hussy pass up to de arkwrights ' wha she wuck she poke along a ' wall she eye roun ' at dis house lak a calf wid de splivin that go on now ever ' day a deep uneasiness go through the old man he moisten he lip but peter say -- good gawd mar ' renfrew whut diff ` ence do it make whut peter say be not you foun ' out yit when a he-nigger a ' a she-nigger git to peepin ' at each udder whut dey say do not lib in de same neighbo ` hood wid whut dey do this be deliver with such energy that it completely undermine the captain 's faith in peter and the fact anger the old gentleman that 'll do rise that 'll do that be all i need of you the old crone puff up again at this unexpected flare and go out of the room plop she foot on floor and mumbling among these ungracious sound the captain catch blin ' ole fool but there be no need become offended and demand what she mean she explanation would have be vague and unsatisfactory the verjuice which old rise have sprinkle over peter and cissie by call they he-nigger and she-nigger somehow minimize they animalize they in the old lawyer 's imagination rise 's speech be charge with such contempt for she own color that it place the mulatto and the octoroon down with ape and rabbit the lawyer fight against he feeling for the sake of he secretary who have come to occupy so wide a sector of he comfort and affection yet the old virago evidently speak from a broad background of experience she be at least half convincing while the captain repel she charge against he quiet hard-working brown helper he admit it against cissie dildine whom he do not know she be a animal a female centaur a wanton and a strumpet as all negress be wanton and strumpet all white man in the south firmly believe that they believe it with a peculiar detestation and since they use these person very profitably for a hundred and fifty year as breed animal one might say they believe it a trifle ungratefully chapter xii the semi-daily passing of cissie dildine before the old renfrew manor on she way to and from the arkwright home upset peter siner 's work schedule to a extraordinary degree after watch for two or three day peter work out a sort of time - table for cissie she pass up early in the morning at about five forty-five he could barely see she then and somehow she look very pathetic hurry along in the cold dim light of dawn after she have cook the arkwright breakfast sweep the arkwright floor dust the arkwright furniture she pass back toward niggertown somewhere near nine about eleven o'clock she go up to cook dinner and return at one or two in the afternoon occasionally she make a third trip to get supper this be as exactly as peter could predict the arrival and departure of cissie and the schedule involve a large margin of uncertainty for half a hour before cissie pass she keep peter watch the clock at nervous interval wonder if after all she have go by unobserved invariably he would move he work to a window where he have the whole street under he observation then he would proceed with he indexing with more and more difficulty at first the paragraph would lose connection and he would be force to reread they then the sentence would drop apart immediately before the girl arrive the word themselves grow anarchic they stare he in the eye each a complete entity self-sufficient individual bearing no relation to any other word except that of mere proximity -- like a spelling lesson only by a effort could peter enforce a temporary cohesion among they and they drop apart at the first slacken of the strain strange to say when the octoroon actually be walk past peter do not look at she steadily on the contrary he would think to himself : how little i care for such a woman my ideal be thus and so -- he would look at she until she glance across the yard and see he sit in the window then immediately he bent over he book as if he stray glance have light on she purely by chance as if she be nothing more to he than a pass dray or a flutter leaf indeed he tell himself during these crisis that he have no earthly interest in the girl that she be not the sort of woman he desire -- while he heart hammer and the line of print under he eye blur into gray streak across the page one afternoon peter see cissie pass he gate hurry almost run apparently in flight from something it send a queer shock through he he stare after she then up and down the street he wonder why she run even when he go to bed that night the strangeness of cissie 's flight keep he awake invent explanation \* \* \* \* \* none of peter 's preoccupation be lose upon captain renfrew none be so suspicious as a credulous man arouse after rose have strike she blow at the secretary the old gentleman note all of peter 's permutation and misconstrue a dozen quite innocent action on peter 's part into sign of bad faith by a little observation he identify cissie dildine and what he see do not reëstablish he peace of mind on the contrary it become more than probable that the cream-colored negress would lure peter away this possibility arouse in the old lawyer a grim voiceless rancor against cissie in he thought he link the girl with every manner of evil design against peter she be a adventuress a cyprian a seductress attempt to snare peter in the brazen web of she comeliness for to the old gentleman 's eye there be a abide impudicity about cissie 's very charm the passionate repose of she face be immodest the possession of a torso such as a sculptor might have carve be brazen the girl be shamefully well appoint one morning as captain renfrew come home from town he chance to walk just behind the octoroon and quite unconsciously the girl deliver a add fillip to the old gentleman 's uneasiness just before cissie pass in front of the renfrew manor womanlike she pause to make some slight improvement in she appearance before walk under the eye of she lover she adjust some strand of hair which have blow loose in the autumn wind look at herself in a purse mirror retouch she nose with she greenish powder then she pick a little sprig of sumac leave that burn in the corner of a lawn and pin its flame on the unashamed loveliness of she bosom this negro instinct for brilliant color be the theme of many jest in the south but it be entirely justified esthetically although the constant sarcasm of the whites have check its satisfaction if it have not corrupt the taste the bit of sumac out of which the octoroon have improvise a nosegay light up she skin and eye and create a ensemble as closely resemble a henrus painting as anything the street of hooker 's bend be destine to see but old captain renfrew be far from appreciate any such bravura in scarlet and gold at first he put it down to mere niggerish taste and he dislike for the girl edge he stricture then on second think the oddness of sumac for a nosegay catch he attention nobody use sumac for a buttonhole he have never hear of any woman white or black use sumac for a bouquet why should this cissie dildine trig herself out in sumac the captain 's suspicion come to a point like a setter he begin sniff about for cissie 's motive in choose so queer a ornament he wonder if it have anything to do with peter siner all he life captain renfrew 's brain have be deliberate he move mentally as he do physically with dignity to tell the truth the captain 's thought have a way of absolutely stop now and then and for a space he would view the world as a simple collection of color surface without depth or meaning during these interval by a sort of irony of the god the old gentleman 's face wear a look of philosophic concentration so that he mental hiatus have give he a reputation for profundity which be county wide it have be this year before that have carry he by a powerful majority into the tennessee legislature the voter agree almost to a man that they prefer depth to a shallow facility the rival candidate have be shallow and facile the poll return the captain and the young gentleman -- for the captain be a young gentleman in those day -- be launch on a typical politician 's career but some republican member from east tennessee have impugn the rise statesman 's honor with some sort of improper liaison in those day there seem to be proper and improper liaison there have be a duel on the bank of the cumberland river in which the captain succeed in wound he traducer in the arm and be thus vindicate by the god but the incident end a career that might very well have wind up in the governor 's chair or even in the united state senate consider how very deliberate the captain be mentally to-day as the captain walk up the street follow cissie dildine one of these vacant mood fall upon he and it be not until they have reach he own gate that it suddenly occur to the old gentleman just what cissie 's sumac do mean it be a signal to peter the simplicity of the solution stir the old man its meaning be equally easy to fathom when a woman signal any man it convey consent denial receive no signal they be infer in this particular case captain renfrew find every reason to believe that this flare bit of sumac be the prelude to a elopement in the window of he library the captain see he secretary stare at he card and book with a intentness plainly assume peter 's fix stare have none of those small movement of the head that mark genuine intellectual labor so peter be pose pretend he do not see the girl to disarm he employer 's suspicion -- pretend not to see a girl rig out like that such duplicity send a queer spasm of anguish through the old lawyer peter 's action hold half a dozen barb for the captain a fellow-alumnus of harvard staying in he house merely for he wage and keep peter bear not the slightest affection for he the mulatto lack even the chivalry to notify the captain of he intention because he know the captain object and yet all these self-centered objection be nothing to what old captain renfrew feel for peter 's own sake for peter to marry a nigger and a strumpet for he to elope with a wanton and a thief for such a upstanding lad the very picture of he own virility and mental alertness when he be of that age for such a boy to fling himself away to drop out of existence -- oh it be loathly the old man enter the library feeling sick it be empty peter have go to he room accord to he custom but in this particular instance it seem to captain renfrew he withdrawal be flavor with a tang of guilt if he be innocent why should not such a big strong youth have stay and help a old gentleman off with he overcoat the old captain blow out a windy breath as he help himself out of he coat in the empty library the bent globe still lean against the window-seat the room have never look so somber or so lonely at dinner the old man eat so little that rise hobbett cease she monotonous grumble to ask if he feel well he say he have have a hard day a difficult day he feel so weak and thin that he foretell the gray day when he could no longer creep to the village and sit with he crony at the livery-stable when he would be house-fast through endless day creep from room to room like a weak old rat in a huge empty house finally to die in some disgusting fashion and now peter be go to leave he be go to throw himself away on a lascivious wench a faint moisture dampen the old man 's withered eye he drink a extra thimbleful of whisky to try to hearten himself its bouquet fill the time-worn stateliness of the dining-room \* \* \* \* \* during the week of peter 's stay at the manor it have grow to be the captain 's habit really to write for two or three hour in the afternoon and he pile of manuscript have thicken under he application the old man be write a book call reminiscence of peace and war he book would form another unit of that extraordinary crop of personal reminiscence of the old south which flood the press of america during the decade of 1908-18 during just that decade it seem as if the aged man and woman of the south suddenly realize that the generation who have live through the picturesqueness and stateliness of the old slave régime be almost go and over they heart sweep a common impulse to commemorate in the sunset of they own live its fading splendor and its vanish deed on this particular afternoon the captain settle himself to work but he reminiscence do not get on he pinch a bit of floss from the nib of he pen and try to swing into the period of which he be write he read over a few page of he copy as mental priming but he thought remain flat and dull indeed he whole life as he review it in the wane afternoon appear empty and futile it seem hardly worth while to go on the captain have come to that point in he memoirs where the republican representative from knox county have set go the petard which have wreck he political career from the very beginning of he labor the old lawyer have look forward to write just this period of he life he mean to clear up he name once for all he mean to use invective argument testimony and a powerful emotional appeal such as a country lawyer invariably attempt with a jury but now that he have arrive at the actual composition of he defense he sit bite he penholder with all the argument he mean to advance slip from he mind he could not recall the point of the proof he could not recall they with peter siner move restlessly about the room glance through the window unsettled nervous on the verge of elope with a negress he secretary 's tragedy smite the old man the necessity of do something for peter put he thought to rout a wild idea occur to the captain that if he should write the exact truth perhaps he memoirs might serve peter as a signal against a futile empty journey but the think no sooner appear than it be reject in the anglo - saxon especially the anglo-saxon of the southern united state abide no such gallic frankness as move a jean-jacque southern memoirs always sound like the conversation between two maiden lady -- nothing intimate simply a few general remark design to show from what nice family they come so the captain write nothing during all the afternoon he sit at he desk with a leaden heart watch peter move about the room the old man maintain more or less the posture of write but he thought be occupy in pity himself and pity peter half a dozen time he look up on the verge of make some plea some remonstrance against the madness of this brown man but the sight of peter sit in the window-seat stare out into the street silence he he be a weak old man and peter 's nerve be string with the desire of youth at last the two man hear old rise clash in the kitchen a few minute later the secretary excuse himself from the library to go to he own room as peter be about to pass through the door the captain be suddenly galvanized into action by the thought that this perhaps be the last time he would ever see he he get up from he chair and call shakenly to peter the negro pause the captain moisten he lip and control he voice i want to have a word with you peter about a -- a little matter i -- i have mention it before yes sir the negro 's tone and attitude remind the captain that the supper gong would soon sound and they would best separate at once it -- it be about cissie dildine the old lawyer hurry on peter nod slightly yes you mention that before the old man lift a thin hand as if to touch peter 's arm but he do not a sort of desperation seize he but listen peter you do not want to do -- what be in you mind what be in my mind captain i mean marry a negress you do not want to marry a negress the brown man stare utterly blank not marry a negress no peter no quaver the old man for yourself it may make no difference but you child -- think of you child you son grow up under a brown veil you can not tear it off god himself can not tear it off you can never reach he through it you child you child 's child a terrible procession that stretch out and out march under a black shroud unknowing unknown all you can see be they sad form beneath the shroud march away -- march away god know where and yet it be you own flesh and blood suddenly the old lawyer 's face break into the hard tearless contortion of the aged he terrible emotion communicate itself to the sensitive brown man but captain i myself be a negro whom should i marry no one no one let you seed wither in you loin it be better to do that it be better -- at that moment the clashing of the supper gong fall on the old man 's naked nerve he straighten up by some reflex mechanism turn away from what he think be he last interview with he secretary and proceed down the piazza into the great empty dining-room chapter xiii with overwrought nerve peter siner enter he room at five o'clock that afternoon he have see cissie dildine go up the street to the arkwright home to cook one of those occasional supper he have be watch for she return and in the midst of it the captain 's extraordinary outburst have stir he up once in he room the negro place the broken hepplewhite in such a position that he could rake the street with a glance then he try to compose himself and await the come of he supper and the passage of cissie there be something almost pathetic in peter 's endless watch all for a mere glimpse or two of the girl in yellow he himself have no idea how he nerve and thought have weave themselves around the young woman he have no idea what a passion this continual dole out of glimpse have beget he do not dream how much he be as folk naïvely put it in love with she he love be strong enough to make he forget for a while the old lawyer 's outbreak however as the dusk thicken in the shrubbery and under the tree certain of the old gentleman 's phrase revisit the mulatto 's mind : a terrible procession march under a black shroud you child you child 's child a terrible procession march away god know where and yet -- it be you own flesh and blood they be terrific sentence as if the old man have be try to tear from he vision some sport of nature some deformity as the implication spread before peter he become more and more astonished at its content even to captain renfrew black man be dehumanize -- shroud untouchable creature it deliver to peter a slow but a profound shock he glance about at the fade magnificence of the room with a queer feeling that he have be introduce into it under a sort of misrepresentation he have take up he abode with the captain at least on the basis of belong to the human family but this passionate outbreak this puzzling explosion cut that ground from under he foot the more peter think about it the stranger grow he sensation not even to be class as a human being by this old gentleman who in a weak helpless fashion have creep somewhat into peter 's affection -- not to be consider a man the mulatto draw a long troubled breath and by the mere mechanic of he desire keep stare through the gloom for cissie peter siner have know all along that the unread whites of hooker 's bend -- and that include nearly every white person in the village -- consider black man as simple animal but he have suppose that the more thoughtful man of whom captain renfrew be a type at least admit the afro - american to the common brotherhood of humanity but they do not as peter sit stare into the darkness the whole effect of the dehumanizing of the black folk of the south begin to unfold itself before he imagination it explain to he the tragedy of he race they suffering at the hand of mob violence the casualness even the levity with which black man be murder : the chronic dishonesty with which negro be treat : the constant enactment of adverse legislation against they the cynical use of negro woman they be all vermin animal they be one with the sheep and the swine a little nearer the human in form perhaps and oddly enough one that could be breed to a human being as testify a multitude of brown and yellow and cream-colored folk but all march away as the captain have so passionately say march away they form hide from human intercourse under a shroud of black a endless procession march away god know whither and yet they be the south 's own flesh and blood the horror of such a complex swell in peter 's mind to monstrous proportion as night thicken at he window the negro sit dazed and wonder at the mightiness of he vision he thought go grope try to solve some obscure problem it pose he think of the arkwright boy he think of the white man smile as he mother 's funeral go past the livery-stable he think of captain renfrew 's manuscript that he be transcribe through all the old man 's memoirs run a certain lack of sincerity peter always feel amid he labor that the old captain be make a attorney 's plea rather than a candid exposition at this point in he thought there gradually limn itself in the brown man 's mind the answer to that enigma which he almost have unravel on the day he first see cissie dildine pass he window with it come the answer to the puzzle contain in the old captain 's library the library be not a ordinary compilation of the world 's thought it too be a attorney 's special plead against the equality of man any book or theory that uphold the equality of man be carefully exclude from the shelf darwin 's great hypothesis and every development spring from it have be ban because the moment that a theory be propound of the great biologic relationship of all flesh from worm to vertebrate there instantly follow a corollary of the brotherhood of man what christ do for theology darwin do for biology -- he democratize it the one descend to man 's brotherhood from the trinity the other climb up to it from the worm the old captain 's library lack sincerity southern orthodoxy which persist in pour its religious thought into the outworn mold of special creation lack sincerity scarcely a department of southern life escape this fundamental attitude of special pleader and disingenuousness it explain the southern fondness for legal subtlety all attempt at southern poetry belles-lettres paint novel bear the stamp of the special plea of author whose exposition be careful peter perceive what every one must perceive that when letter turn into a sort of glorified prospectus of a country all value as literature cease the very breath of art and interpretation be a eager and sincere search of the heart this sincerity the south lack she single talent will always be forensic because she be a lawyer with a cause to defend and such be the curse that arise from lynching and venery and extortion and dehumanizing -- sterility a dumbness of soul peter siner 's thought lift he with the tremendous buoyancy of inspiration he swing out of he chair and begin tramp he dark room the skin of he scalp tickle as if a ghost have rise before he the nerve in he thigh and back vibrate he feel light and tingled with energy unaware of what he be do he set about light the gasolene-lamp he work with nervous quickness as if he be in a great hurry presently a brilliant light flood the room it turn the gray illumination of the window to blackness joy envelop peter he own future develop under he eye with the same swift clairvoyance that mark he vision of the ill of he country he see himself remedy those ill he would go about show white man and black man the simple truth the spiritual necessity for justice and fairness it be not a question of social equality it be a question of clear a road for the development of southern life he would show white man that to weaken to debase to dehumanize the negro inflict a more terrible wound on the south than would any strength the black man might develop he would show black man that to hate the whites constantly to suspect constantly to pilfer from they only rivet heavier shackle on they limb it be all so clear and so simple the white south must humanize the black not for the sake of the negro but for the sake of itself no one could resist logic so fundamental peter 's heart sing with the solemn joy of a man who have find he work all through he youth he have feel blind yearning and groping for he know not what it have drive he with endless travail out of niggertown through school and college and back to niggertown -- this untiring hound of heaven but at last he have reach he work he peter siner a mulatto with the blood of both white and black in he vein would come as a evangel of liberty to both white and black the brown man 's eye grow moist from joy he body seem possess of tremendous energy as he pace he room there come into the glory of peter 's thought the memory of the arkwright boy as he sit in the cedar glade brood on the fall needle peter recall the hobbledehoy 's disjointed word as he wrestle with the moral and physical problem of adolescence peter recall he impulse to sit down by young sam arkwright and as best he might give he some clue to the critical and feverish period through which he be pass he have not do so but peter remember the instance down to the very desperation in the face of the brooding youngster and it seem to peter that this reject impulse have be a sign that he be destine to be a evangel to the whites as well as to the black the joy of peter 's mission bear he aloft on vast wing he room seem to fall away from he and he be move about he country release the two race from they bond of suspicion and cruelty \* \* \* \* \* slowly the old manor form about peter again and he perceive that a tap on the door have summon he back he walk to the door with he heart full of kindness for old rise she be bring he he supper he feel as if he could take the old woman in he arm and out of the mere hugeness of he love sweeten she bitter life the mulatto open the door as eagerly as if he be admit some long-desired friend but when the shutter swing back the old crone and she salver be not there all he could discern in the darkness be the white pillar mark the night into panel there be no light in the outer kitchen the whole manor be silent as he stand listen the knock be repeat this time more faintly he fix the sound at the window he close the door walk across the brilliant room and open the shutter for several moment he see nothing more than the tall quadrangle of blackness which the window frame then a star or two pierce it then something move he see a woman 's figure standing close to the casement and out of the darkness cissie dildine 's voice ask in its careful english : peter may i come in chapter xiv for a full thirty seconds peter siner stare at the girl at the window before even with she prompt he think of the amenity of ask she to come inside as a further delay courtesy he draw the heppelwhite chair toward she cissie 's face look bloodless in the blanched light of the gasolene - lamp she force a faint doubtful smile you do not seem very glad to see I peter i be he assure she mechanically but he really feel nothing but astonishment and dismay they fill he voice he be afraid some one would see cissie in he room he thought go flit about the premise calculate the position of the various tree and shrub in relation to the window try to determine whether and just where in he brilliantly light chamber the girl could be see from the street the octoroon make no further comment on he confusion she eye wander from he over the stately furniture and up to the stuccoed ceiling they tell I you live in a wonderful room she remark absently yes it be very nice agree peter in the same tone wonder what might be the object of she hazardous visit a flicker of suspicion suggest that she be try to compromise he out of revenge for he renouncement of she but the next instant he reject this the girl accept the chair peter offer and continue to look about i hope you do not mind my stare peter she say i stare when i first come here to stay assisted peter who be get a little more like himself even if a little uneasier at the consequence of this visit be that a highboy she nod nervously at the piece of furniture i have see picture of they uh huh revolutionary i believe the night wind be a little raw he move across the room and close the jalousy and thus cut off the night wind and also the west view from the street he glance at the heavy curtain part over he front window with a keen desire to swing they together some fragment of he mind continue the surface conversation with cissie be it post-revolutionary or pre-revolutionary she ask with a preoccupy air post i believe no pre i always mean to examine closely to have such thing would almost teach one history cissie say yeah very nice peter have decide that the girl be in direct line with the left front window and a opening between the tree to the street the girl 's eye follow he be those curtain velour peter i -- i believe so agree the man unhappily i -- i wonder how they look spread peter seize on this flimsy excuse with a wave of relief and thankfulness to cissie he have to restrain himself as he stride across the room and swing together the two half of the somber curtain in order to preserve a appearance of a exhibit he finger be so nervous that he bungle a moment at the heavy cord but finally the two drapery swing together loose a little cloud of dust he draw together a small aperture where the hanging stand apart and then turn away in sincere relief cissie 's own interest in historic furniture and textile come to a abrupt conclusion she give a deep sigh and settle back into she chair she sit look at peter seriously almost distressfully as he come toward she with the closing of the curtain and the establishment of a real privacy peter become aware once again of the sweetness and charm cissie always hold for he he still wonder what have bring she but he be no longer uneasy perhaps i would better build a fire he suggest quite willing now to make she visit seem not unusual oh no -- she speak with polite haste -- i be just go to stay a minute i do not know what you 'll think of I she look intently at he i think it lovely of you to come he be disgust with the triteness of this remark but he could think of nothing else i do not know demur the octoroon with she faint doubtful smile person do not welcome beggar very cordially if all beggar be so charming -- apparently he could not escape banality but cissie interrupted whatever speech he mean to make with a return of she almost painful seriousness i really come to ask you to help I peter then you need have bring I a pleasure at least some impulse keep the secretary make those foolish complimentary speech which keep a conversation empty and insincere oh peter i do not come here for you to talk like that will you do what i want what do you want cissie he ask sober by she voice and manner i want you to help I peter all right i will he space he word with he speculation about the nature of she request what do you want I to do i want you to help I go away peter look at she in surprise he hardly know what he have be expect but it be not this some repress emotion creep into the girl 's voice peter i -- i can not stay here in hooker 's bend any longer i want to go away i -- i have get to go away peter stand regard she curiously and at the same time sympathetically where do you want to go cissie the girl draw a long breath she bosom lift and drop abruptly i do not know that be one of the thing i want to ask you about you do not know where you want to go he smile faintly how do you know you want to go at all oh peter all i know be i must leave hooker 's bend she give a little shiver i be tired of it sick of it -- sick she exhale a breath as if she be indeed physically ill she face suggest it she eye be shadow some northern city i suppose she add and you want I to help you inquire peter puzzle she nod silently with a woman 's instinct to make a man guess the favor she be seek then it occur to peter just what sort of assistance the girl do want it give he a faint shock that a girl could come to a man to beg or to borrow money it be a white man 's shock a notion he have pick up in boston because it happen frequently among village negro and among they it hold as little significance as child beg one another for bite of apple peter think over he bank balance then start toward a chest of drawer where he keep he checkbook cissie if i can he of any service to you in a substantial way i 'll be more than glad to -- she put out a hand and stop he then talk on in justification of she determination to go away i just can not endure it any longer peter she shudder again i can not stand niggertown or this side of town -- any of it they -- they have no _ feeling _ for a color girl peter not -- not a speck she rave a gasp and after a moment plunge on into she wrong : when -- when one of we even walk past on the street they -- they whistle and say a-all kind of thing out loud j-just as if w-we be not there at all th - they do not c-care we be just n-nigger w-women cissie suddenly begin sob with a faint catch noise she full bosom shake by the spasm she tear slowly well over she draw out a handkerchief with a part of its lace edge go and wipe she eye and cheek hold the bit of cambric in a ball in she palm like a negress instead of in she finger like a white woman as she have be teach then she draw a deep breath swallow and become more compose peter stand look in helpless anger at this representative of all woman of he race cissie that be street-corner scum -- the dirty sewage -- they make you feel naked go on cissie in the monotone that succeed a fit of weep and ashamed -- and afraid she blink she eye to press out the undue moisture and look at peter as if ask what else she could do about it than to go away from the village will it be any better away from here suggest peter doubtfully cissie shake she head i -- i suppose not if -- if i go alone i should not think so agreed peter somberly he start to hearten she by say white woman also undergo such trial if that would be a consolation but he know very well that a white woman 's hardship be as nothing compare to those of a color woman who be endowed with any grace whatever and besides cissie go on peter who somehow find himself argue against the notion of she go i hardly see how a decent color woman get around at all color boarding-house be wretched place i eat and sleep in one or two come home rotten the possibility of cissie finding herself in such a place move peter the girl nod submissively to he judgment and say in a queer voice : that be why i -- i do not want to travel alone peter no it be a bad idea -- and then peter perceive that a queer quality be creep into the tête-à-tête she return he look unsteadily but with a curious persistence -lrb- illustration : you-you mean you want m-me -- to go with you cissie he stammer -rrb- i -- i d-don ' t want to travel a-alone peter she gasp she look she voice suddenly bring home to the a the amazing connotation of she word he stare at she feel he face grow warm with a sharp peculiar embarrassment he hardly know what to say or do before she intent and piteous eye you -- you mean you want m-me -- to go with you cissie he stammer the girl suddenly begin tremble now that she last reserve of indirection have be tear away listen peter she begin breathlessly i be not the sort of woman you think if i have not accuse myself we would be marry now i -- i want you more than anything in the world peter but i do tell you surely surely peter that show i be a good woman -- th-the real i dear dear peter there be a difference between a woman and she act peter you be the first man in all my life in a-all my life who ever come to I k - kindly and gently so i have to l-love you and t-tell you peter the girl 's waver voice break down completely she face twist with grief she grope for she chair sit down bury she face in she arm on the table and break into a chatter outbreak of sob that sound like some sort of laughter she shoulder shake the light gleam on she soft black caucasian hair there be a little rent in one of the seam in she cheap jacket at one of the curve where she side mold into she shoulder the customer make garment have find cissie 's body of richer mold than it have be design to shield and yet in peter 's distress and tenderness and embarrassment this little rent hold he attention and somehow misprize the wearer it seem symbolic in the search white light he could see the very break in the thread and the widen stitch at the end of the rip she coat have give way because she be model more nearly like the venus de milo than the run of womankind he feel the little irony of the thing and yet be quite unable to resist the comparison and then too she have refer again to she sin of peculation a woman enjoy confession from a man a man 's sin be mostly vague indefinite thing to a woman a shadowy background which bring out the man in a beautiful attitude of repentance but when a woman confess the man see all she past as a close-up with full lighting he have a intimate acquaintance with just what she be talk about and the woman herself grow shadowy and unreal man have too many blot not to demand whiteness in woman by strike some such average nature keep the race a go moral concern so peter as he stand look down on the woman who be ask he to marry she be fill with as unhappy and as impersonal a tenderness as a bear brother he recall the thought which have come to he when he see cissie pass he window she be not the sort of woman he want to marry she be not he ideal he cast about in he head for some gentle way of put she off so that he would not hurt she any further if such a easement be possible as he stand think he find not a pretext but a reality he stoop over and put a hand lightly on each of she arm cissie he say in a serious even voice if i should ever marry any one it would be you the girl pause in she sobbing at he even passionless voice then you -- you will not she whisper in she arm i can not cissie now that he be say it he utter the word very evenly and smoothly i can not dear cissie because a great work have just come into my life he pause expect she to ask some question but she lay silent with she face in she arm evidently listen cissie i think in fact i know i can demonstrate to all the south both white and black the need of a better and more sincere understanding between we two race peter do not feel the absurdity of such a speech in such a place he pat she arm but there be something in the warmth of she flesh that disturbed he austerity and cause he to lift he hand to the more impersonal axis of she shoulder he proceed to develop he idea cissie just a moment ago you be complain of the insult you meet everywhere i believe if i can spread my idea cissie that even a pretty color girl like you may walk the street without be subject to obscenity on every corner he tone unconsciously patronize cissie 's prettiness with the patronage of the male for the less significant thing as though she ripeness for love and passion and child be after all not comparable with what he a male could do in the way of significantly molding life cissie lift she head and dry she eye so you be not go to marry I peter woman-like now that she be well into the subject she be far less embarrassed than peter she have have she cry why -- er -- consider this work cissie -- be not you go to marry anybody peter the artist in peter the thing the girl love in he catch again that messianic vision of himself why no cissie he say with a return of he inspiration of a hour ago i 'll be go here and there all over the south preach this gospel of kindliness and tolerance of forgiveness of the fault of other cissie look at he with a queer expression i 'll show the white people that they should treat the negro with consideration not for the sake of the negro but for the sake of themselves it be so simple cissie it be so logical and clear -- the girl shake she head sadly and you do not want I to go with you peter why n-no cissie a girl like you could not go perhaps i 'll be misunderstand in place perhaps i may have to leave a town hurriedly or be swing over the wall like paul in a basket he attempt to treat it lightly but the girl look at he with a horror dawn in she melancholy face peter do you really mean that she whisper why truly you do not imagine -- the octoroon open she dark eye until she might have be some weird oh peter please please put such a mad idea away from you peter you have be live here alone in this old house until you do not see thing clearly dear peter do not you _ know _ you can not go out and talk like that to white folk and -- and not have some terrible thing happen to you oh peter if you would only marry I it would cure you of such wildness involuntarily she get up hold out she arm to he offer herself to he need with she frightened eye fix on he it make he exquisitely uncomfortable again he make a little sound design to comfort and reassure she he would do very well he be something of a diplomat in he way he have get along with the boy in harvard very well indeed in fact he be rather a man of the world no need to worry about he though it be awfully sweet of she cissie pick up she handkerchief with its torn edge which she have lay on the table evidently she be about to go i surely do not know what will become of I she say look at it in a reversal of feeling peter do not want she to go away quite then he cast about for some excuse to detain she a moment longer now cissie he begin if you be really go to leave hooker 's bend -- i be not go she say with a long exhalation i -- she swallow -- i just think that up to -- ask you to -- to -- you see she explain a little breathless i think you still love I and have forgive I by the way you watch for I every day at the window this speech touch peter more keenly than any of the little drama the girl have invent it hit he so shrewdly he could think of nothing more to say cissie move toward the window and undo the latch good night peter she pause a moment with she hand on the catch peter she say i would almost rather see you marry some other girl than try so terrible a thing the big full-blooded athlete smile faintly you seem perfectly sure marriage would cure I of my mission cissie 's face redden faintly i think so she say briefly good night and she disappear in the dark space she have open and close the jalousy softly after she chapter xv cissie dildine 's conviction that marriage would cure peter of he mission persist in the mulatto 's mind long after the glamour of the girl have fade and he room have regain the bleak emptiness of a bachelor 's bedchamber cissie have be so brief and positive in she statement that peter who have not think on the point at all grow more than half convinced she be right now that he ponder over it it seem there be a difference between the outlook of a bachelor and that of a married man the former consider humanity as a balloonist survey a throng -- immediately and without perspective -- but the latter always see mankind through the frame of he family a single man tend naturally to philosophy and reform a married man to administration and statesmanship there have be no great unmarried statesman there have be no great married philosopher or reformer now that cissie have point out this universal rule peter see it very clearly and peter suspect that beneath this rough classification and conditioning it lay a plexus of obscure mental and physical reaction set up by the relation between husband and wife it might very well be there be a difference between the actual cerebral and nervous structure of a married man and that of a single man at any rate after these reflection peter now feel sure that marriage would cure he of he mission but how have cissie know it how have she strike out so involve a theory one might say in the toss of a head the more peter think it over the more extraordinary it become it be another one of those explosive idea which cissie apparently have the faculty of create out of a pure mental vacuum all this philosophy aside cissie 's appearance just in the nick of he inspiration she surprising proposal of marriage and he refusal have accomplish one thing : it have commit peter to the program he have outline to the girl indeed there seem something fatalistic in such a concatenation of event siner wonder whether or not he would have obey he vision without this add impulse from cissie he do not know but now since it have all come about just as it have he suspect he would have be neglectful he feel as if a dangerous but splendid channel have be open before he eye and almost at the same instant a hand have reach down and direct he life into it this fancy move the mulatto as he get himself ready for bed he keep thinking : well my life be settle at last there be nothing else for I to do even if this should end terribly for I as cissie imagine my life will not be waste next morning peter siner be awaken by old rise hobbett thrust she head in at he door stare around and finally see peter in bed grumbling : why be you still heah black man the secretary open he eye in astonishment why should not i be here nobody wuz ` speckin ' you to be heah the crone withdraw she head and vanish peter wonder at this unaccustomed interest of rise then hurry out of bed suppose himself late for breakfast a dense fog have come up from the river and the moisture float into he open window have dampen he whole room peter step briskly to the screen and begin splash himself it be only in the midst of he ablutions that he remember he inspiration and resolve of the previous evening as he squeeze the water over he powerfully molded body he recall it almost impersonally it might have happen to some third person he do not even recall distinctly the thread of the logic which have lift he to such a pisgah and show he the whole south as a new and promised land however he know that he could start he train of thought again and again ascend the mountain float through the fog into he open window come the noise of the village as it set about live another day precisely as it have live innumerable day in the past the blast of the six-o'clock whistle from the planing-mill make the loose sash of he window rattle come a lowing of cow and a clucking of hen a woman 's call the voice of man in conversation come so distinctly through the pall that it seem a number of person must be move about they morning work talk and shout right in the renfrew yard but the thing that impress peter most be the solidity and stability of this southern village that he could hear move around he and its certainty to go on in the future precisely as it have go on in the past it be a tremendous force the very old manor about he seem huge and intrenched in long tradition while he peter siner be just a brown man naked behind a screen and rather cold from the fog and damp of the morning he listen to old rise clash the kitchen utensil as he draw on he damp underwear he wonder what he could say to old rise that would persuade she into a little kindliness and tolerance for the white people as he listen he feel hopeless he could never explain to the old creature that she own happiness depend upon the charity she extend to other she could never understand it she would live and die precisely the same bitter old beldam that she be and nothing could ever assuage she while peter be think of the old creature she come shuffling along the back piazza with he breakfast she let herself in by lift one knee to a horizontal balance the tray on it then open the door with she free hand when the shutter swing open it display the crone standing on one foot wear a man 's grimy sock which have fall down over a broken run-down shoe in peter 's mood the thought of this wretched old woman put on such garment morning after morning be unspeakably pathetic he think of he own mother who have live and die only a shade or two remove from the old crone 's condition rise put down she foot and enter the room with she lip poke out ready to make instant attack if peter mention he lack of supper the night before aunt rise ask the secretary with he friendly intent in he tone how come you to look in this morning and say you do not expect to find I in my room she give a unintelligible grunt push the lamp to one side and ease she tray to the table peter finish touch he tie before one of those old-fashioned mirror not of cut-glass yet perfectly true he come from the mirror and move he chair out of force of habit so he could look up the street toward the arkwright ' aunt rise say the young man wistfully why be you always angry she bridle at this extraordinary inquiry I yes you she hesitate a moment think how she could make she reply a personal assault on peter 'cause you come heah ` sputin ' my rights da ' 's ' why no demurred peter you be quarrel in the kitchen the first morning i come here and you do not know i be on the place well -- i get my tribulation she snap stare suspiciously at these unusual question there be a pause then peter say placatingly : i be just think aunt rise you might forget you tribulation if you do not ride they all the time hoccum what you mean ridin ' my tribulation think about they the old captain for instance you be no happier always abuse the old captain the old virago give a sniff toss she head but keep she eye roll suspiciously on peter very often the way we think and act make we happy or unhappy moralize peter broadly look heah nigger you be not no preacher sont out by de lawd to I anyway i be sure you would feel more friendly toward the captain if you act openly with he for instance if you do not take off all he cold victuals and handkerchief and sock soap kitchenware -- the cook snort i would feel dat much mo ' nekk a ' hongry dat 's how i would feel perhaps if you would start over he might give you a better wage huh she snort in a access of irony i see dat skinflint gib 'n' I a better wage puuh the suddenly she realize where the conversation have wander and stare at the secretary with widen eye good lawd do dat fool cap'n set up a nigger in dis bedroom winder je to ketch ole rise packin ' off a few ole lef ' - over peter begin a hurry denial but she rush on : ` fo ' gawd i hope he viddle choke he i hope he ole smoke-house fall down on he ole haid i hope to jesus -- peter plead with she not to think the captain be behind he observation but the hag rush out of the bedroom swing she head from side to side utter the most terrible malediction she would show he she would not put another foot in he old kitchen wild horse could not drag she into he smoke-house again peter run to the door and call after she down the piazza try to exonerate the captain : but she either do not or would not hear and vanish into the kitchen still furious old rise make peter so uneasy that he desert he breakfast midway and hurry to the library in the solemn old room he find the captain alone and in rather a pleased mood the old gentleman stand patting and aline a pile of manuscript as the mulatto enter he exclaim : well here 's peter again as if he secretary have be off on a long journey immediately afterward he add peter guess what i do last night he voice be full of triumph peter be think about aunt rise and stand look at the captain without the slightest idea i write all of this -- he indicate he manuscript -- over a hundred page peter consider the work without much enthusiasm you must have work all night the old attorney rub he hand i think i may claim a touch of inspiration last night peter reminiscence ripple from under my pen propitious word prosperous sentence er -- the fact be peter you will see when you begin copy i have come to a matter -- a -- a matter of some moment in my life every life contain such moment peter i have mean to write something in the nature of a defen -- a explanation peter but after you leave the library last night it suddenly occur to I just to give each fact as it take place quite frankly so i do that -- not -- not what i mean to write at all -- ah as you copy it you may find it not entirely without some interest to yourself peter to I repeat peter after the fashion of the unattentative yes to yourself the captain be oddly move he take he hand off the script walk a little away from the table come back to it it -- ah -- may explain a good many thing that -- er -- may have puzzle you he clear he throat and shift he subject briskly we ought to be think about a publisher what publisher shall we have publish these reminiscence make some stir in tennessee 's political circle peter tremendous sale clear up question everybody be interested in h-m -- well i 'll walk down town and you -- he motion to the script -- begin copying -- by the way captain say peter as the old gentleman turn for the door have rise say anything to you yet the old man detach he mind from he script with a obvious effort what about about leave you service no-o not especially she be always leave my service but in this case it be my fault at least i bring it about i remonstrate with she about take you left-over victuals and sock and handkerchief and thing she be quite offended yes it always offend she agree the old man impatiently i never mention it myself unless i catch she red-handed then i storm a little to keep she in bound naturally peter know of this extraordinary system of service in the south nevertheless he be shock at its implication captain suggest peter would not you find it to you own interest to give old rise a full cash payment for she service and allow she to buy she own thing the captain dismiss the subject with a wave of he hand she be a nigger peter you can not hire a nigger not to steal bear in 'em then i be not sure but what it would be compound a felony hire a person not to steal might be so construe well now there be the script read it carefully my boy and remember that in order to gain a certain _ status quo _ certain antecedent be -- be absolutely necessary peter without they my -- my life would have be quite empty peter it be -- it be very strange -- amazing you will understand as you read i 'll be back to dinner so good-by in the strangest agitation the old captain walk out of the library the last glimpse peter have of he be he meager old figure silhouette against the cold gray fog that fill the compound neither the captain 's agitation nor he obvious desire that peter should at once read the new manuscript really get past the threshold of the mulatto 's consciousness peter 's thought still hover about old rose and from that point spread to the whole system of colored service in the south for rose 's case be typical the wage of cook in small southern village be a pittance -- and what they can steal the tragedy of the mother of a whole race work for they board and thieving come over peter with a rise grimness and there be no public sentiment against such practice it be accept everywhere as natural and inevitable the negress be never prosecute no effort be make to regain the steal goods the employer realize that what they pay would not keep soul and body together that it be steal or perish it be a fantastic truth that for any color girl to hire into domestic service in hooker 's bend be more or less enter a apprenticeship in peculation what she could steal be the major portion of she wage if two such anomalous term may be use in conjunction yet strange to say the negro woman of the village be quite honest in other matter they pay they small debt they take they mistress ' pocket-book to market and bring back the correct change and if a mistress grow too indignant about something they have steal they would bring it back and say : here be a new one i would rather buy you a new one than have you think i would take anything the whole system be the lees of slavery and be surely the most demoralizing the most grotesque method of hire service in the whole civilized world it be so absurd that its mere relation lapse into humor that bane of black folk such painful thought fill the gloomy library and harass peter in he copying he take he work to the window and try to concentrate upon it but he mind keep play away indeed it seem to peter that to sit in this old room and rewrite the wordy meanderings of the old gentleman 's book be the very height of emptiness how utterly futile when all around he on every hand girl like cissie dildine be be indenture to corruption and as far as peter know he be the only person in the south who see it or feel it or care anything at all about it when cissie dildine come to the surface of peter 's mind she remain there whirling around and around in he chaotic thought he begin talk to she image after a certain dramatic trick of he mind and she begin offer she environment as a excuse for what have come between they and estrange they she steal but she have be train to steal she be a thief the victim of a immense immorality the charm of cissie she queer swift-working intuition the candor of she confession she voluptuousness -- all come rush down on peter harass he with anger and love and desire to copy any more script become impossible he lose he place he hardly know what he be write he fling aside the whole work get to he foot with the imperative need of a athlete for the open he start out of the room but as a afterthought scribble a nervous line tell the captain he might not be back for dinner then he find he hat and coat and walk briskly around the piazza to the front gate the tree and shrub be drip but the fog have almost clear away leave only a haze in the air a pale level line of it cut across the scarp of the big hill the sun shone with a peculiar soft light through the vapor as peter pass out at the gate the fancy come to he that he might very well be start on he mission it come with a sort of surprise he wonder how other man have set about reform with unpremeditation he wonder to whom jesus of nazareth preach he first sermon the thought of that young galilean sensitive compassionate inexperienced speaking to he first hearer fill peter with a strange tremble tenderness he look about the familiar street of hooker 's bend the old tree over the pavement the shabby village house and it all hold a strangeness when thus juxtapose to the thought of nazareth nineteen hundred year before the mulatto start down the street with he footstep quicken by a sense of spiritual adventure chapter xvi on the corner against the blank south wall of hobbett 's store peter siner see the usual crowd of negro warm themselves in the soft sunshine they be slapping one another scuffle make feint with knife or stone all to a accompaniment of brag profanity and loud laughter they behavior be precisely that of adolescent white boy of fifteen or sixteen year of age jim pink stagg be furnish much amusement with a impromptu sleight - of-hand exhibition the black audience cluster around jim pink in he pinstripe trousers and blue-serge coat they exhibit not the least curiosity as to the mechanic of the trick but ask for more and still more with the naïve delight of child in the mysterious peter siner walk down the street with he messianic impulse strong upon he he be in that stage of feeling toward he people where a man 's emotion take the color of religion now as he approach the crowd of negro he wonder what he could say how he could transfer to they the idea and the emotion that lift up he own heart as he draw nearer he concern mount to anxiety indeed what could he say how could he present so grave a message he be right among they now one of the negro jostle he by strike around he body at another negro peter stop he heart beat and he have a queer sensation of be operate by some power outside himself next moment he hear himself say in fairly normal tone : fellow do you think we ought to be idle on the street corner like this we ought to be at work do not you think the horse-play stop at this amazing sentiment whuffo peter ask a voice because the whole object of we race nowadays be to gain the respect of other race and more particularly we own self-respect we have not it now the only way to get it be to work work work ef you feel lak you would ought to go to wuck suggest one astonished hearer you do get my p ` mission black boy to hit yo ' natchel gait to de fust job in sight peter be hardly less surprised than he hearer at what he be say he pay no attention to the interruption fellow it be the only way we color people can get on and make the most out of life persistent labor be the very breath of the soul man it -- it be here peter catch a intimation of the whole flow of energy through the universe focus in man and be transform into mental and moral value and it suddenly occur to he that the real worth of any people be they efficiency in give this flow of force moral and spiritual form that be the end of man that be what be prefigure when a baby 's hand reach for the sun but peter consider he audience and he thought stammer on he tongue the persimmon with he protrude half-asleep eye be say : i don ' know peter as i 's so partic ` lar ` bout makin ' de mos ' out 'n dis worl ' you know de bible say -- hit say -- here the persimmon 's voice drop a tone lower in unconscious imitation of negro preacher -- la - ay not up yo ' treasure on uth wha moss do corrup ' a ' thief break th ` ugh _ a ' _ steal come a general nodding and agreement of soft blurry voice ` at sho whut it say black man sho do lawd god love a nigger on a street corner same as he do a millionaire in a six-cylinder peter sho do black man but he be je about de onlies ' thing on uth ` at do well i don ' know come a troubled rejoinder thaiuh 's de debbil ketchin ' mo ' nigger nowadays dan he do white man i ` fo ' gawd b ` liebe well dat 's because dey _ be _ so many mo ' nigger dan dey be white folk put in a philosopher whut you say ` bout dat brudder peter inquire the persimmon seriously none of this discussion be either derision or burlesque none of the crowd have the slightest feeling that these question be not just as practical and important as the suggestion that they all go to work when peter realize how they ignorant and undisciplined thought flow off into absurdity and that they be entirely unaware of it it bring a great depression to he heart he hold up a hand with a earnestness that catch they vagrant attention listen he plead can not you see how much there be for we black folk to do and what little we have do sho be a lot to do we admit dat say bluegum frake but whut 's de use doin ' hit ef we kin manage to shy roun ' some o ' dat wuck a ' keep on libin ' anyhow specially wid wages so high the question stop peter neither he own thought nor any book that he have ever read nor any lecture that he have hear ever attempt to explain the enormous creative urge which be feel by every noble mind and which indeed be share to some extent by every human creature put to it like that siner concoct a sort of allegory tell of a negro who be shiftless in the summer and suffer want in the winter and apply it to the present high wage and to the low wage that be come but in he heart peter know such utilitarianism be not the true reason at all man do not weave tapestry to warm themselves or build temple to keep the rain away the brown man pass on around the corner out of the faint warmth of the sunshine and away from the empty and endless argument which he come have provoke among the negro the futile ending of he first adventure surprise peter he walk uncertainly up the business street of the village hardly know where to turn next cold weather have drive the merchant indoors and the thoroughfare be quite desert except for a few hog root among the refuse heap pile in front of the store it be not a pleasant sight and it repel peter all the more because he be accustom to the antiseptic look of a northern city he walk up to the third door from the corner when a buzz of voice bring he to a standstill and finally persuade he inside at the back end of a badly light store a circle of white man and boy have form around a old-fashioned egg-shaped stove near by on some meal-bag sit two negro one of whom wear a broad grin the other a funny sheepish look the white man be tease the latter negro about have go to jail for sell a mortgage cow the man go about they fun-making leisurely know quite well the negro could not get angry or make any retort or leave the store all of these method of self-defense be rule out by custom you must have forget you cow be mortgage bob no-o-o suh i -- i -- i do not fuhgit drawl he vowel to a prodigious length do not you know you would get into trouble no-o-o suh know it now do not you ya-a-s suh have a good time in jail bob ya-a-s suh shot cra-a-ap nearly all de time tull de jailer break hit up would not he let you shoot any more no-o-o suh not after he win all we money here bob fling up he head poke out he lip like a bugle and break into a grotesque hoo hoo hoo it be such a absurd laugh and bob 's tale have come to such a absurd denouement that the white man roar and shuffle they foot on the flare base of the stove some spat in or near a box fill with sawdust and betray other nervous sign of satisfaction when a man so spat he stop laugh abruptly straighten he face and stare emptily at the rusty stove until further inquisition develop some other preposterous escapade in bob 's jail career the merchant look up at one of these intermission see peter standing at he counter he come out of the circle and ask peter what he want the mulatto buy a package of soda and go out the chill north wind smell clean after the odor of the store peter stand with he package of soda breathing deeply look up and down the street wonder what to do next without much precision of purpose he walk diagonally across the street northward toward a large fade sign that read killibrew 's grocery a little later peter enter a big rather clean store which smell of spice coffee and a faint dash of decayed potato mr killibrew himself a big rotund man with a round head of prematurely white hair be visible in a little glass office at the end of he store even through the glaze partition peter could see mr killibrew smile as he sit comfortably at he desk indeed the grocer 's chief asset be a really expansive friendliness and a pleasant easily provoke laughter he be fifty-two year old and have be in the grocery business since he be fifteen he have never be to school at all but have learn bookkeeping business mathematics salesmanship and the wisdom of the market-place from he store from other merchant and from the drummer who come every week with they sample and they worldly wisdom these drummer be almost to a man very sincere friend of mr killibrew and not infrequently they would write the grocer from the city or send he telegram advise he to buy this or to unload that accord to the exigency of the market as a result of this be very well off indeed and all because he be a friendly agreeable sort of man the grocer hear peter enter and start to come out of he office when peter stop he and ask if he might speak with he alone the white-haired man with the pink good-natured face stand look at peter with rather a question but pleasant expression why certainly certainly he turn back to the swivel-chair at he desk seat himself and twist about on peter as he enter mr killibrew do not offer peter a seat -- that would have be a infraction of hooker 's bend custom -- but he sit lean back evidently make up he mind to refuse peter credit which he fancy the mulatto would ask for and yet do it pleasantly i be wonder mr killibrew begin peter feel he way along i be wonder if you would mind talk over a little matter with I it be consider a delicate subject i believe but i think a frank talk would help during the natural pause of peter 's explanation mr killibrew keep up a genial series of nod and ejaculation certainly peter i do not see why peter i be sure it will help peter i would like to talk frankly about the relation of we two race in the south in hooker 's bend the grocer stop he run accompaniment of affirmation and look steadfastly at peter presently he seem to solve some question and break into a pleasant laugh now peter if this be some political shenanigan i must tell you i be a democrat besides that i do not care a straw about politics i vote and that be all peter put down the suspicion that he be on a political errand not that at all mr killibrew it be a question of the white race and the black race the particular feature i be work on be the wages pay to cook i do not know you be a cook interject the grocer in surprise i be not mr killibrew look at peter think intensely for a few moment and come to a unescapable conclusion you do not mean you have form a cook 's union here in hooker 's bend peter he cry immensely amaze not at all it be this clarify peter it may seem trivial but it illustrate the principle i be try to get at do not you cook carry away cold food it require perhaps four seconds for the merchant to stop he speculation on what peter have come for and adjust he mind to the question why yes i suppose so he agree very much at sea i -- i never catch up with she he laugh a pleasant puzzle laugh of course she do not come around and show I what she be make off with why well it be this would not you prefer to give you cook a certain cash payment instead of have she taking uncertain amount of you foodstuff and wear apparel the merchant lean forward in he chair do old becky davi send you to I with any such proposition as that peter no not at all but mr killibrew would not you like better and more trustworthy servant as cook as farm-hand chauffeur stable-boy you see you and you child and you child 's child be go to have to depend on negro labor as far as we can see to the end of time we-e-ell yes admit mr killibrew who be not accustom to consider the end of time would not it be better to have honest self-respecting help than dishonest help certainly then let 's think about cook how can one hope to rear a honest self - respect citizenry as long as the mother of the race be compel to resort to thievery to patch out a insufficient wage why i do not suppose nigger ever will be honest admit the grocer very frankly you naturally do not trust a nigger if you credit one for a dime the next time he have any money he 'll go trade somewhere else the grocer break into he contagious laugh do you know how i have build up my business here peter by never trust a nigger mr killibrew continue he pleased chuckle yes i get the whole cash trade of the nigger in hooker 's bend by never cheat one and never trust one the grocer lean back in he squeak chair and look out through the glass partition over the brightly color package that line he shelf from floor to ceiling all that prosperity have come about through a policy of honesty and distrust it be something to be proud of now let I see he proceed recur pleasantly to what he recall of peter 's original proposition : aunt becky send you here to tell I if i would raise she pay she would stop stealin ' and -- and raise some honest child mr killibrew throw back he head break into loud jelly-like laughter why do not you know peter she be a old liar if i give she a hundred a week she would steal and child why the old humbug she be too old she be have she crop and besides all that i do not mind what the old woman take it be not much she be a good old darky faithful as a dog he arise from he swivel-chair briskly and float peter out before he tell she if she want a raise he conclude heartily and can not pinch enough out of my kitchen and the two dollar i pay she -- tell she to come to I straight out and i 'll give she more and she can pinch more mr killibrew move down the aisle of he store between fragrant barrel and box laugh mellowly at old aunt becky 's ruse as he see it as he turn peter out he invite he to come again when he need anything in the grocery line and he be so pleasant hearty and sincere in he friendliness toward both peter and old aunt becky that peter even amid the complete side - tracking and derail of he mission decide that it ever he do have occasion to purchase any grocery he would do he trading at this market rule by a absolute honesty with and a complete distrust in he race at the conclusion of the killibrew interview peter instinctively feel that he have just about touch the norm of hooker 's bend the village might contain man who would dive a little deeper into the race question with peter assuredly there would be hundred who would not dive so deep mr killibrew 's attitude on the race question turn on how to hold the negro patronage of the village to he grocery it be not a abstract question at all but a concrete fact which he have work out to he own satisfaction with mr killibrew with all hooker 's bend there be no negro question chapter xvii when peter siner start on he indefinite errand among the village store he believe it would require much tact and diplomacy to discuss the race question without offense to he surprise no precaution be necessary everybody agree at once that the south would be benefit by a more trustworthy labor that if the negro be trustworthy they could be pay more but nobody agree that if negro be pay more they would become more trustworthy the prevail dictum be a nigger 's a nigger as peter come out into the shabby little street of hooker 's bend discouragement settle upon he he feel as if he have come squarely against some blank stone wall that no amount of talk could budge the black man would have to change he psychology or remain where he be a creature of poverty hovel and dirt but amid such surroundings he could not change he psychology the point of these unhappy conclusion somehow turn against cissie dildine the mulatto become aware that he whole crusade have be undertake in behalf of the octoroon everything the merchant say against negro become accusation against cissie in a sharp personal way a nigger be a nigger a thief be a thief she would not quit steal if i pay she a hundred a week every stroke have fall squarely on cissie 's shoulder a nigger a thief and she would never be otherwise it be all so hopeless so unchangeable that peter walk down the bleak street unutterably depress there be nothing he could do the situation be static it seem best that he should go away north and save he own skin it be impossible to take cissie with he perhaps in time he would come to forget she and in so do he would forget the pauperism and pettiness of all the black folk of the south because through cissie peter see the whole negro race she be flexuous and passionate kindly and loving childish and naïvely wise on occasion she could falsify and steal and in the depth of she peter sense a profound capacity for fury and violence for all she precise english she be untame perhaps untamable cissie be a far cry from the sort of woman peter imagine he want for a mate yet he know that if he stay on in hooker 's bend see she desire she with she luxury mock the loneliness of the old renfrew manor presently he would marry she already he have have he little irrational moment when it seem to he that cissie herself be quite fine and worthy and that she speculation be something foreign and do not pertain to she at all he would better go north it would be safer up there no doubt he could find another color girl in the north the thought of fondle any other woman fill peter with a sudden sharp repulsion however peter be wise he know he would get over that in time with this plan in mind peter set out down the street intend to cross the big hill at the church walk over to he mother 's shack and pack he few belongings preparatory to go away it be not a heroic retreat the conversation which he have have with he college friend farquhar recur to peter farquhar have try to persuade peter to remain north and take a position in a system of garage out of chicago you can do nothing in the south siner assure farquhar you countryman must stand on they own foot just as you be do peter have argue the vast majority of the negro have no chance but farquhar press the point that peter himself disprove he own statement at the time peter feel there be a clench in the illinoisan 's logic but he be not skilful enough to analyze it now the mulatto begin to see that farquhar be right the negro question be a matter of individual initiative critic forget that a race be compose of individual man peter have a uneasy sense that this be exceedingly thin logic a mere smoke screen behind which he mean to retreat back up north he walk on down the poor village street turn it over and over in he mind affirm it positively to himself after the manner of uneasy conscience a unusual stir among the negro on hobbett 's corner catch peter 's attention and break into he chain of think half a dozen negro stand on the corner stare down toward the white church a black boy suddenly start run across the street and disappear among the store on the other side peter catch glimpse of he among the wretched alleyway and vacant lot that lie east of main street the boy be still run toward niggertown by this time peter be just opposite the watcher on the corner he lift he voice and ask they the matter but at the moment they begin a excited talking and no one hear he jim pink stagg jerk off he fur cap make a gesture contorted he long black face into a caricature of fright and come lope across the street look back over he shoulder mimic a run for life he mummery set he audience howl the buffoon would have collide with peter but the mulatto catch jim pink by the arm and shoulder bring he to a halt and at the same time help he keep he foot to peter 's inquiry what be the matter the black fellow whirl and blare out loudly for the sake of he audience : ` fo ' gawd nigger i sho think mr bobb have I and he writhe he face into a idiotic grimace the audience reel about in they mirth because with negro as with white person two third of humor be in the reputation and jim pink be of prodigious repute peter walk along with he patiently because he know that until they be out of ear-shot of the crowd there be no way of get a sensible answer out of jim pink where be you go he ask presently think i would step over to niggertown jim pink 's humorous air be still upon he what be do over there what be the boy raise such a hullabaloo about such I why do that boy go run across like that jim pink roll he eye on peter with a peculiar look reckon he mu ' ` a ' want to git on t ` other side o ' town peter flatter the punchinello by smile a little come jim pink what do you know he ask the magician poke out he huge lip mr bobb turn acrost by de church over de big hill da ' 's always a ba-ad sign peter 's brief interest in the matter flicker out another arrest for some niggerish peccadillo the history of niggertown be one long series of petty offens petty raid and petty punishment peter would be glad to get well away from such a place think i 'll go north jim pink remark peter chiefly to keep up a friendly conversation with he companion whut-chu goin ' to do up thaiuh take a position in a system of garage a position be a job wid a white color on it define the minstrel whut you goin ' to do wid cissie peter look around at the foolish face with cissie -- cissie dildine uh huh why what make you think i be go to do anything with cissie m-m visitin ' roun ' the fool fling he face into a grimace and drop it as one might shake out a sack peter watch the contortion uneasily what do you mean -- visit around diff ` nt folk go visitin ' roun ' some go up a ' some go down apparently jim pink have merely quote a few word from a poem he know he stare at the green-black depth of the glade which set in about half-way up the hill they be climb ef this weather don ' ever break he observe sagely we sho be in fuh a dry spell peter do not pursue the topic of the weather he climb the hill in silence wonder just what the buffoon mean he suspect he be hint at cissie 's visit to he room however he do not dare ask any question or press the point in any manner lest he commit himself the minstrel have succeed in make peter 's walk very uncomfortable as somehow he always do peter go on think about the matter if jim pink know of cissie 's visit all niggertown know it no woman 's reputation nobody 's shame or misery or even life would stand between jim pink and what he consider a joke the buffoon be the crudest thing in this world -- a man who think himself a wit peter could imagine all the endless tweak to cissie 's pride niggertown would give the octoroon she have ask peter to marry she and have be refuse she have humble herself for naught that be the very tar of shame peter know that in the moral category of niggertown cissie would suffer more from such a rebuff than if she have lie or commit theft and adultery every day in the calendar she have be refuse marriage all the folk-way of niggertown be utterly topsyturvy it be a crazy-house fill with the most grotesque moral measure it seem to peter as he enter the cedar-glade that he have lose all sympathy with this people from which he have spring he look upon they as strange incomprehensible being just as a man will forget he own childhood and look upon child as strange incomprehensible little creature in the midst of he thought he hear himself say to jim pink : i suppose it be as dusty as ever dustier ` a ever assure jim pink apparently they conversation have recur to the weather after all a chill silence encompass the glade the path the negro follow wound this way and that among reddish boulder between screen of intergrown cedar and over a bronze mat of needle they step be noiseless the odor of the cedar and the temple-like stillness bring to peter 's mind the night of he mother 's death it seem to he a long time since he have come run through the glade after a doctor and yet by a queer distortion of he sense of time he mother 's death and burial bulk in he past as if it have occur yesterday there be no sound in the glade to disturb peter 's thought except a murmur of human voice from some of the innumerable privacy of the place and the occasional chirp of a waxwing busy over cluster of cedar-ball it have be five week and a day since caroline die five week and a day he mother 's death drift away into the mystery and oblivion of the past likewise twenty-five year of he own life complete and go a procession of sad wistful thought trail through peter 's brain : he mother and ida may and now cissie it seem to peter that all any woman have ever bring he be wistfulness and sadness he mother have be jealous and instead of the great happiness he have expect he home life with she have turn out a series of small perplexity and pain before that be ida may and now here be she younger sister peter wonder if any man ever reach the peace and happiness foreshadow in he dream of a woman \* \* \* \* \* a voice call he name check peter 's stride mechanically and cause he to look about with the slight bewilderment of a man arouse from a reverie at the first sound however jim pink become suddenly alert he take three stride ahead of peter and as he go he whisper over he shoulder : beat it nigger beat it the mulatto recognize one of jim pink 's endless stupid attempt at comedy it would be precisely jim pink 's idea of a jest to give peter a little start as the mulatto stand look about among the cedar for the person who have call he name it amaze he that jim pink could be so utterly insane that he perform some buffoonery instantly by reflex action as it be upon the slightest provocation it be almost a mania with jim pink it verge on the pathological the clown however be press he joke he be pretend great fear and be shout out in he loose minstrel voice : hey don ' shoot down di way black man tull i make my exit and a voice rich with contempt call back : you need not be skeer you fool rabbit of a nigger peter turn with a qualm quite close to he and in another direction from which he have be look stand tump pack the ex-soldier look the worse for wear after he jail sentence he uniform be fray and over he face lay a grayish cast that mark negro in bad condition at he side attach by a belt and a elaborate shoulder holster hang a big army revolver while on the greasy lapel of he coat be pin he military medal for exceptional bravery on the field of battle be lookin ' fuh you fuh some time peter he state grimly peter consider the formidable figure with a queer sensation he try to take tump 's appearance casually he try to maintain a air of ordinariness do not know you be back yeah i 's back have you -- be look for I yeah do not you know where i be stay co ` se i do up ` mong de white folk you know dey don ' ` low no shootin ' a ' killin ' ` mong de white folk he draw he pistol from the holster with the address of a expert marksman -lrb- illustration : naw yuh do not he warn sharply you turn roun ' a ' march on to niggertown -rrb- peter stand with a quicken pulse study he assailant the glade the air the sunshine seem suddenly draw to a tension likely to break into violent commotion he abrupt danger bring peter to a feeling of lightness and power a quiver go along he spine he nostril widen unconsciously as he calculate a leap and a blow at tump 's gun the soldier take a step backward at the same time bring the barrel to a ready naw you do not he warn sharply you turn roun ' a ' march on to niggertown what for peter still try to be casual but he voice hold new overtone because nigger i mean to drap you right on de main street o ' niggertown ` fo ' all dem nigger whut 's be a-raggin ' I ` bout you a ' cissie i 's gwine show dem fool nigger i don ' take no fumi-diddle off 'n nobody tump gasp jim pink in a husky voice you ought not shoot peter he mammy je daid ` en she win ' worry none turn roun ' peter a ' when i say ` march ' you march he level he pistol ` tention rat about face march peter turn and move off down the noiseless path walk with the stiff gait of a man who expect a terrific blow from behind at any instant the mulatto walk twenty or more pace amid a confusion of self - protective impulse he think of whirling on tump even at this late date he think of dart behind a cedar but he know the man behind he be a expert shot and something fundamental in the brown man forbid he get himself kill while run away it be too undignified a death presently he surprise himself by call over he shoulder as a sort of complaint : how come you with the pistol tump think it be against the law to carry one you kin can ' y 'em ef you don ' keep 'em hide explain the ex-soldier in a wooden voice mr bobb tol ' I dat when he guv my gun back the irony of the thing catch peter for the authority to arrest tump not because he be try to kill peter but because he go about he first attempt in a illegal manner for the first time in he life the mulatto feel that contempt for a white man 's technicality that flavor every negro 's thought here for thirty day he life have be save by a technical law of the white man at the end of the thirty day by another technical law tump be set at liberty and allow to carry a weapon in a certain way to murder he it be grotesque it be absurd it fill peter with a sudden violent question of the whole white régime he thought dance along in peculiar excitement at the turn of the hill the trio come in sight of the squalid semicircle of niggertown here and there from a tumbledown chimney a feather of pale wood smoke lift into the chill sunshine the sight of the house bring peter a sharp realization that he life would end in the curving street beneath he a shock at the incomprehensible brevity of he life rush over he just to that street just as far as the curve and he leg be swing along carry he forward at a even gait all at once he begin talk argue he try to speak at a ordinary tempo but he word keep edge on faster and faster : tump i be not go to marry cissie dildine i know you be not peter i mean if you let I alone i do not mean to i be not goin ' to let you alone tump we have already decide not to marry after a short pause tump say in a slightly different tone : ` pear lak you don ' haf to ma ' y she -- comin ' to yo ' room a queer sinking come over the mulatto listen tump i -- we -- in my room -- we simply talk that be all she come to tell I she be goin away i -- i do not harm she tump peter swallow he despair of be believe but he defense only infuriate the soldier he suddenly break into violent profanity hot damn you shut yo black mouf whut i keer whut-chu do you wean she away fum I she will not speak to I she will not look at I a sudden insanity of rage seize tump he pour on he victim every oath and obscenity he have rake out of the whole army strangely enough the gunman 's outbreak bring a kind of relief to peter siner it exonerate he he be not suspect of wrong cissie or rather whether he have or have not wrong she make no difference to tump peter 's crime consist in mere be in exist where cissie could see he and desire he rather than tump why it calm peter to know that tump hold no dishonorable charge against he the mulatto himself could not have tell tump 's violence show peter the certainty of he own death and somehow it wash away the hope and the thought of escape half-way down the hill they enter the edge of niggertown the smell of sty and stable come to they peter 's thought move here and there like the eye of a little child glance about as it be force to leave a pleasure-ground peter know that jim pink who now make a sorry figure in they rear would one day give a buffoon 's mimicry of this he walk to death he think of tump who would have to serve a year or two in the nashville penitentiary for the murder of negro be seldom severely punish he think of cissie he be be murder because cissie desire he and then peter remember the single bit of wisdom that he whole life have teach he it be this : no people can become civilized until the woman have the power of choice among the male that sue for she hand the history of the white race show the gradual increase of the woman 's power of choice among the yellow race where this power be curtail civilization be curtail it be this principle that exalt chivalry upon it the white man have rear all he social fabric so deeply ingrained be it that almost every novel write by white man revolve about some woman 's choice of she mate be thwart by power or pride or wealth but in every instance the rightness of the woman 's choice be finally justified the burden of every song be love true love endure love a woman 's true and enduring love and in he moment of clairvoyance peter see that these song and story be profoundly true against a woman 's selectiveness no other social force may count that be why he own race be weak and hopeless and helpless the male of he people be devoid of any such sentiment or self-repression they be man of the jungle creature of tusk and claw and loin this very act of violence against he person condemn he whole race these thought bring the mulatto a unspeakable sadness not only for he own particular death but that this idea this great redeeming truth which burn so brightly in he brain would in another moment flicker out unrevealed and be no more chapter xviii the cough and rattle of a old motor-car as it round the niggertown curve delay tump pack 's act of violence instinctively the three man wait for the machine to pass before peter walk out into the road next moment it appear around the turn move slowly through the dust and spread a veritable fog behind it all three negro recognize the first glimpse of the hood and top for there be only three or four car in hooker 's bend and these be as well know as the face of they owner this particular motor belong to constable bobb and the next moment the trio see the ponderous body of the officer at the wheel and by he side a woman as the machine clack toward they peter feel a certain surprise to see that it be cissie dildine the constable in the car scrutinize the black man by the roadside in a very peculiar way as he come near he lean across cissie and almost eclipse the girl he eye the trio with he perpetual menace of a grin on he broad red face he right hand lie across cissie 's lap hold a revolver when closest he shout above the clangor of he engine : now none o ' that boy none o ' that you 'll prob ` ly hit the gal if you shoot a ' i 'll pick you off lak three black skunks he brandish he revolver at they but the gesture be barely see and instantly conceal by the cloud of dust follow the motor next moment it envelop the negro and hide they even from one another it be only after peter be lose in the dust-cloud that the mulatto really divine what be mean by cissie 's strange appearance with the constable she chalky face she frightened brown eye the significance of the scene grow in he mind he stand with eye screw to slit stare into the apricot-colored dust in the direction of the vanish noise presently tump pack 's form outline itself in the yellow obscurity grope toward peter he still hold he pistol but it swing at he side he call peter 's name in the strained voice of a man struggle not to cough : peter -- be mr bobb do -- ` rest cissie peter could hardly talk himself do not know look like it the two negro stare at each other through the dust fuh gawd 's sake cissie ` rest tump begin to cough then he wheeze : mine a ' yo ' little deal 's off peter you gotta he ' p git she out here he fall into a violent fit of cough and start grope he way to the edge of the dust-cloud in the rush of the moment the swift change in peter 's situation appear only natural he follow tump so distressed by the dust and disturb over cissie that he hardly think of he peculiar position the dust pinch the upper part of he throat sting he nose tear trickle from he eye and he press he finger against he upper lip try not to sneeze he be still struggle against the sneeze when tump recover he speech wh-whut you reckon she do peter she don ' shoot crap nor boot - laig nor -- he fall to cough peter get out a handkerchief and wipe he eye let 's go -- to the dildine house he say the two move hurriedly through the thin cloud and presently come to breathable air where they could see the house around they i know she do somp 'n i know she do somp 'n chant tump with the melancholy cadence of he race he shake he dusty head you be not never be in jail be you black man peter say he have not lawd it be not no place fuh a woman declare tump you dunno nothin ' ` bout it black man it sho be not no place fuh a woman a notion of a iron cage float before peter 's mind the two negro trudge on through the crescent side by side they step raise a little trail of dust in the air behind they they face and clothes be of a uniform dust color streak of mud mark the runnel of they tear down they cheek the shrubbery and weed that grow alongside the negro thoroughfare be quite dead even the little avenue of dwarf box be wither that lead from the gate to the door of the dildine home the two color man walk up the little path to the door knock and wait on the step for the little skirmish of observation from behind the blind none come the worst have befall the house there be nothing to guard the door open as soon as a inmate could reach it and vannie dildine stand before they the quadroon 's eye be red and she face have the moist slightly swollen appearance that come of protracted weep she look so frail and miserable that peter instinctively step inside and take she arm to assist she in the mere physical effort of stand what be the matter mr dildine he ask in a shocked tone what be happen to cissie vannie begin weep again with a faint gasping and a rack of she flat chest it be -- it be -- o-o-oh peter she put a arm about he and begin weep against he he soothe she pat she shoulder at the same time stare at the side of she head wonder what could have deal she this blow presently she steady herself and begin explain in feeble little phrase sandwich between sob and gasp : she -- tuk a brooch -- kep ' -- kep ' layin ' it roun ' in -- h-her way th-that young sam arkwright do -- a-an ' finally she -- she tuk hit n-nen when he see he h-have she he say sh-sh-she would haf to d-do wh-whut he say or he would sen ' she to-to ja-a-il vannie sob drearily for a few moment on peter 's breast sh-she do fuh a while : 'n ` en

place she in the old rocking-chair before the empty hearth there be where he have sit the evening cissie make she painful confession to he only now do he realize the whole of what cissie be try to confess peter siner overtake tump pack a little way down the crescent opposite the berry cabin the thoroughfare be desert because the weather be cold and the scantily clad child be indoors however from every cabin come sound of laugh and romp and now and then a youngster dart through the cold from one hut to another it seem to peter siner only a little while since he and ida may be skitter through wintry weather from one fire to another with cissie a wail wet-nosed little spoil-sport trail after they and then with a wheeling of the year they be scatter everywhere as the negro pass the berry cabin nan berry come out with a old shawl around she bristling spike she stop the two man and draw they to she gate with a gesture wha you gwine jonesbuh whut you goin ' do ` bout po-o-o '

tump it be takin ' mo ' at one time a ' de white folk ` speck you to take define the woman well i 'll go git she clo'e she hurry off up the crescent peter and tump wait in the berry cabin for nan 's return outside the berry cabin be the usual clapboard-roofed weather-stained structure inside it be dark windowless and strong with the odor of black folk some child be play around the hearth roast chestnut they elder sit in a circle of decrepit chair it be so dark that when peter first enter he could not make out the little group but he soon recognize they voice : parson ranson wince washington jerry dillihay and all of the berry family they be talk of cissie of course they hope cissie would not really be send to the penitentiary that the white folk would let she out in time for she to have she child at home parson ranson think it would be bad luck for a child to be bear in jail wince washington who have be in jail a number of time suggest that they bail cissie out by sign they name to a paper he have be set free by this mean once or twice sally nan 's little sister observe tartly that if cissie have not act so she would not have be in jail don ' speak lak dat uv dem as be in trouble sally reprove old parson ranson solemnly anybody can say ` ef ' sho be de troof agree jerry dillihay sho be black man the conversation drift into the endless moralizing of they race but it hold no criticism or condemnation of cissie from the tone of the negro one would have think some impersonal disaster have overtake she every one be plan how to help cissie how to make she present state more endurable they be the black folk the unfortunate of the earth and the pride of righteousness be only to the well place and the untempted presently nan come back with a bundle of cissie 's clothes tump take the bundle of dainty lingerie the intimate garment of the woman he love and set forth on he quixotic errand he tie it to he shoulder-holster and set out peter go a little of the way with he it be almost dusk when they start the chill of approach night sting the man 's face as they walk past the footpath that lead over the big hill three pistol-shot from the glade announce that the boot-legger have open business for the night tump pause and shiver he say it be a cold night he think he would like to get a kick of white mule to put a little heart in he it be a long walk to jonesboro he hesitate a moment then turn off the road around the crescent for the path through the glade a think to dissuade tump from drink the fiery singling of the moonshiner cross peter mind but he put it aside tump be a habitué of the glade all the physiological argument upon which peter could base a argument be far beyond the ex-soldier 's comprehension so tump turn off through the dark tree peter watch he until all he could see be the white blur of cissie 's underwear swing against he holster after tump 's disappearance peter stand for several minute think he brief crusade into niggertown have end in a situation far outside of he volition that morning he have start out with some vague idea of take niggertown in he hand and molding it in accordance with he white idea but niggertown have take peter into its hand have threaten he life have administer to he profound mental and moral shock and now have drop he like some bit of waste with he face set over the big hill for white town as peter stand there it seem to he there be something symbolic in he attitude he be no longer of the black world he be of the white he do not understand he people they elude he he belong to the white world not to the village across the hill but to the north nothing now prevent he from go north and take the position with farquhar cissie dildine be impossible for he now niggertown be immovable at least for he he be no washington to lead he people to a loftier plane in fact peter begin to suspect that he be no leader at all he see now that he initial success with the son and daughter of benevolence have be effect merely by the aura of he college training after he first misstep he have never rehabilitate himself he perhaps have a dash of the artistic in he and the power to mold idea often confuse itself subjectively with the power to mold human being in reality he do not even understand the people he assume to mold a suspicion come to he that under the give condition they way be more rational than he own as for cissie dildine he duty by the girl he queer protective passion for she -- all that be surely past now after she lapse from all decency there be no reason why he should spend another think on she he would go north to chicago the last of the twilight be fading in swift visible gradation of light the cedar the cabin and the hill fade in pulse-beat of darkness above the big hill the last ember of day smolder against a green-blue infinity here and there a star prick the dome with a wintry brilliance then somehow the thought of cissie look out on that chilly sky through iron bar tighten peter 's throat he catch himself up sharply for he emotion he begin a vague defense of the white man 's law on grounds as cold and impersonal as the winter evening law custom and convention be for the strengthening of man to seed the select to winnow the weak it be white logic apply firmly as by a white man but somehow the star multiply and keep cissie 's image before peter -- a cold frightened girl harass with come motherhood peer at those chill distant light out of the blackness of a jail the mulatto decide to spend the night in he mother 's cabin he would do he packing and be ready for the down-river boat in the morning he find he way to he own gate in the darkness he lift it around enter and walk to he door when he try to open it he find some one have bore hole through the shutter and the jamb and have wire it shut peter strike a match to see just what have be do the flame display a small sheet tack on the door he spend two match investigate it it be a notice of levy post by the constable in a action of debt bring against the estate of caroline siner by henry hooker the owner of the estate and the public in general be warn against remove anything whatsoever from the premise under penalty exact by the law govern such offens then peter untwisted the wire and enter peter search about and find the tiny brass night-lamp which he mother always have use the larger glass-bowled lamp be go the interior of the cabin be clammy from cold and foul from long lack of air in the corner he mother 's old four-poster loom in the shadow but he could see some of its cover have be take he pass into the kitchen with a notion of build a fire and eat a bite but everything edible have be abstract even one of the lid of the old step-stove be go most of the pan and kettle have disappear but the pretty old dutch sugar-bowl remain on a bare paper-covered shelf negro-like whatever person or person who have ransack peter 's home consider the sugar-bowl too fine to take or they may have think that peter would want this bowl for a keepsake and with that queer compassion that permeate a negro 's worst moment they allow it to remain and peter know if he raise a outcry about he loss much of the property would be surreptitiously restore or perhaps he neighbor would bring back he thing and say they have find they they would help he as best they could just as they of the crescent would help cissie as best they could and would receive she back as one of they when she and she baby be finally release from jail they be a queer people they be a people who would never get on well and do well they lack the steel-like edge that the white man achieve by virtue of he hardness a white man make he very law and virtue instrument to crush and mulct he fellow-man but negro be so soften by untoward streak of sympathy that they lose the very use of they crime the depression of the whole day settle upon peter with the deepen night he hold he poor light above he head and pick he way to he own room after the magnificence of the renfrew manor it have contract to a grimy little box line with yellowed papers he book be still intact but henry hooker would get they as part payment on the dillihay place which henry own on he little table still lay the pile of old examination papers list of incoherent question which somebody somewhere imagine form a test of human ability to meet and answer the mysterious searching of life peter be familiar with the book many of the question he have learn by rote but the night and the crescent and the thought of a pregnant girl cage in the blackness of a jail fill he soul with a great melancholy query to which he could find no answer chapter xix two voice talk interrupt each other with ejaculation after the fashion of negro under excitement arouse peter siner from he sleep he catch the word : he do tump do the jailer do ` fo ' god black man whut 's cissie doin ' overtone of shock even of horror in the two voice bring peter wide awake the moment he open he eye he sit up suddenly in he bed remain perfectly still listen with he mouth open the voice however be pass the word become indistinct then relapse into that bubble monotone of human voice at a distance and presently cease these fragmentary phrase however feathered with consternation fill peter with vague premonition he whirl he leg out of bed and begin draw on he clothes when he be up and into the crescent however nobody be in sight he stand breathe the chill damp air blinking he eye lack of he cold bath make he feel chilly and lethargic he wriggle he shoulder and consider go back after all and have he splash just then he see the persimmon come around the crescent peter call to the roustabout and ask about tump pack the persimmon look at peter with he half-asleep protrude eyeball don ' you know ` bout tump pack already mister siner no peter be astonish at the formality of the mr siner then be you ` spectin ' somp 'n ` bout he why no but i be asleep in there a moment ago and somebody come along talk about tump and cissie they -- they be not marry be they oh no-o no-o-o no-o-o-o-o the persimmon waggle he bullet head slowly from side to side i hear tump get into a lil trouble wid de jailer la ' night serious i dunno the persimmon close one of he protrude yellow eye owin ' to whut you call se'ius maybe whut i call se'ius would not be se'ius to you at all 'n ` en maybe whut you call se'ius would be ve ' y insince'ius to tump the roustabout 's philosophy which consist in a monotonous recasting of a give proposition trickle on and on in the cold wind after a while it fizzle out to nothing at all and the persimmon ask in a queer manner : do you give tump some woman 's clo'e peter it be such a odd question that at first peter be at loss then he recall nan berry 's despatch cissie some underwear he explain this to the persimmon and tack on a curious why oh nothin ' nothin ' ` tall ever ` body say you a mighty long-haided nigger jim pink he tell we ` bout tump pack marchin ' you ` roun ' wid a gun i sho don ' want you ever git mad at I mister siner man wid a gun a ' you turn yo ' long haid on he a ' blow he away wid a wad o ' woman 's clo'e i sho don ' want you ever cross yo ' finger at I mister siner peter stare at the grotesque bullet-headed roustabout persimmon he say uneasily what in the world be you talk about the persimmon smile a sickly white-toothed smile jim pink say yo ' aidjucation be a flivver i say ` jim pink no nigger don ' go off a ' study fo ' yeah in college whut 'n he come back a ' kin throw some kin ' uv a hoodoo over we fool nigger whut be not get no brain now tump wid a gun a ' you wid je ordina ' y woman 's clo'e ` fo ' gawd aidjucation be a great thing sho be a great thing the persimmon give peter a apprehensive wink and move on there be no use try to extract information from the persimmon unless he be mind to give it he talk would merely become vaguer and vaguer peter watch he go then turn and attempt to throw the whole matter off he mind by assume a certain brisk northern mood he must pack get ready for the down-river gasolene launch the doings of tump pack and cissie dildine be after all nothing to he he start inside when the levy notice on the door again meet he eye he pause read it over once more and decide that he must go over the hill to the planter 's bank and get henry hooker 's permission to remove certain small personal belongings that he want to take with he the mere clear-cut decision to go invigorated peter some of the energy that always fill he during he college day in boston seem to come to he now from the mere thought of the north soon he would be in the midst of it move briskly talk to wide - awake man to whom a slightly unusual english word would not form a stumbling-block to conversation he set out down the crescent and across the big hill at a swing stride he be glad to get away beyond the white church on the other side of the hill he hear a motor come in on the jonesboro road presently he see a battered car move around the long swing of the pike spew a trail of dust down the wind its clack become prodigious the mulatto be just enter that indefinite stretch of thoroughfare where a country road become a village street when there come a wail of brake behind he and he look around it be dawson bobb 's car the fat man now slow up not far from the mulatto and call to he yes sir say peter dawson bob he fat head backward and upward in a signal for peter to approach it hold the casualness of one certain to be obey although peter have do no crime nor have even harbor a criminal intention a trickle of apprehension go through he at bobb 's nod he recall jim pink 's say that it be bad luck to see the constable he walk up to the shudder motor and stand about three foot from the running-board the officer bit on a sliver of toothpick that he hold in he thin lip accident up jonesboro la ' night peter what be it mr bobb tump pack get kill peter continue look fixedly at mr bobb 's broad red face the dusty road beneath he seem to give a little dip he repeat the information emptily try to orient himself to this sudden change in he whole mental horizon the officer be look at peter fixedly with he chill slit of eye yeah try to make a jail delivery the two man continue look at each other one from the road the other from the motor the flow of peter 's thought seem to divide the greater part be occupy with tump pack peter could vision the formidable ex-soldier lie dead in jonesboro jail with he little congressional medal on he breast some lighter portion of he mind nicker about here and there on trivial thing he observe a little hole rust in the running-board of the motor he notice that the officer 's eye be just the same chill wash blue as the winter sky above he head he remember a tale that before electrocution become a law in tennessee the county sheriff 's nerve have fail he at a hanging and the constable dawson bobb have spring the drop there be something terrible about the fat man he would do anything absolutely anything that come to he hand in the way of legal sewage in the midst of these thought peter hear himself say he -- be try to get cissie out yep he -- must have be drunk oh yeah mr bobb sit study the mulatto as he study he he say slowly : some of 'em say he be disguise as a woman other say he have some woman 's clothes along ready to put on now I and the sheriff know tump pack purty well peter and we know that nigger never in the worl ' would ` a ' think up sich a plan by hisself he sit look at peter so interrogatively that the mulatto begin in a strained earnest voice tell the constable precisely what have happen in regard to the clothes mr bobb sit listen impassively move he toothpick up and down from one side to the other of he small thin-lipped mouth at last he nod well i guess that be about the way of it i do not exactly understand the woman 's clothes business -- damn ' fool disguise -- but we figger it might pop into the head of a ' edjucate nigger he suck he tooth reflectively peter he say at last seem to I if i be you i would drift on away from this town the nigger around here be not strong for you now some say you be a hoodoo some say this a ' some that the white folk do not exactly like you try to get up a cook 's union it be you right to do that if you want to of course but this be a mighty small city to have union and thing the fact be it be not a big enough place for a nigger of yore ability peter i b ` lieve if i be you i would je drift on some'ere else the officer tip up he toothpick so that it lift he upper lip in a little v-shaped opening and expose a strong yellowish tooth at the moment he machine start slowly forward it give he the appearance of accidentally roll off while immerse in deep thought \* \* \* \* \* the death of tump pack move peter with a sense of strange pathos he always remember tump tramp away through the night to carry cissie some underclothes and if possible to take she place in jail at the foundation of tump 's be lay a faithfulness and devotion to cissie that reach the height of a dog 's and yet he might have desert she he would probably have beat she and he most certainly would have betray she many many time it be inexplicable now that tump be dead the mantle of he fidelity somehow seem to fall on peter for some reason peter feel that he should assume tump 's place as cissie dildine 's husband and protector have tump live peter might have go north in peace if not in happiness now such a journey without cissie have become impossible he have a feeling that it would not be right as for the disgrace of marry such a woman as cissie dildine peter slowly give that idea up the worthiness and disgrace implicit in harvard atmosphere which peter have spend four year of he life imbibe slowly melt away in the air of niggertown what be honorable there what be disgraceful there somehow change its color here by virtue of this change peter feel intuitively that cissie dildine be neither disgrace by she arrest nor soil by she physical condition somehow she seem just as nice a girl just as good a girl as ever she be before moreover every other darky in niggertown hold these same instinctive belief have it not be for that peter would have think it be he passion plead for the girl justify itself by a grotesque morality as passion often do but this be not the correct solution the sentiment be enigmatic peter puzzle over it time and time again as he wait in hooker 's bend for the outcome of cissie 's trial the octoroon 's imprisonment come to a end on the third day after tump 's death sam arkwright 's parent have not know of they son 's legal proceedings and mr arkwright immediately quash the warrant and hush up the unfortunate matter as best he could young sam be suddenly send away from home to college as the best step in the circumstance and so the wish of the adolescent in the cedar-glade come queerly to pass even if peter do withhold any grave mature advice on the subject which he may have possess naturally there be much mirth among the man of hooker 's bend and much virulence among the woman over the peculiar condition under which young sam make he pilgrimage in pursuit of wisdom and moral and the right conduct of life and life be problematic and uncertain as it be and prone to wind about in the strangest way no one may say with certitude that young sam do not make a promising start certainly over the affair the knight of the round table launch many a quip and jest but that simply prove the fineness of they sentiment toward a certain delicate human relation which form mankind 's single awful approach to the creative and the holy tump pack become almost a mythical figure in niggertown jim pink stagg compose a saga relate the soldier 's exploit in france he assault on the jail to liberate cissie and he death in he song -- and jim pink have compose a good many -- the minstrel instinctively avoid humor he always improvise they to the sobbing of a guitar and they be as invariably sad as the poetry of adolescent it be call tump pack 's lament the negro of hooker 's bend learn it from jim pink and with they it drift up and down the three great american river and now it be sing by the roustabout stevedore and underling of we strange black american world this song commemorate tump pack 's bravery and faithfulness to he love may very well take the place of the congressional medal which unfortunately be lose on the night the soldier be kill between the two there be little doubt that the accolade of fame bestow in the buffoon 's simple melody be more vital and enduring than that accord by special act of the congress of the united state of america when cissie dildine return from jail she and she mother arrange the dildine-siner wedding as nearly accord to white standard in similar circumstance as they could conceive they agree that it should be a simple quiet home wedding however as every soul in niggertown a number of color friend in jonesboro and a contingent from up-river village mean to attend it become necessary to hold the service in the church the officiate minister be not parson ranson after all but a reverend cleotus haidus the preside elder of that circuit of the afro-american methodist church whose duty happen to call he to hooker 's bend that day so notwithstanding cissie 's effort at simplicity the wedding after all be resolve into a affair once in one of she moment of clairvoyance cissie say to peter : we trouble be peter we be try to mix what i have learn in nashville and what you have learn in boston with what we both feel in hooker 's bend i -- i be almost ashamed to say it but i do not really feel sad and plaintive at all peter i feel glad gloriously glad oh my dear dear peter and she fling she arm around peter 's neck and hold he with all she might against she ripening bosom to cissie she theft she jail sentence she pregnancy be nothing more than if she have take a sip of water however with the imitativeness of she race and the histrionic ability of she sex she appear pensive and subdue during the elaborate double-ring ceremony perform by the reverend cleotus haidus nobody in the packed church know how tremendously cissie 's heart be beat except peter who hold she hand the ethical engine that peter have patiently build in harvard almost cease to function in this weird morality of niggertown whether he be do right or do wrong peter could not determine he lose all he mooring at time he feel himself walk accord to the ethnological law which be the harvard way of say walk accord to the will of god but at other time he feel party to some unpardonable obscenity so deeply be he disturb that out of the dregs of he mind float up old bit of the scripture that he be unaware of possess : there be a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof be the way of death and peter wonder if he be not in that way -lrb- illustration : the bridal couple embark for cairo -rrb- the bridal couple embark for cairo on the _ red cloud _ a packet in the dubuque ohio and tennessee river trade peter and cissie be not allow to walk up the main stairway into the passenger ' cabin but be require to pick they way along the boiler-deck through the stench of freight lumber live stock and sleep roustabout then they go through the heat and steam of the engine-room up a small companionway that lead through the toilet on to the rear guard of the main deck and thence back to a little cuddy behind the main saloon call the chambermaid 's cabin the chambermaid 's cabin be fill with the perpetual odor of hot soap - suds soil laundry and the broader smell of steam and the boat 's machinery the little place tremble night and day for the steamer 's engine be just beneath they and immediately behind they thunder the great stern-wheel of the packet a single square window in the end of the chambermaid 's cabin look out on the wheel but at all time except when the wind be blow from just the right quarter this window be deluge with a veritable niagara of water the continual shake of the cabin the creak of the rudder-beam work to and fro the watery thunder of the wheel and the solemn rumble of the engine make conversation impossible until the traveler grow accustomed to the noise still cissie find it pleasant she like to sit and look out into the main saloon with its interminable gilded scroll extend away up the long cabin a suave perspective she like to watch the white passenger dine -- the white napery the bouquet the endless table all fill with diner some swathe in napkin from chin to waistband other less completely protect it give cissie a certain tang of triumph to smile at the swathe one and to think that she know better than that at night a negro string-band play for the white excursionist to dance and cissie would sit with glowing eye clench peter 's hand every fiber of she asway to the music and it seem as if she heart would go mad all these inhibition all this spreading before she of forbid joy do not daunt she delight she revel in they by propinquity the chambermaid be a mrs antolium higgman a strong full-bodied _ café-au-lait _ negress she be a very sensible woman and during she work on the boat she have pick up a northern accent and a number of little mannerism from the chicago and st loui excursionist who make ten-day round trip from dubuque to florence alabama and return when mr higgman be not run errand for the woman passenger she be work at she perpetual laundering at first peter be a little uneasy as to how mrs higgman would treat cissie but she turn out a good-hearted woman and do everything she could to make the young wife comfortable it soon become clear that mr higgman know the whole situation for one day she say to cissie in she odd dialect burr with yankeeish r 's and ing 's these river-r town mr siner-r be jest like one big village with the river-r for its main street i know ever-r ` thang that go on through the cabin-boy a ' cook a ' -- a ' -- you cerrtainly ar-re a dear - r mr siner-r and thereupon quite unexpectedly she kiss cissie so on about the second day down the river cissie drop she saddened manner and become frankly freely and riotously happy after the fashion of village negress she insist on help mr higgman with she work and incidentally she cultivate mr higgman 's northern accent when the chambermaid be out on she errand and cissie find a moment alone with peter she would tweak he ear or pull he cheek and provoke he to kiss she indeed it be all the hot shudder little laundry-room could do to contain the gay and bubble cissie peter think and think resignedly now but persistently how this strange happiness that belong to they both could be he be content yet he feel he ought not to be content he think there must be something base in himself yet he feel that there be not he drink the wine of he honeymoon marvel on the morning before the _ red cloud _ enter the port of cairo mr higgman be out of the cabin and peter stand at the little square window with he arm about cissie 's waist look out to the rear of the steamer a strong east wind blow the spray away from the glass and peter could see the huge wheel cover with a waterfall thunder beneath he back of the wheel stretch a long row of even wave and trough every seventh or eighth wave tumble over on itself in a swash of foam these flash stern wave string far up the river on each side of the great waterway stretch the flat shore of kentucky and ohio here and there over the broad clay-colored water move other boat -- tow-boat a string of government auto-barge a snag-boat another packet peter give up he question the curve of cissie 's form in he arm hold a sweetness and a restfulness that she maidenhood have never promise he feel so deeply sure of he happiness that it seem strange to he that he could not aline he emotion and he mind as peter stand stare up the ohio river it occur to he that perhaps in some queer way the moral of black folk be not the moral of white folk perhaps the law that bind one race be not the law that bind the other it might be that white anathema be black blessing peter think along this line peacefully for several minute and finally he conclude that after all moral and convention right and wrong be merely those precept that a race have practice and find good in its evolution moral be the training rule that keep a people fit it might very well be that one moral régime be applicable to one race and quite another to another the single object of all moral be racial welfare the racial integrity the breeding of strong child to perpetuate the species if the black race possess a more exuberant vitality than some other race then the black would not be force to practice so severe a vital economy as some less virile folk racial moral be simply a question of have and spend within safety limit peter know that for year white man have hold a prejudice against marry widow this be utterly without grounds except for one reason : the first bear of a woman be the lustiest among the still weaker aryan of indium the widow burn themselves among certain south sea islander only the first-born may live and mate all other child be slay among nearly every white race marriage line be strictly draw and the tendency be to have few child to a family to conserve the precious vital impulse so strong be this feeling of birth control that to-day nearly all american white woman be ashamed of large family this shame be the beginning of a convention the convention may harden into a cult a law or a religion and here be the amazing part of moral moral be always direct toward one particular race but the individual member of that race always feel that they brand of moral do and should apply to all the people of the earth so one have the spectacle of nation send out missionary and battle-ship to teach and enforce they particular folk-way another queer thing be that whereas the end of moral be design solely for the betterment of the race and be entirely regardless of the person to the conscience of the person moral be always translate as something that bind he personally that will shame he or honor he personally not only for the brief span of this worldly life but through a eternity to come to he he particular code surround by all the sanction of custom law and religion appear earth-embracing hell-deep and heaven-piercing and any human creature who follow any other code appear fatally wicked utterly shameless and ineluctably lose and yet there be no such thing as absolute moral moral be as transitory as the sheen on a blackbird 's wing they change perpetually with the necessity of the race any people with a abound vitality will naturally practice custom which a less vital people must shun moral be nothing more than the engine control the stream of energy that propel a race on its course all engine be not alike nor be all race bind for the same port here peter siner make the amazing discovery that although he have spend four year in harvard he have come out just as he go in a negro a great joy come over he he take cissie whole-heartedly in he arm and kiss again and again the deep crimson of she lip he brain and he heart be together at last as he stand look out at the window press cissie to he he wonder when he reach chicago if he could ever make farquhar understand end of the project gutenberg ebook of birthright by t strible
