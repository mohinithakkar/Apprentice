talk and sing and do not play at anything now with my little gun i crawl all in the dark along the wall and follow round the forest track away behind the sofa back there in the night where none can spy all in my hunter 's camp i lie and play at book that i have read till it be time to go to bed these be the hill these be the wood these be my starry solitude and there the river by whose brink the roar lion come to drink i see the other far away as if in firelit camp they lay and i like to a indian scout around they party prowl about so when my nurse come in for I home i return across the sea and go to bed with backward look at my dear land of story-book the wind i saw you toss the kite on high and blow the bird about the sky and all around i hear you pass like lady ' skirt across the grass -- o wind a-blowing all day long o wind that sing so loud a song i see the different thing you do but always you yourself you hide i feel you push i hear you call i could not see yourself at all -- o wind a-blowing all day long o wind that sing so loud a song o you that be so strong and cold o blower be you young or old be you a beast of field and tree or just a stronger child than I o wind a-blowing all day long o wind that sing so loud a song winter-time late lie the wintry sun a-bed a frosty fiery sleepy-head blink but a hour or two and then a blood-red orange set again before the star have leave the sky at morning in the dark i rise and shiver in my nakedness by the cold candle bathe and dress close by the jolly fire i sit to warm my frozen bone a bit or with a reindeer-sled explore the colder country round the door when to go out my nurse doth wrap I in my comforter and cap the cold wind burn my face and blow its frosty pepper up my nose black be my step on silver sod thick blow my frosty breath abroad and tree and house and hill and lake be frost like a wedding-cake pirate story three of we afloat in the meadow by the swing three of we aboard in the basket on the lea wind be in the air they be blow in the spring and wave be on the meadow like the wave there be at sea where shall we adventure to-day that we be afloat wary of the weather and steering by a star shall it be to africa a-steering of the boat to providence or babylon or off to malabar hi but here be a squadron a-rowing on the sea -- cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar quick and we 'll escape they they be as mad as they can be the wicket be the harbor and the garden be the shore \* \* \* \* \* poem by jame whitcomb riley little orphant annie little orphant annie 's come to we house

the blue baboon who play the flute and the orient calf from the land of tute and the attery squash and the bisky bat -- all come and build on the lovely hat of the quangle wangle quee and the quangle wangle say to himself on the crumpetty tree when all these creature move what a wonderful noise there 'll be and at night by the light of the mulberry moon they dance to the flute of the blue baboon on the broad green leaf of the crumpetty tree and all be as happy as happy could be with the quangle wangle quee the pobble who have no toe the pobble who have no toe have once as many as we when they say some day you may lose they all he reply fish fiddle de-dee and he aunt jobiska make he drink lavender water tinge with pink for she say the world in general know there be nothing so good for a pobble 's toe the pobble who have no toe swim across the bristol channel but before he set out he wrap he nose in a piece of scarlet flannel for he aunt jobiska say no harm can come to he toe if he nose be warm and it be perfectly know that a pobble 's toe be safe -- provide he mind he nose the pobble swam fast and well and when boat or ship come near he he tinkledy-binkledy-winkle a bell so that all the world could hear he and all the sailor and admiral cry when they see he near the farther side he have go to fish for he aunt jobiska 's runcible cat with crimson whisker but before he touch the shore -- the shore of the bristol channel a sea-green porpoise carry away he wrapper of scarlet flannel and when he come to observe he foot formerly garnish with toe so neat he face at once become forlorn on perceive that all he toe be go and nobody ever know from that dark day to the present whoso have take the pobble 's toe in a manner so far from pleasant whether the shrimp or

round and round and every one cry you 'll all be drown they call aloud we sieve be not big but we do not care a button we do not care a fig : in a sieve we 'll go to sea far and few far and few be the land where the jumbly live they head be green and they hand be blue and they go to sea in a sieve they sail away in a sieve they do in a sieve they sail so fast with only a beautiful pea-green veil tie with a ribbon by way of a sail to a small tobacco-pipe mast and every one say who see they go oh will not they soon be upset you know for the sky be dark and the voyage be long and happen what may it be extremely wrong in a sieve to sail so fast far and few far and few be the land where the jumbly live they head be green and they hand be blue and they go to sea in a sieve the water it soon come in it do the water it soon come in so to keep they dry they wrap they foot in a pinky paper all fold neat and they fasten it down with a pin and they pass the night in a crockery-jar and each of they say how wise we be though the sky be dark and the voyage be long yet we never can think we be rash or wrong while round in we sieve we spin far and few far and few be the land where the jumbly live they head be green and they hand be blue and they go to sea in a sieve and all night long they sail away and when the sun go down they whistle and warble a moony song to the echo sound of a coppery gong in the shade of the mountain brown o timballoo how happy we be when we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar and all night long in the moonlight pale we sail away with a pea-green sail in the shade of the mountain brown far and few far and few be the land where the jumbly live they head be green and they hand be blue and they go to sea in a sieve they sail to the western sea they do -- to a land all cover with tree : and they buy a owl and a useful cart and a pound of rice and a cranberry-tart and a hive of silvery bee and they buy a pig and some green jackdaw and a lovely monkey with lollipop paw and forty bottle of ring-bo-ree and no end of stilton cheese far and few far and few be the land where the jumbly live they head be green and they hand be blue and they go to sea in a sieve and in twenty year they all come back -- in twenty year or more and every one say how tall they have grow for they have be to the lake and the torrible zone and the hill of the chankly bear and they drink they health and give they a feast of dumpling make of beautiful yeast and every one say if we only live we too will go to sea in a sieve to the hill of the chankly bear far and few far and few be the land where the jumbly live they head be green and they hand be blue and they go to sea in a sieve \* \* \* \* \* poem by henry w longfellow the emperor 's bird 's - nest once the emperor charle of spain with he swarthy grave commander i forget in what campaign long besiege in mud and rain some old frontier town of flander up and down the dreary camp in great boot of spanish leather stride with a measure tramp these hidalgo dull and damp curse the frenchman curse the weather thus as to and fro they go over upland and through hollow give they impatience vent perch upon the emperor 's tent in she nest they spy a swallow yes it be a swallow 's nest build of clay and hair of horse mane or tail or dragoon 's crest find on hedge-row east and west after skirmish of the force then a old hidalgo say as he twirl he gray mustachio sure this swallow overhead think the emperor 's tent a shed and the emperor but a macho hearing he imperial name couple with those word of malice half in anger half in shame forth the great campaigner come slowly from he canvas palace let no hand the bird molest say he solemnly nor hurt she add then by way of jest golondrina be my guest ` tis the wife of some deserter swift as bowstring speed a shaft through the camp be spread the rumor and the soldier as they quaff flemish beer at dinner laugh at the emperor 's pleasant humor so unharmed and unafraid sit the swallow still and brood till the constant cannonade through the wall a breach have make and the siege be thus conclude then the army elsewhere bent strike its tent as if disband only not the emperor 's tent for he order ere he go very curtly leave it stand so it stand there all alone loosely flap tear and tattered till the brood be fledge and fly singing o'er those wall of stone which the cannon-shot have shatter the rainy day the day be cold and dark and dreary it rain and the wind be never weary the vine still cling to the moulder wall but at every gust the dead leave fall and the day be dark and dreary my life be cold and dark and dreary it rain and the wind be never weary my thought still cling to the moulder past but the hope of youth fall thick in the blast and the day be dark and dreary be still sad heart and cease repining behind the cloud be the sun still shine thy fate be the common fate of all into each life some rain must fall some day must be dark and dreary a April day when the warm sun that bring seed-time and harvest have return again ` tis sweet to visit the still wood where spring the first flower of the plain i love the season well when forest glade be teem with bright form nor dark and many-folded cloud foretell the coming-on of storm from the earth 's loosen mould the sapling draw its sustenance and thrive though stricken to the heart with winter 's cold the droop tree revive the softly-warbled song come from the pleasant wood and color wing glance quick in the bright sun that move along the forest opening when the bright sunset fill the silver wood with light the green slope throw its shadow in the hollow of the hill and wide the upland glow and when the eve be bear in the blue lake the sky o'er-reaching far be hollow out and the moon dip she horn and twinkle many a star invert in the tide stand the gray rock and tremble shadow throw and the fair tree look over side by side and see themselves below sweet April -- many a thought be wed unto thee as heart be wed nor shall they fail till to its autumn bring life 's golden fruit be shed rain in summer how beautiful be the rain after the dust and heat in the broad and fiery street in the narrow lane how beautiful be the rain how it clatter along the roof like the tramp of hoof how it gush and struggle out from the throat of the overflow spout across the window pane it pour and pour and swift and wide with a muddy tide like a river down the gutter roar the rain the welcome rain \* \* \* \* in the country on every side where far and wide like a leopard 's tawny and spot hide stretch the plain to the dry grass and the drier grain how welcome be the rain \* \* \* \* daybreak a wind come up out of the sea and say o mist make room for I it hail the ship and cry sail on ye mariner the night be go and hurry landward far away cry awake it be the day it say unto the forest shout hang all you leafy banner out it touch the wood-bird 's fold wing and say o bird awake and sing and o'er the farm o chanticleer you clarion blow the day be near it whisper to the field of corn bow down and hail the come morn it shout through the belfry tower awake o bell proclaim the hour it cross the churchyard with a sigh and say not yet in quiet lie afternoon in February the day be end the night be descend the marsh be freeze the river dead through cloud like ash the red sun flash on village window that glimmer red the snow recommence the bury fence mark no longer the road o'er the plain while through the meadow like fearful shadow slowly pass a funeral train the bell be peal and every feeling within I respond to the dismal knell shadow be trail my heart be bewail and toll within like a funeral bell hiawatha 's fishing forth upon the gitche gumee on the shine big-sea-water with he fishing-line of cedar of the twisted bark of cedar forth to catch the sturgeon nahma mishe-nahma king of fish in he birch canoe exult all alone go hiawatha through the clear transparent water he could see the fish swim far down in the depths below he see the yellow perch the sahwa like a sunbeam in the water see the shawgashee the craw-fish like a spider on the bottom on the white and sandy bottom at the stern sit hiawatha with he fishing-line of cedar in he plume the breeze of morning play as in the hemlock branch on the bow with tail erect sit the squirrel adjidaumo in he fur the breeze of morning play as in the prairie grass on the white sand of the bottom lay the monster mishe-nahma lay the sturgeon king of fish through he gill he breathe the water with he fin he fan and winnow with he tail he sweep the sand-floor there he lay in all he armor on each side a shield to guard he plate of bone upon he forehead down he side and back and shoulder plate of bone with spine project paint be he with he war-paint stripe of yellow red and azure spot of brown and spot of sable and he lay there on the bottom fan with he fin of purple as above he hiawatha in he birch canoe come sailing with he fishing-line of cedar take my bait cry hiawatha down into the depths beneath he take my bait o sturgeon nahma come up from below the water let we see which be the stronger and he drop he line of cedar through the clear transparent water wait vainly for a answer long sit wait for a answer and repeat loud and louder take my bait o king of fish quiet lay the sturgeon nahma fan slowly in the water look up at hiawatha listen to he call and clamor he unnecessary tumult till he weary of the shouting and he say to the kenozha to the pike the maskenozha take the bait of this rude fellow break the line of hiawatha in he finger hiawatha feel the loose line jerk and tighten as he draw it in it tug so that the birch canoe stand endwise like a birch log in the water with the squirrel adjidaumo perch and frisk on the summit full of scorn be hiawatha when he see the fish rise upward see the pike the maskenozha come nearer nearer to he and he shout through the water esa esa shame upon you you be but the pike kenozha you be not the fish i want you be not the king of fish reel downward to the bottom sink the pike in great confusion and the mighty sturgeon nahma say to ugudwash the sun-fish to the bream with scale of crimson take the bait of this great boaster break the line of hiawatha slowly upward waver gleaming rise the ugudwash the sun-fish seize the line of hiawatha swing with all he weight upon it make a whirlpool in the water whirl the birch canoe in circle round and round in gurgle eddy till the circle in the water reach the far-off sandy beach till the water-flag and rush nod on the distant margin but when hiawatha see he slowly rise through the water lift up he disk refulgent loud he shout in derision esa esa shame upon you you be ugudwash the sun-fish you be not the fish i want you be not the king of fish slowly downward waver gleaming sink the ugudwash the sun-fish and again the sturgeon nahma hear the shout of hiawatha hear he challenge of defiance the unnecessary tumult ring far across the water from the white sand of the bottom up he rise with angry gesture quiver in each nerve and fiber clash all he plate of armor gleaming bright with all he war-paint in he wrath he dart upward flash leap into the sunshine open he great jaw and swallow both canoe and hiawatha down into that darksome cavern plunge the headlong hiawatha as a log on some black river shoot and plunge down the rapid find himself in utter darkness grope about in helpless wonder till he feel a great heart beat throbbing in that utter darkness and he smite it in he anger with he fist the heart of nahma feel the mighty king of fish shudder through each nerve and fiber hear the water gurgle round he as he leap and stagger through it sick at heart and faint and weary crosswise then do hiawatha drag he birch-canoe for safety lest from out the jaw of nahma in the turmoil and confusion forth he might be hurl and perish and the squirrel adjidaumo frisk and chatter very gayly toil and tug with hiawatha till the labor be complete then say hiawatha to he o my little friend the squirrel bravely have you toil to help I take the thanks of hiawatha and the name which now he give you for hereafter and forever boy shall call you adjidaumo tail-in-air the boy shall call you and again the sturgeon nahma gasp and quiver in the water then be still and drift landward till he grate on the pebble till the listen hiawatha hear he grate upon the margin feel he strand upon the pebble know that nahma king of fish lay there dead upon the margin then he hear a clang and flap as of many wing assemble hear a scream and confusion as of bird of prey contend see a gleam of light above he shine through the rib of nahma see the glittering eye of sea-gull of kayoshk the sea-gull peer gaze at he through the opening hear they say to each other ` tis we brother hiawatha and he shout from below they cry exult from the cavern : o

be to sail upborne by a strong free wing through the rosy morn to meet the young sun face to face and pierce like a shaft the boundless space to pass through the bower of the silver cloud to sing in the thunder hall aloud to spread out the wing for a wild free flight with the upper cloud-wing -- oh what delight oh what would i give like a bird to go right on through the arch of the sun-lit bow and see how the water-drop be kiss into green and yellow and amethyst how pleasant the life of a bird must be wherever it listeth there to flee to go when a joyful fancy call dash down ` mong the waterfall then wheeling about with its mate at play above and below and among the spray hither and thither with scream as wild as the laughing mirth of a rosy child what joy it must be like a living breeze to flutter about ` mid the flowering tree lightly to soar and to see beneath the waste of the blossom purple heath and the yellow furze like field of gold that gladden some fairy region old on the mountain top on the billowy sea on the leafy stem of a forest tree how pleasant the life of a bird must be the spider and the fly will you walk into my parlor say a spider to a fly ` tis the

thrice and murmur with delight then come the gallant captain and stand upon the deck in velvet coat and ruffle white without a spot or speck and diamond ring and triple string of pearl around he neck and four-and-twenty sailor be round he bow low on every jacket three time three gold button in a row and cutlass down to they knee they make a goodly show and then the ship go sailing a-sailing o'er the sea she dive beyond the setting sun but never back come she for she find the land of the golden sand where the pearl and diamond be jack frost the door be shut as door should be before you go to

and field and knight in armor ride by with nod plume and shine shield and here be little boat and there big ship with sail spread to the breeze and yonder palm tree wave fair on island set in silver

out jack frost take every breath you breathe and know the thing you think about he paint they on the window-pane in fairy line with frozen steam and when you wake you see again the lovely thing you see in dream the world 's music the world 's a very happy place where every child should dance and sing and always have a smile face and never sulk for anything i waken when the morning 's come and

mill-wheel make music go round and round and dusty-white with flour and meal the miller whistle to its sound and if you listen to the rain where leave and bird and bee be dumb you hear it pattering on the pane like andrew beating on he drum the coal beneath the kettle croon and clap they hand and dance in glee and even the kettle hum a tune to tell you when it be time for tea the world be such a

have part with stem and blade but under the ground i be safe and sound with the snow 's thick blanket over I lay i be all alive and ready to shoot should the spring of the year come dancing here -- but i pity the flower without branch or root you think i be dead a soft voice say because not a branch or root i own i never have die but close i hide in a plumy seed that the wind have sow patient i
