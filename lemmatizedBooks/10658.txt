she often do it passionately and thoroughly that afternoon as she emerge from the kitchen she dark defiant face be full of grim satisfaction in the fact that she have leave a kitchen polish and irreproachable a kitchen without the slightest indication that it ever have be or ever would be use for prepare human nature 's daily food a show kitchen even the apron which she have wear be hang in concealment behind the scullery door the lobby clock which stand over six foot high and have to be wind up every night by haul on a rope be noisily get ready to strike two but for mr lessway ' disorderly and undesired assistance hilda 's task might have be finish a quarter of a hour earlier she pass quietly up the stair when she be near the top she mother 's voice at once querulous and amiable come from the sitting-room : where be you go to there be a pause dramatic for both of they and in that minute pause the very life of the house seem for a instant to be suspend and then the wave of the hostile love that unite these two woman resume they beating and hilda 's lip harden upstairs she answer callously no reply from the sitting-room at two o'clock on the last Wednesday of every month old mr skellorn employ by mr lessway to collect she cottage-rent call with a statement of account and cash in a linen bag he be now due during he previous visit hilda have seek to instil some common sense into she mother on the subject of repair and there have ensue a altercation which have never be settle if i stay down she would not like it hilda complain fiercely within herself and if i keep away she do not like that either that be mother all over she go to she bedroom and into the soft controlled shut of the door she put more exasperated vehemence than would have suffice to bang it off its hinge ii at this date late October in 1878 hilda be within a few week of twenty-one she be a woman but she could not realize that she be a woman she remember that when she first go to school at the age of eight a assistant teacher aged nineteen have seem to she to be unquestionably and absolutely a woman have seem to belong definitely to a previous generation the year have pass and hilda be now older than that mature woman be then and yet she could not feel adult though she childhood gleam dimly afar off and though the intervene expanse of ten year stretch out like a hundred year like eternity she be in trouble the trouble grow daily more and more tragic and the trouble be that she want she know not what if she mother have say to she squarely tell I what it be will make you a bit more contented and you shall have it even if it kill I hilda could only have answer with the fervor of despair i do not know i do not know she mother be a creature contented enough and why not -- with a sufficient income a comfortable home and fair health at the end of a day devoted partly to sheer vacuous idleness and partly to the monotonous simple machinery of physical existence -- everlasting cookery everlasting cleanliness everlasting stitchery -- she mother do not with a yearning sigh demand must this sort of thing continue for ever or will a new era dawn not a bit mrs lessway go to bed in the placid expectancy of a very similar day on the morrow and of a interminable succession of such day the which be incomprehensible and offensive to hilda she be in a prison with she mother and see no method of escape see not so much as a lock door see nothing but blank wall even could she by a miracle break prison where should she look for the unknown object of she desire and for what should she look enigma it be true that she read occasionally with feverish enjoyment especially verse but she do not and could not read enough of the shelf-ful of book which in thirty year have drift by one accident or another into the lessway household she have read every volume except cruden 's concordance a heterogeneous and forlorn assemblage lavater 's _ physiognomy _ in a translation and in full calf thomson 's _ season _ which have thrill she by its romantic beauty mr henry wood 's _ danesbury house _ and one or two novel by charlotte m yonge and dinah marium craik which she have gulp eagerly down for the mere interest of they story disraelus 's _ ixion _ which she have admire without understand it a _ history of the north american indian _ these be the more exciting item of the set the most exciting of all be a green volume of tennyson 's contain _ maud _ she know _ maud _ by heart by simple unpleasant obstinacy she have force she mother to give she this volume for a birthday present have see a quotation from it in a lady ' magazine at that date in turnhill as in many other town of england the poem have not yet live down a reputation for immorality but fortunately mr lessway have only the vaguest notion of its dangerousness and be indeed a negligent kind of woman dangerous the book be once in recite it aloud in she room hilda have come so near to faint that she have have to stop and lie down on the bed until she could convince herself that she be not the male lover cry to he beloved a astounding and fearful experience and not to be too lightly renew for hilda _ maud _ be a source of lovely and exquisite pain why have she not use she force of character to obtain more book one reason lay in the excessive difficulty to be face birthday be infrequent and besides the enterprise of purchase _ maud _ have prove so complicated and tedious that mr lessway with that curious stiffness which mark she sometimes have swear never to attempt to buy another book turnhill a town of fifteen thousand person have no bookseller the only bookseller that mr lessway have ever hear of do business at oldcastle mr lessway have journey twice over the hillport ridge to oldcastle in the odd quest of a book call _ maud _ by tennyson -- the poet laureate the book have have to be send from london and on she second excursion to oldcastle mr lessway have be catch by the rain in the middle of hillport marsh no hilda could not easily demand the gift of another book when all sort of nice really useful present could be buy in the high street nor be there in turnhill a municipal library nor any public lending-library yet possibly hilda 's terrific egoism might have get fresh book somehow from somewhere have she really believe in the virtue of book thus far however book have not furnish she with what she want and she faith in they promise be insecure book fail might she not have escape into some vocation the sole vocation conceivable for she be that of teaching and she know without have try it that she abhor teaching further there be no economical reason why she should work in 1878 unless push by necessity no girl might dream of a vocation : the idea be monstrous it be almost unmentionable still further she have no wish to work for work 's sake marriage remain but she feel herself a child age short of marriage and she never meet a man it be literally a fact that except mr skellorn a few tradesman the vicar the curate and a sidesman or so she never even speak to a man from one month 's end to the next the church choir have its annual dance to which she be invite but the perverse creature care not for dance she mother do not seek society do not appear to require it nor do hilda acutely feel the lack of it she could not define she need all she know be that youth moment by moment be drop down inexorably behind she and still a child in heart and soul she see herself ageing and then aged and then wither she twenty-first birthday be well above the horizon soon soon she would be ` over twenty-one ' and she be not yet bear that be it she be not yet bear if the passionate strength of desire could have do the miracle time would have stand still in the heaven while hilda seek the way of life and withal she be not wholly unhappy just as she attitude to she mother be self-contradictory so be she attitude towards existence sometimes this profound infelicity of hers change its hue for a instant and lo it be bliss that she be bath in a phenomenon which disconcert she she do not know that she have the most precious of all faculty the power to feel intensely iii mr skellorn do not come he be most definitely late from the window of she bedroom at the front of the house hilda look westwards up toward the slope of chatterley wood where as a child she use to go with other child to pick the sparse bluebell that thrive on smoke the bailiwick of turnhill lay behind she and all the murky district of the five town of which turnhill be the northern outpost lay to the south at the foot of chatterley wood the canal wound in large curve on its way towards the undefiled plain of cheshire and the sea on the canal-side exactly opposite to hilda 's window be a flour-mill that sometimes make nearly as much smoke as the kiln and chimney close the prospect on either hand from the flour-mill a brick path which separate a considerable row of new cottage from they appurtenant garden lead straight into lessway street in front of mr lessway ' house by this path mr skellorn should have arrive for he inhabit the farthest of the cottage hilda hold mr skellorn in disdain as she hold the row of cottage in disdain it seem to she that mr skellorn and the cottage mysteriously resemble each other in they primness they smugness they detestable self-complacency yet those cottage perhaps thirty in all have stand for a great deal until hilda glancing at they shatter they with she scorn the row be call freehold villa : a consciously proud name in a district where much of the land be copyhold and could only change owner subject to the payment of ` fine ' and to the feudal consent of a ` court ' preside over by the agent of a lord of the manor most of the dwelling be own by they occupier who each a absolute monarch of the soil niggle in he sooty garden of a evening amid the flutter of dry shirt and towel freehold villa symbolize the final triumph of victorian economics the apotheosis of the prudent and industrious artisan it correspond with a building society secretary 's dream of paradise and indeed it be a very real achievement nevertheless hilda 's irrational contempt would not admit this she see in freehold villa nothing but narrowness -lrb- what long narrow strip of garden and what narrow home all flatten together -rrb- and uniformity and brickiness and polished brassiness and righteousness and a eternal laundry from the upper floor of she own home she gaze destructively down upon all that and into the chill crimson eye of the descend sun she own home be not ideal but it be better than all that it be one of the two middle house of a detach terrace of four house build by she grandfather lessway the teapot manufacturer it be the chief of the four obviously the habitation of the proprietor of the terrace one of the corner house comprise a grocer 's shop and this house have be rob of its just proportion of garden so that the seigneurial garden-plot might be triflingly larger than the other the terrace be not a terrace of cottage but of house rate at from twenty-six to thirty-six pound a year beyond the means of artisan and petty insurance agent and rent-collector and further it be well build generously build and its architecture though debased show some faint trace of georgian amenity it be admittedly the best row of house in that newly settle quarter of the town in come to it out of freehold villa mr skellorn obviously come to something superior wider more liberal suddenly hilda hear she mother 's voice in a rather startle conversational tone and then another woman speak then the voice die away mrs lessway have evidently open the back door to somebody and take she at once into the sitting-room the occurrence be unusual hilda go softly out on to the landing and listen but she could catch nothing more than a faint irregular murmur scarcely have she station herself on the landing when she mother burst out of the sitting-room and call loudly : hilda and again in a instant very impatiently and excitedly long before hilda could possibly have appear in response have she be in she bedroom as she mother suppose she to be : hilda hilda could see without be see mr lessway ' thin wrinkled face border by she untidy but still black and glossy hair be upturn from below in a expression of tragic fretfulness it be the uncontrolled face shamelessly expressive of one who think himself unwatched hilda move silently to descend and then demand in a low tone whose harsh self-possession be a reproof to that volatile creature she mother : what be the matter mr lessway give a surprised oh and like a flash she feature change in the attempt to appear calm and collect i be just come downstairs say hilda and to herself : she be always try to pretend i be nobody but when the least thing happen out of the way she run to I for all the world like a child and as mr lessway offer no reply but simply stand at the foot of the stair she ask again : what be it well say she mother lamentably it be mr skellorn here 's mr grant -- who be mr grant hilda inquire with a touch of scorn although she know perfectly well that mr skellorn have a married daughter of that name hsh hsh mr lessway protest indicate the open door of the sitting-room you know mr grant it seem mr skellorn have have a paralytic stroke be not it terrible hilda continue smoothly to descend the stair and follow she mother into the sitting-room chapter ii the end of the scene i the linen money-bag and the account-book proper to the last Wednesday in the month lay on the green damask cloth of the round table where hilda and she mother take they meal a paralytic stroke have not be drastic enough to mar mr skellorn 's most precious reputation for probity and reliability he statement of receipt and expenditure together with the corresponding cash have be due at two o'clock and despite the paralytic stroke it be less than a quarter of a hour late on one side of the bag and the book be range the older woman -- mr lessway thin and vivacious and mrs grant large and solemn and on the other side as it be in opposition the young dark slim girl with she rather wiry black hair and she straight prominent eyebrow and she extraordinary expression of uncompromising aloofness she be just enjoy it that be what she be do say hilda to herself of mr grant and the fact be that mr grant quite unconsciously do appear to be savor the catastrophe with pleasure although paralytic stroke be more prevalent at that period than now they constitute even then a striking dramatic event moreover they be consider as direct visitation of god also there be something mysteriously and agreeably impressive in the word ` paralytic ' which people would repeat for the pleasure of repeat it mr grant over whose mighty breast flow a black mantle suit to the occasion use the word again and again as she narrate afresh for hilda the history of the stroke yes she say they come and fetch I out of my bed at three o'clock this morning and would you believe I though he could not hardly speak the money and this here book be all wait in he desk and he would have I come with it and he sixty-seven he always be like that and i do believe if he would be paralyse on both side instead of only all down he right side and speechless too he would ha ' make I understand as i must come here at two o'clock if i be a bit late it be because i be keep at home with my son enoch he be get a whitlow that be worry the life out of he we enoch have mr lessway warmly deprecate any apology for inexactitude and wipe she sympathetic eye it be all over with father mr grant resume doctor hint to I quiet-like as he would never leave he bed again he be lay himself down for the rest of he day and he would be warn he would have warning but there mr grant contemplate with solemn gleeful satisfaction the overwhelming grandeur of the disaster that have happen to she father the active old man a continual figure of the street have be cut off in a moment from the world and condemn for life to a mattress she sincerely imagine herself to be fill with proper grief but a aesthetic appreciation of the theatrical effectiveness of the misfortune be certainly stronger in she than any other feeling observe that mr lessway weep she also draw out a handkerchief i be wishful for you to count the money say mr grant i would not like there to be any -- nay that i 'll not protest mr lessway mr grant 's press duty necessitate she immediate departure mr lessway ceremoniously insist on she leaving by the front door i do not know where you 'll find another rent-collector that be worth he salt -- in this town observe mr grant on the doorstep i can not think _ what _ you 'll do mr lessway i shall collect my rent myself be the answer when mr grant have cross the road and take the brick path lead to the paralytic 's house mr lessway slowly shut the door and bolt it and then say to hilda : well my girl i do think you might have try to show just a little more feeling they be close together in the narrow lobby of which the heavy pulse be the clock 's tick hilda reply : you surely be not serious about collect those rent yourself be you mother serious of course i be serious say mr lessway ii why should not i collect the rent myself ask mrs lessway this half-defiant question be put about two hour later in the meantime no remark have be make about the rent mother and daughter be now at tea in the sitting-room hilda have pass the greater part of those two hour upstairs in she bedroom ponder on she mother 's preposterous notion of collect the rent herself alone she would invent conversation with she mother silencing the foolish woman with unanswerable sarcastic phrase that utterly destroy she illogical argument she would repeat these phrase repeat even entire conversation with pleasure and dwelling also with pleasure upon she grievance against she mother would gradually arrive at a state of dull-glowing resentment she could if she choose easily free she brain from the obsession either by read or by a sharp jerk of volition but often she prefer not to do so say to herself voluptuously : no i _ will _ nurse my grievance i 'll nurse it and nurse it and nurse it it be mine and it be just and anybody with any sense at all would admit instantly that i be absolutely right thus it be on this afternoon when she come to tea she face be formidably expressive nor would she attempt to modify the rancor of those uncompromising feature on the contrary as soon as she see that she mother have notice she condition she deliberately intensify it mr lessway who be incapable of sustained thought and who have completely forget and recall the subject of the cottage-rent several time since the departure of mr grant nevertheless at once diagnose the cause of the trouble and with she usual precipitancy begin to repulse a attack which have not even be open mr lessway be not good at strategy especially in conflict with she daughter she be a ingenuous hasty thing and much too candidly human and not only be she deficient in practical common sense and most absurdly unable to learn from experience but she have not even the wit to cover she shortcoming by resort to the traditional authoritativeness of the mother she brief rare effort to play the mother be ludicrous she be too simply honest to acquire stature by stand on she maternal dignity by a profound instinct she wistfully treat everybody as a equal as a fellow-creature even she own daughter it be not the way to come with credit out of the threaten altercation about rent-collecting as hilda offer no reply mr lessway say reproachfully : hilda you be too bad sometimes and then after a further silence : anyhow i be quite decide then what be the good of talk about it say the merciless child but _ why _ should not i collect the rent myself i be not ask you to collect they and i shall save the five per cent and goodness know we need it you be more likely to lose twenty-five per cent say hilda i 'll have some more tea please mr lessway be quite genuinely scandalize you need not think i shall be easy with those calder street tenant because i sha not not I i be more likely to be too hard you 'll be too hard and you 'll be too easy too say hilda savagely you 'll lose the good tenant and you 'll keep the bad one and the house will all go to rack and ruin and then you 'll sell all the property at a loss that be how it will be and what shall you do if you be not feel well and if it rain on Monday morning hilda could conceive she mother forget all about the rent on Monday morning or put they off till Monday afternoon on some grotesque excuse she fancy hear the interminable complaining devising futile resolving of the self-appointed collector it be impossible to imagine a woman less fit by nature than she mother to collect rent from unthrifty artisan such as inhabit calder street the project sicken she it would render the domestic existence a inferno as for mr lessway she be shock for she project have seem very beautiful to she and for the moment she be perfectly convince that she could collect rent and manage property as well as anyone she be convince that she habit be regular she temper firm and tactful and she judgment excellent she be more than shocked she be wound she weep as she push forward hilda 's replenish cup you ought to take shame she murmur weakly yet with certitude why say hilda feign simplicity what have i say _ i _ do not begin you ask I i can not help what i think it be you tone say mr lessway grievously iii despite all hilda 's terrible wisdom and sagacity this remark of the foolish mother 's be the truest word speak in the discussion it be hilda 's tone that be at the root of the evil if hilda with the intelligence as to which she be secretly so complacent do not amicably rule she mother the unavoidable inference be that she be either a clumsy or a wicked girl or both she indeed feel dimly that she be a little of both but she do not mind sit there in the small familiar room close to the sewing-machine the steel fender the tarnished chandelier and all the other daily object which she at once detest and love sit close to she silly mother who anger she and yet in whom she recognize a quality that be mysteriously precious and admirable stare through the small window at the brown tattered garden-plot where blacken rhododendron be sway in the October blast she wilfully bath herself in grim gloom and in a affectation of despair somehow she enjoy the experience she have only to tighten she lip -- and she become oblivious of she clumsiness and she cruelty savor with pleasure the pain of the situation clasp it to she now and then a thought of mr skellorn 's tragedy shot through she brain and the tenderness of pity well up from somewhere within she and mingled exquisitely with she dark melancholy and she find delight in read she poor mother like a open book as she suppose and all the while she mother be dream upon the first year of hilda 's life before she have discover that she husband 's health be as unstable as he character and compare the reality of the present with she early illusion but the clever girl be not clever enough to read just that page we ought to be everything to each other say mr lessway pursue she reflection aloud hilda hate sentimentalism she could not stand such talk and you know say hilda speak very frigidly and with even more than she usual incisive clearness of articulation it be not you property it be only yours for life it be my property the mother 's mood change in a moment how do you know you have never see you father 's will she speak in harsh challenge no because you have never let I see it you ought to have more confidence in you mother you father have and i be trustee and executor mr lessway be exceedingly jealous of she legal position whose importance she never forget nor would consent to minimize that be all very well for you say hilda but if the property be not manage right i may find myself slave when i be you age mother and whose fault will it be however i shall -- you will what nothing i suppose she ladyship will be consult she own lawyer next say mr lessway bitterly they look at each other hilda 's face flush to a sombre red mr lessway brusquely leave the room then hilda could hear she rattle fussily at the kitchen range after a few minute hilda follow she to the kitchen which be now nearly in darkness the figure of mr lessway still do nothing whatever with great vigor at the range be dimly visible hilda approach she and awkwardly touch she shoulder mother she demand sharply and she be astonish by she awkwardness and she sharpness be that you she mother ask in a queer foolish tone they kiss such a candid peacemaking have never occur between they before mr lessway as simple in forgiveness as in wrath do not disguise she pleasure in the remarkable fact that it be hilda who have make the overture hilda think : how strange i be what be come over I she glance at the range in which be a pale gleam of red and that gleam in the heavy twilight seem to she to be inexpressibly enchantingly mournful and she herself be mournful about the future -- very mournful she see no hope yet she sadness be beautiful to she and she be proud chapter iii mr cannon i a little later hilda come downstairs dress to go out she mother be light a glimmer of gas in the lobby ere mr lessway could descend from she tiptoe to she heel and turn round hilda say quickly forestall curiosity : i be go to get that thread you want just give I some money will you nobody could have guess from she placid tone and indifferent demeanor that she be in a state of extreme agitation but so it be suddenly after kiss she mother in the kitchen she have form a tremendous resolve and in a moment the resolve have possess she send she fly upstairs and burn she into a fever as with the assure movement of familiarity she put on she bonnet mantle ` fall ' and glove in the darkness of the chamber she hold herself in leash while she mother lift a skirt and find a large loaded pocket within and a purse in the pocket and a sixpence in the purse but when she have shut the door on all that interior haunt by she mother 's restlessness when she be safe in the porch and in the windy obscurity of the street she yield with voluptuous apprehension to a thrill that shake she i might have tidy my hair she think pooh what do my hair matter she mind be full of a adventure through which she have pass seven year previously when she be thirteen and a little girl at school for several day then she have be ruthlessly mortify she mother by complaint about the meal she fastidious appetite could not be suit at last one noon when the child have refuse the whole of a plenteous dinner mr lessway have burst into tear and slapping four penny down on the table have cry here i fairly give you up go out and buy you own dinner then perhaps you 'll get what you want and the child without a instant 's hesitation have seize the coin and go out hatless and buy food at a little tripe-shop that be also a eating-house and consume it there and then in grim silence return home both mother and daughter have be stupefy and frighten by the boldness of the daughter 's initiative by she amazing flaunt disregard of filial decency mr lessway would not have relate the episode to anybody upon any consideration whatever it be a shameful secret never even refer to but mr lessway have unmistakably though indirectly refer to it when in anger she have say to she daughter aged twenty : i suppose she ladyship will be consult she own lawyer next hilda have understand and that be why she have blush and now as she turn from lessway street into the oldcastle road on she way to the center of the town she experience almost exactly the intense excitement of the reckless and supercilious child in quest of its dinner the only difference be that the recent reconciliation have inspire she with a certain negligent compassion for she mother with a curious tenderness that cause she to wonder at herself ii the market square of turnhill be very large for the size of the town the diminutive town hall which in reality be nothing but a watch-house seem to be a mere incident on its irregular expanse to which the two-storey shop and dwelling make a low border behind this crimson blue-slated border rise the loftier form of a church and a large chapel situate in adjacent street the square be calm and almost desert in the gloom it typify the slow tranquillity of the bailiwick which be remove from the central life of the five town and unconnected therewith by even a tram or a omnibus only within recent year have turnhill get so much as a railway station -- rail-head of a branch line turnhill be the extremity of civilization in those part go northwards out of this market square and you would soon find yourself amid the wild and hilly moorland sprinkle with iron-and-coal village whose red-flaming furnace illustrate the eternal damnation which be the chief article of they devout religious belief and in the market square not even the late edition of the _ staffordshire signal _ be cry though it be discreetly on sale with its excellent sport news in a few shop in the hot and malodorous candle-lit factory where the real strenuous life of the town would remain coop up for another half-hour of the evening man and woman have yet scarcely take to horse-racing they would gamble upon rabbit cock pigeon and they own fist without the mediation of the _ signal _ the one noise in the market square be the bell of a hawker selling warm pikelet at a penny each for the high tea of the tradesman the hawker be a deathless institution a living proof that withdraw turnhill would continue always to be exactly what it always have be still to the east of the square across the high street a vast space be be clear of hovel for the erection of a new town hall daringly magnificent hilda cross the square scorn it she say to herself : i would better get the thing over before i buy the thread i should never be able to stand miss dayson 's finicking i should scream out but the next instant with she passion for prove to herself how strong she could be she add : well i just _ will _ buy the thread first and she go straight into dayson 's little fancy shop which be full of counter and cardboard box and miss dayson and stay therein for at least five minute emerge with a miraculously achieve leisureliness a few door away be a somewhat new building of three storey -- the highest in the square the ground floor be a ironmongery it comprise also a side entrance of which the door be always open this side entrance show a brass-plate q karkeek solicitor and the wire-blind of the two window of the first floor also bear the word : q karkeek solicitor q karkeek solicitor the queerness of the name have attract hilda 's attention several year earlier when the sign be fresh it be a accident that she have notice it she have not notice the door-plate or the wire-blind of other solicitor she do not know mr q karkeek by sight nor even whether he be old or young married or single agreeable or repulsive the side entrance give directly on to a long flight of naked stair and up these stair hilda climb into the unknown towards the redoubtable and the perilous i be bind to be see she say to herself but i do not care and i _ do not _ care at the top of the stair be a passage at right angle and then a glazed door with the legend in black letter q karkeek solicitor and two other door mysteriously label private she open the glaze door and see a dirty middle-aged man on a stool and she say at once to he in a harsh clear deliberate voice without give herself time to reflect : i want to see mr karkeek the man stare at she sourly as if bewilder she say to herself : i sha not be able to stand this excitement much longer you can not see mr karkeek say the man mr karkeek 's detain at hanbridge county court but if you be in such a hurry like you would better see mr cannon it be mr cannon as they generally do see who d'ye come from miss come from hilda repeat unnerved what name she have not expect this i suppose i shall have to tell he she say to herself and aloud : lessway oh ah exclaim the man bless we yes it be as if he have say : of course it be lessway and do not i know all about _ you _ and hilda be overwhelm by the sense of the enormity of the folly which she be commit the man swing half round on he stool and seize the end of a india-rubber tube which hang at the side of the batter and litter desk just under a gas-jet he speak low like a conspirator into the mouthpiece of the tube miss lessway -- to see you sir then very quickly he clap the tube to he ear and listen and then he put it to he mouth again and repeat : lessway hilda be agonize i 'll ask ye to step this way miss say the man slip off he stool at the same time he put a long inky penholder which he have be hold in he wrinkled right hand between he tooth never think hilda as she follow the clerk in a whirl of horrible misgiving never have i do anything as mad as this before i be under twenty-one iii there she be at last seat in front of a lawyer in a lawyer 's office -- she ladyship consult she own lawyer it seem incredible a few minute ago she have be at home and now she be in a world unfamiliar and alarming perhaps it be a pity that she mother have unsuspectingly put the scheme into she head however the deed be do hilda generally act first and reflect afterwards she be frightened but rather by the unknown than by anything she could define you have come about the property say mr cannon amiably in a matter-of-fact tone he have deep black eye and black hair like hilda 's good regular tooth and a clear complexion perhaps he nose be rather large but it be straight with he large pale hand he occasionally stroke he long soft moustache the chin be blue he be smartly dress in dark blue he have a beautiful neck-tie and the genuine whiteness of he wristband be remarkable in a district where starched linen be usually either gray or bluish he be not a dandy but he respect he person he evidently give careful attention to he body and this trait alone set he apart among the citizen of turnhill yes say hilda she think : he be a very handsome man how strange i do not remember see he in the street she be in awe of he he be indefinitely older than herself and she feel like a child out of place in the easy-chair i suppose it be about the rent-collecting he pursue yes -- it be she answer astonished that he could thus divine she purpose i mean -- what do you mother want to do oh say hilda speaking low it be not mother i have come to consult you myself mother do not know i be nearly twenty-one and it be really my property you know she blush with shame ah he exclaim he try to disguise he astonishment in a easy friendly smile but he be most obviously startle he look at hilda in a different way with a much intensify curiosity yes she resume he now seem to she more like a fellow-creature and less like a member of the inimical older generation so you be nearly twenty-one in December she say and i think under my father 's will -- she stop at a loss the fact be i do not think mother will be quite able to look after the property properly and i be afraid -- you see now that mr skellorn have have this stroke -- yes say mr cannon i hear about that and i be think perhaps mr lessway have send you we collect rent you know i see hilda murmur well the truth be mother have not the slightest idea i be here not the slightest and i would not hurt she feeling for anything he nod sympathetically but i think something ought to be do she be decide to collect we calder street rent herself and she be not fit to do it and then there be the question of the repair i know the rent be go down i expect it be all mother 's for life but i want there to be something leave for I when she be go you see and if -- i have never see the will i suppose there be no way of see a copy of it somewhere i can not very well ask mother again i know all about the will say mr cannon you do wondrous magical man yes he explain i use to be at tom and scole 's i be there when it be make i copy it really she feel that he would save she not only from any possible unpleasant consequence of she escapade but also from suffer ultimate loss by reason of she mother 's foolishness you be quite right he continue i remember it perfectly you mother be what we call tenant-for-life everything go to you in the end well hilda ask abruptly all i want to know be what i can do of course without upset you mother he glance at she she blush again naturally she say coldly you say you think the property be go down -- it _ be _ everybody know that -- and you mother think of collect the rent herself well young lady it be very difficult very difficult you mother be the trustee and executor yes that be what she be always say -- she be the trustee and executor you would better let I think it over for a day or two and shall i call in again you might slip in if you be pass i 'll see what can be do of course it would never do for you to have any difficulty with you mother oh no she concur vehemently anything would be better than that but i think there be no harm in I -- certainly not she have a profound confidence in he and she be very content so far with the result of she adventure i hope nobody will find out i have be here she say timidly because if it _ do _ get to mother 's ear -- nobody will find out he reassure she assuredly he influence be tranquillize even while he insist on the difficulty of the situation he seem to be smooth they away she be convince that he would devise some means of change she mother 's absurd purpose and of strengthen she own position but when at the end of the interview he come round the large table which separate they and she rise and look up at he close she be suddenly very afraid of he he be a tall and muscular man and he stand like a monarch and she stand like a child and he gesture seem to say : yes i know you be afraid and i rather like you to be afraid but i be benevolent in the exercise of my power under he gaze she gaze fasten on the wire-blind and the dark window and she read off the reversed letter on the blind like a mouse she escape to the stair she be happy and fearful and expectant it be do she have consult a lawyer she be astounded at herself in the market square it be now black night she look shyly up at the light wire-blind over the ironmongery i be there she say he be still there the whole town the whole future seem to be drench now in romance nevertheless the cause of she immense discontent have not apparently be remove nor in any way modify chapter iv domesticity invade i early in the afternoon two day later hilda come with a air of reproach into she mother 's empty bedroom mr lessway have contract a severe cold in the head a malady to which she be subject and which she accept with fatalistic submission even pleasurably give herself up to it as a martyr to the rack mr lessway ' cold annoy hilda who out of she wisdom could always point to the precise indiscretion which have cause they and to whom the spectacle of a head wrap day and night in flannel be offensively ridiculous moreover hilda in these crisis be further and still more acutely exasperated by the pillage of she handkerchief although she possess a supply of handkerchief far beyond she own need she really hate to lend to she mother in the hour of necessity she do lend and she lend without speak protest but with frigid bitterness she youthful passion for order and efficiency be aggrieve by she mother 's negligent and inadequate arrangement for cope with the inevitable plague she now make a police-visit to the bedroom because she consider that she mother have be demand handkerchief at a stage too early in the progress of the disease impossible that she mother should have come to the end of she own handkerchief she know with all the certitude of she omniscience that numerous clean handkerchief must be conceal somewhere in the untidiness of she mother 's wardrobe see she as she enter the bedroom the principal bedroom of the house whose wide bed and large wardrobe recall the past when she have a father as well as a mother and when that bedroom awed she footstep a thin brown-frocked girl wear a detest but enforce small black apron with fine pale determine feature rather unfeminine hair and glower challenging black eye she have a very decide way of put down she uncoquettishly shod foot absurdly young of course wistfully young she be undeveloped and do not even look nearly twenty-one you be at liberty to smile at she air at that careless critical glance which pityingly say : ah if this be my room it would be different from what it be at that serious worried expression as if the anxiety of the whole world 's deficiency oppress the heart within and at that supreme conviction of wisdom which after all be little but a exaggerated perception of folly and inconsistency in other she be not to be comprehend on a acquaintance of three day year must go to the understanding of she she do not understand herself she be not even acquaint with herself why she be naïve enough to be puzzle because she feel older than she mother and younger than she beautiful girlish complexion simultaneously she open the central mirror door of the once formidable wardrobe and as she do so the image of the bed and of half the room shot across the swing glass take the place of she own reflection and instantly when she insert herself between the expose face of the wardrobe and its door she be precipitate into the most secret intimacy of she mother 's existence there be the familiar odour of old kid glove she be more intimate with she mother now than she could ever be in talk to she the lower part of this section of the wardrobe consist of three deep drawer with inset brass handle a exquisitely exact piece of mahogany cabinetwork from one of the drawer a bit of white linen untidily protrude she mother the upper part be fill with slide tray each have a raise edge to keep the contents from fall out these tray be heap pell-mell with she mother 's personal belongings -- small garment odd indeterminate trifle a muff a bundle of whalebone veil bag and especially cardboard box quantity of various cardboard box she mother keep everything could not bear that anything which have once be useful should be abandon or destroy whereas hilda 's propensity be to throw away with a impatient gesture whatever threaten to be a encumbrance sigh she begin to arrange the contents of the tray in some kind of method incompetent and careless mother hilda wonder how the old thing manage to conduct she life from day to day with even a semblance of the decency of order it do not occur to she that for twenty-five year before she be bear and for a long time afterwards mr lessway have contrived to struggle along through the world without she daughter 's aid to the general satisfaction of herself and some other at length ferret on the highest shelf but one she have the deep proud satisfaction of the philosopher who have correctly deduce consequence from character underneath a paisley shawl she discover a lose treasure of clean handkerchief one two three four -- there be eleven and among they be one of she own appropriate by she mother through sheer inexcusable inadvertence they have probably be lie under the shawl for week month still she do not allow herself to be vex since the singular hysterical embrace in the twilight of the kitchen she have feel for she mother a curious kind forbear fatalistic indulgence mother be like that and there you be and further she mood have be so changed and uplift by excitement and expectation that she could not be genuinely harsh she have be thrill by the audacity of the visit to mr cannon and though she hope from it little but a negative advantage she be experience the rare happiness of adventure she have slip out for a moment from the confine and stifle circle of domestic dailiness she have scented the feverish perfume of the world and she owe all this to herself alone she mean on the morrow while she mother be market to pursue the enterprise the consciousness of this intention be sweet but she know not why it be sweet she only know that she live in the preoccupation of a dream have take two of the handkerchief she shut the wardrobe and turn the key she go first to she own small prim room to restore steal property to its rightful place and then she descend towards the kitchen with the other handkerchief give it to she mother and conceal she triumph beneath a mask of wise long-suffering benevolence she would say : i have find ten of you handkerchief mother here be one and she mother ingenuously startle and please would exclaim : where child and she still control herself as befit a superior be would reply casually : in you wardrobe of course you stick to it there be not any but i be sure there be ii the dialogue which actually do accompany the presentation of the handkerchief though roughly correspond to she rehearsal of it be lack in the dramatic pungency necessary for a really effective triumph the reason be that the thought of both mother and daughter be divert in different way from the handkerchief by the presence of florrie in the kitchen florrie be the new servant and she have come into the house that morning sponsor by a aunt who be one of the best of the calder street tenant florrie have be accept rather unwillingly the objection to she be that she be too young -- thirteen and a half mr lessway have a vague humanitarian sentiment against the employment of child as for hilda 's feeling it be at one moment more compassionate even than she mother 's and at another almost cynically indifferent the aunt however a person of powerful common sense have persuade mr lessway that the truest kindness would be to give florrie a trial florrie be very strong and she have be bring up to work hard and she enjoy work hard do not you florrie yes aunt with a delightful smile whisper timidity she be the eldest of a family of ten and have always assist she mother in the management of a half-crown house and the nurture of a regiment of infant but at thirteen and a half a girl ought to be earn money for she parent bless you she know what a pawnshop be she father be often out of a job owe to potter 's asthma and she have some knowledge of cookery and be in particular very good at boil potato to take she would be a real kindness on the part of mr lessway for the ` place ' be not merely a easy place it be a ` good ' place suppose that mr lessway refuse to have she -- well florrie might go on to a ` potbank ' and come to harm or she might engage herself with tradespeople where notoriously the work be never finish or she might even be force into a public-house she aunt know that they want a servant at the queen adelaide where the wages would be pretty high but no no niece of hers should ever go into service at a public-house if she could help it what with hot rum and coffee to be ready for customer at half-past five of a morning and clean up at night after close a poor girl would never see she bed whereas at mr lessway ' so mrs lessway take florrie in order to save she from slavery the slim child be pretty with graceful and eager movement and certainly a rapid comprehension she gray eye sparkle and she brown hair be coquettishly tie up rather in the manner of a horse 's tail on may day she have arrive all by herself in the morning with a tiny bundle and she make a remarkably neat appearance -- if you do not look at she boot which have evidently be somebody else be a long time before hilda have be clearly aware of a feeling of pleasure at the prospect of this young girl 's presence in the house hilda now see she in another aspect she wear a large foul apron of sack which make she elegant body quite shapeless and she be kneel on the red-and-black tiled floor of the kitchen with she enormous crack boot stick out behind she at one side of she be a pail full of steam brown water and in she red coarse little hand which do not seem to belong to those gracile arm she hold a drip clout in front of she on a half-dried space of clean shine floor stand mr lessway she head wrap in a flannel petticoat nearer to the child stretch a small semi-circle of liquid mud to the rear be the untouched dirty floor florrie be look up at she mistress with respectful strained attention she could not proceed with she work because mr lessway have choose this moment to instruct she with much snuffle in the duty and responsibility of she position yes mum florrie whisper she seem to be incapable of speak beyond a whisper but the whisper be delicate and agreeable and perhaps it be a mysterious sign of she alleged unusual physical strength you 'll have to be down at half-past six then you 'll light you kitchen fire but of course you 'll get you coal up first and then you 'll do you boot now the bacon -- but never mind that -- either miss hilda or I will be down to-morrow morning to show you yes mum florrie 's whisper be grateful when you have get thing go a bit like you 'll do you parlor -- i have tell you all about that though but i do not tell you -- except on wednesday on wednesday you give you parlor a thorough turn-out _ after _ breakfast and mind it be get to be all straight for dinner at half-past twelve yes mum i shall show you about you fire-iron -- mr lessway be continue to make everything in the house the private property of florrie when hilda interrupt she about the handkerchief and afterwards with a exhortation to beware of the dampness of the floor which exhortation mr lessway faintly resent whereupon hilda leave the kitchen it be always imprudent to come between mr lessway and a new servant hilda remain listen in the lobby to the interminable and rambling instruction at length mr lessway say benevolently : there be no reason why you should not go to bed at half-past eight or nine at the latest no reason whatever and if you be quick and handy -- and i be sure you be -- you 'll have plenty of time in the afternoon for plain sewing and darning i shall see how you can darn mr lessway add encouragingly yes mum hilda 's heart revolt less against she mother 's defect as a organizer than against the odious mess of the whole business of domesticity she know that with she mother in the house florrie would never get to bed at half-past eight and very seldom at nine and that she would never be free in the afternoon she know that if she mother would only consent to sit still and not interfere the housework could be accomplish with half the labor that at present go to it there be three woman in the place or at any rate a woman a young woman and a girl -- and in theory the main preoccupation of all of they be this business of domesticity it be of course ridiculous and she would never be able to make anyone see that it be ridiculous but that be not all the very business itself absolutely disgust she it disgust she to such a point that she would have prefer to do it with she own hand in secret rather than see other do it openly in all its squalor the business might be more efficiently organize -- for example there be no reason why the sitting-room should be make uninhabitable between breakfast and dinner once a week -- but it could never be other than odious the kitchen floor must inevitably be wash every day by a girl on she knee in sackcloth with terrible hand she be witness now the first stage in the progress of a victim of the business of domesticity to-day florrie be a charming young creature full of slender grace soon she would be a dehumanize drudge and hilda could not stop it all over the town in every street of the town behind all the nice curtain and blind the same hidden shame be be enact : a vast sloppy steam greasy social horror -- inevitable it amount to barbarism hilda think in she revolt she turn from it with loathing and yet nobody else seem to turn from it with loathing nobody else seem to perceive that this business of domesticity be not life itself be at best the clumsy external machinery of life on the contrary about half the adult population worship it as a exercise sacred and paramount enlarge its importance and with positive gusto permit it to monopolize they existence nine-tenth of she mother 's conversation be concern with the business of domesticity -- and withal mr lessway take the business more lightly than most iii there be a impatient knock at the front door -- rare phenomenon but not unknown mr lessway cry out thickly from the fold of she flannel petticoat : hilda just see who that be will you knock like that florrie can not come and just as hilda reach the front door she mother open the kitchen door wide to view the troublesome disturber and to inform he if as be probable he be exceed he rights that he would have do better to try the back door it be mr cannon at the front door hilda hear the kitchen door slam to behind she but the noise be like a hallucination in she brain she be stagger by the apparition of mr cannon in the porch she have vaguely wonder what he might do to execute he promise of aid she have feel that time be run short if she mother be to be prevent from commence rent-collector on the Monday she have perhaps ingenuously expect from he some kind of miracle but of a surety she have never dream that he would call in person at she home he must be mad she would have exclaim to herself if the grandeur of he image in she heart have not make any such accusation impossible to she he be not mad he be merely inscrutable terrifyingly so it be as if she adventurous audacity personify have double back on she and be exquisitely threaten she good afternoon say mr cannon smile confidently and yet with ceremoniousness be you mother about yes hilda do not know it but she be whisper quite in the manner of florrie shall i come in oh please do the word jump out of she mouth all at once so anxious be she to destroy any impression conceivably make that she do not desire he to come in he cross the step and take she hand with one gesture she shut the door he wait in suave silence there be barely space for they together in the narrow lobby and she scarce dare look up at he he easily dominate she he bigness subdue she and the handsomeness of he face and he attire be like a moral intimidation he have a large physical splendor that be well set off and illustrate by the brilliance of he linen and he broadcloth she be as modest as a mouse beside he the superior young woman the stern and yet indulgent philosopher have utterly vanish and only a poor little mouse remain will you please come into the drawing-room she murmur when after a immense effort to keep full control of she faculty she have decide where he must be put thanks he say as she diminish herself with beautiful shy curve of she body against the wall so that he could maneuver he bigness through the drawing-room doorway he give she a glance half benign and half politely malicious which seem to say again : i know you be afraid and i rather like it but you know you need not be please take a seat she implore and then quickly as he seem to have no intention of speak to she confidentially i 'll tell mother leave the room she see he sink smoothly into a seat he rich-piled hat in one gloved hand and a ebony walking-stick in the other he presence have a disastrous effect on the chill unfrequented drawing-room reduce it instantly to a condition of paltry shabbiness the kitchen door be still shut yes all the squalor of the business of domesticity must be hide from this splendid be hilda go as a criminal into the kitchen mr lessway with violent movement signal she to close the door before speak florrie gaze spellbound upward at both of they the household be in a high fever you do not mean to tell I that be mr cannon mr lessway excitedly whisper do -- do -- you know he hilda falter do i know he what do he want he want to see you what about i suppose it be about property or something hilda reply blush never have she feel so abject in front of she mother mr lessway rapidly unpin the flannel petticoat and then throw it with a desperate gesture of sacrifice on to the deal table the situation have to be meet the resplendent male await she in the death-cold room the resplendent male have he overcoat but she suffer must face the rigor and the risk unprotect no matter if she catch bronchitis the thing have to be do even hilda do not think of accuse she mother of folly mr lessway have pat she hair empty several handkerchief from the twin pocket of she embroidered black apron and snatch at the clean handkerchief furnish by hilda depart to she fate she be certainly startle and puzzle but she be not a whit intimidate and the perception of this fact inspire hilda with a new reluctant respect for she mother hilda from the kitchen hear the greeting in the drawing-room and then the reverberation of the sufferer 's nose she desire to go into the drawing-room she mother probably expect she to go in but she dare not she be afraid i be wonder say the voice of mr cannon whether you have ever think of sell you calder street property mr lessway and then the drawing-room door be close and the ticking of the grandfather 's clock resume possession of the lobby chapter v mrs lessways ' shrewdness i wait irresolute in the kitchen doorway hilda pass the most thrillingly agreeable moment that destiny have ever vouchsafe to she she dwell on the mysterious attractive quality of mr cannon 's voice -- she be sure that though in speak to she mother he be softly persuasive he have use to herself a tone even more intimate and ingratiating he and she have a secret they be conspirator together : which fact be both disconcerting and delicious she recall they propinquity in the lobby the remembered syllable which he have utter mingle with the faint scent of he broadcloth the whiteness of he wristband the gleam of he stud the droop of he moustache the downward ray of he glance and the proud nimble carriage of he great limb -- and form in she mind the image of a ideal a image regard not with any tenderness but with naïve admiration and unquestioning respect and yet also with more than that for when she dwell on he glance she have a slight transient feeling of faintness which come and go in a second and which she do not analyze -- and could not have analyze cloud of fear sail in swift capriciousness across the sky of she dream obscure it : fear of mr cannon 's breath-taking initiative fear of the upshot of she adventure and a fear without a name nevertheless she exult she exult because she be in the very midst of she wondrous adventure and tingle with a thousand apprehension after a long time the latch of the drawing-room door crack warningly hilda retire within the kitchen out of sight of the lobby she know that the child in she would compel she to wait like a child until the visitor be go instead of issue forth boldly like a young woman but to florrie the young mistress with she stern dark mask and formidable eyebrow and air of superb disdain be as August as a goddess florrie move backwards have now get nearly to the scullery door with she wringing and splashing and wipe and she have dirty even she face as hilda absently look at she she think somehow of mr cannon 's white wristband she see the wash and the ironing of those wristband and a slatternly woman or two sigh and grumble amid wreath of steam and a background of cinder and suds and sloppiness all that so that the grand creature might have a rim of pure white to he coat-sleeve for a day it be inevitable but the grand creature must never know the shame necessary to he splendor must be conceal from he lest he might be offend and this be woman 's loyalty she idea concern the business of domesticity be now mixed and opposing and irreconcileable and she begin to suspect that the basis of society might be more complex and confusing than in she youthful downrightness she have imagine ii well you have get you way say mr lessway with a certain grim disdainful cheerfulness from which benevolence be not quite absent the drastic treatment accord to she cold seem to have do it good at any rate she have not resume the flannel petticoat and the nasal symptom be much less pronounced get my way hilda repeat at a loss and newly apprehensive mother and daughter be set tea florrie have be do very well but she be not yet quite equal to she situation and the mistress be now perform she lighter duty while she change from the offensive drudge to the neat parlour-maid throughout the afternoon hilda have avoid she mother 's sight partly because she want to be alone -lrb- without know why -rrb- and partly because she be afraid lest mr cannon as a member of the older generation might have betray she to she mother this fear be not very genuine though she pretend that it be and enjoy play with it : as if she really desire a catastrophe for the outcome of she adventure she have only come downstairs in response to she mother 's direct summons and instantly on see she she have know that mr cannon be not a traitor which knowledge somehow render she gay in spite of herself so that what with this gaiety and the stimulation produce in mr lessway by the visit of mr cannon and the general household relief at the obvious fact that florrie would rather more than ` do ' the atmosphere around the tinkle tea-table in the half-light be decidedly pleasant nevertheless the singular turn of mr lessway ' phrase -- you have get you way -- have startle the guilty hilda mr cannon 's go to see to the collect of the calder street rent explain mr lessway so i hope you be satisfied miss hilda be aware of self-consciousness yes you may well color up mr lessway pursue genial but malicious you be as pleased as punch and you be say to yourself you have make you old mother give way to ye again and so you need not tell I i think say hilda with all possible prim worldliness -- i think i hear he say something about buy the property mr lessway laugh sceptically confidently as one who could not be deceive pooh she say that be only a try-on that be only so that he could begin he palaver do not tell I i may be a simpleton but i be not such a simpleton as he think for nor as some other folk think for either -lrb- at this point hilda have to admit that in truth she mother be not completely a simpleton in she mother be a vein of perceptive shrewdness that occasionally crop out and make all hilda 's critical philosophy seem school-girlish -rrb- do you think i do not know george cannon he come here o ' purpose to get that rent-collecting well he be get it and he be welcome to it for i doubt not he 'll do it a sight better than poor mr skellorn but he need not hug himself that he be be too clever for I because he have not i give he the rent-collecting because i think i would buy he be no more get a good customer for calder street than he be get a good customer for this slop-bowl hilda resent this casual detraction of a be who have so deeply impressed she and moreover she be convince that she mother secretly very flattered and delighted by the visit be adopt a derisive attitude in order to ` show off ' before she daughter parent be thus ingenuous but she be so shocked and sneap that she find it more convenient to say nothing george cannon could talk the hind leg off a horse mr lessway continue quite happily and yet it be not as if he say a great deal he do not i 'll say this for he he be always the gentleman and i could not say as much for he sister be a lady and i be sorry for it he be the most gentlemanly man in turnhill and always so spruce too he sister well he half-sister since you be so particular miss precise not miss gailey say hilda who begin faintly to recall a forget fact of which she think she have once be cognizant yes miss gailey mr lessway snap still very genial and content i do hear she be quarrel out and out with _ he _ too at last she tighten she lip draw the blind down miss gailey a spinster of superior breeding and a teacher of dancing have in the distant past be a intimate friend of mr lessway the friendship be legendary in the house and the grand quarrel which have finally put a end to it date in hilda 's early memory like a historical event for many year the two have not exchange a word mr lessway light the gas and the china and the white cloth and the color fruit-jelly and the silver spoon catch the light and throw it off again with gaiety have she sweep the hearth yes she have say mr lessway glance round at the red fire hilda sit down to wait folding she hand as it be in meekness in a few moment florrie enter with the teapot and the hot-water jug the child wear proudly a new white apron that be a little too long for she and she smile happily at mr lessway ' brief compliment on she appearance and she briskness she might have be in paradise come in for you cup in three minute say mr lessway and to hilda when florrie have whisper and go : now we shall see if she can make tea i tell she very particularly this morning and she seem quick enough and when three minute have expire mr lessway taste the tea yes it be good it be quite good undeniably the water have boil within five seconds of be pour on the leaf there be something _ in _ this florrie already she be exhibit the mysterious quality of efficiency the first day be the first day have of course not be without its discourage moment but on the whole florrie have prove that she could be trust to understand and to do thing here be a extra piece of sugar for you say mr lessway beam as florrie leave the parlor with she big breakfast-cup full of steam tea to drink with the thick bread-and-butter on the scrubbed kitchen - table all by herself and do not touch the gas in the kitchen -- it be quite high enough for young eye mr lessway cry out after she little poppet she murmur to herself maternally reflect upon florence 's tender youth iii she be happy be mrs lessway in she domesticity she foresee a immediate future that would be tranquil she be prepare herself to lean upon the reliability of florrie as upon a cushion she like the little poppet and she like well-made tea and pure jelly and she have settle the calder street problem and incidentally hilda be thereby placate why should she not be happy she wish for nothing else and she be not a woman to meet trouble half-way one of she greatest quality be that she do not unduly worry -lrb- hilda might say that she do not worry enough let thing go -rrb- in spite of she cold she yield with more gusto than usual to the meal and even say that if florrie ` continue to shape ' they would have hot toast again hot toast have long since be drop from the menu as a item too troublesome as a rule the meal be take hurriedly and negligently like a religious formality which have lose its meaning but which custom insist on hilda could not but share she mother 's satisfaction she could not entirely escape the soft influence of the tranquillity in which the household be newly bath the domestic existence of unmated woman together though it be full of secret exasperation also have its hour of charm -- a charm honey perverse and unique hilda feel the charm but she be suddenly sad and she again find pleasure in she sadness she be sad because she adventure be over -- over too soon and too easily she think now that really she would have prefer a catastrophe as the end of it she have get what she desire but she be no better off than she have be before the paralytic stroke of mr skellorn domesticity have close in on she once more she secret adventure have become sterile its risk be destroy and nothing could spring from it nevertheless it live in she heart after all it have be tremendous and the virtue of audacious initiative be miraculous yes she mother be shrewd enough -- that could not be deny -- but she be not so shrewd as she imagine for it have never occur to she and it never would occur to she even in the absurdest dream -- that the author of mr cannon 's visit be the girl sit opposite to she and delicately peck at jelly how be he miss gailey 's half-brother hilda demand half-way through the meal why mr gailey -- sarah gailey 's mother that be -- marry a foreigner after she first husband die but mr cannon be not a foreigner he be half a foreigner look at he eye surely you know all about that child no it be before you time hilda then learn that mr gailey have marry a french modeller name canonge who have be bring over from limoge -lrb- or some such sound place -rrb- by peel at bursley the great rival of minton and of copeland and that in course of time the modeller have informally change the name to cannon because no one in the five town could pronounce the true name rightly and that george cannon the son of the union have be leave early a orphan how do he come to be a solicitor hilda question eagerly they say he be not really a solicitor say mr lessway that be he have not pass he examination like but i dare say he know as much law as a lot of 'em _ and _ more and he have that mr karkeek to cover he like that be what they _ say _ he use to be a lawyer 's clerk -- at tom and scole 's i think it be then he leave the district for a year or two -- or it might be several and then he lordship come back all of a sudden and set up with mr karkeek just like that can he talk french who mr cannon he can talk _ english _ my word he can that eh he be a ` customer ' he be -- a regular ' customer ' hilda instead of be seat at the table be away in far realm of romance the startling thought occur to she : of course he 'll expect I to go and see he he be do what i ask he and he 'll expect I to go and see he and talk it over and i suppose i shall have to pay he something i would forget that and i ought not to have forget it chapter vi victor hugo and isaac pitman i the next morning Saturday hilda run no risk in visit mr cannon she mother 's cold after a fictitious improvement have assume a aggravate form in order to prove that not with impunity may nature be flout in unheated October drawing-room and hilda have be request to go to market alone she be free and even suppose that the visit should be observe by the curious nobody would attach any importance to it because everybody would soon be aware that mr cannon have assume charge of the calder street property past the brass plate of mr q karkeek out of the straw-littered hubbub of the market-place she climb the long flight of stair lead to the office on the first floor in one worsted-gloved hand she hold a market-basket of multi-coloured wicker which dangle a little below the frilled and flounced edge of she blue jacket secure in the pocket of she valanced brown skirt -- for at that time and in that place it have not yet occur to any woman that pocket be a superfluity -- a private half-sovereign lay in the inmost compartment of she purse this coin be destine to recompense mr cannon she free hand go up to the heavy chignon that hang uncertainly beneath she bonnet -- a gesture of coquetry which she tell herself she despise she face be a prim and rather forbid mask assuredly a mysterious mask she could not have explain she own feeling she be still in the adventure but the end of it be immediate she have nothing to hope from the future she essential infelicity be as profound and as enigmatic as ever she might have say with deliberate and vehement sincerity that she be not happy wise experienced observer study she as she walk she way in the street might have say of she with sympathetically sad conviction that girl be not happy what a pity it be so and yet in she unhappiness she be blest she savor she unhappiness she drink it down passionately as though it be the very water of life -- which it be she live to the utmost in every moment the recondite romance of existence be not hide from she the sudden creation -- she creation -- of the link with mr cannon seem to she surpassingly strange and romantic and in so regard it she have no ulterior thought whatever : she look on it with the single-mindedness of a artist look on he work and be it not indeed astounding that by a swift caprice and stroke of audacity she should have change and tranquillize the ominous future for she unsuspecting mother and herself be it not absolutely disconcert that she and this mr cannon whom she have never know before and in whom she have no other interest should bear between they this singular secret at once innocent and guilty in the midst of the whole town so deaf and blind ii a somewhat shabby-genteel youngish man appear at the head of the stair he be wear a silk hat and a too ample frock-coat and immediately from the hidden corridor at the top she hear the voice of mr cannon imperious : karkeek the shabby-genteel man stop hilda want to escape but she could not chiefly because she pride would not allow she have to go on she go on frown the man vanish back into the corridor she could hear that mr cannon have join he in conversation she arrive at the corridor how-d'ye-do miss lessway mr cannon greet she with calm politeness turn from mr karkeek who raise he hat will you come this way one moment mr karkeek through a door marked private mr cannon introduce hilda straight into he own room then shut the door on she he hold in one hand a large calf-bound volume from which evidently he be expound something to mr karkeek the contrast between the expensive informality of mr cannon 's new suit and the battered ceremoniousness of mr karkeek 's strike she just as much as the contrast between they demeanor and she feel vaguely the oddness of the fact that the name of the deferential mr karkeek and not the name of the commanding mr cannon should be upon the door-plate and the wire-blind of the establishment but of course she be not in a position to estimate the full significance of this remarkable phenomenon further though she perfectly remember she mother 's observation upon mr cannon 's status they do not in the slightest degree damage he in she eye -- when once those eye have be set on he again they seem to she inessential the essential for she be the incontestable natural authority and dignity of he bear she sit down self-consciously in the chair -- opposite the owner 's chair -- which she have occupy at she first visit and thus survey across the large flat desk all the range document and bundle with the write thereon upside down there also be he blotting-pad and he vast inkstand and he pen and he thick diary the disposition of the thing on the desk seem to indicate sharply and incontrovertibly that orderliness that inexorable efficiency which more than aught else she admire in the external conduct of life the spectacle satisfy she soothe she and seem to explain the attractiveness of mr cannon immediately to she left be a open bookcase almost fill with heavy volume the last of a uniform row of law report be absent from its place -- be at that moment in the corridor in the hand of mr cannon the next book a thin one have topple over sideways and be bridge the vacancy at a angle several other similar thin book fill up the remainder of the shelf she stare with the factitious interest of one who be very nervously await a encounter at the title and presently decipher the word ` victor hugo ' on each of the thin volume she interest instantly become real characteristically abrupt and unreflecting she deposit she basket on the floor and go to the bookcase take out the slanting volume its title be _ les rayons et les ombres _ she open it by hazard at the follow poem which have no head and which stand a small triptych of print rather solitary in the lower half of a large white page : dieu qui sourit et qui donne et qui vient vers qui l'attend pourvu que vous soyez bonne serum content le monde où tout étincelle mais ou rien n'est enflammé pourvu que vous soyez belle serum charmé mon coeur dans l'ombre amoureuse où l'énivrent deux beaux yeux pourvu que tu sois heureuse serum joyeux that be all but she shake as though a miracle have be enact hilda owe partly to the fondness of a otherwise stern grandfather and partly to the vanity of she unimportant father have finally be send to a school attend by girl who on the average be a little above herself in station -- chetwynd 's in the valley between turnhill and bursley -lrb- it be still call chetwynd 's though it have change hand -rrb- among the staff be a mistress who be know as miss miranda -- she seem to have no surname one of miss miranda 's duty have be to teach optional french and one of miss miranda 's delight have be to dictate this very poem of victor hugo 's to she pupil for learn by heart it be miss miranda 's sole french poem and she impose it with unfading delight on the successive generation whom she ` ground ' in french hilda have apparently forget most of she french but as she now read the poem -lrb- for the first time in print -rrb- it re-establish itself in she memory as the most lovely verse that she have ever know and the recitation of it in miss miranda 's small classroom come back to she with a effect beautiful and tragic and also there be the name of victor hugo which miss miranda 's insistent enthusiasm have render sublime and legendary to a sensitive child hilda now see the sacred name stamp in gold on a whole set of elegant volume it be marvellous that she should have turn the page contain just that poem it be equally marvellous that she should have discover the work of victor hugo in the matter-of-fact office of mr cannon but be it be he not half-french and be not these book precisely a corroboration of what she mother have tell she mr cannon 's origin at once assume for she the strange seductive hue of romance he share the glory of victor hugo then the voice in the corridor cease and with a decisive movement he unlatch the door she relinquish the book and calmly sit down as he enter iii of course you mother 's tell you yes i have no difficulty at all i just ask she what she be go to do about the rent-collecting standing up in front of hilda but on he own side of the desk mr cannon smile as a conqueror who can recount a triumph with pride but without conceit she look at he with naïve admiration to admire he be agreeable to she and she like also to feel unimportant in he presence but she fight unsuccessfully against the humiliating idea that he personal smartness convict she of be shabby -- of be even inefficient in one department of she existence and she could have wish to be magnificently dress mr lessway be a very shrewd lady -- very shrewd indeed say mr cannon with a smile this time to indicate humorously that mr lessway be not so easy to handle as might be imagine and that even the cleverest must mind they p 's and q 's with such a lady oh yes she _ be _ hilda agree with a exaggerated emphasis that show a lack of conviction indeed she have never think of she mother as a _ very _ shrewd lady mr cannon continue to smile in silence upon the shrewdness of mr lessway give little appreciative movement of the diaphragm drawing in he lip and by consequence push out he cheek like a child 's and he eye be all the time say lightly : still i manage she and while this pleasant intimate silence persist the noise of the market-place make themselves prominent quite agreeably -- in particular the hard metallic stamp and slip on the brick pavement under the window of a team of cart-horse that be be turn in a space too small for they grand free movement and the good-humoured crack of a whip again hilda be impressed mystically by the strangeness of the secret relation between herself and this splendid effective man there they be safe within the room almost on a footing of familiar friendship the atmosphere be different from that of the first interview and none know and she alone have bring it all about by a simple caprice i be fine and startle when i see you at we door mr cannon she say he might have say be you you do not show it she be half expect he to say some such thing but he become reflective and begin : well you see -- and then hesitate you do not tell I you think of call well he proceed at last -- and she could not be sure whether he be reply to she or not -- i be pretty nearly ready to buy that calder street property and i think i would talk _ that _ over with you mother first it just happen to make a good beginning you see he speak with all the flattering charm of the confidential hilda flush under she mother 's suggestion she have be misjudge he he have not be guilty of mere scheming she be profoundly glad the act of apology to he perform in she own mind give she a curious delight i wish she would sell say hilda to whom the ownership of a slum be obnoxious very soon you consent would be necessary to any sale really she exclaim agreeably flattered but scarcely surprise by this information i should consent quick enough i can not bear to walk down the street he laugh condescendingly well i do not think you mother _ would _ care to sell if you ask I he sit down hilda frown regret she confession and resent he laughter what will you charge be please mr cannon she demand abruptly and yet girlishly timid and at the same moment she draw forth she purse which she have be hold ready in she hand for a second he think she be refer to the price of rent-collecting but the appearance of the purse explain she meaning oh there be no charge he say in a low voice seize a penholder but i must pay you something i can not -- no you must not they glance meet in conflict across the table she have know that he would say exactly that and she have be determine to insist on pay a fee -- utterly determine but she could not now withstand the force of he will she glance fail she she be disconcert by the sudden demonstration of she inferiority she be distressed and then a feeling of faintness and the gathering of a mist in the air positively frighten she the mist clear he glance seem to say with kindness : you see how much stronger i be than you but you can trust I the sense of adventure grow even more acute in she she marvel at what life be and hide the purse like a shame it be very kind of you she murmur not a bit he say i have get a job through this do not forget that we do not collect rent for nothing you know -- especially calder street sort of rent she pick up she basket and rise he also rise so you have be look at my victor hugo he remark put he right hand negligently into he pocket instead of hold it forth in adieu iv so overset be she by the dramatic surprise of he challenging remark and so enlighten by the sudden perception of it be perfectly characteristic of he that she manner change in a instant to a delicate startled timidity all the complex sensitiveness of she nature be express simultaneously in the change tint of she face the confusion of she eye and she gesture and the exquisite hesitation of she voice as she tell he about the coincidence which have bring back to she in he office the poem of she schoolday he come to the bookcase and take out the volume handle it carelessly i only bring these thing here because they be nicely bind and fill up the shelf he say not much use in a lawyer 's office you know he glance from the volume to she and from she to the volume ah miss miranda yes well it be not so wonderful as all that my father use to give she lesson in french this hugo be he he think a great deal of it mr cannon 's pose exhibit pride but it be obvious that he do not share he father 's taste he tone rather patronize he father and hugo too as he let the page of the book slip by under he thumb he stop and with a very good french accent quite different from hilda 's memory of miss miranda 's murmur in a sort of chant -- _ dieu qui sourit et qui donne _ that be the very one cry hilda ah there you be then you see -- the bookmark be at that page hilda have not notice the thin ribbon almost conceal in the jointure of the page i would not be a bit astonished if my father have lend she this very book curious be not it it be nevertheless hilda feel that he sense of the miraculousness of life be not so keen as she own and she be disappointed i suppose you be very fond of read he say no i be not she reply she spirit lift a little courageously to meet he with defiance like a ship lift its prow above the threatening billow she eye waver but do not fall before he really now i should have say you be a great reader what do you do with yourself he now speak like a brother confident of a trustful response i just waste my time she answer coldly she see that he be puzzle interested and pique and that he be examine she quite afresh well he say shortly after a pause adopt the benevolent tone of a uncle or even a great-uncle you 'll be get married one of these day i do not want to get marry she retort obstinately and with a harder glance then what do you want i do not know she discover great relief even pleasure in thus callously expose she mind to a stranger tap he tooth with one thumb he gaze at she apparently in meditation upon she peculiar case at last he say : i tell you what you ought to do you ought to go in for phonography phonography she be at a loss yes pitman 's shorthand you know oh shorthand -- yes i have hear of it but why why it be go to be the great thing of the future there never be anything like it he voice grow warm and he glance scintillate and now hilda understand she mother 's account of he persuasiveness she feel the truth of that odd remark that he could talk the hind leg off a horse but do it lead to anything she inquire with she strong sense of intrinsic value i should say it do he answer it lead to everything there be nothing it will not lead to it be the key of the future you 'll see look at dayson he be take it up and now he be give lesson in it he be get a room over he aunt 's i can tell you he stagger I he write in shorthand as fast as ever i could read to he and then he read out what he would write without a single slip i be have one of my chap teach i be pay for the lesson i thought of learn myself -- yes really oh it be a thing that 'll revolutionize all business and secretarial work and so on -- revolutionize it and it be spread it 'll be the open sesame to everything anybody that can write a hundred and twenty word a minute 'll be able to walk into any situation he want -- straight _ into _ it there be never be anything like it look here it be he snatch up a pale-green booklet from the desk and open it before she she see the cryptic character for the first time and she see they with he glowing eye in they mysterious stroke and curve and dot she see romance and the key of the future she see the philosopher 's stone she see a new religion that have already begin to work like leaven in the town the revelation be deliciously intoxicating she be convert as by lightning she yield to the ecstasy of discipleship here -- somehow inexplicably incomprehensively -- here be the answer to the enigma of she long desire and it be a answer original strange distinguished unexpected unique yes and divine how lovely how beatific to be the master of this enchanted key it must be very interesting she say low with the venturesome shyness of a deer that be reassure i do not mind tell you this mr cannon go on with the fire of the prophet i have get something come along pretty soon -- he repeat more slowly -- i have get something come along pretty soon where there 'll be scope for a young lady that can write shorthand _ well _ i can not tell you what it be but it be something different from anything there be ever be in this town _ and _ better he eye masterfully hold hers seem to say : i be vague but i be vague when i tell you i would see what could be do about you mother -- and look at what i do and how quickly and easily i do it when i be vague it mean a lot and she entirely understand that he vagueness be calculate -- out of pride they talk about mr dayson a little i must go now say hilda awkwardly i would like you to take that hugo he say i dare say it would interest you remind you of old time oh no you can return it when you like she feature become apologetic she have too hastily assume that he wish to force a gift on she please he ejaculate no abuse this time of moral authority but a appeal boyish wistful supplicate it be irresistible completely irresistible it give she a extraordinary sense of personal power he wrap up the book for she in a sheet of blue draft paper that noisily crackle while he be do so a tiny part of she brain be as it be automatically explore a box of old book in the attic at home and search therein for a gasc 's french-english dictionary which she have use at school and never think of since my compliment to you mother he say at parting she gaze at he questioningly oh i be forget he correct himself with a avuncular ironic smile you be not suppose to have see I be you then she be outside in the din and from thrilling altitude she have to bring she mind to marketing she hide under apple the flat blue parcel in the basket chapter vii the editorial secretary i arthur dayson though a very good shorthand writer and not without experience as a newspaper reporter and sub-editor be a nincompoop there could be no other explanation of he bland complacent indifference as he sit poke at a coke stove one cold night of January 1880 in full view of a most marvellous and ravishing spectacle the stove be in a room on the floor above the office label as mr q karkeek 's its pipe support by wire stay go straight up nearly to the grimy ceiling and then turn horizontally and disappear through a clumsy hole in the scorch wall it be a shabby stove but not more so than the other few article of furniture -- a large table a small desk three deteriorated cane-chair two gas bracket and a old copying-press on its rickety stand the sole object that could emerge brightly from the ordeal of the gas-flare be a splendid freshly print blue poster gummed with stamp-paper to the wall : which poster bear the word in vast capital of two size : _ the five town chronicle and turnhill guardian _ copy of this poster have also be fix face outwards on the two curtainless black window to announce to the market square what be afoot in the top storey over the ironmonger 's a young woman very soberly attire be strain at the double iron-handle of the copying-press some copying-press have a screw so accurately turn and so well oiled and handle so massively like a fly-wheel that a touch will send the handle whiz round and round till they stop suddenly and then one slight wrench more and the letter be duly copy but this be not such a press it have be outwear in mr karkeek 's office rust have intensify its original defect of design and it produce the minimum of result with the maximum of means nevertheless the young woman love it she clench she hand and she tooth and she frown as though she love it and when she have sufficiently crush the letter-book in the press she lovingly unscrew and draw forth the book and with solicitude she open the book on the smaller table and tenderly detach the blotting-paper from the damp tissue paper and at last extract the copy letter and examine its surface smudge she murmur tragic and the excellent ass dayson always facetiously cheerful and without a grain of humor remark : copiousness with the h2o miss lessway be the father of smudged epistle i be ready to go through these proof with you as soon as you be he be over thirty he have have affair with young woman he reckon that there remain little for he to learn he have deliberately watch this young woman at the press he have clearly see she stare under the gas-jet at the copy letter and yet in she fierce muscular movement and in she bending and straightening and in she delicate caressing and in she savage scowling and wrinkling and in she rapt gazing and in all she awful absorption he have quite fail to perceive the terrible eager outpouring of a human soul mighty passionate and wistful he have keep he eye on she slim bust and tight-girded waist that spring suddenly neat and smooth out of the curve skirt-fold and it have not occur to he to exclaim even in he own heart : with you girlishness and you ferocity you intimidating seriousness and you delicious absurdity i would give a week 's wages just to take hold of you and shake you no the dolt have see absolutely naught but a conscientious female beginner learn the duty of the post which he himself have baptize as that of ` editorial secretary ' ii hilda be no longer in a nameless trouble she no longer want she know not what she know beyond all question that she have find that which she have want for nearly a year she have have lesson in phonography from miss dayson 's nephew often as a member of a vary night-class and sometimes alone during the day she could not write shorthand as well as mr dayson and she never would for mr dayson have the shorthand soul but as the result of sustained and terrific effort she could write it pretty well she have grapple with isaac pitman as with apollyon and have not be worst she could scarcely believe that in class she have take down at the rate of ninety word a minute mr dayson 's purposely difficult political speechifying -lrb- which always contain the phrase ` capital punishment ' because ` capital punishment ' be a famous grammalogue -rrb- but it be so mr dayson 's watch prove it about half-way through the period of study she have learn from mr cannon on one of he rare visit to she mother 's something about he long-matured scheme for a new local paper she have at once divine that he mean to offer she some kind of a situation in the enterprise and she be right gratitude fill she mr lessway be one of you happy-go-lucky broad-minded woman with a experimental disposition -- a disposition to let thing alone and see how they will turn out -- have make little objection though she be not encouraging instantly the newspaper have become the chief article of hilda 's faith she accept the idea of it as a nun accept the sacred wafer in ecstasy yet she know little about it she be aware that mr cannon mean to establish it first as a weekly and then when it have grow to transform it into a daily and wage war with that powerful monopolist _ the staffordshire signal _ which from its office at hanbridge cover the entire district the original title have be _ the turnhill guardian and five town general chronicle _ and she have approve it but when mr cannon with a view to the intended development have invert the title to _ the five town chronicle and turnhill guardian _ she have enthusiastically applaud he deep wisdom also she have applaud he project of move later on to hanbridge the natural center of the five town this be nearly the limit of she knowledge she neither know nor care anything about the resource or the politics or the program or the prospects of the paper to she all newspaper be much alike she do not even explore in meditation the extraordinary psychology of mr cannon -- the man whose original energy and restless love of initiative be lead he to find a newspaper on the top of a successful but audaciously irregular practice as a lawyer she incuriously and with religious admiration accept mr cannon as she accept the idea of the paper and being of course entirely ignorant of journalism she be not in a position to criticize the organize arrangement of the newspaper not that these would have seem excessively peculiar to anybody familiar with the haphazard improvisation of minor journalism in the province she have indeed in she innocence imagine that the basic fact of a newspaper enterprise would be a printing-press but when mr dayson who have be on _ the signal _ and on sundry country papers in shropshire assure she that the majority of weekly sheet be print on job press in private hand she correct she foolish notion she sole interest -- but it be tremendous -- lay in what she herself have to do -- namely take down from dictation transcribe copy classify and keep letter and document and occasionally correct proof all beyond this be misty for she and she never adjust she sight in order to pierce the mist save for she desire to perfect herself in she duty she have no desire she be content in the dismal dirty untidy untidiable uncomfortable office arctic near the window and tropic near the stove with dust on she dress and ink on she finger and the fume of gas in she quivering nostril and she mind strain and rack by a exaggerated sense of she responsibility she be in heaven she who so vehemently object to the squalid mess of the business of domesticity revel in the squalid mess of this business she whose heart would revolt because florrie 's work be never do be delighted to wait all hour on the convenience of man who seem to be the very incarnation of incalculable change and caprice and what be she nothing but a clerk at a commence salary of fifteen shilling per week ah but she be a priestess she have a vocation which be unsoiled by the economic excuse she be a pioneer no young woman have ever do what she be do she be the only girl in the five town who know shorthand and in a fortnight -lrb- they say -rrb- the paper be to come out iii at the large table which be laden with prodigious heterogeneous mass of paper and general litter she bent over the proof by mr dayson 's side he have one proof she have a duplicate the copy lay between they it be the rough galley of a circular to the burgess that they be correct together read and explain aloud he inscribe the cabalistic sign of correction in the margin of he proof and she faithfully copy they in the margin of hers for practice lc he intone what do that mean lower case he explain grandiosely in the naïve vanity of he knowledge small letter not a capital thank you she say and write lc note in she strive brain that ` lower case ' mean a small letter instead of a capital but she know not why and she do not ask the reason do not trouble she i think we 'll put ` enlighten ' there before ` public ' ring it will you ring it oh i see yes put a ring round the word in the margin that be to show it be not the intelligent compositor 's mistake you see then there be a familiar and masterful footstep on the stair and the attention of both of they waver iv arthur dayson and he proof-correcting lose all interest and all importance for hilda as mr cannon come into the room the unconscious expressive gesture scornful and abrupt with which she neglect they might have be terribly wound to a young man more sensitive than dayson but dayson in he self-sufficient good-natured mediocrity have the hide of a alligator he even judge she movement quite natural for he be a flunkey bear hilda gaze at she master with anxiety as he deposit he black walking-stick in the corner behind the door and loose he white muffler and large overcoat -lrb- which dayson call a ` immensikoff ' -rrb- she think the master look tired and worried suppose he fall ill at this supreme juncture the whole enterprise would be scotch and not forty dayson could keep it go the master be do too much -- law by day and journalism by night they be perhaps all do too much but the other do not matter nevertheless mr cannon advance to the table buoyant and faintly smile straighten he shoulder back proudly prove to himself and to they that he individual force be inexhaustible that straighten of the shoulder always affect hilda as something wistful as almost pathetic in its confident boyishness it make she feel maternal and say to herself -lrb- but not in word -rrb- with a sort of maternal superiority : how brave he be poor thing yes in she heart she would apply the epithet ` poor thing ' to this grand creature whose superiority she acknowledge with more fervor than anybody as for the undaunted straightening of the shoulder she adopt it and after a time it grow to be a characteristic gesture with she well mr cannon greet they well say arthur dayson with a factitious air of treat he as a equal i have be round to bennion and make it clear to he that if he can not guarantee to run off a maximum of two thousand of a eight-page sheet we shall have to try clayhanger at bursley even if it be the last minute what do he say grunt i shall risk two thousand any way paper deliver governor dayson ask in a low voice leering pawkily as though to indicate that he be a man who could be trust to think of everything will be to-morrow i think say mr cannon get that letter ready miss lessway hilda spring into life yes she say hand it diffidently but if you would like I to do it again -- you see it be -- plethora of h2o dayson put in indulgent oh no mr cannon decide have read the letter he give it to dayson it do not matter but you ought to have sign it before it be copy in the letter-book geminus miss murmured dayson glancing at hilda with uplifted brow the fact be that both of they have forget this formality dayson take a pen and after describe a few flourish in the air about a quarter of a inch above the level of the paper he magnificently sign : dayson & co such be the title of the proprietorship just as karkeek be mr cannon 's dummy in the law so be dayson in the newspaper business but whereas karkeek be privately ashamed dayson be proud of he rôle which give he the illusion of power and glory just take this down will you say mr cannon hilda grasp at she notebook and seize a pencil and then hold herself tense to receive the message stare downward at the blank page dayson loll in he chair throw he head back he know that the presence of himself the great shorthand expert make hilda nervous when she have to write from dictation and this flatter he simple vanity hilda hate and condemn she nervousness but she could not conquer it mr cannon standing over the table push he hat away from he broad shine forehead and then meditative absently lift higher he carefully tend hand and lower the singing gas-jet only to raise it again mr ezra brunt dear sir re advertisement with reference to you letter reply to ours in which you inquire as to the circulation of the above newspaper we beg to state that it be we intention to print four thousand of -- two thousand hilda interrupted confidently unruffled mr cannon go on politely : no -- four thousand of the first number we representative would be please to call upon you by appointment respectfully yours -- you might sign that dayson and get it off to-night be sowter here for answer dayson jerk he head towards a inner door sowter be the old clerk who have first receive hilda into the office of mr q karkeek he be earn a little extra money by clerical work at night in connection with the advertisement department of the new organ mr cannon march to the inner door and open it then he turn and call : dayson -- a moment certainly say dayson jump up he plant he hat doggishly at the back of he head stick he hand into he pocket and swagger after he employer the inner door close on the three man hilda stare at the notebook blushing and nibble at the pencil be leave alone under the gas she could feel she heart beat violently chapter viii janet orgreave i we friend be wait for that letter to brunt say arthur dayson emerge from the inner room a little later in one moment hilda reply coldly though she have not begin to write the letter dayson disappear nod she resent he refer to mr cannon as ` we friend ' but she do not know why unless it be that she vaguely regard it as presumptuous or in the alternative if he mean to be facetious as ill-bred on the part of arthur dayson she choose a sheet of paper and write the letter in longhand as quickly as she could but with arduous care in the formation of every character she write with the whole of she faculty fully apply even in the smallest task she could not economize herself she have to give all or nothing when she come to the figure -- 4000 -- she intensify she ardor lavish enormous unnecessary force : it be like a steamhammer crack a nut she conscience have instantly and finally decide against she but she ignore she conscience she know and own that she be wrong to abet mr cannon 's deception and she abet it she would have abet it if she have believe that the act would involve she in everlasting damnation -- not solely out of loyalty to mr cannon only a little out of loyalty chiefly out of mere unreasoning pride and obstinate adherence to a decision the letter finish she take it into the inner room where the three man sit in mysterious conclave mr cannon read it over and then arthur dayson borrow the old clerk 's vile pen and with the ceremonious delay due to he sense of he own importance flourishingly add the signature when she come forth she hear a knock at the outer door come in she command defiantly for she be still unconsciously in the defiant mood in which she have offer the lie letter to mr cannon ii a well-dressed kind-featured and almost beautiful young woman of about the same age as hilda open the door with a charming gesture of diffidence for a second the two gaze at each other astounded well hilda of all the -- janet it be a old schoolfellow janet orgreave daughter of osmond orgreave a successful architect at bursley janet have pass part of she schoolday at chetwynd 's and with she brother charlie she have also attend sarah gailey 's private dancing-class -lrb- famous throughout turnhill bursley and hanbridge -rrb- at the same time as hilda she be know she be almost notorious as a universal favorite by instinct without take thought she please everybody great and small nature have spoil she endow she with some beauty and undeniable elegance and abundant sincere kindliness she have only to smile and she make a friend it cost she nothing she smile now and produce the illusion not merely in hilda but in herself also that she pleasure in this very astonishing encounter be quite peculiarly poignant they shake hand as woman of the world do you know i be here hilda question characteristically on she guard with a nervous girlish movement of the leg that perhaps sin against the code of authentic worldliness no indeed exclaim janet well i be i be engage here how splendid of you say janet enthusiastically with no suggestion whatever in she tone that hilda 's situation be odd or of dubious propriety or aught but enviable but hilda survey she with secret envy transient yet real in the half-dozen year that have pass since the day of the dancing-class janet have mature she be now the finish product she have the charm of she sex and she depend on it she have grace and a overflow goodness she have a smooth ease of manner she be dignified and with she fur and she expensive veil protect those bright apple-red cheek and all the study minor detail of she costume she be admirably and luxuriously attired she be the usual as distinguish from the unusual woman bring to perfection she represent no revolt against establish custom doubt and longing do not beset she she be content within she sphere : a destine queen of the home and yet she could not be accuse of be old-fashioned none would dare to despise she she be what hilda could never be have never long desire to be she be what hilda have definitely renounce be and there stand hilda immature graceless harsh inelegant dowdy hold the letter between she inky finger in the midst of all that hard masculine mess -- and a part of it the blindly devoted subaltern who could expect none of the ritual of homage give to woman who must sit and work and stand and strain and say ` yes ' and pretend stiffly that she be a sound serviceable thick-skinned imitation man among man if hilda have be a valkyrie or a saint she might have feel no envy and no pang but she be a woman self-pity shot through she tremendous pride and the lancinate stab make she inattentive even to she curiosity concern the purpose of janet 's visit iii i come to see mr cannon say janet the housekeeper downstairs tell I he be here somewhere he be engage answer hilda in a low voice with the devotee 's instinct to surround she superior with mystery oh murmur janet check hilda wonder furiously what she could be want with mr cannon janet recommence : it be really about miss gailey you know yes -- what hilda nod eagerly speak in a tone still lower and more careful janet drop she voice accordingly : she be mr cannon 's sister of course half-sister i mean i have just come away from see she she hesitate i only hear by accident so i come over with father he have to come to a meeting of the guardian here or something they have quarrel have not they who miss gailey and mr cannon well you see she quarrel with every one hilda appear to defend mr

point i have just see she i go on purpose because i would hear but i have to pretend all sort of thing to make a excuse for myself i could not offer she anything could i be not it dreadful they be much worried these two young maid full of health and vigor and faith and pride and simplicity by this startling first glimpse into one of the nether reality of existence and they loyally try to feel more worried than they actually be they do they best out of sympathy to moderate the leap joyous vitality that be in they -- and do not succeed very well they be fine they be touch -- but they be also rather deliciously amusing -- as they concentrate all they resource of solemnity and of worldly experience on the tragic case of the woman whom life have defeat hilda 's memory rush strangely to

she be convince that she never would accept it before depart janet lift she veil with a beautiful gesture and offer she lip to kiss they embrace affectionately the next moment hilda at the top of the dim naked resounding stair be watch janet descend -- a figure infinitely stylish and agreeable to the eye chapter ix in the street i a few minute later just as hilda have seal up the last of the letter mr cannon issue somewhat hurriedly out of the inner room button he overcoat at the neck good night he say and take he stick from the corner where he have place it mr cannon well i want to speak to you what be it i be in a hurry she glance at the inner door which he have leave open from beyond that door come the voice of arthur dayson and the old clerk hilda lack the courage to cross the length of the room and deliberately close it and though mr cannon do not seem inclined to move he eye follow the direction of hers and he must have divine she embarrassment she know not what to do a crisis seem to rise up monstrous between they in a instant she be tremble and in acute trouble it be rather important she say timidly but not without a unintentional violence well to-morrow afternoon he too be apparently in a fractious state the situation be perhaps perilous but she could not allow she conduct to be influence by danger or difficulty which indeed nearly always have the effect of confirm she purpose if something have to be do it have to be do -- and let that suffice he wait impatient for she to agree and allow he to go no she answer with positive resentment in she clear voice i must speak to you to-night it be very important he make with he tongue a inarticulate noise of controlled exasperation if you have finish put you thing on and walk along with I he say she hurry to

pull on she glove i have a appointment at the saracen 's he say mildly mean the saracen 's head -- the central rendezvous of the town where conservative and liberal meet on neutral ground ii he turn to the leave toward the high street and the great clear space out of which the cellarage of the new town hall have already be scoop he carry he thick glove in he white and elegant hand as one who do not feel the frost she step after he they breath whiten the keen air she be extremely afraid and consider herself a abject coward but she be determine to the point of desperation he ought to know the truth and he ought to know it at once : nothing else matter she reflect in she terror : if i do not begin right off he will be ask I to begin and that will be worse than ever she be like one who have boastfully undertake to plunge into deep cold water from a height have climb to the height and measure the fearful distance and be sick and dare not leap but know that he must leap i suppose you know miss gailey be practically starve she say abruptly harshly stare at the gutter she have leap life seem to leave she she have not intend to use such word nor such a tone she certainly do not suppose that he know about miss gailey 's condition she have affirm to janet orgreave she absolute assurance that he do not know as for the tone it be accuse it be brutal it be full of the unconscious and terrible clumsy cruelty of youth what he head move sharply sideways to look at she miss gailey -- she be starve it seem hilda say timidly now almost apologetically i feel sure you do not know i think _ some _ one should tell you what do you mean -- starve he ask gruffly not enough to eat she reply with the direct simplicity of a child and how do this tale get about it be true she say i be tell to-night who tell you a friend of mine -- who be see she but who it would not be right for I to tell you who they walk on in a appalling silence to the corner of the square and the high street here be the letter-box he say stop she drop the letter with nervous haste into the box then she look up at he appealingly in the brightness of the starry night she see that he face have a sardonic meditative smile the middle part of the lower lip be push out while the corner be pull down -- a expression of scornful disgust she burst out : of course i know very well it be not you fault i know if you would _ know _ but what with she never see you and perhaps people not care to -- i be very much oblige to you he interrupt she quietly still meditative he be evidently sincere he attitude be dignified many man would have be ashamed humiliate even though aware of innocence but he contrived to rise above such weakness she be glad she admire he and she be very glad also that he do not deign to asseverate that he have be ignorant of he half-sister 's plight naturally he have be ignorant iii she be suddenly happy she be inspire by a unreasoning joy she be happy because she be so young and fragile and inexperienced and he so much older and more powerful and more capable she be happy because she be a mere girl and he a mature and important male she think they relation in that moment exquisitely beautiful she be happy because she have be exceedingly afraid and the fear have go the dark square and far-stretching street lay placid and void under the night surround they silence in a larger silence : and because of that also she be happy a policeman with he arm hide under he cloak march unhasting downward from the direction of the bank fine night officer say mr cannon cordially yes sir good night sir the policeman respond with respect and sturdy self-respect he footstep ring onward and the sight and bearing of this hardy frost-defying policeman watch over the town and the greeting between he and mr cannon -- these too seem strangely beautiful to hilda and then a train reverberate along its embankment in the distance and the glide procession of yellow window be divide at regular interval by the black silhouette of the scaffolding-pole of the new town hall beautiful she be fill with a delicious sadness it be janet 's train in some first-class compartment janet and she father be shut together side by side intimate mutually understand again a beautiful relation from the summit of a high kiln in the middle distance flame shoot intermittently forth formidable crockery be be fire in the night : and unseen the fireman somewhere flit about the mouth of the kiln and here and there in the dim face of the street a window shine golden there be live people behind the blind it be all beautiful joy-giving the thought of she mother fidget for she return home be delightful the thought of mr cannon and miss gailey separate during many year and now destine to some kind of reconciliation be indescribably touching and beautiful in a way that she could not define i be only think the other day say mr cannon treat she as a equal in year and wisdom -- i be only think i would get the very thing for my half-sister -- the very open for she -- a chance in a thousand if only she have it be unnecessary for he to finish the sentence and be it too late now hilda ask eagerly no he say it be not too late i shall go round and see she to-morrow morning first thing it would not do for I to go to-night -- you see -- might seem too odd yes hilda murmur well good night they separate she know that he be profoundly stir nevertheless he have inquire for no further detail concern miss gailey he be too proud and beneath he inflexibility too sensitive to do so he mean to discover the truth for himself he have believe -- that be the essential he behavior have be superb the lie letter to ezra brunt be a mere peccadillo even if it be that even if it be not actually virtuous she walk off rapidly try to imitate the fine free calmly defiant bearing of mr cannon and the policeman iv florrie go to bed she ask briskly of she mother who be fuss about she in the parlor pretend to be fretful but secretly enchant to welcome she with a warm fire and plenteous food back again into the house and hilda too be enchant at she reception florrie go to bed i should just think florrie have go to bed half-past ten and after eh my this go out after tea i never hear of such doings now do warm you foot i should have be home sooner only something happen say hilda oh mrs lessways exclaim indifferently she have in fact no curiosity as to the affair of dayson and company the sole thing that interest she be hilda 's daily absence and daily return she seem quite content to remain in ignorance of what hilda do in the mysterious office she conversation profuse when she be in good spirit rarely go beyond the trifling separate event of existence personal and domestic -- the life of the house hour by hour and minute by minute it be often astounding to hilda that she mother never show any sign of be weary of these topic nor any desire to discover other topic yes say hilda miss gailey -- mr lessway become instantly a different creature and do he know she ask blankly when hilda have inform she of janet 's visit and news yes i tell he -- of course you well somebody have to tell he say hilda with a affectation of carelessness so i tell he myself and how do he take it well how should he take it hilda retort largely he _ have _ to take it he be much oblige and he say so mrs lessway begin to weep what ever be the matter i be only thinking of poor sarah mr lessway answer the imply rebuke of hilda 's brusque question i shall go and see she to-morrow morning but mother do not you think you would better wait mr lessway speak up resolutely : i shall go and see sarah gailey to-morrow morning and let that be understand i do not need my daughter to teach I when i ought to go and see my friend and when i ought not i know sarah gailey before you mr cannon be bear oh very well very well hilda soothe she lightly i shall tell sarah gailey she be get to reckon with I whether she want to or not that be what i shall tell sarah gailey mr lessway wipe she eye mother hilda ask when they have go upstairs do you wind the clock i do not think i do answer the culprit uncertainly from she bedroom door mother how tiresome you be night before last you would not let I touch it you say you prefer to do it yourself and now i shall be wait for it to strike to-morrow morning to get up -- lend I that candle do she trip down to the lobby gladly and open the big door of the clock and put she hand into the dark cavity and grimace haul up the heavy weight this forgetfulness of she mother 's somehow increase she extraordinary satisfaction with life she remount the shadowy stair on the wing of a pure and ingenuous elation chapter x miss gailey in declension i know whom she be to meet hilda come home to tea on the next day but one with a demeanor whose characteristic be heighten by nervousness the weather be still colder and she have tie the broad ribbon of she small bonnet rather closely under she chin the double bow a little to the leave a knit bodice over the dress and under the jacket make the latter tighter than usual so that the fur edge of it curve away somewhat between the button and all the upper part of the figure seem to be too strictly confine while the petticoat surge out freely beneath a muff brightly color to match the skirt and the bonnet and she cheek complete the costume she go into the house through the garden and delicately stamp she foot on the lobby tile partly to warm they and shake off a few bit of snow and partly to announce clearly she arrival then just as she be hand in muff she enter the parlor she be tingle with keen rosy life and with the sense of youthful power she have the deep unconscious conviction of the superiority of youth to age and there be the two older woman wait for she as it be on the defensive and as nervous as she good afternoon miss gailey she say with a kind and even very cordial smile and heartily shake the flaccid rheumatic hand that be primly hold out to she and yet in spite of herself perhaps unknown to herself there be in she tone and she smile and she vigorous clasp something which mean poor old thing pityingly indulgently scornfully she have not speak to miss gailey and she have scarcely see she since the day of the dancing-class a woman who be in process of lose everything but she pride can disappear from view as easily in a small town as in a great city she acquaintance will say to each other i have not meet so-and-so lately i wonder and curiosity will go no further and in a short time she invisibility will cease to excite any remark except she keep herself to herself nowadays to hilda miss gailey appear no older she brown hair have very little gray in it and she skin be fairly smooth and well-preserved but she seem curiously smaller and less significant this woman who with a certain pedagogic air use to instruct girl in grace and boy in gallantry this woman who be regard by all she pupil as the authoritative source of correctness and ease in deportment now master charle hilda could remember she say will you ask I for the next polka all over again and try not to look as if you be do I a favor and be rather ashamed of yourself she have a tongue for the sneaping of too casual boy and girl also and she speak so correctly as correctly as she perform the figure of a dance hilda who also speak without the local peculiarity have be deprive of she five town accent at chetwynd 's school where the purest kensingtonian be inculcate but miss gailey have lose hers in kensington itself -- so rumor say -- many year before and now in she declension she be still perfect of speech but the authority and the importance be go in substance : only the shadow of they remain she have now indeed a manner half apologetic and half defiant but timorously and weakly defiant she head be restless with little nervous movement she watery eye seem to say : do not suppose that i be not as proud and independent as ever i be because i _ be _ look at my silk dress and my polished boot and my smooth hair and my hand can anyone find any trace of shabbiness in _ I _ but beneath all this desperate bravery be the wistful acknowledgment continually-peeping out that she have after all come down in the world albeit with a special personal dignity that none save she could have keep ii the two woman be seat at a splendid fire hilda whose nervousness be quickly vanish come between they to warm she hand that be shine with cold despite muff and glove here mother she say teasingly put the muff and glove in she mother 's lap sarah gailey rise with slow stiffness from she chair now do not let this child disturb you sarah mr lessway protest oh no caroline say miss gailey composedly i be only get my apron from a reticule on the table she draw forth a small black satin apron on which be embroider in filoselle a spray of moss-rose it be extremely elegant -- much more so than mr lessway ' -- though not in quite the latest style of fashionable apron not be edible it have probably be long preserve in a wardrobe on the chance of just such a occasion as this she adjust the elastic round she thin waist and sit down again the apron be a sign that she have come definitely to spend the whole evening it be a proof of the completeness of the reconciliation between the former friend as the conversation shift from the immediate topic of the weather to the great general question of cure for chilblain hilda wonder what have pass between she mother and miss gailey and whether she mother have overcome by mere breezy force or by guile : which detail she never learn for mr lessway be very loyal to she former crony and moreover she have necessarily to support the honor of the older generation against the younger it seem incredible to hilda that this woman who sit with such dignity and such gentility by she mother 's fire be she who the day before yesterday have be starve in the pride-imposed prison of she own house could miss gailey have know that hilda know but hilda know that miss gailey know that she know -- and that other guess such however be the sublime force of convention that the universal pretence of ignorance securely triumph then florrie -- change grown budded practice in the technicality of parlor but timid because of company -- come in to set the tea and miss gailey inspect she with the calm and omniscient detachment of a deity and say to caroline when she be go that florrie seem a promising little thing -- with the ` makings of a good servant ' in she afterwards the mistress recount this judgment to florrie who be thereby apparently much impressed and encouraged in well-doing iii and so you be think of go to london miss gailey say hilda during tea the meal be progress satisfactorily though caroline could not persuade sarah to eat enough miss gailey flush slightly with the characteristic nervous movement of the head evidently she sensitiveness be extreme and what do you know about it you inquisitive little puss mr lessway intervene hastily though it be she who have inform hilda of the vague project somehow in presence of she old friend mr lessway seem to feel herself under a obligation to play the assertive and crush mother have mr cannon mention it say miss gailey politely miss gailey at any rate recognize in the most scrupulous way that hilda be a adult and no longer a foal-legged pupil for dance well he seem so set on it he come round to see I about it yesterday morning without any warning and he be full of it i tell you how full he be of it do not i caroline you know how he be when anything take he do i know how he be murmured caroline arch she eyebrow she speak much more broadly than either of the other miss gailey continue to hilda with seriousness : it be a boarding-house that he be get control of up there something about a bill of sale on the furniture i think but perhaps you know no i do not say hilda oh say miss gailey relieved well anyhow he be bent on I take charge of this boarding-house he will have it it be just the thing for I but -- but i do not know she finish weakly everyone know you be a splendid housekeeper say mr lessway always be i remember the refreshment at you annual dance say hilda politely enthusiastic i always attend to those myself miss gailey judicially observe i do not know anything about refreshment at dance say mr lessway but i do know what you housekeeping be sarah well that be what george say sarah simper he say he never have such meal and such attention as that year he live with I i be sure he be be sorry many a time he ever leave you exclaim caroline many and many a time oh well relative you know sarah murmured vaguely this be the only reference to the estrangement she go on with more vivacity and then mr cannon have always have idea about boarding-house and furnished room and so on he always do say there be lot of money to be make out of they if only they be manage properly only they never be he ought to know he be be a bachelor long enough and he be try enough of they he say he be not at all comfortable where he be she add as it be aside to caroline it be some people who use to let lodgings to theater people at hanbridge oh _ they _ cry caroline the talk meander into a maze of reminiscence and hilda have to realize she youthfulness and the very inferior range of she experience : sarah and caroline recall to each other dozen of person and event open up historical vista in a manner that fill the young girl with envious respect in spite of herself do you remember hanbridge theater be build sarah question caroline my grandfather -- hilda 's great-grandfather -- tender for it -- not that he get the job -- but he be very old do he now no i do not but i dare say i be in london then i dare say that would be it yes say sarah turn to hilda once more that be just what mr cannon say he say it be not as if i do not know what london be but it be such a long time ago she glance at caroline as if for sympathy come come sarah caroline protest stoutly and yet with a care for sarah 's sensitiveness it be not so long ago as all that it seem so long say sarah reflective and she mouth work uneasily then after a pause : he be so set on it set on what on you go to london yes and why not well i do not know whether i could -- paw scoff caroline lightly and flatteringly you be younger than i be and i be not go to have anyone make out that i be get old now do finish that bit of cake no thank you caroline i really could not not but what i should be sorry enough to lose you caroline conclude there be no friend like the old friend ah no sarah thickly mutter gaze with she watery eye at a spot on the white diaper hilda do turn down that there gas a bit say mr lessway sharply and self-consciously it be fizzing and she change the subject iv with a nervous exaggeration of solicitude hilda spring to the gas-jet suddenly she be drench in the most desolating sadness she could not bear to look at miss gailey and further miss gailey seem unreal to she not a actual woman but a abstract figure of sorrow that fancy have create a few minute previously hilda have be take pride in the tact and the enterprise of george cannon who possess a mysterious gift of find a opportunity for everybody who need it he have set hilda on she foot and he be do the same for he half-sister and with such skilful diplomacy that miss gailey be able to pretend to herself and to other that george cannon and not sarah gailey be the oblige person but now hilda saw sarah gailey afraid to go to london and george cannon push she forward with all the ruthless strength of he enterprising spirit and the sight be extraordinarily incomprehensibly tragic sarah gailey 's timorous glance seem to be say : i be terrify to go it be not beyond my strength -- it be beyond my spirit but i shall have to go and i shall have to seem glad to go and nobody can save I and miss gailey 's excellent silk dress and she fine apron and she primness and dignified manners and she superb pretence of be undamaged strike hilda as intolerably pathetic -- so that she be oblige to look away lest she might weep at the sight of that pathos yes it be a fact that she could not bear to look nor could she bear to let she imagination roam into miss gailey 's immediate past she say to herself : only yesterday morning perhaps she do not know where she next meal be come from he must have manage somehow to give she some money only yesterday morning perhaps she do not know where she next meal -- if i say that to myself once more i shall burst out cry she balance she spoon on she teacup and let it fall now miss fidgety she mother comment with good humor and then they all hear a knock at the front door will florrie have hear it mrs lessway ask nervously what she mean be : who on earth can this be but such question can not be put in the presence of a newly reconcile old friend it be necessary to behave as though knock at the front door be a regular accompaniment of tea chapter xi disillusion i the entrance of george cannon into the parlor produce a tumult greatly stimulate the vitality and the self-consciousness of all three woman sarah gailey 's excitement be express in flushing and in characteristic small futile movement of the head and hand and in monosyllable that convey naught except a vague but keen apprehension mr lessway be perturb and somewhat apprehensive also but she be flattered and pleased hilda be frankly suspicious during the first moment she guess that mr cannon be aware of he sister 's visit and that he have come to further he own purpose he confirm she idea by greet he sister without apparent surprise but as in response to mr lessway ' insistence he take off he great overcoat with those large powerful gesture which impress susceptible woman and give pleasure even to the indifferent he say casually to sarah gailey i do not expect to meet you here sally i have come to have a private word with mr lessway about put one of she calder street tenant on to the pavement sarah laugh nervously and say that she would retire and mr lessway say that sarah would do no such thing and that she be very welcome to hear all that mr cannon might have to say concern the calder street property in a minute mr cannon be resplendently sit down to the table with they and rub he friendly hand and admit that he should not refuse a cup of tea if press and hilda receive she mother 's sharp instruction to get a cup and saucer from the sideboard and a spoon from the drawer she bear these to the table like a handmaid but like a delicate and superior handmaid and it please she to constitute herself a delicate and superior handmaid mr cannon sit next to she mother and hilda put down the tinkle cup and saucer on the white cloth between they and as she do so mr cannon turn and thank she with a confidential smile to which she respond they be not now employer and employee but exclusively in the social world nevertheless they business relation make a intimacy which it be piquant to feel in the home moreover sarah gailey be opposite to they and hilda could not keep out of she dark eye the intelligence : if she be here if you be all amicable together it be due to I delicious and somehow perilous secret go back to she seat she arrange more safely the vast overcoat which he have throw carelessly down on she mother 's rock - chair it be inordinately heavy and would have outweigh a dozen of she skimpy little jacket she who would have be lose in it like a cat in a rug enjoy the thought of the force of the creature capable of wear it lightly for a garment withal the rough soft surface of it be agreeable to the hand out of one of the immense pocket hang the end of a color silk muffler filmy as anything that she herself wear then they be all definitely seat and mr cannon accept he tea from the hand of mr lessway the whiteness of he linen the new smartness of he suit the elegance and gallantry of he gesture -- these phenomenon incite the woman to a responsive emulation they be something which it be a feminine duty to live up to archness reign especially between the hostess and the caller hilda answer to the mood and sarah gailey though she say little and never finish a sentence do she best to answer to it by nodding and nervous appreciative smile and swift turning of the head from one to another when mr cannon and mr lessway in half a dozen serious word interject among the archness have adversely settle the fate of a whole family in calder street there remain scarcely a trace in the company 's demeanor of the shame consciousness that only two day before its member have be divide by disastrous enmity and that one of they have lack the means of life ii oh no my dear girl you be too modest -- that be what be the matter with you say george cannon eagerly to he half-sister the epithet flattered but do not allay she timidity to hilda it seem mysteriously romantic the supreme topic have work its way into the conversation uppermost in the mind of all it seem to have force itself out by its own intrinsic energy against the will of the company impossible to decide who first have let it forth but george cannon have now fairly seize it and run off with it he be almost boyishly excite over it the latin strain in he animated he feature and he speech he be a poet as he talk of the boarding-house that await a mistress he have pull out of he pocket the cutting of a advertisement of it from the london _ daily telegraph _ a paper that be never see in turnhill and this bit of paper describe in four line the advantage of the boarding-house have the effect of give the actual house a symbolic reality there it be he exclaim slapping down the paper and there it appear really to be the bit of paper be extraordinarily persuasive it compel everybody to realize now for the first time that the house do in fact exist george cannon have a overwhelming answer to all timorous objection the boarding-house be remunerative boarder be at that very moment in it the nominal proprietor be not leave it because he be lose money on the boarding-house but because he have lose money in another enterprise quite foreign to it and have pledge all the contents of the boarding-house as security the occasion be one in a thousand one in a million he george cannon through a client have the entire marvellous affair between he finger and thumb and most obviously sarah gailey be the woman of all woman for the vacant post at he disposition chance be wait on she she have nothing whatever to do but walk into the house as a regent into a kingdom and rule only delay be impossible all be possible except delay she would inevitably succeed she could not fail and it would be a family affair tea be finish and forget for you own sake he wind up a peroration it really do not matter to I do not you agree with I mrs lessways he glance be a homage oh you exclaim mr lessway smile happily you have only get to open you mouth and you would talk anybody into the middle of next week mother hilda mildly reprove she be convince now that mr cannon have come on purpose to clinch the affair he laugh appreciatively but really seriously he insist and mr lessway straighten she face say with slight self-consciousness : oh _ i _ think it be worth while consider there you be cry mr cannon to miss gailey i shall be all alone up there say miss gailey as cheerfully as she could i 'll go up with you and see you into the place i should have to come back the same night -- i be so tremendously busy just now -- what with the paper and so on yes but -- i quite admit all you say george -- but -- here 's another idea he break out why do not you ask mr lessway to go up with you and stay a week or two it would be a rare change for she and company for you miss gailey look quickly at she old friend oh bless you say mr lessway i have only be to london once and that be only for two day -- before hilda be bear i should be no use in london at my time of life i be one of you home-stayer nevertheless it be plain that the notion appeal to she fancy and that she would enjoy flirt with it nonsense mr lessway say george cannon it would do you a world of good and it would make all the difference to sally that it would sarah agree still question caroline with she watery appealing eye in caroline sarah see she salvation and snatch at it caroline could no nothing well she have no excellence all that caroline could do sarah could do better and yet caroline by the mysterious virtue of she dry and yet genial shrewdness and of the unstable but reliable equilibrium of she temperament be the skilled sarah 's superior they both know it and feel it the lofty hilda admit it caroline herself negligently admit it by a peculiar brusque unaffected geniality of condescension towards sarah do go mother say hilda to herself she have be say : another of he wonderful idea the prospect of be alone in the house with florrie of be free for a space to live she own life untrammelled and throw all she ardor into she work be inexpressibly attractive to hilda it promise the most delicious experience that she have ever have yes retort mr lessway and leave you here by yourself a nice thing i shall be all right say hilda confidently and joyously she be sure that the excursion to london have appeal to she mother 's latent love of the unexpected and that she faculty for accept placidly whatever fate offer would prevent she from resist the pressure that sarah gailey and mr cannon would obviously exert shall you mr lessway mutter why not take you daughter with you too mr cannon suggest oh cry hilda shocked i could not possibly leave my work just now the paper just come out you could not spare I she speak with pride use phrase similar to those which he have use to explain to sarah gailey why he could not remain with she in london even for a night oh yes i could he answer kindly lightly carelessly shatter -- in he preoccupation with one idea -- all she fine loyal pretension we should manage all right iii she be hurt she be mortally pierce the blow be too cruel she lower she glance before he and fix it on the table-cloth she brow darken she lower lip bulge out she be the child again he have with atrocious inhumanity reduce she to the unimportance of a child she have bestow on he and he interest the gift of she whole soul and he have say that it be negligible and the worst be that he be perfectly unaware of what he have do he have not even observe the symptom of she face he have turn at once to the older woman and be continue the conversation he have ride over she and ridden on without a look behind the conversation move after a pause back to the plausible excuse for he call he desire to see some old rent-book which would show how the doomed tenant in calder street have originally fall into arrears where be that old book of mr skellorn 's hilda she mother ask she could not speak the sob be at she throat if she have speak it would have burst through and she would have be not merely the child but the disgraced child hilda repeat she mother she singular silence draw the attention of all she blush a sombre scarlet no she could not speak she curse herself what a little fool i be surely i can useless she could not speak she take the one desperate course open to she and run out of the room to the astonishment of three puzzle and rather frightened adult she shame be now notorious baby great baby she gnash at she own inconceivable silliness have she no pride and now she be in the gloom of the lobby and she could hear florrie in the kitchen softly whistle she be out in the dark lobby exactly like a foolish passionate child she know all the time that she could easily persuade she mother to leave she alone with florrie in the house she have lever to move she mother but of what use now to do that chapter xii the telegram i it be the end of February 1880 a day resemble spring have come illusive but exquisite hilda have start out too hurriedly for the office after the midday dinner have have to return home for a proof which she have forget she now have the house to herself as a kingdom over which she reign for amid all she humiliation and pensive dejection she have be able to exert sufficient harsh force to drive she mother to london in company with miss gailey she be alone free and she taste she freedom to the point of ecstasy she con correct proof at she meal : this be life when florrie come in with another dish hilda look up impatiently from print matter as if disturb out of a dream and florrie put on a apologetic air to invoke pardon it be largely pretence on hilda 's part but it be life then she have the delicious anxiety of be responsible for florrie now florrie i be go out to-night to see miss orgreave at bleakridge i shall rely on you to go to bed not later than nine i have get the key _ i may not be back till the last train _ yes miss and what with hilda 's solemnity and florrie 's impressed eye the ten-forty-five be transform into a train that circulate in the dark and mysterious hour just before cockcrow hilda alone be always appeal to florrie 's loyalty sometimes when discreetly abolish some old-fashioned work-increasing method of she mother 's she would speak to florrie in a tone of sudden transient intimacy raise she for a moment to the rank of a intellectual equal as she voice hint that she mother after all belong to the effete generation awkwardly with she gloved hand turn over the page of a book in which the slip-proof have be carelessly leave hidden hilda from she bedroom hear florrie come whistle down the attic stair florrie have certainly hear nothing of she young mistress since the door-bang which have signal she departure for the office in the delusion that she be utterly solitary in the house florrie be whistle not at all like a modest young woman but like a carter hilda know that she could whistle and have several time indicate to she indirectly that whistle be undesirable but she have never hear she whistling as she whistle now she first impulse be to rush out of the bedroom and ` catch ' florrie and make she look foolish but a sense of honor restrain she from a triumph so mean and she keep perfectly still she hear florrie run into she mother 's bedroom and then she hear that voice usually so timid say loudly exultantly and even coarsely : oh how beautiful i be how beautiful i be sha not i just mash the man sha not i just mash 'em this new and vulgar word ` mash ' offend hilda ii she creep noiselessly to the door which be ajar and look forth like a thief the door of she mother 's room be wide open and across the landing she could see florrie posturing in front of the large mirror of the wardrobe the sight shock she in a most peculiar manner it be florrie 's afternoon out and the child be wear for the first time a old brown skirt that hilda have abandon to she but in this long skirt she be no more a child although scarcely yet fifteen year old she be a grown woman she have astoundingly develop during she service with mr lessway she be scarcely less tall than hilda and she possess a sturdy round figure which put hilda 's to shame it be uncanny -- the precocity of the child of the poor it be disturb on a chair lay florrie 's new ` serviceable ' cloak and a cheap but sound bonnet : both article the fruit of a special journey with she aunt to baine 's drapery shop at bursley where there be a small special sober department for servant who be wise enough not to yield to the temptation of ` finery ' florrie who at thirteen and a half have never be able to rattle one penny against another have since then earn some two thousand five hundred penny and have clothe herself and put money aside and also pour a shower of silver upon she clamorous family amazing feat amazing growth she seize the ` good ' warm cloak and hide she poor old bodice beneath it and draw out she thick pig-tail and shake it into position with a free gesture of the head and on the head she poise the bonnet and tie the ribbon under the delightful chin and then after a moment of hard scrutiny dance and whistle and cry again : how beautiful i be how pretty i be she be she positively do not look a bit like a drudge she be not the florrie of the kitchen and of the sack-apron but a young fledged creature with burst bosom who could trouble any man by the capricious modesty of a gaze downcast the miraculous skirt odious on hilda have the brightness of a new skirt she hand and arm be red and chapped but she face have bloom perfect in the kitchen like a flower in a marl-pit it be a face that a ambitious girl could rely on its charm and the fluid charm of she movement atone a thousand time for all she barbaric ignorance and crudity the grime on she neck be naught hilda watch intensely ashamed of this spy but she could not bring herself to withdraw she be angry with florrie she be outraged then she think : why should i be angry the fact be i be be mother all over again after all why should not florrie and she be a little jealous of florrie and a little envious of she because florrie have the naturalness of a savage or of a animal unsophisticated by ideal of primness hilda be disconcert at the discovery of florrie as a authentic young woman florrie more than seven year she junior she feel experienced and indulgent as the old be indulgent for the first time in she life she do honestly feel old and she ask herself -- half in dismay : florrie have get thus far where be _ i _ what be _ i _ do it be upset at length florrie take off the bonnet and run upstairs and shut the door of she attic apparently she mean to improve the bonnet by some touch after wait nervously a few moment the aged hilda slip silently downstairs and through the kitchen and so by the garden where with they foot in mire the hare tree be give sign of hope under the soft blue sky into the street florrie would never know that she have be watch iii ten minute later when she go into the office of dayson & co hilda be younger than ever it be a young fragile girl despite the dark frown of she intense seriousness who with accustomed gesture poke the stove and hang bonnet and jacket on a nail and then sit down to the loaded desk it be a ingenuous girl absurdly but fiercely anxious to shoulder the world 's weight she have pass a whole night in revolt against george cannon 's indignity she have call it furiously a insult she have say to herself : well if i be so useless as all that i 'll never go near he office again but the next afternoon she have appear as usual at the office meek modest with a smile fatigue and exquisitely resign and a soft voice and she have work with even increase energy and devotion this kissing of the rod this irrational instinctive humility be a strange and sweet experience for she such be the hilda of the office but hilda at home cantankerous obstinate and rude have offer a remarkable contrast to she until the moment when it be decide that she mother should accompany miss gailey to london from that moment hilda at home have be a angel and the hilda of the office have show some return of sturdy pride to-day the first number of _ the five town chronicle _ be to go to press the delay have be inexplicable and exasperating to hilda though she have not criticize they even to herself they be now over the town have no air of be excite about the appearance of its new paper but the office be excite the very room itself look feverish it be change more table have be bring into it and papers and litter have accumulate enormously it be a room humanize by habitation with a physiognomy that be individual and sympathetic from beyond the closed door of the inner room come the sound of man 's rapid voice hilda could distinguish mr cannon 's and arthur dayson 's there be a third unfamiliar to she have nothing to do she begin to make work rearrange the contents of she table finger with a factitious hurry the thick bundle of proof of correspondence from the village -lrb- so energetically organize by the great dayson -rrb- and the now useless ` copy ' and the innumerable letter that dayson be always disturbing and the sample of encaustic tile bring in by a inventor who desire the powerful aid of the press and the catalogue and dayson 's cutting from the manchester birmingham and london papers and the notepaper and envelope and card and veale chifferiel & co 's almanac that have somehow come up with other matter from mr karkeek 's office below and then she dust with pursed lip that blame the disgraceful and yet excusable untidiness of man and then she examine with despair and with pride she dirty little hand whose finger-tip all cluster together -lrb- they be now like the hand of a nice careless schoolboy -rrb- and lightly dust one against the other then she find a galley-proof under the table it be a duplicate proof of _ the five town chronicle 's _ lead article dictate to she by a prodigious arthur dayson in mr cannon 's presence on the previous day and deal faithfully with the calder street scandal and with mr enville a member of the local board -- implicate in the say scandal the proof be useless now for the leader-page be make up nevertheless hilda carefully classify it in case iv on a chair be _ the daily telegraph _ which dayson have evidently be read for it be blue pencil hilda too must read it she duty be to read it : dayson have tell she that she ought never to neglect the chance of read any newspaper whatever and that a young woman in she responsible situation could not possibly know too much which advice though it come from a person ridiculous to she seem sound enough and be in fact rather flattering in the _ telegraph _ she see between dayson 's blue line a account of a terrible military disaster she be move by it in different way it produce in she a grievous horror - strike desolation but it also give she a extraordinary sensation of fervid pleasure it be a item of news that would have to appear in the _ chronicle _ and this would mean change in the make-up and work at express speed and similar delight already the paper be suppose to be on the machine though in fact as she well know it be not no doubt the subject of discussion in the inner room be the disaster yes she be acutely and happily excited and always afterwards when she hear or see the sinister word ` majuba ' -lrb- whose political association never in the least interested she -rrb- she would recall she contradictory delicious feeling on that dramatic afternoon while she be busily cut out the news from the _ telegraph _ to be ready for arthur dayson there be a very timid knock at the door and florrie enter as into some formidable cabinet of tyrannic ruler if you please miss -- she begin to whisper why florrie hilda exclaim what have you put that old skirt on for when i have give you mine i tell you -- i do put it on miss but there come a telegram i tell the boy you be here but he say that be not no affair of he so i bring it myself and i think you would not care for to see I in you skirt miss not while on duty miss ` specially here like so i up quick and change it back telegram hilda repeat the word florrie breathless after run and all this whisper advance in the prettiest confusion towards the throne and hilda take the telegram with a gesture as casual as she could manage florrie 's abashed mien and the arrival of the telegram stiffen she back and steady she hand imagine that infant be afraid of she hilda this too be life and the murmur of the man in the inner room be thrill to hilda 's ear she brusquely open the telegram and read : lessway lessway street turnhill mother ill can you come -- gailey chapter xiii hilda 's world i the conversation in the inner room promise to be interminable hilda could not decide what to do she feel no real alarm on she mother 's account mr lessway often slightly indispose be never seriously ill she possess one of those constitution which do not go to extreme of disease if a malady overtake she she invariably ` have ' it in a mild form doubtless sarah gailey preoccupy and worry by new responsibility desire to avoid the add care of nurse the sick hence the telegram moreover if the case have be grave she would not have put the telegram in the interrogative she would have write ` please come at once ' no hilda be not unduly disturbed nevertheless she have a odd idea that she ought to rush to the station and catch the next train which leave knype at five minute to four this idea do not spring from she own conscience but rather from the old-fashioned collective family conscience but at a quarter to four when it be already too late to catch the local train at turnhill the man have not emerge from the inner room nor have hilda come to any decision as the departure of she mother and miss gailey have involve much solemn poring over time-table it happen that she know the time of all the train to london to catch the next and last she would have to leave turnhill at _ 555 _ she say that she would wait and see she work for the first number of the paper be practically do but there be this mysterious conclave which fret she curiosity and threaten exciting development also the majuba disaster would mean trouble for somebody and in any event she hate the very think of quit turnhill before the _ chronicle _ be definitely out she have live for the moment of its publication and she could not bear to miss it she be almost angry with she mother she be certainly angry with miss gailey all the egotism of the devotee in she be arouse and irate then the man come forth from the inner room with a rather unexpected suddenness mr cannon appear first and after he mr enville lastly arthur dayson papers in hand intimidate by the presence of the stranger hilda affect to be busy at she table mr enville shake hand very amicably with george cannon and instantly depart as he pass down the stair she catch sight of he he be a grizzled man of fifty lean and shabby despite he reputation for riches she know that he be a candidate for the supreme position of chief bailiff at the end of the year and he do not accord with she spectacular ideal of a chief bailiff the actual chief bailiff be a beautiful and picturesque old man with perfectly tend white whisker and always a flower in he coat further she could not reconcile this nearly effusive friendliness between mr enville and mr cannon with the animadversion of the leading article which arthur dayson have compose and mr cannon have approve only twenty-four hour earlier as mr cannon shut the door at the head of the stair she see he give a discreet disdainful wink to dayson then he turn sharply to hilda and say thoughtful and stern : you notebook please brace herself and still full of pride in she ability to write this mysterious shorthand she open she notebook and wait with poise pencil the mien of the two man have communicate to she a excitement far surpass they own in degree and in felicity the whole of she vital force be concentrate at the point of she pencil and she seem to be say to herself : i be very sorry mother but see how important this be i shall consider what i can do for you the very moment i be free arthur dayson cough and plump heavily on a chair ii it be in such moment as this that dayson really live with all the force of he mediocrity george cannon be not a journalist he could compose a letter but he have not the trick of compose a article he feel indeed a negligent disdain for the people who possess this trick as for performer in a circus he certainly do not envy they for he know that he could buy they as a carpenter buy tool he attitude be that of the genuine bourgeois towards the artist : possessive incurious and contemptuous dayson however ignore george cannon 's attitude perhaps do not even perceive what it be he glory in he performance accustom to dictate extempore speech on any subject whatever to he shorthand pupil he be quite at he ease quite master of he faculty and self-satisfaction seem to stand out on he brow like genial sweat while the banal phrase pour glibly from the cavern behind he jagged tooth and each phrase be a perfect model of provincial journalese george cannon have to sit and listen -- to approve or at worst to make tentative suggestion the first phrase which penetrate through the outer brain of the shorthand writer to the secret fastness where hilda sit in judgment on the world be this : the campaign of vulgar vilification inaugurate yesterday by we contemporary _ the staffordshire signal _ against we esteem fellow-townsman mr richard enville this phrase come soon after such phrase as we first bow to the public we solemn and bounden duty to the district which it be we highest ambition to serve etc phrase which have already occur in the leading article dictate on the previous day hilda soon comprehend that in twenty-four hour mr enville from be a unscrupulous speculator who have use he official position to make illicit profit out of the sale of land to the town for town improvement have become the very mirror of honesty and high fidelity to the noblest tradition of local government without understand the situation and before even she have formulate to herself any criticism of the person concern she feel suddenly sick she dare not look at george cannon but once when she raise she head to await the flow of a period that have be arrest at a laudatory superlative she catch dayson wink coarsely at he she hate dayson for that george cannon might wink at dayson -lrb- though she regret the condescending familiarity -rrb- but dayson have no right to presume to wink at george cannon she hope that mr cannon have silently snub he as the article proceed there arise a cry from the square below a _ signal _ boy one of the earliest to break the silent habit of the square be bawl a fresh edition of arthur dayson 's contemporary and across the web of the dictator 's verbiage she could hear the word : south africa -- detail -- mr cannon glance at he watch impatiently hilda could see under she bent and frown brow he white hand move on the dark expanse of he waistcoat immediately afterwards mr cannon interrupt say : that 'll be all right finish it i must be off right you be say dayson grandly i 'll run down with it to the printer 's myself -- soon as it be copy mr cannon nod and tell he we have get to be on the railway bookstall first thing to-morrow morning he 'll never do it he must do it i do not care if he work all night but -- there have not get to be any ` but ' dayson there be be a damned sight too much delay as it be all right all right dayson placate he hastily mr cannon depart it seem to hilda that she shiver but whether with pain or pleasure she know not never before have mr cannon swear in she presence all day he manner have be peculiar as though the strain of mysterious anxiety be change he spirit and now he be go and she have say naught to he about the telegram from miss gailey arthur dayson roll oratorically on in defense of the man whom yesterday he have attack and then sowter the old clerk enter what be it do not interrupt I snapped dayson there be the _ signal _ latest detail this here majuba business what do i care about you majuba dayson retort i have get something more important than you majuba it be the governor as tell I to give it you say sowter restive well give it I then and do not waste my time dayson hold out a imperial hand for the sheet he look at hilda as if for moral support and add to she in a martyred tone : i suppose i shall have to dash off a few line about sowter 's majuba while you be copy out my article and the governor say to remind you that mr enville want a proof of he advertisement sowter call out sulkily as he be disappear down the stair hilda blush as she have blush in write george cannon 's first lie about the printing of the first issue she have accustom herself to lie and really without any difficulty or hesitation yes she have even reach the level of be religiously proud of they but now she bully and crush conscience leap up again and in the swift alarm of the shock she heart be once more violently beat yet amid the wild confusion of she feeling a mechanical intelligence guide she hand to follow arthur dayson 's final sentence and there shine out from she soul a contempt for the miserable hack so dazzling that it would have blind he -- have he not be already blind iii that evening she sit alone in the office the first number of _ the five town chronicle _ after the most astounding adventure have miraculously go to press dayson and sowter have depart there be no reason why hilda should remain -- burn gas to no purpose she have telegraph by favor of a karkeek office-boy to miss gailey say that she would come by the first train on the morrow -- Saturday and she have therefore much to do at home nevertheless she sit idle in the office unable to leave she whole life be in that office and it be just when she be most weary of the environment that she would vacillate longest before quit it she be unhappy and apprehensive much less about she mother than about the attitude of she conscience towards the moral of this new world of hers the dramatic enville incident have spoil the pleasure which she have feel in sacrifice she formal duty as a daughter to she duty as a clerk she have be disillusion she foresee the future with alarm and yet strangely the disillusion and the fear be a source of pleasure she savor they with she loyalty that loyalty which have survive even the frightful blow of george cannon 's casual disdain at she mother 's tea-table whatever this new world might be it be hers it be precious she would no more think of abandon it than a young mother would think of abandon a baby obviously imperfect nay she would cling to it the tighter george cannon come up the stair with he decisive and rapid step she rise from she chair at the table as he enter he be wear a new overcoat that she have never see before with a fine velvet collar you be go he ask a little breathless i _ be _ go she reply in she clear timid voice imply that she be ready to stay everything all right mr dayson say so he be go yes mr sowter 's go too good he murmur and he straighten he shoulder and put he hand in the pocket of he trousers begin to walk about the room hilda move to get she bonnet and jacket she move very quietly and delicately and because he be there she put on she bonnet and jacket with gesture of a almost apologetic modesty he seem to ignore she so that she be able to glance surreptitiously at he face he be now apparently less worried still it be a enigmatic face she have no notion of what he have be do since he hurry exit in the afternoon he might have be attend to he legal practice or he might have be abroad on mysterious errand funny business this newspaper business be be not it he remark after a moment just imagine enville now upon my soul i do not think he have it in he of course -- he throw he head up with a careless laugh -- of course it would have be madness for we to miss such a chance he be one of the man of the future in this town yes she agree in a eager whisper in a instant george cannon have completely change the attitude of she conscience -- by less than a phrase by a mere intonation in a instant he have reassure she into perfect security it be plain from every accent of he voice that he have do nothing of which he think he ought to be ashamed business be business and newspaper be newspaper and the simple truth be that she absurd conscience have be in the wrong she duty be to accept the standard of she new world who be she nobody she do accept the standard of she new world with fervor she be proud of they actually proud of they apparent wickedness she have accomplish a act of faith she joy become intense and shot glint from she eye as she put on she glove she life become grand to she she know she be know in the town as ` the girl who could write shorthand ' she situation be not ordinary it be unique again the irregularity of the hour and the fact that the work never commence till the afternoon seem to she romantic and beautiful here she be at nine o'clock alone with george cannon on the second floor of the house and who gaze from the square at the light window would guess that she and he be there alone all the activity of newspaper production be poetize by she fervor the _ chronicle _ be not a poor little weekly sheet struggle into existence anyhow at haphazard dependent on other newspaper for all except purely local item of news it be a organ it be the courageous rival of the ineffable _ signal _ its natural enemy one day it would trample on the _ signal _ and though she rôle be humble though she understand scarcely anything of the enterprise beyond she own duty yet she be very proud of she rôle too and she be glad that the man be seemingly so careless so disorderly so forgetful of detail so -- in a word -- childish for it be part of she rôle to remind they to set they right to watch over they carelessness to restore order where they have leave disorder in so far as she rôle affect they she condescend to they she inform george cannon of she mother 's indisposition and that she mean to go to london the next morning and to return most probably in a few day he stop in he walk near she like herself he be not seriously concerned about mr lessway but he show a courteous sympathy it be a good thing you do not go to london when you mother go he say after a little conversation he do not add : you have be indispensable he have no air of apologize for he insult at the tea-table but he look firmly at she with a peculiar expression suddenly she feel all she slimness and fragility she feel all the girl in herself and all the dominant man in he and all the empty space around they she go hot she sight become dim she be ecstatically blissful she be deeply ashamed she desire the experience to last for ever and he and herself to be eternally moveless and at the same time she desire to fly or rather she have no desire to fly but she voice and limb act of themselves against she volition good-night then but i say you wages shall i pay you now no no it do not matter in the least thanks he shake hand with a careless good-natured smile which seem to be say : foolish creature you can not defend yourself and these air be amusing but i be benevolent and she be ashamed of she shame and furious against the childishness that make she frown and lower she eye and escape out of the room like a mouse chapter xiv to london i in the middle of the night hilda wake up and within a few seconds she convince herself that she attitude to miss gailey 's telegram have be simply monstrous she see it in the darkness as a enormity she ought to have respond to the telegram at once she ought to have go to london by the afternoon train what have there be to prevent she from knock at the door of the inner room and say to mr cannon in the presence of no matter whom : i be very sorry mr cannon but i have just have a telegram that mother be ill in london and i must leave by the next train there have be nothing to prevent she at latest she should have catch the evening train business be of no account in such a crisis she mother might be very ill might be die might be dead it be not for trifle that people send such telegram the astounding thing be that she should have be so blind to she obvious duty and she say to herself think with a mysterious and beautiful remorse of the last minute of she talk with mr cannon : if i have do as i ought to have do i should have be in london or on my way to london instead of in the room with he there and _ that _ would not have occur but what ` that ' be she could not have explain nevertheless mr cannon 's phrase it be a good thing you do not go to london still give she a pleasure though the pleasure be dull then she try to reassure herself sarah gailey be nervous and easily frighten she mother have a excellent constitution the notion of she mother be seriously ill be silly in a few hour she would be with she mother and would be laugh at these absurd night-fear in any case there would assuredly be a letter from sarah gailey by the first post so that before start she would have exact information she succeed partially in reassure herself for a brief space but soon she be more unhappy than ever in the clear conviction of she wrongdoing again and again she formulate in she fancy scene of the immediate future as for example at she mother 's die bed and she imagine conversation and repeat the actual word use by herself and other interminably and then she return to the previous day and hundred of time she go into the inner room and say to mr cannon : i be very sorry mr cannon but i have just have a telegram -- etc why have she not say it thus work the shuttle of she mind with ruthless insane insistence until she know not whether she be awake or asleep and the very tissue of she physical brain seem raw she think feebly : if i get up and light the candle and walk about i should end this but she could not rise she be net down to the bed and when she try to soothe herself with other image -- image of delight -- she find that they have lose they power undress a few hour earlier she have live again in exquisite and delicious alarm through the last minute of she talk with mr cannon she have go to sleep while reconstitute those instant but now they memory leave she indifferent even inspire repugnance and she remorse little by little lose its mysterious beauty she cling to the idea of the reassuring letter which she would receive that be she sole glint of consolation ii at six she be abroad in the house intensely alive intensely conscious of every particle of she body and of every tiniest operation of she mind in less than two hour the letter would drop into the lobby at half-past six both she and florrie be dress and florrie stern with the solemnity and importance of she mission be set forth to the saracen 's head to order a cab to be at the door at eight o'clock hilda have much to do for it be of course necessary to shut up the house and the packing of she trunk have to be finish and the trunk lock and cord and a label find and there be breakfast to cook mr lessway would have easily pass a couple of day in prepare the house for closure nevertheless time instead of fly lag at seven-thirty hilda in the partially dismantle parlor and florrie in the kitchen be sit down to breakfast in a quarter of a hour say hilda to herself the post will be here but in four minute she have eat the bacon and drunk the scalding tea and in five she have carry all the breakfast-thing into the kitchen where florrie be loudly munch over the sloppy deal table she tell florrie sharply that there would be ample time to wash up then she go to she bedroom and drag out she trunk slide it unaid down the stair back again in the bedroom she carelessly glance at the money in she purse and then put on she thing for the journey wait she stand at the window to look for the postman presently she see he in the distance he approach quickly but spend a unendurable minute out of sight in the shop next door when he emerge hilda be in anguish have he a letter for she have he not he seem to waver at the gateway and to decide to enter she hear the double blow of he drumstick baton now in a few seconds she would know about she mother proudly restrain herself she walk with composure to the stair she be astonish to see florrie bend down to pick up the letter florrie must have be wait ready to rush to the front door as she raise she body and catch sight of hilda florrie blush the stair be block by the trunk which hilda have leave on the stair-mat for the cabman to deal with stand behind the trunk hilda hold forth she hand for the letter please miss it be for I florrie whisper like a criminal for you hilda cry startle in proof florrie timidly expose the envelope on which hilda plainly see in a coarse scrawling masculine hand the word miss florrie bagster florrie 's face be a burning peony hilda turn superciliously away too proud to demand any explanation all she alarm be refresh by the failure of a letter from miss gailey in vain she urge to herself that miss gailey have think it unnecessary to write expect to see she or that the illness have pass miss gailey busy have put off write she could not dismiss a vision of a boarding-house in london upset from top to bottom by the grave illness of one person in it and a distract landlady who have not a moment even to scribble a post card and all the time as this vision tear and desolate she she be think : fancy that child have a follower at she age she be certainly get a follower the cab come five minute before it be due iii as the cab roll through market square where the Saturday stall be be busily set up the ironmongery building be frame for a instant by the oblong of the rattle window hilda seem to see the place anew -- for the first time a man be take down the shutter of the shop above that be the wire-blind with the name of q karkeek and above the blind the blue poster of the _ five town chronicle _ no outward sign of mr cannon and yet mr cannon she have a extremely disconcerting sensation of the mysteriousness of mr cannon and of the mysteriousness of all existence mr cannon exist somewhere at that moment engage in some activity in a house afar off unknown to she she mother exist -- if she be not dead florrie with a bundle of personal goods on she lap and doubtless the letter in she bosom sit impressed and subdue opposite to she in the shift universe of the cab which be move away from the empty and silent home florrie be be throw back out of luxury into she original hovel and be accept the stroke with the fatalism of the young and of the poor and one day hilda and she mother and florrie would be unite again in the home now desert whose heavy key be in the traveller 's satchel but would they at the station there be a quarter of a hour to wait hilda dismiss florrie with final injunction and follow she trunk to the bleak platform the old porter be very kind she go to the little yellow bookstall there under she hand be a low pile of _ the five town chronicle _ miracle miraculous george cannon she flush with pride with a sense of ownership as she take a penny from she purse to pay for a copy it be th ' new peeper drawl the bookstall lad with a most foolish condescension towards the new paper lout she address he in she heart if you know whom you be talk to -- with what pride mask by careful indifference she would hand the copy of the _ chronicle _ to she mother she mother would exclaim bless we and spend a day or two in con the thing make singular discovery in it at short interval iv it be not until she have reach euston and drive through a tumultuous and shabby thoroughfare to king 's cross and take another ticket and install herself in another train that hilda begin to feel suddenly like a abyss opening beneath she strength the lack of food meticulous in she clerical duty and in many minor mechanical detail of she personal daily existence she be capable of singular negligence concern matter which the heroic part of she despise and which do not immediately bear on a great purpose in hand thus in she carelessness she find herself with less than two shilling in she pocket after pay for the ticket to hornsey she think grimly resign : never heed i shall manage in half a hour i shall be there and my anxiety will be at a end the train almost empty wait forlornly in a forlorn and empty part of the huge resounding ochreish station then without warn or signal it slip off as though casually towards a undetermined goal often it run level with the roof of vague far-stretching acre of house -- house vile and frowsy and smoking like pyre in the dank air and always it travel on a platform of brick arch now and then the walled road receive a tributary that round subtly into it and this tributary could be see curve away on innumerable brick arch through the chimneypot and lose itself in a dim horizon of gloom at interval a large lifeless station bring the train to a halt for a moment and the march be resume a clock at one of these station say a quarter to two then the name of hornsey quicken she apprehensive heart as she descend nervously from the train she trunk be shoot out from the guard 's van behind she go and stand over it until the last of a series of kindly porter come along and touch he cap when she ask for a cab he seem doubtful whether a cab be available and look uncertainly along the immense empty platform and across at other platform the train have wander away she strive momentarily to understand the reason of these great sleep station but fatigue emotional and physical have rob she of all intelligent curiosity in the phenomenon of the mysterious and formidable city presently the porter throw the trunk on he shoulder and she trudge after he up step and over a iron bridge and down step and a express whiz like a fly shell through the station and vanish and at a wicket in a ragged road there actually stand a cab and a skeleton of a horse between the shaft the driver bounce up enhearten at sight of the trunk and the inexperienced timid girl but the horse do not stir in its crooked coma what address miss ask the cabman cedar house harringay park road the cabman pause in intense thought and after a few seconds respond cheerfully : yes miss the porter touch he cap for threepence the lash horse plunge forward hilda lean back in the creaking and depraved vehicle and sigh so this be they london she find herself travel in the direction from which she have come parallel to the railway down the longest street that she have ever see on she left be ten thousand small new house all alike on she right be break patch of similar house intersperse with fragment of green field and view of the arch of the railway the conception of the horrible patience which have go to the construction of these endless endless arch make she feel sick the cab turn into another road and another and then stop she see the word cedar house on a gateway she could not open the door of the cab the cabman open it blind down here miss he say with appropriate mournfulness it seem a rather large house and every blind be draw have the incredible occur then have this disaster befall just she of all the young woman in the world she see the figure of sarah gailey good afternoon she call out calmly here i be only i be afraid i have not get enough to pay the cabman but while she be speak she know from sarah gailey 's face that the worst and the most ridiculous of she night-fear have be justify by destiny three day previously mr lessway have be suddenly take ill in the street a doctor pass in he carriage have come to she assistance and drive she home food eat on the previous evening have ` disagree ' with she at first the case be not regard as very serious but as the patient do not improve in the night miss gailey telegraph to hilda immediately afterwards the doctor summon in alarm diagnose peritonitis cause by a perforate cancer mr lessway have die on the third day at eleven in the morning while hilda be in the train useless to protest that these catastrophe be unthinkable that mr lessway have never be ill in she life the catastrophe have happen and upstairs a corpse lay in proof \* \* \* \* \* book ii she recovery chapter i sin i from she bed hilda could see the tree wave in the wind every morning she have thus watch they without interest at first the branch have be utterly bare and beyond they reticulation have be visible the rosy façade of a new board-school but now the branch be rich with leafage hide most of the board-school so that only a large upper window of it could be see this window upon which the sun glint dazzlingly throw back the ray on to hilda 's bed give she for a few moment the illusion of direct sunlight the hour be eleven o'clock on the night-table lay a tea-tray in disorder and on the turned-down sheet some crumb of toast a low nervous tap at the door cause hilda to stir in the bed sarah gailey enter hurriedly in she bony yellowed hand she hold a collection of tradesman 's account-book good morning dear how be you she ask bend awkwardly over the bed in the same instant she look askance at the tray i be all right thanks say hilda lazily observe the ceiling you have not be too cold without the eiderdown i forget to ask you before you know i only take it off because i think the weather be get too warm i do not want it for another bed i assure you it be in the chest of drawer in my room sarah gailey add the last word as if supplicate to be believe you need not tell I that say hilda she be not angry but bore by this characteristic remark of miss gailey 's in three month she have learn a great deal about the new landlady of the cedar that strange neurotic compound of ability devotion thin-skinned vanity and sheer narrow stupidity i have be quite warm enough hilda add as quickly as she could lest miss gailey might have time to convince herself to the contrary and the toast i do hope -- after all i have say to that hettie about -- you see i have eat it all hilda interrupt she point to the plate they face be close together they exchange a sad smile miss gailey be still bend over she anxiously as over a child yet neither the ageing and worn woman nor the flaccid girl feel the difference between they in age nor be hilda in any ordinary sense ill the explanation of miss gailey 's yearning attitude lay in a exaggerated idea of she duty to hilda whose mother 's death have be the result of a act of friendliness to she if mr lessway have not come to london in order to keep company with sarah she might -- she would under providence -- have be alive and well that day such be sarah 's reasoning which by the way ignore certain statement of the doctor sarah would never forgive herself but she seek by a infatuate devotion to earn the forgiveness of caroline 's daughter she attention might have infuriate a earlier hilda or at least have be meet with disdain only half conceal but on the present actual hilda they produce simply no effect of any kind the actual hilda living far within the mysterious fastness of she own being be too solitary too preoccupy and too fatigue to be touch even by the noble beauty that distinguish the expiatory and protective gesture of the spinster otherwise somewhat ludicrous as she lean across the bed and cut off the sunshine ii on the morning of she mother 's funeral hilda have go to hornsey station to meet a uncle of mr lessway who be come down from scotland by the night-train she scarcely know he but he be to be recognizable by he hat and he muffler and she be to await he at the ticket-gate a entirely foolish and unnecessary arrangement contrived by a peculiar old man : the only possible course be to accept it she have wait over half a hour between eight and nine and in that time she have have full opportunity to understand why those suburban station have be build so large a dark torrent of human being chiefly man gather out of all the street of the vicinity have dash unceasingly into the enclosure and cover the long platform with tramp foot every few minute a train roll in as if from some inexhaustible magazine of train beyond the horizon and suck into itself a multitude and depart again leave one platform for one moment empty -- and the next moment the platform be once more fill by the quenchless stream less frequently but still often other train thunder through the station on a line remove from platform and these train too be cram with dark human being frown in study over white newspaper for even in 1880 the descent upon london from the suburb be a formidable phenomenon train after train flee downward with its freight towards the hidden city and the torrent still surge more rapid than ever through the narrow gullet of the station it be like the flight of some enormous and excited population from a country menace with disaster bear on and buffet by the torrent hilda have see a well-dressed epileptic youth in charge of a elderly woman approach the station he have pass slowly close by she as she modestly wait in she hasty mourning and she have have a fearful vision of he idiotic greenish face support somehow like a mask at the summit of that shaky structure of limb he have indeed stare at she with he apelike eye she have watch he almost shudder till he be lose amid the heedless crowd within then without wait longer for she relative without reflect upon what she do she have walk tremblingly back to the cedar check by tributary of the torrent at every street corner she have know nothing of the funeral she have not have speech with the relative she be in bed somehow the day have elapse and in the follow night when she be alone and quite awake she have become aware that she she herself be that epileptic shape that that epileptic shape be lie in she bed and that there be none other in the bed nor be this a fancy of madness she know that she be not mad that she be utterly sane and the conviction of sanity only intensify she awful discovery she pass a tremble hand over she face and feel the skin corrupt and green gaze into the darkness she know that she stare be apelike she have feel then the fullest significance of horror in the morning she have cease to be the epileptic shape but the risk of re-transformation have hover near she and the intimidation of it be such that she have weep aghast and broken as much by the future as by the past she have be discover weep later the phrase ` nervous breakdown ' have lodge in she confused memory the doctor have be very matter-of-fact logical and soothing overwork strain loss of sleep the journey anxiety lack of food the supreme shock the obstinate refusal of youth to succumb and then the sudden sight of the epileptic -lrb- with whom the doctor be acquaint -rrb- : thus have run the medical reasoning after a discreet but thorough cross-examination of she and it have seem so plausible and so convincing that the doctor 's pride in it be plain on he optimistic face as he give the command : absolute repose but to hilda the reasoning and the resultant phrase ` nervous breakdown ' have mean nothing at all word empty word she know profoundly and fatally the evil principle which have conquer she so completely that she have no power leave with which to fight it this evil principle be sin it be not the force of sin however multifarious it be sin itself she be the sinner convict and self-convicted one of the last intelligent victim of a malady which have now almost pass away from the civilized earth she exist in the chill and stricken desolation of incommutable doom iii she have sin against she mother and she could not make amends the mere thought of she mother so vivacious cheerful life-loving even-tempered charitable disorderly incompetent foolish and yet shrewd cause pain of such intensity that it cease to be pain she ought to have see she mother before she die she might have see she have she do what be obviously she duty it be inconceivable to she now that she should have hesitate to fly instantly to london on receipt of the telegram but she have hesitate and she mother have expire without have sight of she all exculpatory argument be futile against the fact itself in vain she blame the wording of the telegram in vain she try to reason that chance and not herself be the evil-doer in vain she invoke the aid of simple common sense against sentimental fancy in vain she go over the event of the afternoon precede the death in order to prove that at no moment have she be aware of not act in accordance with she conscience the whole of she conduct have be against she conscience but pride and selfishness have make she deaf to conscience she be the sinner she despair except when at interval she become the loathe epileptic shape have be calm its symptom have be and remain a complete lack of energy and a most extraordinary black indifference to the surrounding world save in the deep center of she soul where she agonize she seem to have lose all capacity for emotion nothing move she or even interested she she sit in the house and eat a little and talk a little like a automaton she walk about the street like a bored exile but a exile who have forget he home she spirit never respond to the stimulus of environment suggestion at once lose they tonic force in the woolly cushion of she apathy if she continue to live it be by inertia to cease from life would have require a effort she do not regret the vocation which she have abandon she feel no curiosity about the fortune of the newspaper a tragic nonchalance hold she after several week she have naturally begin to think of religion for the malady alone be proof enough that she have a profoundly religious nature miss gailey could rarely go to church but one Sunday morning -- doubtless with intent -- she ask hilda if they should go together and hilda agree as they approach the large high-spired church hilda have vague pricking of hope and be thereby much astonished but the service in no way respond to she expectation how silly i be she think disdainfully this sort of thing have never move I before why should it move I now the sermon evangelical be upon the creed and the preacher explain the emotional quality of real belief it be a goodish sermon but the preacher have effectually stop the very last of those exquisite vague pricking of hope hilda agree with he definition of real belief and she know that real belief be impossible for she she could never say with joyous fervor : i believe at best she could only assert that she do not disbelieve -- and be she so sure even of that no belief have be deny to she and to dream of consolation from religion be sentimentally womanish even in she indifference she prefer straightforward honest damnation to the soft self-deception of feminine religiosity ah if she could have be a roman catholic genuine and convinced -- with what ardor would she have cast herself down before the confessional and whisper she sinfulness to the mysterious face within and with what ecstasy would she have receive the absolution -- that cleanse bath of the soul then -- she could have recommence but she be not a roman catholic she could no more become a roman catholic than she could become the queen of some romantic latin country of palace and cathedral she be a young provincial girl staying in a boarding-house at hornsey on the great northern line out of london and she be suffer from nervous breakdown such be the exterior common sense of the situation occasionally the memory of some verse of victor hugo sound the beat of one of he vast melancholy would float through she mind and cause it to vibrate for a instant with a mournful sensation that resemble pleasure iv be you think of get up dear ask sarah gailey as she arrange more securely the contents of the tray and find space on it for she weekly book yes i suppose i may as well hilda murmur it 'll be lunch-time soon the day be long yet somehow they seem short too already before get up she would begin to think of the evening and of go to bed and Saturday night follow quickly on Monday morning it be scarcely credible that sixteen week have pass thus since she mother 's death -- sixteen week whose retrospect show no achievement of any kind and hardly a desire i have give those boutwood notice say sarah gailey suddenly the tray in she hand ready to lift not really they be shockingly late for breakfast again this morning both of they and mr boutwood have the face to ask for another egg hettie come and tell I so i go in myself i tell he breakfast be serve in my house at nine o'clock and there be a notice to that effect in the bedroom not to mention the dining-room and as good a breakfast as they would get in any of they hotel i lay if the egg be cold at ten o'clock and after that be not my fault they be both of they perfectly healthy and yet they be bone-idle they never want to go to bed and they never want to get up it be not as if they go to theater and get home late and so on i could make excuse for that -- now and then no it be just idleness and carelessness and if you see they bedroom oh my a nice example to servant well he be very insulting -- most insulting he say he pay I to give he not what i want but what _ he _ want he say if i go into a shop and they begin to tell I what i ought to want and when i ought to want it i should be annoyed i say i do not need anyone to tell I that i say and my house be not a shop he say it be a shop and if it be not it ought to be can you imagine it hilda try to exhibit a tepid sympathy miss gailey 's nostril be twitch and the tear stand in those watery eye she could manage the house by the exertion of all she power and she force she have make of herself a exceptionally efficient mistress but she could not manage the boarder because she have not sufficient imagination to put herself in they place preside over all she secret thought be the axiom that the cedar be a perfect machine and that the least that a grateful boarder could do be to fit into the machine and so you say they could go that i do and i 'll tell you another thing my dear i -- there be a knock at the door sarah gailey stop in she confidence like a catch conspirator and open the door hettie stand on the mat -- the hettie who despite frequent protest would leave hilda 's toast to cool into leather on the landing somewhere between the kitchen and the bedroom in hettie 's hand be a telegram which miss gailey accept here take the tray hettie say she nervously tear at the envelope put these book in my desk she add and i wonder what _ he 'll _ say she observe stare absently at the open telegram after hettie have go who george he say he 'll be up here for lunch he be bind to be vex about the boutwood but he do not understand man do not you know they do not understand the strain it be on you the appeal of she eye be strangely pathetic hilda say : i do not think i shall get up for lunch to-day sarah gailey move to the bed forget she own trouble you be not so well then after all she mutter with mournful commiseration but you know he 'll have to see you _ this _ time he want to but why you affair i suppose he say so ` come lunch one must see hilda -- george ' sarah gailey offer the telegram but hilda could not bear to take it this telegram be the first she have set eye on since the telegram hand to she by florrie in george cannon 's office the mere sight of the salmon-tinted paper agitate she be it possible that i can be so silly she think over a bit of paper but so it be on a previous visit of george cannon 's to hornsey she have keep she bed throughout the day afraid to meet he ashamed to meet he inexplicably convince that to meet he would be a crime against filial piety there be obscure grotto in she soul which she have not have the courage to explore candidly i think say sarah gailey reflective and anxious i think if you _ could _ get up it would be nicer than he see you here in bed hilda perceive that at last she would be compel to face george cannon chapter ii the little room i after lunch sarah gailey leave hilda and mr cannon in ` the little room ' together ` the little room ' -- about eight foot square -- have no other name it be always speak of affectionately by the boarder and by the landlady with pride in its coziness situate on the first floor over the front part of the hall it lay between the two principal bedroom old boarder would discover the little room to new boarder or new boarder would discover it for themselves with immense satisfaction it be the chamber of intimacy and of confidence it be a refuge from the public life of the cedar and to a certain extent from the piano two woman newly acquaint and feel a mutual attraction would say to each other : shall we go up to the little room oh yes do let we and they would climb the stair in a fever of anticipation quite the most charming room in the house dear miss gailey another simpering spinster would say yet it contain nothing but a old carpet two wicker arm-chair a small chair a nearly empty dwarf bookcase a engraving of marie antoinette regally face the revolutionary mob and a couple of photograph of the cedar hilda sit down in one of the arm-chair and george cannon in the other he have a small black bag which he place on the floor by he side hilda 's diffidence be extreme throughout lunch she have scarcely speak but as there have be eight people at the table and george cannon have chat with all of they she taciturnity have pass inconspicuous now she would be oblige to talk and the sensation which she have experience on first meeting george cannon in the dining-room be renew in a form even more acute she have in the first place the self-consciousness due to she mourning attire which draw attention to herself it might have be a compromise uniform and the mere fact of she mother 's death -- quite apart from the question of she conduct in relation thereto -- give she in a interview with a person whom she have not see since before the death a feeling akin to guiltiness -- guiltiness of some misdemeanor of taste some infraction of the social law against notoriety she feel in she mourning like one who be be lead publicly by policeman to the police-station in she fancy she could hear people say : look at that girl in deep mourning and she could see herself blush as it be apologetic but much worse than this general mortification in presence of a acquaintance see after a long interval be the special constraint due to the identity of the acquaintance it be with george cannon that she have first deceive and plot against she ingenuous mother 's hasty plan it be she loyalty to george cannon that have be the cause of she inexplicable disloyalty to she mother she could not recall she peculiar and delicious agitation during the final moment of she previous interview with cannon -- that night of February in the newspaper office while she mother be die in london -- without a profound unreasoning shame which intensify most painfully she natural grief as a orphan there be this to be say : she be now disturb out of she torpid indifference to she environment as she fidget there pale and frown in the noisy basket-chair beneath george cannon 's eye she actually perceive again that romantic quality of existence which have always so powerfully present itself to she in the past she reflect : how strange that the dreaded scene have now actually begin he have come to london and here we be together in this house which at the beginning of the year be nothing but a name to I and mother be away there in the churchyard and i be in black and it be all due to he he send miss gailey and mother to london he will it no it be all due to I i go to see he one late afternoon i seek he out he do not seek I out and just because i go to see he one afternoon mother be dead and i be here strange these reflection be dimly beautiful to she even in she sadness and in she acute distress the coma have assuredly pass if only for a space ii well now he say after a few inanity have be succeed by a awkward pause i have get to talk business with you so i suppose we may as well begin eh he tone be fairly blithe but it be that of a man who be throw off with powerful ease the weariness of somewhat exasperating annoyance since lunch he have have a brief interview with sarah gailey yes she agree glumly have you decide what you be go to do he begin to smile sympathetically as he speak i be not go back to the paper she curtly answer cut short the smile with fierceness almost with ferocity beyond question she be rude in she bitterness she ask herself : why do i talk like this why can not i talk naturally and gently and cheerfully i have really get nothing against he but she could not talk otherwise than she do talk it be by this symptom of bite acrimony that she agitation show itself she know that she be scowl as she look at the opposite wall but she could not smooth away the scowl no i suppose not he say quietly but be you think of come back to turnhill she remain mute for some seconds a feeling of desolation come over she and it seem to she that she welcome it try to intensify it and yield she feature to it how do i know she mutter at length shrug she shoulder because if you be not he resume it be no use you keep that house of yours empty you must remember it be just as you leave it and the thing in it be not take any good either she shrug she shoulder again i do not see that it matter to anybody but I she say after another pause with a sort of frigid and disdainful nonchalance and once more she reflect : be it possible that i can behave so odiously he stand up suddenly i do not know what you and sarah have be plot together he say wound and contemptuous yet with lightness but i be sure i do not want to interfere in you affair with sarah 's i have get to interfere unfortunately and a famous time i be have he nostril grow fastidious but not yours i only promise you uncle you uncle tell I you want I to -- he break off in a instant she grow confuse alarmed and extremely ashamed she mood have change in a flash it seem to she that she be in presence of a disgraceful disaster which she herself have bring about by wicked and irresponsible temerity she be like a child who have naughtily trifle with danger stand aghast at the calamity which he perverseness have cause she be positively affright she reflect in she terror : i ask for this and i have get it george cannon stoop and pick up he little bag there he tower high and massive above she and she feel acutely she slightness she girlishness and she need of he help she could not afford to transform sympathy into antipathy she be alone in the world never before have she realize as she realize then the lurk terror of she loneliness the moment be critical in another moment he might be go from the room and she leave solitary to irremediable humiliation and self-disgust please she whisper appealingly the whole of she be become a appeal -- the glance the gesture the curve of the slim and fragile body she be like a slave she have no pride no secret reserve of thought she be a instinct tear show in she eye and affect she voice he give the twisted difficult rather foolish smile of one who be cursing the mortification of a predicament into which he have be cast through no fault of he own please what please sit down he wave a hand deprecatingly and obey it be all right he say all right i ought to have know -- then he smile generously know what she voice be now weak and liquid with woe you would be likely to be upset not furtively but openly she wipe she eye no no she protest honestly it be not that it be -- but -- i be very sorry i reckon i know a bit what worry be myself he add with a brief almost harsh laugh these strange word strike she with pity iii well now -- he seem to be begin again -- let 's leave lessway street for a minute i can sell the calder street property for you if you like and at a pretty good price sooner or later the town will have to buy up all that side of the street you remember i tell you mother last year but one i could get a customer for it but she be not have any yes say hilda eagerly i remember in she heart she apologize to george cannon once more for have allow she mother to persuade she even for a day that that attempt to buy be merely a trick on he part invent to open negotiation for the rent-collecting you know what the net rent be he go on as you have have 'em every month i dare say the purchase money if it be carefully invest will bring you in as much but even if it do not bring in quite as much you must not forget that calder street 's go down -- it be get more and more of a slum and there 'll always be a lot of bother with tenant of that class i wish i could sell everything -- everything she exclaim passionately lessways street as well then i should be absolutely free you can he say with dramatic emphasis and let I tell you that ten year hence those lessway street house will not be worth what they be now be that property go down too she ask i think they be build all round there so they be he answer but cheap cottage you house be too good for that part of the town that be what be the matter with they people who can afford # 25 a year -- and over -- for rent will not care to live there much longer you know the end house be empty all house seem to she to be a singularly insecure and even perilous form of property and the sale of everything she possess present itself to she fancy as a transaction which would enfranchise she from the past it symbolize the starting-point of a new life of a recommencement unhamper by the vestige of grief and error she could go anywhere do what she choose the entire world would lie before she please do sell it all for I she plead wistfully suppose you could about how much should i have -- i mean income he glance about and then take a pencil from he waistcoat pocket scribble a few figure on he cuff quite three pound a week he say iv after a perfunctory discussion which be somewhat self-consciously prolong by both of they in order to avoid a appearance of hastiness in a important decision george cannon open he black bag and then look round for ink the little room have no table have no inkpot and the lawyer take from he pocket a eagle indelible pencil -- the fountain-pen of those simple day it need some adjustment he step closer to the window and hold the pointed end of the case up to the light while screw the lower end he be very fastidious in these mechanical detail of he vocation hilda watch he from behind with a intentness that fascinate herself and how 's the _ chronicle _ get on she ask in a tone of friendly curiosity which give a exaggerated impression of she actual feeling she be more and more ashamed that during lunch she have not trouble to put a question about the paper she be even ashamed of she social indifference that sarah gailey narrow and preoccupy should be indifferent should never once in three month have refer to she brother 's organ be not surprising but it be monstrous that she hilda the secretary the priestess should share this uncivil apathy and it be unjust to mark the newspaper as somehow she have be do with the stigma of she mother 's death she actually begin to characterize she recent mental attitude to she past life as morbid oh he murmur absently with gloomy hesitation as he manipulate the pencil she go on still more persuasively : i suppose you have get a new secretary no he say as though it fatigue and annoy he to dwell on the subject i tell 'em they must manage without it be no fun start a new paper in a god-forsaken hole like the five town i can tell you plainly he high exuberant hope have be dash have perhaps be destroy she do not reply she could not she become suddenly sad with sympathy and this sadness be beautiful to she already when he be scribble on it she have notice that he wristband be fray now silhouette against the window the edge of the wristband catch she attention again and grow strangely significant this man be pass through adversity it seem tragic and shocking to she that he should have to pass through adversity that he could not remain for ever triumphant brilliant cocksure in all he grand scheme and masculinely scathless it seem wrong to she that he should suffer and desirable that anybody should suffer rather than he george cannon with faulty linen by what error of destiny have this heart-rending phenomenon of discord be cause -lrb- yes heart-rending -rrb- be it due to weary carelessness or to actual horrible financial strait either explanation be very painful to she she have a vision of a whole sisterhood of woman toiling amid steam and soapsud in secret and in secret deny themselves to provide he with all that he lack so that he might always emerge into the world unblemished and glitteringly perfect she would have sacrifice the happiness of multitude to she sense of fitness v there be no table george cannon remove a grotesque ornament from the dwarf bookcase and use the top of the bookcase as a writing-board hilda be call upon to sign two papers he explain exactly what these papers be but she do not understand nor do she desire to understand one be a informal sale-note and the other be a authority but which be which and to what each have reference she superbly and wilfully ignore she could by a religious effort of volition make of herself a excellent clerk eagerly imitative and mechanical but she have a instinctive antipathy to the higher form of business moreover she want to trust herself to he if only as a mystic reparation of she odious rudeness at the beginning of the interview and she think also : these transaction will result in profit to he it be by such transaction that he live i be help he in he adversity when he give she the eagle pencil and point to the place where she be to sign she take the pencil with fervor more and more anxious to atone to he for a moment she stand bewilder in a dream stare at the scratch mahogany top of the bookcase and the bookcase seem to she to be something sentient patient and helpful that have always be wait there in the corner to aid george cannon in this crisis -- something human like herself she love the bookcase and the eagle pencil and the papers and the pattern on the wall george cannon be stand behind she she feel he presence like a delicious danger she sign the papers in that large scrawl hand which for a few brief week she have by force cramp down to the submissive caligraphy of a clerk as she sign she see the name karkeek in the midst of one of the document and remember with joyous nonchalance that george cannon 's own name never appear in george cannon 's affair he take she place in front of the little bookcase and fold the document there he be beside she in all he masculinity -- he moustache he blue chin he wide white hand he broadcloth -- there he be plant on he massive foot as on a pedestal she do not see he she be aware of he and she be aware of the closed door behind they one of the basket-chair though empty continue to creak like a thing alive faintly very faintly she could hear the piano -- mr boutwood play overhead be the footstep of sarah gailey and hettie -- they be check the linen from the laundry as usual on Saturday afternoon and she be aware of herself thin throb fragile mournful somehow insignificant he look round at she with a half-turn of the head in he glance be good humor good nature protectiveness and rectitude and more than these some of the old serenely smile triumphant quality he be not ruin he be not really in adversity he remain the conqueror she thrill with she relief you be in my hand now -- no mistake he murmur roguishly pick up the document and bend over the bag hilda could hear a heavy footstep on the stair ascend in the same instant she have a extraordinary and disconcerting impulse to seize he hand -- she know not why whether it be to thank he to express she sympathy or to express she submission she struggle against this impulse but the impulse be part of herself and of she inmost self she be afraid but she fear be pleasurable she be ashamed but she shame be pleasurable she want to move away from where she stand she think : if only i will to move away i could move away but no i shall not will it i like remain just here in this fear this shame and this agitation she have a clear dazzling perception of the splendor and the fineness of sin but she do not know what sin and all the time the muscle of she arm be tense in the combat between the weakening desire to keep she arm still and the grow desire to let she hand seize the hand of george cannon and all the time the heavy footstep be ascend the interminable staircase and all the time george cannon with avert head be fumble in the bag and then in a flash she be really afraid the fear be no longer pleasurable and she shame have become a curse she say to herself : i can not move now in a minute i shall do this horrible thing nothing can save I despairing she find a dark and tumultuous joy in despair the trance endure for age while disaster approach nearer and nearer then after the heavy footstep have be climb the staircase since earth begin the door be brusquely open and the jovial fat face of mr boutwood appear let in the louder sound of the piano oh i beg pardon he mutter pretend that he have assume the little room to be empty the fact be that he be in search of george cannon in whom he have recognize a fraternal spirit come in mr boutwood say hilda with a easy disdainful calm which absolutely astounded herself that be all then she add to george cannon glancing at he indifferently she depart without wait for a answer vi put on a bonnet and take a umbrella to occupy she hand she go out into the remedial freedom of the street and after turn the first corner she see come towards she the figure of a woman whom she seem to know elegant even stately in youthful grace it be janet orgreave wear a fashionable fawn-coloured summer costume as they recognize each other the girl blush slightly janet hasten forward hilda stand still she be amaze at the chance which have send she two unexpected visitor in the same day they shake hand and kiss so i have find you say janet how be you you poor dear why do not you answer my letter letter hilda repeat wonder then she remember that she have indeed receive a letter from janet but in she comatose dejection have neglect to answer it i be up in london with father for the weekend we want you to come with we to the abbey to-morrow and you must come back with we to bursley on Monday you _ must _ we be quite set on it i have leave father all alone this afternoon to come up here and find you out not that he mind what a way it be but how be you hilda hilda be so touch by janet 's affectionate solicitude that she eye fill with tear she look at that radiate and innocent goodness and thought : how different i be from she she have not the least idea how different i be for a moment janet seem to she to be a sort of angel -- modish but exquisitely genuine she see in the invitation to the five town a miraculous defense against a peril the prospect of which be already alarming she she would be compel to go to turnhill in order to visit lessway street and decide what of she mother 's goods she must keep she would of course take janet with she in all the turnhill affair janet should accompany she she new life should begin under the protection of janet 's society and she heart turn from the old life towards the new with hope and a vague brighten expectation of happiness at the cedar she lead janet to she bedroom and then come out of the bedroom to bid good-bye to george cannon the extreme complexity of existence and of she sensation baffle and intimidate she chapter iii journey to bleakridge i hilda and janet be mount the precipitous sytch bank together on they way from turnhill into bursley it be dark they have miss one train at turnhill and have prefer not to wait for the next although they have be very busy in hilda 's house throughout all the afternoon and a part of the evening and have eat only a picnic meal neither of they be aware of fatigue and the two mile to bursley seem a trifle go slowly up the steep slope they do not converse janet say that the weather be change and hilda without reply peer at the black baffling sky the air have almost suddenly grow warmer above in the region unseen mysterious activity be in movement as if marshal vast force the star have vanish a gentle but equivocal wind on the cheek presaged rain and seem to be bear downward into the homeliness of the earth some strange vibration out of infinite space the primeval element of the summer night encourage and intensify hilda 's mood half joyous half apprehensive she think : a few day ago i be in hornsey with the prospect of the visit to turnhill before I now the visit be behind I i say that janet should be my companion and she have be my companion i say that i would cut myself free and i have cut myself free i need never go to turnhill again unless i like the two trunk will be send for to-morrow and all the rest will be sell -- even the clock the thing be do i have absolute liberty and a income and the intimacy of this splendid affectionate janet how fortunate it be that mr cannon be not at he office when we call of course i be oblige to call and yet would it not be more satisfactory if i have see he i must have be in a horribly morbid state up at hornsey soon i must decide about my future soon i shall actually have decide life be very queer she have as yet no notion whatever of what she would do with she liberty and she income and the future but she think vaguely of something heroic grandiose and unusual ii in she hand she carry a small shabby book bind in blue and gold with gilt edge a little irregular she have find this book while sort out the multitudinous contents of she mother 's wardrobe and at the last moment perceive that it have be overlook and be somehow ashamed to leave it to the auctioneer she have bring it away not know how she would ultimately dispose of it the book have possibly be dear to she mother but she could not embarrass she freedom by conserve everything that have possibly be dear to she mother it be entitle _ the girl 's week-day book _ by mr copley and it have be publish by the religious tract society no doubt in she mother 's girlhood the frontispiece a steel engraving show a group of girl feed some swan by the terraced margin of a ornamental water and it bear the legend feed the swan and on the title - page be the text : that we daughter may be as corner-stone polish after the similitude of a palace psalm cxliv 12 in the table of contents be such phrase as : one thing at a time darkness and light respect for minister the drown fly trifle with word of scripture goose and swan delicate health conscientious regard to truth sensibility and gentleness contrast with affectation curiosity and tattle instability of worldly possession a book represent for hilda all that be most grotesque in a age that be now definitely finish and close a silly book during the picnic meal she have idly read extract from it to janet amusing sentence and though the book have once be hold sacred by she who be dead and though they be engage in stir the scarce-cold ash of a tragedy the girl have nevertheless permit themselves a kindly moderate mirth hilda have quote from a conversation in it : well i would rather sit quietly round this cheerful fire and talk with dear mamma than go to the grandest ball that ever be know and janet have plumply comment : what a dreadful lie and then they have both laugh openly perhaps to relieve the spiritual tension cause by the day 's task and the surroundings after that hilda have continue to dip into the book but silently and janet have imagine that hilda be merely bore by the monotonous absurdity of the sentiment express janet be wrong hilda have read the following : one word more do not rest in you religious impression you have perhaps be the subject of terror on account of sin you mind have be solemnize by some event in providence by a alarming fit of sickness or the death of a relative or a companion this be indeed to be reckon a great mercy but then the danger be lest you should rest here lest those tear and terror and resolution should be the only evidence on which you venture to conclude on the safety of you immortal state what be you present condition which word intimidate hilda in spite of herself in vain she repeat that the book be a silly book she really believe that it be silly but she know also that there be a aspect of it which be not silly she be remind by it that she have find no solution of the problem which have distract she in hornsey ` what be you present condition ' she present condition be still that of a weakling and a coward who have sink down inertly before the great problem of sin and now in the grow strength of she moral convalescence she be raise she eye again to meet the problem she future seem to be bind up with the problem as she breast the top of the sytch under the invisible lowering cloud with she new adore friend by she side and the despise but powerful book in she hand she muse in a ambiguous reverie upon she situation dog by the problem which alone be accompany she out of the past into the future she reverie be shoot through by pierce needle of regret for she mother and even with the touch of janet 's arm against she own in the darkness she have sharp realization of she extreme solitude in the world withal the sense of life be precious and beautiful she be not happy but she be fill with the mysterious vital elation which surpass happiness iii they descend gently into bursley cross the top of st luke 's square and turn eastward into market square rule by the sombre and massive town hall in whose high tower a illuminate dial shone like a topaz to hilda this nocturnal entry into bursley have the romance of a entry into a town friendly but strange and recondite during the few day of she stay with the orgreave in the suburb of bleakridge she have scarcely go into the town once she have never see it at night in the old turnhill day she have come over to bursley occasionally with she mother but to shopper from turnhill bursley mean st luke 's square and not a yard beyond now the girl arrive at the commencement of the steam-car track where a huge engine and tram be wait and as they turn another corner the long perspective of trafalgar road rise with its double row of lamp towards fashionable bleakridge be reveal to hilda she think naturally that every other part of the five town be more impressive and more important than the poor little outskirt turnhill of she birth in turnhill there be no thoroughfare to compare with trafalgar road and no fashionable suburb whatever she have almost the feeling of be in a metropolis if a local metropolis it be begin to rain i think say janet who be that hilda question abruptly ignore the remark in the swift unreflecting excitement of a sensibility surprise where there they be go down duck bank into the hollow on the right opposite the light dragon hotel lay duck square in obscure somnolence at the corner of duck square and trafalgar road be a double-fronted shop of which all the shutter be up except two or three in the center of the doorway frame thus in the aperture a young man stand within the shop under a bright central gas-jet he be gaze intently at a large sheet of paper which he hold in he outstretched hand and the girl see he in profile : tall rather lanky fair with hair dishevelled and a serious studious and magnanimous face quite unconscious that he make a picture for unseen observer that say janet in a confidential and interested tone that be young clayhanger -- edwin clayhanger -lrb- 1 -rrb- he father 's the printer you know come from turnhill originally i never know say hilda but i seem to have hear the name oh it must have be a long time ago he be get the best business in bursley now father say it be one of the best in the five town he be build that new house just close to ours do not you remember i point it out to you father 's the architect they be go to move into it next week or the week after i expect that be why the son and heir 's work so late to-night packing and so on perhaps the young man move out of sight but he face have make in those few thrilling seconds a deep impression on hilda so that in she mind she still see it with a almost physical particularity of detail it present itself to she in some mysterious way as a romantic visage wistful full of sad subtlety of the unknown and the seductive and of a latent benevolence it be as recondite and as sympathetic as the town in which she have discover it she say nothing old mr clayhanger be a regular character janet eagerly go on to hilda 's great content some people do not like he but i rather do like he she be always thus kind grandmother once tell I he spring from simply nothing at all -- work on a potbank when he be quite a child who the father you mean yes the father now goodness know how much he be not worth i father be always say he could buy _ we _ up lock stock and barrel janet laugh people often call he a miser but he can not be so much of a miser see that he be build this new house and i suppose the son 's in the business yes he want to be a architect that be how father get to know he but old mr clayhanger would not have it and so he be a printer and one day he 'll be one of the principal man in the town oh so you know he well we do and we do not i go into the shop sometimes and then i have see he once or twice up at the new house we have ask he to come in and see we but he be never come and i do not think he ever will i believe he father do keep he grind away rather hard i be sure he be frightfully clever how can you tell oh from bit of thing he say and he be read everything it seem and once he save a great heavy printing-machine from go through the floor of the printing-shop into the basement if it have not be for he there would have be a dreadful accident everybody be talk about that he do not look it do he they be now pass the corner at which stand the shop hilda peer within the narrowing unshuttered slit but she could see no more of edwin clayhanger no he do not she agree while think nevertheless that he do look precisely that and so he live all alone with he father no mother no mother but there be two sister the youngest be marry and just go to have a baby poor thing the other one keep house i believe she be a splendid girl but neither of they be a bit like edwin not a bit he be -- what i do not know look here miss what about this rain i vote we take the car up the hill iv the steam-car be rumble after they down duck bank it stop huge above they and they climb into it through a odour of warm grease that trail from the engine the conductor touch he hat to janet who smile like a sister upon this fellow-being two middle-aged man be the only other occupant of the interior of the car both raise they hat to janet the girl sit down in opposite corner next to the door then with a deafening continuous clatter of loose glass-pane and throbbing of its filthy floor the vehicle start again elephantine it be impossible to talk in that unique din hilda have no desire to talk she watch janet pay the fare as in a dream without even offer she own penny though as a rule she be touchily punctilious in share expense with the sumptuous janet without be in the least aware of it and quite innocently janet have paint a picture of the young man edwin clayhanger which intensify a hundredfold the strong romantic piquancy of hilda 's brief vision of he in a instant hilda see she ideal future -- that future which have loom grandiose indefinite and strange -- she see it quite precise and simple as the wife of such a creature as edwin clayhanger the change be astounding in its abruptness she see all the delightful and pure vista of love with a man subtle baffling and benevolent and above all superior with a man who would be respect by a whole town as a pillar of society while bring to he intimacy with herself a exotic and wistful quality which neither she nor anyone could possibly define she ask : what attract I in he i do not know _ i like he _ she who have never speak to he she who never before have vividly see herself as marry to a man he be clever he be sincere he be kind he be trustworthy he would have wealth and importance and reputation all this be good but all this would have be indifferent to she have there not be a enigmatic and inscrutable and unprecedented something in he face in he bearing which challenge and inflamed she imagination it do not occur to she to think of janet as in the future a married woman but of herself she think with new agitation : i be innocent now i be ignorant now i be a girl now but one day i shall be so no longer one day i shall be a woman one day i shall be in the power and possession of some man -- if not this man then some other everything happen and this will happen and the hazardous strangeness of life enchant she chapter iv with the orgreave i the orgreave family be hold its nightly session in the large drawing-room of lane end house when hilda and janet arrive the bow-window stand generously open in three different place and the heavy outer curtain as well as the lace inner one be move gently in the capricious breeze that come across the oval lawn the multitudinous sound of rain on leaf enter also with the wind and a steam-car could be hear thunder down trafalgar road from which the house be separate by only a few intervene minor roof mr orgreave the plump fade image of goodness with janet 's full red lip and janet 's kindly eye sit as usual whether in winter or in summer near the fireplace survey with placidity the theater where the innumerable drama of she motherhood have be enact tom she eldest the thin spectacled lawyer have as a boy of seven rampage on that identical turkey hearthrug when it be new a quarter of a century earlier he be now seat at the grand piano with the youngest child alicia a gawky little treasure always alternate between pertness and timidity aged twelve jimmie and johnnie young blood of nineteen and eighteen be only present in they mother 's heart be in process of establish by practice the right to go forth into the world of a evening and return when they choose without suffer too much from family curiosity two other child -- marian eldest daughter and sole furnisher of grandchild to the family and charlie a young doctor -- be permanently away in london osmond orgreave the elegant and faintly mock father of the brood a handsome grizzled man of between fifty and sixty be walk to and fro between the grand piano and the small upright piano in the farther half of the room well my dear say mr orgreave to hilda you be not wet she draw hilda towards she and stroke she shoulder and then kiss she the embrace be to convey the mother 's sympathy with hilda in the ordeal of the visit to turnhill and she satisfaction that the ordeal be now over the ageing lady seem to kiss she on behalf of the entire friendly family all the other appreciate the delicacy of the situation refrain from the peril of clumsy speech oh no mother janet exclaim reassuringly we come up by car and i have my umbrella and it only begin to rain in earnest just as we get to the gate very thoughtful of it i be sure pipe the pig-tailed alicium from the piano she could talk in she pert moment exactly like she brother alicium darling say janet coaxingly as she sit on the sofa flank by the hat glove and jacket which she have just take off will you run upstairs with these thing and take hilda 's too i be quite exhaust father will swoon if i leave they here i suppose he be walk about because he be so proud of he new birthday slipper but i be just play the symphony with tom alicium protest i 'll run up -- i be just go to say hilda you 'll do no such thing mr orgreave announce sharply alicia i be surprised at you here janet and hilda have be out since noon and you -- and so on and so on say alicium jump up from the piano in obedience we do not wait supper mr orgreave go on but i tell martha to leave -- mother dearest janet stop she please do not mention food we have stuff ourselves have not we hilda anyone be swetnam say alicia as she leave the room with she arm full _ mr _ swetnam correct mr orgreave which one the ineffable the ineffable reply mr orgreave who have wander smile enigmatically to the sofa he leg like the whole of he person have a distinguished air and he hold up first one slippered foot and then the other to the silent sham-ecstatic inspection of the girl he may look in again later on it be evidently hilda he want to see this say mr orgreave lazily sink into a easy chair opposite the sofa and light a cigarette he be one of the most industrious man in the five town and assuredly the most industrious architect but into a idle hour he could pack more indolence than even johnnie and jimmie allege wastrel could accomplish in a week i say janet tom sing out from the piano you be not really exhaust be you i be get better well let 's dash through the scherzo before the infant come back she can not take it half fast enough and do you think i can say janet rise in theory janet be not a pianist and she never play solo nor accompany song but in the actual practice of duet-playing she sympathetic presence of mind at difficult crisis of the music cause she to be esteem by tom the expert and enthusiast as superior to all other performer in the family ii hilda listen with pleasure and with exaltation to the scherzo beyond a little part-singing at school she have no practical acquaintance with music there have never be a piano at home but she know that this music be beethoven 's and from the mere intonation of that name as it be utter in she presence in the house of the orgreave she be aware of its greatness and the religious faculty in she have enable she at once to accept its supremacy as a article of genuine belief so that though she understand it not she feel it and be uplift by it whenever she hear beethoven -- and she hear it often because tom in the word of the family have for the moment get beethoven on the brain -- she thought and she aspiration be ennoble she be singularly content with this existence amid the intimacy of the orgreave the largeness and prodigality and culture of the family life so different from anything she have ever know and in particular so different from the desolating atmosphere of the cedar soothe and flatter she in a manner subtly agreeable at the same time she be but little irk by it for the reason that she spirit be not one to be unduly affect by exterior social intellectual and physical condition moreover the orgreave though obviously of a class superior to she own have the facile and yet aristocratic unceremoniousness which unconsciously repudiate such distinction until circumstance arise that compel they acknowledgment to live among the orgreave be like live in a small private republic that throb with a hundred activity and interest each member of it be a center of various energy and from each hilda draw something that be precious : from mr orgreave sheer love and calm wisdom from janet sheer love and the spectacle of elegance from little alicium candor and admiration from tom knowledge artistic enthusiasm and shy curt sympathy from johnnie and jimmie the homage of they proud and naïve mannishness : as for mr orgreave she admire he perhaps as much as she admire even janet and once when he and she have take a walk together up to toft end she have think he quite exquisite in he attitude to she quizzical worldly and yet sensitively understand and humane and withal they never worry she by interference and criticism they never presume on they hospitality but leave she as free as though she age have be twice what it be undoubtedly in the ardor of she gratitude she idealized every one of they the sole reproach which in secret she would formulate against they have reference to they quasus - cynical levity in conversation they would never treat a serious topic seriously for more than a few minute either one or another would yield to the temptation of clever facetiousness and clever facetiousness would always carry off the honor in a discussion this do not apply to mr orgreave who be incapable of humor but it apply a little even to janet the thought continually arise in hilda 's mind be : why do they care for I what can they see in I why be they so good to I i be never good to they she do not guess that at she very first visit to lane end house the force and mystery of she character have powerfully attract these rather experienced amateur of human nature she be unaware that she have make she mark upon janet and charlie so far back as the day of the dancing-classes and she under-estimate the appeal of she situation as a orphan and a solitary whose mother 's death in its swiftness have amount to a tragedy the scherzo be finish and alicium have not return into the drawing-room the two pianist sit hesitant where be that infant tom demand if i finish it all without she she 'll be vex i can tell you where she ought to be say mr orgreave placidly she ought to be in bed no wonder she look pale stop up till this time of night then there be unusual and startling movement behind the door accompany by giggle and alicium enter follow by charlie -- charlie who be suppose at that precise instant to be in london hello mater say the curly-headed charlie with a sublime affectation of calmness as though he have slip out of the next room he produce a effect fully equal to he desire iii in a little while charlie on the sofa be seat at a small table cover with viand and fruit the white cloth spread on the table make a curiously charming patch amid the sombre color of the drawing-room he have protest that have consume much food en route he be not hungry but in vain mr orgreave demolish such argument by the power of she notorious theory which admit no exception that any person come off a express train must be in need of sustenance the odd thing be that all the other discover mysterious appetite and begin to eat and drink with gusto sit standing or walk about while charlie munch related how he have miraculously get three day ' leave from the hospital and how he have impulsively ` cab it ' to euston and how have arrive at knype he have also ` cab it ' from knype to bleakridge instead of wait for the loop line train the blot on he advent in the eye of mr orgreave be that he have no fresh news of marian and she child you do not seem very surprised to find hilda here say alicia it be not my business to be surprise at anything kid charlie retort smile at hilda who sit beside he on the sofa moreover do not i get ten column of news every three day i know far more about this town than you do i bet everybody laugh at mr orgreave the great letter-writer and universal disseminator of information now alicia you must go to bed say mr orgreave and alicium regret that she have be so indiscreet as to draw attention to herself the kid can stay up if she will say she piece say charlie mockingly he know that he could play the autocrat for that evening at any rate what piece the child demand blushing and defiant she ` abou ben adhem ' say charlie do you think i do not know all about that too oh mother you be a bear alicium exclaim pout why do you tell he that well i 'll say it if hilda will recite something as well I murmur hilda stagger i never recite i have always understand you recite beautifully say mr orgreave you know you do hilda say janet of course you do say charlie _ you have _ never hear I anyhow she reply to he obstinately how could they have get it fix into they head that she be a reciter this renown be most disconcerting now hilda mr orgreave soothingly admonish she from the back of the sofa she turn she head and look up at he smile in she distress go ahead then kid it be agree say charlie and alicium gallop through leigh hunt 's moral poem which she be prepare for a imminent speech-day in a extraordinarily short space of time but i can not remember anything i have not recite for year and year hilda plead when the child burst out now hilda _ stuff _ charlie pronounce some tennyson mr orgreave suggest do not you know any tennyson we must have something now and alicium exulting in the fact that she have pay the penalty impose cry that there could be no draw back hilda be lose mr orgreave 's tone with all its softness be a command tennyson i have forget ` maud ' she mutter i 'll prompt you say charlie thoma everybody look at tom expert in literature as well as in music tom the collector the owner of book and bookcase tom go to a bookcase and draw forth a green volume familiar and sacred throughout all england oh dear hilda moan where do you mean to begin charlie sternly inquire it just happen that i be read ` in memoriam ' myself i read ten stanza a day hilda bent over the book with he but i must stand up she say with sudden fire i can not recite sit down they all cry bravo and make a circle for she and she stand up the utterance of the first line be a martyrdom for she but after that she surrender herself frankly to the mood of the poem and forget to suffer shame speaking in a loud clear dramatic voice which she accompany by glance and even by gesture after about thirty line she stop and regain she ordinary sens perceive that the entire family be stare at she with a extreme intentness i can not do any more she murmur weakly and drop on to the sofa everybody clap very heartily it be wonderful say janet in a low tone i should just say it be say tom seriously and hilda be saturate with delicious joy you ought to go on the stage that be what you ought to do say charlie for a fraction of a second hilda dream of the stage and then mr orgreave say softly like a mother : i be quite sure hilda would never dream of any such thing iv there be a irruption of jimmie and johnnie and three of the swetnam brother include he know as the ineffable jimmie and johnnie play the rôle of the absolutely imperturbable with a skill equal to charlie 's own and only a series of calm how-do 's marked the greeting of these relative the swetnam be more rollickingly demonstrative now that the drawing-room be quite thickly populated hilda make nervous by mr orgreave 's jocular insinuation that she herself be the object of the swetnam ' call take refuge first with janet and then as janet be draw into the general crowd with charlie who be absently turn over the page of in memoriam know this he inquire friendly indicate the poem i do not she say it be splendid be not it well he answer it be rather on the religious tack you know that be why i be read it he smile oddly really he hesitate and then nod it be the strangest avowal from this young dandy of twenty-three with the airy and cynical tongue hilda think : here then be another and she own most secret trouble recur to she mind what be that about teddy clayhanger charlie cry out suddenly look up he have catch the name in a distant conversation janet explain how they have see edwin and go on to say that it be impossible to persuade he to call what rot say charlie i bet you what you like i get he here to-morrow night he add to hilda : go to school with he hilda 's face burn i bet you do not say janet stoutly from across the room i 'll bet you a shilling i do say charlie have not a penny leave janet smile father will you lend I a shilling that be what i be here for say mr orgreave mr orgreave the youngest swetnam put in you talk exactly like the dad talk the bet be make and accord to a singular but long-established family custom tom have to be stake-holder hilda become troubled and apprehensive she hope that charlie would lose and then she hope that he would win look forward to the intimate bedroom chat with janet which bring each evening to a heavenly close she say to herself : if he _ do _ come i shall make janet promise that i be not to be ask to recite or anything in fact i shall get she to see that i be not discuss chapter v edwin clayhanger i the next evening mr and mr orgreave hilda janet and alicium be in the dining-room of the orgreave await the advent at the supper - table of sundry young man whose voice could be hear through open door in the distance of the drawing-room charlie orgreave have win he bet : and edwin clayhanger be among those young man who have remain behind in the drawing-room to exchange accord to the practice of young man idea upon life and the world hilda have be introduce to he but owe to the performance of another beethoven symphony there have be almost no conversation before supper and she have not hear he talk she have station herself behind the grand piano on the plea of turn over the page for the musician -lrb- though it be only with great uncertainty and in peril of miss the exact instant for turn that she follow the music on the page -rrb- and from this security she have furtively glance at edwin when she task allow perhaps i be quite mistaken last night she say to herself perhaps he be perfectly ordinary the strange thing be that she could not decide whether he be ordinary or not at one moment he face present no interest at another she see it just as she have see it frame in the illuminate aperture of the shop-shutter on the previous night or she fancy that she see it thus the more she try to distinguish between edwin 's reality and she fancy concern edwin the less she succeed she would pronounce positively that she fancy be absurd and even despicable but this abrupt positiveness do not convince suppose that he be after all marvellous among man during the day she have take advantage of the mention of he name to ascertain discreetly some detail of the legendary feat by which as a boy he have save he father 's printing-shop from destruction the detail be vague and not very comprehensible but they seem to indicate on he part a astounding presence of mind a heroic promptitude in action assuredly the orgreave regard he as a creature out of the common run and at the same time they all have the air of feeling rather sorry for he stand near the supper-table hilda listen intently for the sound of he voice among the other voice in the drawing-room but she could not separate it from the rest perhaps he be keep silence she say to herself : yet what do i care whether he be keep silence or not mr orgreave remark in the suspense glance ironically at he wife : i think i 'll go upstairs and do a hour 's planning they be not likely to be more than a hour i expect hilda say mr orgreave quite calm but take she husband quite seriously will you please go and tell those young man from I that supper be wait ii of course hilda obey though it appear strange to she that mr orgreave have not send alicium on such a errand pass out of the bright dining-room where the gas be light she hesitate a moment in the dark broad corridor that lead to the drawing-room the mission she feel would make she rather prominent in front of edwin clayhanger the stranger and she have a objection to be prominent in front of he she have indeed take every possible precaution against such a danger how silly i be to loiter here she think i might be alicia the boy she could now hear be discuss french literature and in particular victor hugo when she catch the name of victor hugo she lift she chin and move forward a little she worship victor hugo with a passion unreflecting and intense simply because certain detach line from he poem be the most splendid occupant of she memory dignify every painful or sordid souvenir at last charlie 's clear gay voice say : it be all very well and victor hugo _ be _ victor hugo but you can say what you like -- there be a lot of this that 'll bear skip you worship already she be at the doorway in the dusk of the unlighted chamber the face of the four orgreave and clayhanger show like pale patch on the gloom not a line she say fiercely with she extremely clear articulation she have no right to make such a statement for she have not read the twentieth part of victor hugo 's work she do not even know what book they be discuss -- charlie hold the volume lightly in he hand -- but she be incense against the mere levity of charlie 's tone she see edwin clayhanger jump at the startling interruption and all five look round she could feel she face burn charlie quiz she with a word and then turn to edwin clayhanger for support do not _ you _ think that some of it be dullish teddy edwin clayhanger shamefaced look at hilda wistfully as if in apology as if appeal to she clemency against she fierceness and say slowly : well -- yes he have agree with charlie but while disagree with hilda he have mysteriously prove to she that she have be right in say to herself on the previous evening : _ i like he _ the incident appear to she to be enormous and dramatic she move away as it be breathless under emotion and then remember she errand throw over she shoulder : mr orgreave want to know when you be come to supper iii the supper-table be noisy and joyous -- more than usually so on account of the presence of charlie the gayest member of the family at either end of the long white-spread board sit mr and mr orgreave alicium stand by mr orgreave who accept she caress with the negligence of a handsome father along one side sit hilda next to janet and these two be flank by jimmie and johnnie tall unbending apparently determine to prove by a politely supercilious demeanor that to pass a whole evening thus in the home circle be consider by they to be a concession on they part rather than a privilege edwin clayhanger sit exactly opposite to hilda with charlie for sponsor and tom 's spectacles gleam close by hilda while still constrain be conscious of pleasure in the scene and of a certain pride in form part of it these prodigal and splendid person respect and like she even love she she recitation on the previous evening have be a triumph she be glad that she have show they that she could at any rate do one thing rather well but she be equally glad that she have obtain janet 's promise to avoid any discussion of she quality or she situation after all with she self-conscious restraint and she pitiful assure income of three pound a week she be a poor little creature compare with the easy luxurious being of this household whose upkeep could not cost less than three pound a day janet in rich and complicated white and glisten with jewel at hand and neck be a princess beside she she hate she spare black frock and for the second time in she life desire expensive clothes markedly feminine she feel that she be at a grave disadvantage and that to remedy this disadvantage would be necessary not only dress and precious stone but a instinctive faculty of soft allurement which she have not each gesture of janet 's show seductive grace while she own rare gesture be stiffen by a kind of masculine harshness every time that the sad-eyed and modest edwin clayhanger glance at janet and include herself in the glance she fancy that he be unjustly but inevitably misprise herself and at length she think : why do i make janet promise that i should not be talk about why should not he know all about my mourning and that i be the only girl in the five town that can write shorthand why should i be afraid to recite again however much i might have suffer through nervousness if i would recite i should have show i be not such a poor little thing as all that why be i such a baby she wilt under she own disdain it be strange to think that edwin clayhanger scarcely older than the irresponsible charlie be the heir to a important business be potentially a rich and influential man have not mr orgreave say that old mr clayhanger could buy up all the orgreave if he choose it be strange to think that this wistful and apparently timid young man this nice boy would one day be the head of a household and of a table such as this yes it would assuredly arrive everything happen and the mother of that household would it be she she imagination leap far into the future as she exchange a quiet furtive smile with mr orgreave and she try to see herself as another mrs orgreave a strenuous and passionate past behind she honor beloved tease adored but she could not quite see herself thus impossible that she with she temperament so feverish restive and peculiar should ever reach such a haven it be fantastically too much to expect and yet if not with edwin clayhanger then with another with some mysterious be whom she have never see do not everything happen but then equally strange and terrible misfortune might be lie in wait for she the indescribable sharp savor of life be in she nostril iv the conversation have turn upon bradlaugh the shameless free-thinker the man who have know how to make himself the center of discussion in every house in england this be the bradlaugh year the apogee of he notoriety dozen of time at the cedar 's meal-table have she hear the shocking name of bradlaugh on outraged tongue but never once have a word be utter in he favor the public opinion of the boarding-house be absolutely unanimous in reckon he a scoundrel in the dining-room of the orgreave the attitude towards he be different he free-thought be not precisely defend but champion of he right to sit in the house of common be numerous hilda grow excited and even more self-conscious it be as if she be in momentary expectation of be challenge by these hardy debater : be not _ you _ a free-thinker she interest be personal the interest of one in peril compare to the discussion at the cedar this discussion be as the open toss windy sea to a weed-choked canal the talk veer into mere profane politics and mr orgreave entrench himself behind a assumption of careless disdain be severely attack by all he son except jimmie who above hilda 's left shoulder pretend to share the paternal scorn the indifference of hilda to politics be complete she begin to feel less disturbed she begin to dream then she suddenly hear through she dream the name of bradlaugh again and edwin clayhanger in response to a direct question from mr orgreave be say : you can not help what you believe you can not make yourself believe anything and i do not see why you should either there be no virtue in believe and tom be cry hooray hilda be thunderstruck she be blind as though by a mystic revelation she want to exult and to exult with all the ardor of she soul this truth which edwin clayhanger have enunciate she have indeed always be vaguely aware of but now in a flash she feel it she face it she throb to its authenticity and be free it solve every difficulty and loose the load that for month past have weary she back there be no virtue in believe it be fundamental it be the gift of life and of peace she soul shout as she realize that just there in that instant at that table a new epoch have dawn for she never would she forget the instant and the scene -- scene of she re-birth mr orgreave remonstrate with mild sadness : no virtue in believe eh mr edwin and hilda under the ageing lady 's grieved glance try to quench the exultation on she face somewhat like a child trap but she could not tom again cry hooray he tone however grate on she sensibility it lack emotion it be the tone of a pugilist 's backer and janet permit herself some pleasantry and charlie become frankly facetious be it conceivable that charlie could be interested in religion she like he very much partly because he and she have learn to understand each other at the dancing-classes and partly because he curly hair and he candid smile compel sympathy but she esteem for he have limit it be astonishing that a family otherwise simply perfect should be content with jocosity when jocosity be so obviously out of place be they then afraid of be serious edwin clayhanger be not laugh he have blush she eye be fix on he with the extremest intensity study he careless of the danger that he gaze might catch hers she be lose in he and then he catch she and burn with honest shame she look downward chapter vi in the garden i that evening janet do not stay long in hilda 's bedroom have perceive that hilda be in one of she dark dreamy mood as soon as she be go hilda lower the gas a little and then go to the window and open it wider and draw aside the blind look forth the night be obscure and warm and a wet wind move furtively about in the elm-tree of the garden the window be at the side of the house it give on the west and command the new house just finish by mr orgreave for the clayhanger family the block of this generously plan dwelling rise massively at a distance of perhaps forty foot dwarf a whole row of cottage in the small street behind lane end house its various chimneypot stand out a deeper black against the enigmatic sky beyond the clayhanger garden-plot as yet uncultivated and its high boundary wall run the great silent thoroughfare trafalgar road whose gas-lamp reign in the nocturnal silence that the last steam-car have leave in its wake hilda gaze at the house and it seem strange to she that the house which but a short time ago have no existence whatever and be yet cold and soulless be destine to be the living home of a family with history in its wall and memory cling about it the formidable magic of life be always thus discover itself to she so that she could not look upon even a untenanted terra-cotta-faced villa without a secret thrill and the impenetrable sky above be not more charm and enchant than those brick wall when she reflect that one day the wistful boyish edwin clayhanger would be the master of that house that in that house he will would be stronger than any other will the mystery that hide beneath the surface of all thing surge up and overwhelm thought and although scarcely a couple of hour have elapse since the key of the new life have be put into she hand she could not make a answer when she ask herself : be i happy or unhappy ii the sound of young man 's voice come round the corner of the house from the lawn some of the brother orgreave be say good-night to edwin clayhanger in the porch she know that they have be chat a long time in the hall after clayhanger have bid adieu to the rest of the family she wonder what they have be talk about and what young man do in general talk about when they be by themselves and confidential in she fancy she endow they conversation with the inexplicable attractiveness of masculinity as masculinity be understand by woman alone she have a intense desire to overhear such a conversation and she feel that she would affront the unguessed peril of it with delight drinking it up eagerly every drop even be the draught deadly meanwhile the mere inarticulate sound of those distant voice please she and she be glad that she be listen and that the boy know it not silence succeed the banging of the front door and then after a pause she be startle to hear the crunching of gravel almost under she window in alarm she drop the blind but continue to peer between the edge of the blind and the window-frame at one point the contiguous demesne of the orgreave and the clayhanger be separate only by a poor sparse hedge a few yard in length somebody be push he way through this hedge it be edwin clayhanger despite the darkness of the night she could be sure that the dim figure be edwin clayhanger 's by the peculiar exaggerated swing of the loose arm he pass the hedge carelessly brush he clothes with he hand and walk slowly up the clayhanger garden towards the new house and in the deep shadow of the house be lose still she could catch vague noise of movement in a state of extreme excitation she wonder what he could be do it seem to she that he and she be share the night together iii she think : i would give anything to be able to speak to he privately and ask he a little more about what he say to-night i ought to i may never see he again at any rate i may never have another chance he may have mean something else he may not have be serious the skin of she face prickle and a physical wave of emotion seem to sweep downward through she whole body the thrill be exquisite but it be intimidate she whisper to herself : i could go downstairs and outside and find he and just ask he the next instant she be open the door of she bedroom no all the household have not yet retire for a light be still burn in the corridor nevertheless she might go she descend the stair ask herself aghast : why be i do this another light be burn in the hall and through the slit of the half-shut door of the breakfast-room she could see light she stand hesitant then she hear the striking of a match in the breakfast-room and she boldly push the door open tom with a book before he be light he pipe hello he say what be the matter oh nothing she reply only i be just go to walk about in the garden a minute i sha not go to sleep unless i do she speak quite easily all serene he agree so long as you keep off the grass it be bind to be damp i 'll unchain the door for you shall i she say that she could unfasten the door for herself and he do not insist the hospitality of the orgreave be never irksome tom have scarcely half-risen from he chair i sha not be long she add casually that be all right hilda he say i be not go to bed just yet all the other go he nod she pull the door to trip delicately through the hall and unchain the heavy front door as quietly as she could iv she be outside amid all the influence of the night gradually she eye accustom themselves again to the gloom she pass along the facade of the house until she come to the corner where the breeze surprise she and whence she could discern the other house and across the indistinct hedge the other garden where be edwin clayhanger be he wander in the other garden or have he enter the house then a brief flare light up a lower window of the dark mass for a few instant he be within she hesitate should she go forward or should she go back at length she go forward and find in the hedge the gap which clayhanger have make force she way through it she skirt be tear by a obstinate twig quite calmly she bent down and with she finger examine the rent it be not important she be now in the garden of the clayhanger and he whom she seek be move somewhere in the house supposing i _ do _ meet he she think what shall i say to he she do not know what she should say to he nor why she have enter upon this singular adventure but the consciousness of self the fine disturbing sense of be alive in every vein and nerve be a rich reward for she audacity she wish that that tense moment of expectation might endure for ever she approach the house tremble it be not by volition that she walk over the uneven clayey ground but by instinct she be in front of the garden-porch and here she hesitate again apparently wait for a sign from the house she glance timidly about she as though in fear of marauder that might spring out upon she from the shadow just over the boundary wall the placid flame of a gas-lamp peeped then feel with she foot for the step she ascend into the shelter of the porch almost at the same moment there be another flare behind the glass of the door she hear the sound of unlatch the flare expire she be absolutely terror-struck now the door open grate on some dirt or gravel who be there demand a queer shake voice she could see he form I she answer in a harsh tone which be the expression of she dismay the deed be do irretrievably in she bedroom she have say that she would try to speak with he and lo they be face to face in the dark in secret she terror be now at any rate desperately calm she have plunge she be fall into the deep sea she be hopelessly cut off from the past oh come the uncertain voice weakly do you want I do anyone want I she hear the door be close behind he she tell he with peculiar curtness how she have see he from she window and how she wish to ask he a important question i dare say you think it be very queer of I she add not at all he say with a insincerity that annoy she yes you do she sharply insist but i want to know -- what do she want to know -- i want to know -- do you mean it when you say -- you know at supper -- that there be no virtue in believe he stammer : do i say there be no virtue in believe she cry out irritated : of course you do do you mean to say you can say a thing like that and then forget about it if it be true it be one of the most wonderful thing that be ever say and that be why i want to know if you mean it of whether you be only say it because it sound clever she stop momentarily wonder why she be thus imply a untruth for the fact be that she have never doubt that he have be in earnest that be what they be always do in that house you know -- be clever she go on in a tone apparently inimical to ` that house ' yes come the voice i mean it why and the voice be so simple and so sincere that it pierce straight to she heart and change she secret mood swiftly to the religious so that she really be occupy by the thought with which a moment previously she have only pretended to be occupy and the splendor of the revelation be renew nevertheless some impulse perverse or defensive compel she to assume a doubt of he assurance she suspect that have she not adopt this tactic she might have melt before he in gratitude you do she murmur she thank he after that rather coldly and they talk a little about the mere worry of these religious question he protest that they never worry he and reaffirm he original proposition i hope you be right she say softly in a thrill voice she be think that this be the most wonderful miraculous experience that she have ever have v silence now she think i must go back inwardly she give a delicious sigh but just as she be about to take she prim leave the scarce-discerned figure of she companion step out into the garden by jove say edwin clayhanger it be begin to rain i do believe the wind blow and she feel rain on she cheek clayhanger advise she to stand against the other wall of the porch for better protection she obey he re-enter the porch but be still expose to the rain she call he to she side already he be so close that she could have touch he shoulder by outstretch she arm oh i be all right he say lightly and do not move you need not be afraid of I she be hurt that he have refuse she invitation to approach she the next instant she would have give she tongue not to have utter those word but she be in such a tingling state of extreme sensitiveness as render it impossible for she to exercise a normal self-control scarcely conscious of what she do she ask he the time he strike a match to look at he watch the wind blow the match out but she see he wistful face with he disorder hair under the hat it have the quality of a vision he offer to get a light in the house but abruptly she say good night then they be shake hand -- she know not how or why she could not loose he hand she think : never have i hold a hand so honest as this hand at last she drop it they stand silent while a trap rattle up trafalgar road it be as if she be bind to remain moveless until the sound of the trap have die away she walk proudly out into the rain he call to she : i say miss lessway but she do not stop in a minute she be back again in lane end house that you tom 's voice from the breakfast-room yes she answer clearly i have put the chain on good night good night thanks she ascend the stair smile to herself with the raindrop fresh on she cheek in she mind be no distinct thought either concern the non-virtue of belief or the new epoch or edwin clayhanger or even the strangeness of she behavior but all she being vibrate to the mysterious and beautiful romance of existence chapter vii the next meeting i for several day the town of bursley be to hilda simply a place make perilous and redoubtable by the apprehension of meeting edwin clayhanger accidentally in the street thereof and the burden of she meditation be : what can he have think of I she have say nothing to anybody of the deliberately-sought adventure in the garden and with the strangest ingenuous confidence she assume that edwin clayhanger too would keep a absolute silence about it she have therefore naught to fear except in the privacy of he own mind she do not blame herself -- it never occur to she to do so -- but she rather wonder at herself inimically prophesy that one day she impulsiveness would throw she into some serious difficulty the memory of the night beautifully color she whole daily existence in spite of she avoidance of the town due to she dread of see clayhanger she be constantly think : but this can not continue for ever one day i be bind to meet he again and she seem to be wait for that day it come with inevitable quickness the last day but one of June be appoint throughout the country for the celebration of the centenary of Sunday school neither hilda nor any of the orgreave child have ever see the inside of a Sunday school and the tendency up at lane end house be to condescend towards the festival as towards a rejoicing of the proletariat but in face of the magnitude of the affair loom more enormous as it approach this attitude could not be maintain the preparation for the centenary fill newspaper and change the physiognomy of town and on the morning of the ceremonial service gloriously flatter by the sun there be candid excitement at the breakfast-table of the orgreave mr orgreave regret that pressure of work would prevent he from see the fun tom be go to see the fun at hanbridge jimmie and johnnie be go to see the fun but they would not say where the servant be go to see the fun charlie have return to london alicium want to go and see the fun but as she be flush and feverish mr orgreave forbid and decide to remain at home with alicium otherwise even mrs orgreave would have go to see the fun hilda and janet apparently hesitate about go but mr orgreave point out that there could not under the most favourable circumstance be another centenary of Sunday school for at least a hundred year sarcastically urge they to set forth the fact be as janet teasingly tell he while she hang on he neck that he wish to accentuate as much as possible he own martyrdom to industry be not all the shop and office of the five town close do not every member of he family save those detain by illness attend the historic spectacle of the centenary he alone have sacrifice pleasure to work thus janet 's loving ironic smile foretold would the father of the brood discourse during the next few day ii hilda and janet accordingly go down a be-flagged and sunlit trafalgar road together janet be wear still another white dress and hilda to she marked relief have abandon black for a slate-coloured frock make by a dressmaker in bleakridge it be mrs orgreave herself who have first counsel hilda if she hate black as she say she do to abandon black the entire family chorus have approve the risk of encounter edwin clayhanger on that day of multitude be surely infinitesimal nevertheless in six minute the improbable have occur at the corner of trafalgar road and duck square janet attract by the sight of banner in the distance turn to the leave along wedgwood street and past the front of clayhanger 's shop theoretically shop be close but one shutter of clayhanger 's be down and in its place stand edwin clayhanger hilda feel she feature stiffen into a sort of wilful and insincere hostility as she shake hand within the darkness of the shop she see the figure of two dowdy woman -- doubtless the sister of whom janet have tell she they disappear before janet and hilda enter it have happen i have see he again hilda say to herself as she sit in the shop listen to janet and to edwin clayhanger it appear likely that edwin clayhanger would join they in the enterprise of witness the historic spectacle a few minute later everybody be startle by the gay apparition of osmond orgreave swing he cane curiosity have be too much for industriousness and osmond orgreave have yield himself to the general interest oh father cry janet what a deceitful thing you be only a day or two ago hilda be think i have never even hear of he and he shop seem so strange and romantic to I and now i be sit in he shop like a old friend and nobody suspect that he and i have have a secret meeting the shop itself seem to be important and prosperous mr orgreave have decide for pleasure be anxious to find it at once and under he impatience they leave the shop janet go out first with she gay father edwin clayhanger wait respectfully for hilda to pass but just as she be about to step forth she catch sight of george cannon come along the opposite side of wedgwood street in the direction of trafalgar road he be in close conversation with another man she keep within the shelter of the shop until the two have go by she do not want to meet george cannon with whom she have not have speech since the interview at the cedar he have write to she about the property sale and she have reply there be no reason why she should hesitate to meet he but she wish not to complicate the situation she think : if he see I he would come across and speak to I and i might have to introduce he to all these people and goodness know what the contretemps cause she heart to beat when they emerge from the shop janet a few yard ahead with mr orgreave be beckon iii hilda stand on a barrel by the side of edwin clayhanger on another barrel there from the top of st luke 's square they survey a vast rectangular carpet of upturned face that make a pattern of pale dot on a color and black groundwork nearly all the child of bursley thousand upon thousand be mass in the square wedge in tight together so that there seem not to be a inch of space anywhere between the shutter shop front on the east of the square and the shutter shop front on the west of the square at the bottom of the square a row of railway lorry be cram with tiny babe -- or such they appear -- toddler too weak to walk in procession at the top of the square a large platform full of bearded adult rise like a island out of the unconscious sea of infant and from every window of every house adult look down in safe ease upon that wavy ocean over which banner gleam in the dazzling and fierce sunshine she might have put up she sunshade but she would not do so she think : if all those child can stand the sun without faint i can she be extraordinarily affect by the mere sight of the immense multitude of child they be as helpless and as fatalistic as sheep utterly at the mercy of the adult who have herd they there be about they a collective wistfulness that cut the heart to dwell on the idea of it would have bring she to tear and when the multitude sing so lustily so willingly so bravely pour forth with the brass instrument a volume of tone enormous and majestic she have a tightness of the throat that be excrutiate the centenary of Sunday school be quite other than she have expect she have not bargain for these emotion it be after the hymn there be a fountain fill with blood during the quietude of a speech that edwin clayhanger take up a evangelistic phrase in the speech whisper to she : more blood what she ask amaze by he ironical accent which jar on she mood and also by he familiar manner of lean towards she and drop the word in she ear well he say look at it it only want the gange at the bottom of the square evidently for edwin clayhanger all religion be equally heathenish she be quite startle out of she amazement and she response be a almost humble entreaty not to make fun the next moment she regret that she have not answer he with sharp firmness she be somewhat out of humor with he he have begin by lose sight of mr orgreave and janet -- and of course it be hopeless to seek for they in those throng street around st luke 's square then he have say to she in a most peculiar tone : i hope you do not catch cold in the rain the other night and she have not like that she have regard it as a fault in tact almost as a sexual disloyalty on he part to refer at all to the scene in the garden finally he way of negotiate with the barrel man for the use of two barrel have be lack for hilda in the quality of largeness and masterfulness any one of the orgreave boy would she be sure have carry the thing off in a more worldly manner the climax of the service come with the singing of when i survey the wondrous cross the physical effect of it on hilda be nearly overwhelming the terrible and sublime word seem to surge upon she charge with all the multitudinous significance of the crowd she be profoundly stir and to prevent a outburst of tear she shake she head what be the matter say edwin clayhanger clumsy dolt she think have not you get enough sense to leave I alone and she say aloud passionately transform she weakness into ferocity : that be the most splendid religious verse ever write you can say what you like it be worth while believe anything if you can sing word like that and mean they he agree that the hymn be fine do you know who write it she demand threateningly he do not she be delighted dr watt of course she say with a scornful sneer what do janet mean by say that he have read simply everything iv a episode which supervene close to they barrel do a great deal to intensify the hostility of she mood on the edge of the crowd a old man who have be try to force he way through it be be guy by a gang of lout who have surround a ice-cream barrow suddenly she recognize this old man he name be shushion he be a familiar figure of the street of turnhill and he have the reputation of be the oldest Sunday school teacher in the five town he be indeed exceedingly old foolish and undignified in senility and the lout be odiously jeer at he defenceless dotage and a young policeman be obviously with the lout and against the aged fatuous victim hilda give a exclamation of revolt and call upon edwin clayhanger to go to the rescue of mr shushion not he however but she jump down first and push towards the barrow she make the path and he follow she protest to the policeman and he too modestly second she yet the policeman ignore she address himself to edwin clayhanger hilda be infuriate it appear that old mr shushion have have a ticket for the platform but have lose it he must be get on to the platform somehow she decide with a fiery glance but edwin clayhanger seem to be incapable of a heroic action he hesitate the policeman hesitate fortunately the plight of the doting oldest Sunday school teacher in the five town have be observe from the platform and two fussy rosetted official bustle up and offer to take charge of he and hilda dissolve in painful pity bent over he softly and arrange he disorder clothes she be weep shall we go back to we barrel edwin clayhanger rather sheepishly suggest after mr shushion have be drag away but she would not go back to the barrel i think it be time we set about to find janet and mr orgreave she reply coldly and they draw out of the crowd she be profoundly deceive in edwin clayhanger so famous for he presence of mind in save printing-shop from destruction she do not know what he ought to have do she make no attempt to conceive what he ought to have do but that he ought to have do something -- something decisive and grandly masculine -- she be sure v later after sundry adventure and have find mr orgreave and janet they stand at the tail of the steam-car which janet have decide should carry she up to bleakridge and edwin shake hand yes hilda be profoundly deceive in he nevertheless he wistful and honest glance as he part from she have its effect if he have not one quality he have another she try hard to maintain she scorn of he but it be exceedingly difficult to do so mr orgreave wipe he brow as the car jolt they out of the tumult of the centenary it be hot but he do not seem to be in the slightest degree fatigue or dispirited whereas janet put back she head and shut she eye catch sight of a friend of yours this morning hilda he say pleasantly oh yes mr cannon by the way i forget to tell you yesterday that he famous newspaper -- _ yours _ -- have come to a end he speak as it be with calm sympathy yes well it be not surprising not surprising nothing 's ever stand up against the _ signal _ yet hilda be sadden when they reach lane end house a few seconds in front of the hurry and apologetic servant mr orgreave tell she that mr george cannon have call to see she and have leave a note for she she run up to she room with the note it say merely that the writer wish to have a interview with she at once \* \* \* \* \* book iii she burden chapter i hilda indispensable i hilda make no response of any kind to george cannon 's request for a immediate interview allow day after day to pass in inactivity and wonder the while how she might excuse or explain she singular conduct when circumstance should bring the situation to a head she know that she ought either to go over to turnhill or write he with a appointment to see she at lane end house but she do nothing nor do she say a word of the matter to janet in the bedroom at night all that she could tell herself be that she do not want to see george cannon she be not honestly persuade that she fear to see he in the meantime edwin clayhanger be invisible though the removal of the clayhanger household to the new residence at bleakridge have make a considerable stir of straw and litter in trafalgar road on Tuesday in the follow week she receive a letter from sarah gailey it be bring up to she room early in the morning by a half-dressed alicium orgreave and she read it as she lay in bed sarah gailey struggle with the complexity of the cedar away in hornsey be unwell and gloomily desolate she write that she suffer from terrible headache on waking and that she be often feverish and that she have no energy whatever i be at a very try age for a woman she say i do not know whether you understand but i have come to a time of life that really upset one above a bit and i be fit for nothing hilda understand she be flatter even touch by this confidence it make she feel older and more important in the world and a whole generation away from alicium who be draw up the blind with the cry and awkward gesture of a prattle infant to the letter there be a postscript : have george be to see you yet about I he write I he should but i have not hear since in fact i have be wait to hear i 'll say nothing about that yet i be ashamed you should be bother it be so important for you to have a good holiday again much love sg the prim handwriting get smaller and smaller towards the end of the postscript and the end of the page and the last line be perfectly parallel with the lower edge of the paper all the other slope feebly downwards from leave to right oh pipe alicium from the window maggie clayhanger have get she curtain up in the drawing-room oh be not they proud thing _ oh _ -- i do believe she be catch I stare at she and alicium withdraw abruptly into the room blush for she detect sin of ungenteel curiosity she bump down on the bed three day more she say not count to-day four count to-day school alicium nod she finger in she mouth be not it horrid go to school on a day like this i hear you and janet be off up to hillport this afternoon again to play tennis you do have time no say hilda i have get to go to turnhill this afternoon but janet tell I you be -- she glance fall on the letter be it business yes the child be impressed and she change of tone she frank awe give pleasure to hilda 's vanity shall i go and tell jane she be not near dress yes do off scampered alicium leave the door unlatch behind she hilda gaze at the letter hold it limply in she left hand amid the soft disorder of the counterpane it have come to she a intolerably pathetic messenger and accuser out of the exacerbate frowsiness of the cedar yesterday afternoon care-ridden sarah gailey be write it with sigh at the desk in she stuffy uncomfortable bedroom as hilda gaze at the formation of the word she could see the unhappy sarah gailey write they and the letter be like a bit of sarah gailey 's self magically and disconcertingly project into the spacious laughing home of the orgreave and into the mysterious new happiness that be form around hilda the orgreave so far as hilda could discover have no real anxiety they be a joyous lot favor alike by temperament and by fortune and she hilda -- what real anxiety have she none she be sure of a small but adequate income she grief for she mother be assuage the problem of she soul no longer trouble : in part it have be solve and in part it have fade imperceptibly away nor be she exercise about the future about the ` new life ' instead of rush ardently to meet the future she feel content to wait for its come why disturb oneself she be free she be enjoy existence with the orgreave yes she be happy in this roseate passivity the letter shake she arouse as it do the sharp sense of she indebtedness to sarah gailey who alone have succour she in she long period of despair infelicity have she guess that it be sarah gailey 's affair upon which george cannon have desire to see she she would not have delay a hour no reluctance to meet george cannon would have cause she to tarry but she have not guess the idea have never occur to she she rise pick up the envelope from the carpet carefully replace the letter in it and lay it with love on the glitter dressing-table through the unlatched door she hear a tramp of unshod masculine foot in the passage and the delightful curt greet of osmond orgreave and he sleepy son jimmie -- splendid powerful male she glance at the garden and at the garden of the clayhanger swim in fresh sunshine she glance in the mirror and see the deshabille of she black hair and of she insecure nightgown and thought : truly i be not so bad-looking and how well i feel how fond they all be of I i be just at the right age i be young but i be mature i have have a lot of experience and i be not a fool i be strong -- i could stand anything she put she shoulder back with a challenging gesture the pride of life be hers and then this disturbing vision of sarah gailey alone unhappy unattractive enfeebled ageing -- age it seem to she inexpressibly cruel that people must grow old and weak and desolate it seem monstrous a pang momentary but excruciating smite she she say to herself : sarah gailey have nothing to look forward to except worry sarah gailey be at the end instead of at the begin ii when she get off the train at turnhill station early that afternoon she have no qualm at the thought of meeting george cannon she be not even concern to invent a decent excuse for she silence in relation to he urgent letter she go to see he for the sake of sarah gailey and because she apparently might be of use in some affair of sarah 's -- she know not what she be proud that either sarah or he think that she could be of use or that it be worth while consult she she have a grave air as of one to whom esteem have bring responsibility in child street lead to high street she pass the office of godliman the auctioneer and there among a group of white poster cover the large window be a poster of the sale of valuable household furniture and effect remove from no 15 lessway street and on the poster in a very black line by itself stand out saliently the phrase : massive bedroom suite she mother 's hers she have to stop and read the poster through though she be curiously afraid of be catch in the act all the principal item be mention by the faithful auctioneer and the furniture thus describe have a strange aspect of special importance as if it have be subtly better more solid more desirable than any other houseful of furniture in the town -- lessway ' furniture she seek for the date the sale have take place on the previous night at the very hour when she be loll and laugh in the drawing-room of lane end house with the orgreave the furniture be sell dispersed go the house be empty the past be irremediably close the realization of this naturally affect she raising phantom of she mother and of the face of the cab-driver as he remark on the draw blind at the cedar but she be still more affect by the thought that the poster be on the window and the furniture scatter solely because she have will it she have say : please sell all the furniture and you need not consult I about the sale i do not want to know i prefer not to know just get it do and it have be do how mysteriously romantic some girl would not have sell the furniture would not have dare to sell it would have accept the furniture and the house as a solemn charge and go on living among those relic obedient to a tradition but she have dare she have will -- and the solid furniture have vanish away and she be adventurously free she go forward at the corner of child street and high street the new town hall be rise to the sky already its wall be higher than the highest house in the vicinity and workman be crawl over it amid dust and a load of crimson brick be tremble and revolve upward on a thin rope that hang down from the blue glimpse of london have modify old estimate of she native town nevertheless the new town hall still appear extraordinarily large and important to she she see the detest arthur dayson in the distance of the street and cross hurriedly to the square look fixedly at the storey above the ironmonger 's so that arthur dayson could not possibly catch she eye there be no sign of the _ five town chronicle _ in the bare window of the second storey this do not surprise she but she be startle by the absence of the karkeek wire-blind from the first-floor window equally bare with those of the second when she get to the entrance she be still more startle to observe that the karkeek brass-plate have be remove she climb the long stair apprehensively iii anybody here she call out timidly she be in the clerk 's office which be empty but she could hear movement in another room the place seem in process of be dismantle suddenly george cannon appear in a doorway frown good afternoon mr cannon good afternoon miss lessway he speak with stiff politeness he face look weary after a slight hesitation he advance and they shake hand hilda be nervous she neglect of he letter now present itself to she as inexcusable she think : if he be vex about it i shall have to humor he i really

begin when they be both seat in he own room there be still a lot of papers though fewer than of old on the broad desk but the bookcase be quite empty and several of the shelf in it have sup from the horizontal the front part of the shelf be a pale yellow and behind that a irregular dark band of dust indicate the vary depths of the vanish tome the forlornness of the bookcase give a stricken air to the whole room she be not well or she imagine she be not well oh no say hilda warmly it be not imagination she really be not well you think so i do not think -- i know hilda speak proudly but with the restraint which absolute certainty permit she crush rather than resent george cannon 's easy insinuation full of the unjustified superiority of the male how could he judge -- how could any man judge she have never before feel so sure of herself so adult and experienced as she feel then but it be nothing serious he suggest with deference n -- no -- not what you would call serious say hilda judicially mysteriously because she want to give up the boarding-house business altogether -- that be all have deliver this dramatic blow george cannon smile as it be quizzically and hilda be reassure about he she have be think : be he ruin if he be not ruin what be the meaning of these puzzling change here and she have remember she shrewd mother 's hint and she own later fear concern the insecurity of he position : and have study he tired and worn face for a equivocal sign but this smile self-confident and firm be not the smile of a ruin man and he flash glance seem to be a omen of definite success want to give it up exclaimed hilda he nod but why i think she be do rather well so she be then why ah george cannon lift he head with a gesture signify enigma that be just what i want to ask you have not she say anything to you as to give it up no so it be this that you want to see I about he nod she write I a few day after you come away and suggest i should see you and ask you what you think but why I well she think the world of you sarah do hilda thought : how strange she do nothing but look after I and wait on I hand and foot and i never help she in any way and yet she turn to I and she be extremely flattered and gratified and be aware of a delicious increase of self-respect but suppose she do give it up hilda say aloud what will she do exactly say george cannon and then in a very confidential ingratiating manner : i wish you would write to she and put some reason into she she must not give it up with she help -- and you know in the management she be simply wonderful -- with she help i think i shall be able to bring something about that 'll startle folk only she must not throw I over and she must not get too crotchety with the boarder i have have some difficulty in that line as it be in fact i have have to be rather cross you know about the boutwood for instance well i have smooth that over it be nothing nothing -- if she 'll keep she head if she 'll keep she head it be a gold mine -- you 'll see only -- she want a bit of manage if you would write -- i sha not write say hilda i shall go and see she -- at once i should have go in any case after

she for something which he admit he could not accomplish himself those two people george cannon and sarah gailey have both instinctively turn to she in a crisis none could do what she could do she by the force of she individuality could save the situation she be no longer a girl but a mature and influential be she ancient diffidence before george cannon have completely go she have no qualm no foreboding no dubious sensation of weakness indeed she feel herself in one respect he superior for he confidence in sarah gailey 's housewifely skill he conviction that it be unique and would be irreplaceable strike she as somewhat naif as be yet another example of the absurd family pride which she and she mother have often notice in the five town she be not happy at the prospect of so abruptly quit the delight of lane end house and the vicinity of edwin clayhanger she be not happy at the prospect of postpone the consideration of plan for she own existence she be not happy at the prospect of sarah gailey 's pessimistic complaining she be above happiness she be above even that thrill of sharp and intense vitality which in time past have ennoble trouble and misery she have the most exquisite feeling of triumphant self-justification she be splendidly conscious of power she be indispensable and the dismantle desolation of the echo office and the mystery of george cannon 's personal position somehow give a strange poignancy to she mood they talk of indifferent matter : she property the orgreave even the defunct newspaper as to which george cannon shrug he shoulder then the conversation droop i shall go up by the four train to-morrow she say clinch the interview and rise i may go up by that train myself say george cannon she start oh be you go to hornsey too no not hornsey i have other business chapter ii sarah 's benefactor i on the follow afternoon hilda travel alone by the local train from bleakridge to knype the central station where all voyager for london birmingham and manchester have to foregather in order to take the fast express that unwillingly halt there and there only in they skim flight across the district it be a custom of five town hospitality that a depart guest should be accompany as far as knype and stow with personal attention into the big train but on this occasion hilda have wish otherwise i should _ prefer _ nobody to go with I to knype she have say in a characteristic tone to janet it be enough the family have wonder but it be enough the family know its singular its mysterious hilda and instead of at knype the leave-takings have occur at the little wayside station of bleakridge with wavy moorland behind factory chimney in front and cinder and shawd heap all around hilda have tell janet : mr cannon may be meet I at knype he be probably go to london too and the discreet janet comprehend hilda have not even mention this fact to the rest of the family george cannon in a light summer suit and straw hat be already on the platform at knype hilda have fear that at bleakridge he might be look out of the window of the local train which start from turnhill she have desire not to meet he in the presence of any of the orgreave but either he have catch the previous train to knype or he have drive down hold a gladstone bag and a stick in one hand he stand talk to another man of about he own age and height the conversation be vivacious at any rate on george cannon 's part hilda pass close by he amid the populous stir of the expectant platform he see she turn and raise he hat but in a perfunctory preoccupy manner and instantly resume the speech to he companion hilda recognize the latter it be ` young lawton ' son and successor to ` old lawton ' the most famous lawyer in the five town young lawton have a branch office at turnhill and live in a important house half-way between turnhill and bursley where behind the town hall be the historic principal office of the firm the express come loudly in and hilda have climb into a second-class compartment lean out from it to descry she porter and bestow on he a threepenny bit george cannon and young lawton be still in argument and apparently quite indifferent to the train young lawton 's thin face have its usual faint harsh smile he limb be moveless in a exasperating and obstinate calm hilda detest the man from he mere look but george cannon be very obviously under excitement he face be flush he move he free arm violently -- even the gladstone bag swing to and fro he punctuate he sentence with sharp angry nod of the head insist and protest and insist while the other say much less maintain he damnable stupid disdainful grin would he let the train go in he feverish preoccupation hilda be seriously afraid that he would the last trunk be fling into the front van the stationmaster in he tall hat wave curtly to the glitter guard the guard wave he flag and whistle a porter bang the door of hilda 's compartment ignore she gesture the engine whistle and at that moment george cannon throw apparently a last malediction at young lawton spring towards the train and see hilda 's face rush to the door which she strain to open again i be afraid you would be leave behind she say as he drop he bag on the seat and the affronted stationmaster himself shut the door not quite ejaculated cannon grimly the smooth irresistible glide of the train become apparent establish a sudden aloof calm hilda perceive that all she muscle be tense in the compartment be a middle-aged couple what be this place ask the woman look like tamworth say the man sleepily knype sir george cannon correct he very sharply he be so work up that he have omit even to shake hand with hilda make no effort to talk and show no curiosity about hilda 's welfare or doings he move uneasily on he seat and from time to time open and shut the gladstone bag gradually the flush pale from he face at lichfield the middle-aged couple take advice from a porter and stumble out of the train ii we be fairly out of the smoke now say hilda when the train begin to move again as a fact they have be fairly out of the smoke of the five town for more than half a hour but hilda speak at random timidly nervously for the sake of speaking and she be as apologetic as though it be she herself who by some untimely discretion have annoyed george cannon yes thank god he reply fiercely blow with pleasure upon the ember of he resentment and i 'll take good care i never go into it again -- to live that be really she murmur strike into a extreme astonishment he produce a cigar and a match-box may i he demand carelessly and accept she affirmative as of course you have hear about my little affair he ask after light the cigar and he gaze at she curiously no do you mean to say that none of the orgreave have say anything this last day or two he lean forward they be in opposite corner no she repeat stiffly nevertheless she remember a peculiar glance of tom 's to he father on the previous day when george cannon 's name have be mention well say he you surprise I that be all but -- she stop full of misgiving never hear any gossip about I -- never he persist as it be menace she she shake she head never hear that i be not really a solicitor oh well -- i think mother once do say something -- i think so but i do not understand those thing she say simply be anything the matter be -- nothing he reply calm and convincing only i have be do do you 'll hear about it some day i dare say shall i tell you would you like I to tell you he smile rather boyishly and lean back yes she nod he attitude be very familiar recall they former relation of employer and employ it seem as natural to she as to he that he should not too ceremoniously conceal he feeling or disguise he mood well you see i expect i know as much about law as any of 'em but i have never be admit and so -- he stop perceive that she do not comprehend the significance of such a word as ` admit ' if you want to practice as a solicitor you have to pass examination and i never have pass examination very expensive all that and i could not afford when i be young it be not the exam that be difficult -- you may tell that from the fellow that pass they lawton for instance but after a certain age exam become a nuisance however i could do everything else i might have have half a dozen situation as manage clerk in the five town if i would want only i do not want i want to be on my own i could get client as quick as any of they _ and _ quicker so i find karkeek -- the excellent mr karkeek another of the bright one that could pass the exam oh he would pass the exam all right he would spend five year and i do not know how many hundred pound in pass the exam and with it all he could not get above a couple of pound a week there be hundred of real solicitor up and down the country who be not earn more and they be not worth more but i give he more and a lot more just to use he name on my door and my blind see in theory i be he clerk but in reality he be mine it be all quite clear he understand -- i should think he do by jove george cannon laugh shortly every one understand i get a practice together in no time _ he _ do not do it he would not have get a practice together in a thousand year i have the second-best practice in turnhill and i should soon have have the best -- if i have not be do yes say hilda the confidence flatter she well karkeek come into some money -- and he simply walk out of the office simply walk out do not give I time to turn round i would always treat he properly but he be jealous what a shame hilda 's scorn shrivel up mr karkeek there be nothing that she detest so much as a disloyalty yes i could not stop he of course no formal agreement between we could not be in a case like ours so he have I he would take my wages quick enough as long as it suit he then he come into money and behave like that jealousy they be all jealous -- always have be i be do too well so i have the whole gang down on I instantly like a thousand of brick they know i be helpless and so they come on special meeting of the committee of the north staffordshire law society if you please rumor of prosecution -- oh yes i do not know what all because i would not take the trouble to pass they wretched exam why i could pass they exam on my head if i have not anything better to do but i have at first i think i would retire for five year and pass they exam and then come back and make 'em sit up and would not i have make 'em sit up but then i say to myself ` no it be not good enough ' hilda frown what be not what the five town be not good enough i can find something better than the law and i can find something better than the five town and here young lawton have the impudence to begin to preach to I on knype platform and to tell I i be wise in go he be the president of the local law society you know no end of a president and have not even get gumption enough to keep he father 's practice together stupid ass well i let he have it and straight he be no worse than the rest they have get no brain in this district and they be so narrow -- narrow be not the word thick-headed 's the word stupid mean mean what do it matter to they i keep to all they rule there be a real solicitor on the premise and there would soon have be another if i would have time no concern of theirs how the money be divide between I and the real solicitor but they be jealous -- there you be they do not understand enterprise they hate it nothing ever move in the five town and they have get no manners -- i do believe that be the worst look at lawton 's manners nothing but a boor they be not civilized yet -- that be what be the matter with they that be what my father use to say barbarian he use to say ' _ ce sont des barbares _ ' kid use to throw stone at he because of he neck-tie the grown-up chuck a brick at anything they do not quite fancy that be they idea of wit hilda be afraid of he tempestuous mood but she enjoy she fear as she might have enjoy exposure to a dangerous storm she enjoy the sensation of she fragility and helplessness there coop up with he in the close intimacy of the compartment she be glad that he do not apologize to she for he lack of restraint nor foolishly pretend that he be bore she it do seem a shame she murmur she eye candidly admit that she feel enormously flattered he sigh and laugh how often have i hear my father say that -- ' _ ce sont des barbares _ ' peel only bring he over because they could find nobody in the five town civilized enough to do the work that he do i can imagine how he must have feel when he first come here my god environment i tell you what -- it be only lately i have realize how i loathe the province the little interior in which they be sweep steadily and smoothly across the central sunlit plain of england pass canal and brook and cottage and church -- silent and stolid in that english stupidity that he be criticize and hilda saw of george cannon all that be french in he she see he quite anew as something rather exotic and entirely marvellous she think : when i first meet he i say to myself he be a most extraordinary man and i be right i be more right than i ever imagine no one down there have any idea of what he really be they be too stupid as he say he impose on she he scorn of the provincial she have to share it she have a vision of the five town as a smoky blotch on the remote horizon -- negligible crass ridiculous in its heavy self-complacency the very orgreave themselves be tinge with this odious english provincialism he smile to himself and then say very quietly : it be not of the least importance you know in fact i be rather glad i have never have any difficulty in make money and when i have settle up everything down there i sha not be precisely without and i shall have no excuse for not branch out in a new line she meekly encourage he to continue oh yes he go on the law be not the only thing -- not by a long way and besides i be sick of it do you know what the great thing of the future be i mean the really great thing -- the smash big thing he smile kindly and confidential she too smile shake she head well i 'll tell you hotel hotel she be perfectly nonplussed hotel there 'll be more money and more fun to be get out of hotel soon than out of any other kind of enterprise in the world you should see those hotel that be go up in london they would give you a start and no mistake yes hotel there be not twenty people in england who know what a hotel be but i know he pause and add reflectively in a comically naïve tone : curious how these thing come to you bit by bit now if it have not be for sarah -- and that boarding-house -- he be use he straw hat as a fan with a unexpected and almost childlike gesture he suddenly throw the hat up on to the rack above he head how 's that what a boy he be after all think hilda sympathetically wonder why in the midst of all she manifold astonishment she feel so light-hearted and gay funny parcel you have get up there he idly observe glance from one rack to the other the parcel contain mr orgreave 's generous conception of a repast proper to be eat in a train in place of high tea he help she to eat it as the train approach london he resume he manhood and he be impeccably adult as he conduct she from euston to king 's cross and put she into a train in a corner of the station that the summer twilight have already take possession of iii late at night hilda sit with sarah gailey in the landlady 's small bedroom at the cedar it be light by a lamp because the builder of the house hate excess have think fit not to carry gas-pipe higher than the first floor a large but old bedstead fill half the floor space on the shabby dressing-table a pile of bill and various papers lay near the lamp clothes be hang behind the door and a vague wisp of muslin move slightly in the warm draught from the tiny open window there be two small cane-chair enamel on which the woman sit close to each other both incommode by the unwholesome sultriness of the only chamber that could be spare for the private use of the house-mistress this small bedroom be sarah gailey 's home its amenity be the ultimate nightly reward of she labor if george cannon have obtain possession of the cedar as a occupation for sarah this room and sarah 's pleasure therein be the sole justification of the entire mansion as hilda look at sarah gailey 's bow head but little greyed beneath the ray of the lamp and at she shrivel neurotic plaintive face in shadow and at she knotty hand loosely clasp she contrast she companion and the scene with the youthfulness and the spaciousness and the sturdy gay vigor of existence in the household of the orgreave she think with a renew sense of the mysterious strangeness of life : last night i be there far away -- all those score of mile of field and town be between -- and to-night i be here down there i be nothing but a idler here i be the strongest i be indispensable i be the one person on whom she depend without I everything will go to piece and she think of george cannon 's vast enigmatic project concern grand hotel in pass the immense pile of st pancra on the way from euston to king 's cross george cannon have wave he hand and say : look at that look at that it be something after that style that i want for a toy and i 'll have it yes the lofty turret of st pancra have not intimidate he he fresh from little turnhill and from defeat could rise at once to the height of they and by the force of imagination make they he own he could turn abruptly from the law -- to hotel a disconcerting man and the mere tone in which he mention he enterprise seem in a most surprising way to dignify hotel and even boarding-house to give romance to the perfectly unromantic business of lodging and catering and the seed from which he be to grow the magic plant sit in the room there with hilda : that bow head the ambition and the dream resemble st pancra : the present reality be the cedar and sarah 's poor stuffy little bedroom in the cedar sarah begin to cry weakly but what be the matter ask hilda the strong succourer nothing only it be such a relief to I you have come hilda deprecate lightly i should have come sooner if i would know you ought to have send word before no i could not after all what be it i be only silly there be nothing really the matter the minute you come i can see that i can even stand those boutwood if you be here you know george make it up with they and i will not say he be not right but i have to put my pride in my pocket and yesterday it nearly make I scream out to see mr boutwood stir she tea but why i do not know it be nerve that be what it be well i have get to go through these she finger the papers on the dressing-table with she left hand while dry she tear with the right he be very wishful for proper account george be that be right enough but -- well -- i think i can make a shilling go as far as anyone and choose flesh-meat with anyone too -- that i will say -- but these account george be always want to know how much it cost a head a week for this that and the other it be all very well for he but if he have the servant to look after and -- i be go to keep you account for you hilda soothe she but -- i be go to keep you account for you and she think : how exactly like mother i be just then it appear to hilda that she be make a promise and shoulder a responsibility against she will and perhaps against she common sense she might keep account at the cedar for a week a fortnight a month but she could not keep account there indefinitely she be sowing complication for herself freedom and change and luxury be what she deem she desire not a desk in a boarding-house and yet something within she compel she to say in a firm sure kindly voice : now give I all those papers miss gailey and amid indefinite regret and foreboding she be proud and happy in she rôle of benefactor when hilda at length rise to go to she own room sarah gailey have to move she chair so that she might pass at the door both hesitate for a instant and then hilda with a sudden gesture advance she lip it be the first time she and sarah have ever kiss the contact with that desiccate skin intensify to a extraordinary degree hilda 's emotional sympathy for the ageing woman she think poignantly : poor old thing and when she be on the dark little square landing under the roof sarah hold the lamp call out in a whisper hilda well do he say anything to you about brighton brighton she perceive with certainty from sarah 's eager and yet apologetic tone that the question have be wait for utterance throughout the evening and that sarah have lack courage for it until the kiss have enhearten she and also she perceive that sarah be suspect she of be somehow in conspiracy with george cannon yes say sarah he be get into he head that brighton 's the only place for this boarding-house business if it be to be properly do he never say a word to I about brighton hilda whisper positively oh hilda descend the stair grope brighton what next chapter iii at brighton i she think vividly one afternoon about three month later of that final scrap of conversation just as she have sit opposite george cannon in a second-class compartment so now she be sit opposite sarah gailey in a second-class compartment the train have pass lewe be within a few minute of brighton and follow behind they somewhere at the tail of the train be certain trunk contain all that she possess and all that sarah gailey possess of personal property -- they sole chattel and paraphernalia on earth george cannon have will it and bring it about he be to receive they on the platform of brighton station she have not see very much of he in the interval for he have be continually on the move between brighton and turnhill in a moment we shall all be together again she reflect this meeting also will happen as everything else have happen and a new period will definitely have begin and she sit and stare at the closed eye of the desiccate sarah gailey and wait for the instant of arrival apprehensively and as it be incredulously -- not with fear not with pleasure but with the foreboding of adventure and a curious idea that the instant of arrival never would come for thirteen week which have go very quickly she have devote herself to sarah gailey act as george cannon 's precursor prophet and expounder while the summer cool into autumn and the boarding-house season slacken and once more feebly brighten she have daily converse with sarah about george 's plan make they palatable to she soften the shock of they and voluntarily promising not to quit she until the crisis be past she have have to discourse on the unique advantage of brighton as a field for george 's enterprise and on george 's common sense and on sarah 's common sense and the interdependence of the two when the news come that george have acquire down there a house in go order she have have to prove that it be not the end of the world that be announce when the news come that george have re-sell the cedar to its original occupier she have have to prove that the transaction do not signify a mysterious but mortal insult to sarah when the news come that the cedar must be vacate before noon on a give Saturday she have have to begin all she demonstration afresh and in addition attempt to persuade sarah that george be not utterly mad -- buying and sell boarding-house tenancy all over the south of england -- and that the exit from the cedar would not be the ruin of dignity and peace and the commencement of fatal disaster in the hour when sarah gailey learn the immutable Saturday of departure the cedar which have be she hell promise to become on that very Saturday a paradise on the whole the three month have constitute a quarter of exceed difficulty and delicacy the first month have be render memorable by sarah 's astonishing behavior when hilda have desire to pay as before for she board and lodge the mere offer of the money have make plain to sarah -- what she then say she have always suspect -- that hilda be she enemy in disguise and -lrb- like the rest -rrb- bent on humiliating she and outrage she most sacred feeling in that encounter but in no other sarah have win the opportune withdrawal of the boutwood from the boarding-house have assist the establishment of peace when the boutwood leave miss gailey seem to breathe the drawing-room air as though it be ozone of the mountain but she joy have be quickly dissipate for to dissipate joy be she chief recreation a fortnight before the migration to brighton hilda contemplate all that have to be do have think aghast : i shall never he able to humor she into do it all closing of account dismissal inventory bill receipt pack decision concern train reception of the former proprietor -lrb- especially that -rrb- good-bye superintend the stowage of luggage on the cab george cannon have not once appear in the last sensitive week and he have therein be wise and all that have to be do have be do -- not by hilda but by sarah gailey the touchy and the competent hilda have do little but the humor ii and there sit sarah gailey deracinate and captive to prove how influential a person hilda be with the eye shut sarah 's worn face under she black bonnet have precisely the aspect of a corpse -- and the corpse of somebody who have expire under the weight of all the world 's woe hilda think : when she be dead she will look just like that and one day sooner or later she will be dead strange that sarah gailey with no malady except she chronic rheumatism and no material anxiety and every prospect of security in old age could not be content could not at any rate refrain from be miserable but she could not she be a exhaustless fount of worry and misery i suppose i like she thought hilda but why do i like she she be not agreeable she be not amusing she be not pretty she be not even kind now she be only depressing and tedious as soon as she be fix up here i shall go i shall leave she i have do enough and i have have enough i must attend to my own affair a bit after all -- and then hilda 's conscience interrupt : but can you leave she altogether without you what will happen to she she be get older and worse every day perhaps in a few year she will not even be competent already she be not perhaps quite quite as competent as she be and hilda say : well of course i shall have to keep a eye on she come and see she sometimes -- often and she know that as long as they both live she could never be free from a sense of responsibility towards sarah gailey useless to argue : it be george cannon 's affair not mine useless to ask : _ why _ should i feel responsible only after she have lay sarah gailey in the tomb would she be free and that day too will come she think again i shall have to go through it and i shall go through it the poignant romance of existence envelop she in its beautiful veil and through these veil she see vague and diminish the far vista of the hour which she have spend with the orgreave she see the night of edwin clayhanger 's visit and herself and he together in the porch and she remember the shock of he word there be no virtue in believe the vision be like that of another and quite separate life would she ever go back to it janet be she friend in theory she one intimate friend : she have see she once in london -- beautiful agreeable affectionate intelligent all the orgreave be lovable the glance of edwin clayhanger and the sincerity of he smile have affect she in a manner absolutely unique but would she ever go back it seem to she fantastic impossible that she should ever go back it seem to she that she be net by destiny in any case she know that she could not meanwhile give to that group in bursley even a part of herself hilda could never give a part of herself moreover she be a bad letter-writer and so if among themselves the group at bursley charge she with inconstancy she must accept the accusation to which she be inevitably expose by the very ardor of she temperament the putting-on of brake take she unaware the train be in brighton slide over the outskirts of the town miss gailey open she apprehensive eye hilda saw steep street of house that sprawl on the hilly mound of the great town like ladder : reminiscent of certain street of she native district yet quite different a physiognomy utterly foreign to she this then be brighton that which have be a postmark become suddenly a reality shatter she preconception of it and disappointing she she know not why she glance forward through the window and see the cavern of the station in a few seconds they would have arrive and she formal mission would be over she be very agitate and very nervous george cannon have promise to meet they would he meet they the next instant she see the platform she see george cannon conspicuous and debonair in a new suit swing he ebony stick the train stop he descry they there he be she say bravely pretend to be gay and she think : i could not believe that this moment would come but it have come she have anticipate relief from this moment but she be aware of no relief on the contrary she feel most uncomfortably apologetic to sarah gailey for george cannon and to george cannon for sarah gailey she have the constraint of a sinner and by the side of george cannon on the platform she be aware of she shabbiness and of she girlish fragility nevertheless she put she shoulder back with a gesture like he own thinking proudly and try to make she eye speak : well here be sarah gailey -- thanks to I as sarah greet he hilda observe with some dismay a curious very slight stiffening of she demeanor -- familiar phenomenon which denote that sarah be in the grip of a secret grievance poor old thing she think ruefully i would imagine she would forgive he for bring she here but she have not iii they drive down from the station in a open carriage unencumbered by the trunk which george cannon have separately dispose of he sit with he back to the horse opposite the two woman and talk at interval about the weather the prospects of the season and the town he familiarity with the town be apparently such that he seem to be a native of it and even in some mysterious way to have assist in its creation and development so that he take pride in its quality and accept responsibility for its defect when he ceremoniously salute two woman who go by in another carriage hilda feel sharply the inferiority of a ignorant stranger in presence of one for whom the place have no secret she first disappointment change slowly into expectant and hopeful curiosity the quaint irregularity of the architecture and the vastness of the throng perspective make promise to she romantic sense the town seem to be endless as london there be hotel church chapel library and music-shop on every hand the more ordinary feature of main street -- the mart of jewellery drapery and tobacco -- have a air of grandiose respectability while the narrow alley that curve enigmatically away between the lofty building of these fine thoroughfare beckon darkly to the fancy the multiplicity of beggar lout and organ-grinder be alone a proof of brighton 's success in the world the organ-grinder often a man and a woman yoke together be extraordinarily english genteel and prosperous as they trudge in they neat middle-class raiment through the gritty mud of the macadam stolidly ignore the menace of high-stepping horse and disdainful glittering wheel brighton be evidently a city apart nevertheless hilda do not as yet understand why george cannon should have consider it to be the sole field worthy of he enterprise then the carriage round into king 's road and suddenly she see the incredible frontage of hotel and _ pension _ and apartment and she see the broad and boundless promenade alive with all its procession of pleasure and she see the ocean and everything that she have see up to that moment fall to the insignificance of a background she understand after a blusterous but mild autumn day the scarlet sun be set calmly between a saffron sky and saffron water it flash upon wave and sail and flag and upon the puddle in the road and upon bow-window and flowered balcony give glory to human pride the carriage merge in a phalanx of carriage roll past innumerable splendid house and every house without exception be a hostel and a invitation some be higher than any she have ever see and one terrific building in course of construction have already far overtop the highest of its neighbor she glance at george cannon who by a carefully casual demeanor be try not to take the credit of the entire spectacle and she admit that he be indeed wonderful of course sarah he say as the carriage shortly afterwards turn up preston street where the die wind roughly catch they we be not begin with anything as big as all that so you need not shiver in you shoe you know what my notion be -- he include hilda in he address -- my notion be to get some experience first in a smaller house we must pay for we experience and my notion be to pay as little as possible i can tell you there be quite a lot of thing that have to be pick up before you have get the hang of a town like this -- quite a lot sarah grimly nod she have scarcely speak we be begin rather well i have tell you all about the watchett sister have not i they be a income a positive income and then boutwood and he wife have decide to come -- do i tell you bou -- the syllable escape explosively from sarah gailey 's mouth overcome she stern guard instantly by a tremendous effort she check the flow but the violent shock of the news have convulse she whole be the look on she face be change to desperation hilda tremble and even the splendid and ever-resurgent george cannon be discountenance not till then have hilda realize with what intense bitterness the souvenir of the boutwood fester in sarah gailey 's unreasoning heart iv here we be say george cannon jauntily as the carriage stop in front of no 59 preston street but he jauntiness seem factitious the demeanor of all three be diffident and unnatural for now have arrive the moment when george cannon have to submit he go concern to the ordeal of inspection by the woman and especially by sarah gailey there the house stand a physical fact force george to justify it and beseech clemency from the two woman the occasion be critical therefore everybody have to pretend that it be a perfectly ordinary occasion well know the futility of the pretence and the inevitable constraint be acutely aggravate by sarah 's silent and terrible reception of the news concern the boutwood while george cannon be pay the driver sarah and hilda hesitate awkwardly on the pavement they hand occupy with small belongings they have the sensation of be foreigner to the house they could not even mount the step without he protection scarcely might they in decency examine the frontage of the house they could not however avoid see that a workman be fix a new and splendid brass-plate at the entrance and that this plate bear the word cannon 's board - house hilda think startle : at last he be use he own name he turn to they you have a view of the sea from the bow-window of the drawing-room -- on the first floor he remark neither hilda nor sarah respond and of course from the other bow-window higher up he add almost pitifully in he careful casualness hilda feel sorry for he and she could not understand why she feel sorry why it seem a shame that he should be mysteriously compel thus to defend the house before it have be attack oh yes she murmur foolishly almost fatuously the street and the house be disappointing after the grandeur of the promenade the street appear shabby and third-rate it have the characteristic of a side street it be the retreat of those who could not afford anything better and its base inhabitant walk out on to the promenade and swaggeringly feign to be the equal of they superior the house also be shabby and third-rate -- with its poor little glimpse of the sea although larger than the cedar it be noticeably smaller and meaner than any house on the promenade and whereas the cedar be detach no 59 be not even semi-detached but one of a gaunt tall row of stuccoed and single-fronted dwelling it look like a boarding-house -lrb- which the cedar do not -rrb- and not all the style of george cannon 's suit and cane and manner as he mount the step nor the polish of he new brass-plate could redeem it from the disgrace of be a very ordinary boarding-house george cannon have make a serious mistake in bring the carriage round by the promenade true he have exhibit the glory of brighton but he have do so to the detriment of he new enterprise that no 59 ought to be regard as merely a inexpensive field for the acquire of preliminary experience do not influence the judgment of the woman in the slightest degree for they it be a house that rightly apologize for itself and whose apologetic air deserve only a condescending tolerance the front door stand open for the convenience of the artisan who be screw at the brass-plate he move aside with the servility that always characterize the worker in a city of idler and the party pass into a long narrow hall whose wall be paper to imitate impossible block of mustard-coloured marble the party be now at home here we be say hilda with a gaiety that absolutely desolate herself and in the same instant she remember that george cannon have precede she in say ` here we be ' she look from the awful glumness of sarah gailey to the equally awful alacrity of george cannon and feel as though she have commit some crime whose nature she could not guess a middle-aged maid appear like a suspicious scout at the far end of the hall beyond the stair have open a door which show a glimpse of a kitchen that tea ready ask george cannon no sir say the maid plumply well let it be get ready yes sir the maid vanish flounce sarah gailey with a heavy sigh drop she small belongings on to a narrow bare table that stand against the wall near the foot of the stair daylight be fading well say george cannon balance he hat on he cane you luggage will be here directly this be the dining-room he push at a yellow-grained door the woman follow he into the dining-room and stare at the dining - room in silence there be a bedroom behind he say as they come out and he display the bedroom behind that be the kitchen he point to the adjoining door the drawing-room 's larger he say it include the width of the hall they climb the narrow stair after he wearily the door of the drawing-room be ajar and the chatter of thin feminine voice could be hear within george cannon give a soundless warning whisper : the watchett and sarah gailey frown back the information that she do not wish to meet the watchett just then with every precaution against noise george cannon open two other door show bedroom and then as it be hypnotize by he the woman climb another flight of narrow stair darken and see more room and then still another flight and still more room and finally the boast view of the sea after all hilda be oblige to admit to herself that the house be more impressive than she have at first suppose although single-fronted it be deep and there be two bedroom on the first floor and four each -- two large and two small -- on the second and third eleven in all they have see of which three be occupy by the watchett and one temporarily by george cannon the rest be empty but the season have scarcely begin and the boutwood be come george cannon have say grandly that hilda must choose she room she choose the smallest on the top floor the furniture if shabby and old-fashioned be everywhere ample they descend and not a word have be say about sarah 's room on the first-floor landing where indeed the danger be acutest they be trap by two of the watchett these elderly lady shoot almost roguishly out of the drawing-room and by they smile strike the descend party into immobility oh we see you arrive mr cannon say the elder shake she head so this be miss gailey good afternoon miss gailey so pleased to make you acquaintance there be handshake then it be hilda 's turn we be so sorry we eldest sister be not here to welcome you to no 59 say the younger she be have to go to london for the day we be very fond of no 59 there be no place quite like it to we mind and we be quite sure we shall be quite as comfortable with dear miss gailey as we be with dear mr granville poor thing it be quite a wrench when we have to say good-bye to she last night do come into the drawing-room please there be a beautiful view of the sea sarah gailey hesitate a noise of bump come from the hall below i think that be the luggage she say the smile with which she force herself to respond to the fix simper of the watchett seem to cause she horrible torment she motion nervously to george cannon who be nearest the stair a little later then a little later then say both the watchett bow the party away with the most singular grimace in the hall a lad perspire and breathe quickly stand behind the trunk wait a moment george cannon say to he and murmur to sarah : this be the basement here the middle-aged maid appear at the kitchen door with a large loaded tray come along with that tea louisa he add pleasantly he go first sarah next and hilda last cautiously down a short dark flight of stone step beneath the stair the servant follow at the foot a gas-jet burn those watchett might be the landlady mutter sarah strangely ignore the propinquity of the maid and sniff hilda give a short uneasy laugh she have a desire to laugh loudly and wildly and by so do to snap the nervous tension which seem to grow tighter and tighter every minute she wretchedness have become so exquisite that she could begin to enjoy it to savor it like a pleasure and she think with conscious and satisfied grimness : so this be brighton chapter iv the sea i in the evening hilda return from a short solitary walk as far as the west pier find sarah gailey stoop over she open trunk in the bedroom which have be assign to she there be two quite excellent though low-ceiled room of which this be one in the basement the other be to be use as a private parlor by the manager of the house at night with the gas light and the yellow blind draw and the loose bundle of strip paper gleam in the grate the bedroom seem very cozy and habitable in its shabbiness like the rest of the house it have a ample supply of furniture and especially of those trifling article useful or useless which collect only by slow degree and which be a proof of long humanize habitation in that room sarah gailey be indeed merely the successor of the regret mr granville the landlady who have mysteriously recede into the unknown before the advent of sarah and hilda but with whom george cannon must have have many interview no doubt the room be a epitome of the character of mr granville presumably a fussy and precise celibate with a place for everything and everything in its place and a indiscriminating tendency to hoard sarah gailey be at that stage of unpack when trunk be nearly empty and drawer have scarcely begin to fill bed table and chair be encumber with confused mass of goods apparently far exceed the cubical contents of the trunk can i do anything for you ask hilda the new landlady raise she watery and dejected eye if you would not mind take every single one of those knick-knack off the mantelpiece and put they away on the top shelf of the cupboard -- hilda smile it be a bit crowded be not it crowd by she intonation of this one word sarah gailey condemn mr granville 's whole life can i empty this chair i shall want something to stand on say hilda better see if the shelf 's dusty sarah gloomily warn she well murmur hilda on the chair if my feather do not actually touch the ceiling sarah gailey make no response to this light-heartedness and hilda with she hand full of vain gewgaw try again : i wonder what mr granville would say if she see I my word it be quite hot up here a resonant very amiable voice come from beyond the door : be she there who demand sarah grievous miss lessway it be george cannon yes i just want to speak to she if she be at liberty say george cannon hilda cry from the ceiling : i 'll come as soon as i have -- please go now sarah interrupted in tense accent hilda glance down at she astonished and see in she eye a almost childish appeal weak and passionate which grip the heart painfully she jump from the chair sarah gailey be now sit on the bed yes in she worn face of a woman who have definitely pass the climacteric and in the abandon pose of those thin arm there be the look and gesture of a young girl desperately beseech hilda be puzzle and intimidate she have mean to be jocular and to insist on stay till the task be finish but she keep silence and obey the supplication from a motive of prudence i would not keep you from he for anything murmured sarah gailey tragically as hilda open the door and leave she sit forlorn among all she skirt and linen ii i be here george cannon call out from the parlor when he hear the sound of the door he be look from the window up at the street the blind have not be draw he turn as hilda enter you have be out he say observe that she be in street attire what be it she ask nervously fear that some altercation have already occur between brother and sister it be about you private affair -- that be all he say easily and half-humourously if you 'll just come in oh she smile she relief but nevertheless she be still preoccupy by the image of the woman in the next room they have be drag on quite long enough say george cannon as he stoop to poke the morsel of fire in the old-fashioned grate which have a hob on either side on one of these hob be a glass of milk hilda have learn that day for the first time that at a certain hour every evening george cannon drink a glass of warm milk and that this glass of warm milk be a important factor in he daily comfort he now take the glass and drink it off and hilda have a peculiar sensation of be more intimate with he than she have ever be before they sit down to the square table in the middle of the room crowd with oddment of furniture include a desk which george cannon have appropriate to he own exclusive use this desk be open and a portion of its contents be spread abroad on the crimson cloth of the table among they hilda notice with she accustomed clerkly eye two number of _ the hotel-keeper and boarding-house review _ several sheet of advertisement-scale and a many-paged document with the head inventory of furniture at no 59 preston street also a large legal envelope inscribe lessway estate from the latter george cannon draw forth a engrave and flourish paper which he silently place in front of she it be a receipt sign by the manager of the brighton branch of the southern county bank for the sum of three thousand four hundred and forty-five pound deposit at call by miss hilda lessway everything be now settle up he say here be all the figure and he hand she another paper show the whole of the figure for the realization of she real property and of she furniture it be in you name and nobody can touch it but you she glance at the figure vaguely not attempt to comprehend they as for the receipt it fascinate she the fragile scrap represent she livelihood she future she salvation it alone stand between she and unimagined terror and she be surprise to see it surprise by its assurance that no accident have happen to she possession during the process of transformation carry out by george cannon for though he have throughout be almost worryingly meticulous in he business formality and he promptitude -- never have any interest or rent be a day late -- she admit to herself now that she have be afraid that in fact she have not utterly trust he and what be get to be do with this she ask simply finger the receipt he smile at she with a touch of protective and yet sardonic condescension without say a word and suddenly it strike she that age have elapse since she first interview with he in the office over the ironmonger 's at turnhill and that both of they be extraordinarily change -lrb- she be remind of that interview not by he face and look nor by they relative position at the table but by a very faint odour of gas-fume for at turnhill also a gas-jet have be between they -rrb- after a interval of anxiety and depression he have regain exactly the triumphant self-sure air which be she earliest recollection of he he be not appreciably older but for she he be no longer the same man because she see he differently know much more of he she read in he feature a thousand minor significance to which before she have be blind the dominate impression be not now the impression of he masculinity there be no clearly dominate impression he have lose for she the romantic allurement of the strange and the unknown still she like and admire he and she feel a awe which be agreeable to she of he tremendous enterprise and he obstinate volition that faculty which he possess of uproot himself and uproot other put she in fear of he he have will to be establish as a caterer in brighton -- he who but yesterday -lrb- as it seem -rrb- be a lawyer in turnhill -- and on this very night he be establish in brighton and he sister with he and she with he sister the enormous affair have be accomplish this thought have be obsess hilda all the afternoon and evening when she reflect upon the change in herself the untravelled hilda of turnhill appear a stranger to she and a simpleton no more as george cannon offer no answer to she question she say : i suppose it will have to be invest all this he nod well consider it be only be bring in one per cent per annum for the last week of course i need not have put it on deposit but i always prefer that way it be more satisfactory hilda could hear faintly through the thin wooden partition the movement of sarah gailey in the next room and the image of the mournful woman return to disquiet she what could be the meaning of that hysteric appeal and glance then she hear the door of the bedroom open violently and the figure of sarah gailey pass like a flash across the doorway of the parlor and the footstep of sarah gailey patter up the stone stair and the front door bang and the skirt and foot of sarah gailey intercept for a instant the light of the street-lamp that shone on the basement-window of the parlor excuse I a minute mutter hilda frowning by one of she swift and unreflecting impulse she abandon george cannon and she private affair and scurry by the area step into the street iii barehead and with no jacket or mantle sarah gailey be walk quickly down preston street towards the promenade and hilda afraid but courageous follow she at a distance of thirty or forty yard hilda could not decide why she be afraid nor why it should be necessary in so simple a undertaking as a walk down preston street to call upon she courage assume even that sarah gailey turn round and catch she -- what then the consequence could not be very terrible but sarah gailey do not turn round she go straight forward as though on a definite errand in a town with which she be perfectly familiar and have arrive at the corner of preston street and the promenade unhesitatingly cross the muddy roadway of the promenade and after a moment 's halt vanish down the step in the sea-wall to the left-hand of the pier the pier a double rope of twinkling lamp hang magically over the invisible sea and at the end of it constant and grave a red globe burn menacingly in the wind-haunted waste of the night and hilda think as she hasten with gathering terror across the promenade : out there at the end of the pier the water be splash and beat against the pile she stop at the parapet of the sea-wall and look behind she like a thief the wrought-iron entrance to the pier be highly illuminate but except for a man 's head and shoulder cage in the ticket-box of the turnstile there be no life there the man seem to be wait solitary with everlasting patience in the web of waver flame beneath the huge dark sky score of poster large and small show that robertson 's school be be perform in the theater away over the sea at the extremity of the pier the promenade save for one gigantic policeman and a few distant carriage be apparently desert and the line of dimly light hotel stretch vaguely east and west have a air grim and forlorn at that hour hilda run down the step at the bottom another row of lamp define the shore and now she could hear the tide lap ceaselessly amid the support ironwork of the pier she at once descry the figure of sarah gailey in the gloom the woman be move towards the faintly white edge of the sea hilda start to run after she first across smooth asphalt and then over some sail stretch out to dry and then she foot sink at each step into descend ridge of loose shingle and she nearly fall at length she come to firm sand and stand still sarah gailey be now silhouette against the pale shallows of foam that in ever-renewed curve divide the shore from the sea after a time she bent down rose again move towards the water and draw back hilda do not stir she could not bring herself to approach the lonely figure she feel that to go and accost sarah gailey would be indelicate and inexcusable she feel as if she be basely spy she be completely at a loss and know not how to act but presently she discern that the white foam be circle round sarah 's foot and that sarah be stand careless in the midst of it and at last timid and shake with agitation she venture nearer and nearer and sarah hear she on the sand and look behind miss gailey she appeal in a tremble voice sarah make no response of any kind and hilda reach the edge of the foam please please do not stand there you 'll catch a dreadful cold and you have get nothing on you shoulder either i want to make a hole in the water say sarah miserably i want to make a hole in the water please do come back with I hilda implored but she speak mechanically as though say something which she be bind to say but which she do not feel the foam capriciously recede and hilda still without any effort of she own will step across the glisten yielding sand and take sarah gailey 's arm there be no resistance i want to make a hole in the water sarah repeat but i make a mistake i ought to have go to that groin over there i know there be a groin near here only it be so long since i be here i would forget just the place but what be the matter hilda ask lead she away from the sea she be not extremely surprised but she be shock into a most solemn awe as she press the arm of the poor tragic woman who but for a accident might have plunge off the end of the groin into water deep enough for drown she do really feel humble before this creature who have deliberately invite death she in no way criticize she she do not even presume to condescend towards the hasty clumsiness of sarah gailey 's scheme to die she be overwhelm by the woman 's utterly unconscious impressiveness which exceed that of a criminal reprieve on the scaffold for the woman have dare a experience that only the fierce and sublime courage of desperation can affront she have a feeling that she ought to apologize profoundly to sarah gailey for all that sarah must have suffer and as she hear the ceaseless cruel play of the water amid the dark jungle of ironwork under the pier and the soft creep of the foam-curve behind and the vague stirring of the night-wind round about -- these phenomenon combine mysteriously with the immensity of the dome above and with the baffling strangeness of the town and with the grandeur of the beaten woman by she side and communicate to hilda a thrill that be divine in its unexampled poignancy the great figure of the policeman suspicious be descend from the promenade discreetly towards they to avoid any encounter with he hilda guide she companion towards the pier and they sheltered there under the resounding floor of the pier by the light of one of the lower lamp hilda could now clearly see sarah gailey 's face it show no sign of terror it be calm enough in its worn resign woe it have the girlish look again beneath the mark of age hilda could distinguish the young girl that sarah have once be come home will you she entreat sarah gailey sigh terribly i give it up she say with weariness i could never do it i could never do it -- now hilda pull gently at she unwilling arm she could not speak she could not ask she again : what be the matter it be not that the house be too large sarah gailey go on half meditatively though just think of all those stair and not a tap on any of the upper floor no and it be not that i be not ready enough to oblige he no i know as well as anybody there be only he between I and starvation no it be not that he do not consider I no but when he go and settle behind my back with those boutwood -- she begin to weep and when i can hear you and he discuss I in the next room and plot against I -- it be -- it be more -- the tear gradually drown she voice and she cease i assure you you be quite mistaken hilda burst out with passionate and indignant persuasiveness we never mention you he want to talk to I about my money and if you feel like that over the boutwood i be certain he 'll tell they they must not come sarah gailey shake she head blankly i be certain he will hilda persist please -- the other begin to walk away drag hilda with she the policeman inspect they from a distance cough and withdraw they climb a flight of step on the far side of the pier cross the promenade and go up preston street in silence i should prefer not to be see go in with you say sarah gailey suddenly it might -- she free she arm go down the area step say hilda and i 'll wait a moment and then go in at the front door sarah gailey hurry forward alone hilda watch she and observe the wet footmark which she leave on the pavement be appal by the sense of she own responsibility as to the future of sarah gailey till this hour even at she most conscientious she have under-estimate the seriousness of sarah gailey 's case everybody have under-estimate the seriousness of sarah gailey 's case she become aware of some one hurry cautiously up the street on the other side it be george cannon as soon as sarah have disappear within the house he cross over what be the matter he inquire anxiously well -- she have not be try to drown herself have she hilda nod and speechless move towards the house he turn abruptly away the front door of no 59 be still open hilda pass through the silent hall and go timorously down the step to the basement the gas be still burn and the clothes be still strew about in sarah gailey 's bedroom just as though naught have happen sarah stand between she two trunk in the middle of the floor where 's george she ask in a harsh perfectly ordinary voice i do not think he be in the parlor hilda prevaricate promise I you will not tell he of course i will not say hilda kindly do get into bed and let I make you some tea sarah gailey rush at she and embrace she i know i be all wrong i know it be all my own fault she murmur with plaintive feeble contrition cry again but you have no idea how i try if it be not for you -- iv that night hilda in she small bedroom at the top of the house be listlessly arrange at the back of the dressing-table the few volume which have cling to she or to which she have cling throughout the convulsive disturbance follow she mother 's death among they be one which she do not wish to keep _ the girl ' week-day book _ and also the whole set of victor hugo which do not belong to she george cannon have lend she the latter in instalment and she have omit to return it she be say to herself that the opportunity to return it have at length arrive when she hear a low conspiratorial tap at the door all she skin creep as after a second 's startle hesitation she move to open the door george cannon hold a candle stand on the landing she have not see he since the brief colloquy between they outside the house have satisfy herself that sarah gailey be safe and to a certain extent tranquillize for the night she have await george cannon 's reappearance a long time in vain and have then retire upstairs you be not go to bed he whisper very cautiously within a few foot of they be a airless kennel where louisa the chambermaid sleep no i be just -- i stay up for you i do not know how long be she all right well -- she be in bed i wish you would come to one of these other room he continue to whisper all the sibilant in he word seem to detach themselves hiss from the rest of the sound she give a gesture of assent he tiptoe over the traitorous board of the landing and slowly turn the knob of a door in the end wall the door explode like the firing of a pistol frown he grimly push it open hilda follow he noiselessly creep he hold the door for she she enter and he shut the door on the inside they be in a small bedroom similar to hilda 's own but the bed be strip the square of carpet roll the blind undrawn and the curtain loop up from the floor he put the candle on the tiny iron mantelpiece and sit on the bed he hand in he pocket you do not mean to say she be want to commit suicide he say after a short reflective silence with he head bent but he eye raise peeringly to hilda 's the crudity of the word ` suicide ' affect hilda painfully if you ask I say she stand with she back rubbing against the small wardrobe she do not know quite what she be do but there be no doubt that be what she go out for you overtake she i see you come up from the beach hilda related what have happen but have you any notion -- before -- I no why nothing only the way you rush out like that well -- it strike I all of a sudden you have not see she since you come in he shake he head i think i would better keep out of the way i think i would better leave it all to you it be appalling simply appalling just when everything be shape so well hilda thought bewilder : ` shape so well ' with she glance she take in the little cheerless bedroom and herself and george cannon within it overwhelm in imagination she see all the other bedroom dark forlorn and inanimate wait through long night and empty day until some human creature as pathetic as themselves should come and feebly vitalize they into a spurious transient homeliness and she see george cannon 's bedroom -- the harsh bedroom of the bachelor who have never have a home and the bedroom of those fearsome mummy the watchett each bed with its grisly face on the pillow in the dark and the kennel of the unclean servant and so descend through the floor to sarah gailey 's bedroom in the very earth and the sleepless form on that bed beneath the whole and the organism of the boarding-house seem absolutely tragic to she compact of the stuff of sorrow itself and yet george cannon have say ` shape so well ' what be to be do he inquire plaintively nothing that i can see she say she have a tremendous desire to escape from the responsibility thrust on she by the situation but she know that she could never escape from it that she be immovably pin down by it i can not see anything either say he quietly responsive and speak now in a gentle voice suppose i tell she that she can go and that i 'll make she a allowance what could she do then it would be madness for she to live alone any more she be the very last person who ought to live alone moreover she would not accept the allowance well then she must stay with I -- here and if she stay here she must work otherwise she would never stay -- not she and she must be the mistress she would not stand have anyone above she or even equal with she that be a certainty besides she be so good at she job she have not get a great deal of system so far as i can see but she can get the work out of the servant without too much fuss and she be so mighty economical in she catering of course she can not get on the right side of a boarder -- but then i _ can _ and that be the whole point with I on the spot to _ run _ the place she would be perfect -- perfect could not wish for anything better and now she -- i assure you i be do the best i can do for she i do honestly assure you if anybody can suggest to I anything else that i can do -- i 'll do it like a shot he throw up he arm hilda be touch by the benevolence of he tone nevertheless it only intensify she helpless perplexity sarah gailey be inexpressibly to be pity but george cannon be not to be blame she have a feeling that for any piteous disaster some one ought to be definitely blamable do you think she 'll settle down george cannon ask in a new voice oh yes say hilda i think she will it be just a sort of -- attack she have i think she be not vex with I hilda could not find courage to say : she think you and i be plot against she and yet she wonder why she should hesitate to say it after a pause she murmur as casually as possible : she do not like the boutwood come back i know you be go to say that he frown if you could manage to stop they -- no no he interrupt -- nervous impatient it would not do that would not it would never do a boarding-house can not be run on those line it be not that i care so much as all that about lose a couple of boarder and i be not specially keen on the boutwood but it would not do it be the wrong principle you have not get to let customer get on you nerve so long as they pay and behave respectably if i give way the very first thing sarah would do would be to find a grievance against some other boarder and there would be no end to it the fact be she want a grievance she must have a grievance -- whether it be the boutwood or somebody else make no matter oh no he repeat softly gently oh no she know that he argument be unanswerable she be perfectly aware that she ought to yield to it nevertheless the one impulse of she being in that moment be to fight blindly and irrationally against it she instinct say : i do not care for argument the boutwood must be stop from come if they be not stop i do not know what i shall do i can not bear to think of that poor woman meet they again i can not bear it she draw breath sharply startling hot tear come into she eye and she step forward on she left foot please she entreat please do not let they come there be a silence in the agonizing silence she feel acutely she girlishness she helplessness she unreason confront by he strong and shrewd masculinity at the bottom of she soul she know how wrong she be but she be ready to do anything to save sarah gailey from the distress of one particular humiliation with the whole of she volition she want to win oh well he say of course if you take it so much to heart -- a peculiar bright glance shot from he eye -- the old glance that at once negligently assert he power over she and reassure she against he power she being be suffuse with gladness and pride she have win she have win in defiance of reason she have appeal and she have conquer and she enjoy he glance she glory in it she blush a spasm of exquisite fear shot through she and she savor it deliciously the deep organic sadness of the house present itself to she in a new light it be still sadness but it be beautiful in the background she sympathy for sarah gailey be as keen as ever but it have a different quality -- a anguish less desolating and the fact that a joint responsibility for sarah gailey 's welfare bind herself and george cannon together in spite of themselves -- this fact seem to she grandiose and romantic no longer oppressive to be alone with he in the secrecy of the small upper room seem to endow she with a splendid worldly importance and yet all the time a scarce-heard voice be say clearly within she : this appeal and this abandonment be unworthy no matter if this man be kind and sincere and admirable this appeal and this abandonment be unworthy but she do not care she ignore the voice i 'll tell sarah in the morning he say please do not she beg you might pretend later on that you have have a letter from the boutwood and they can not come if you tell she to-morrow she 'll guess at once i have be talk to you and you be not suppose to know anything at all about what happen to-night she make I promise but of course she do not know that you would find out for yourself you see george cannon walk away to the window and then to the mantelpiece from which he take up the candle i be very much oblige to you he say simply put a faint emphasis on the last word she know that he mean it without any reserve but in he urbane tone there be a chill tranquillity that astonish and vaguely disappointed she \* \* \* \* \* book iv she fall chapter i the go concern i on a Saturday afternoon of the follow August hilda be sit at a book in the basement parlor of cannon 's boarding-house in preston street she hear through the open window several pair of foot mount wearily to the front door and then the long remote tinkling of the bell within the house there be no responsive sound but from the porch come a clearing of throat a mutter impatient and yet resign and a vague shuffling after a long pause the bell ring again and then the gas globe over hilda 's head vibrate for a moment to footstep in the hall and the front door be unlatched she could not catch the precise question but the reply of louisa the chambermaid -- haughty scornful and negligently pity -- be quite clear : sorry sir we be full up we have have to refuse several this very day no i could not rightly tell you where you might try no 51 ` homeleigh ' as they call it but we be full up good afternoon sir would afternoon be the door bang arrogantly the foot redescend to the pavement and hilda throw a careless glance at the window see two man and a woman pass melancholy down the hot street with they hand-luggage and although she condemn and despise the flunkey-souled louisa who would have abase herself with sickly smile and sweet phrase before the applicant if the house have need custom although in she mind she be say curtly to the mature louisa : it be a good thing mr cannon do not hear you use that tone to customer my girl nevertheless she could not help feeling somewhat as louisa feel it be indubitably agreeable to hear a prosperous door close on dusty and disappointed holiday-maker and to realize in she tranquil retreat that she be part of a very thriving and successful concern ii george cannon in a light and elegant summer suit pass slowly in front of the window and look for hilda in she accustomed place see she and nod surprise by the unusual gesture she move uneasily and blush and as she do so she ask herself resentfully : why do i behave like this i be only he clerk and i shall never be anything else but he clerk and yet i do believe i be get worse instead of better george cannon skip easily up to the porch he have a latchkey but before he could put it into the keyhole louisa have fly down the stair and open the door to he she must have be on the watch from a upper floor george cannon would have be well serve whatever he situation in the house for he be one of those genial bully who be adore by the menial whom they alternately cajole and terrorize but he situation in the house be that of a god and like a god he be attend he be the very creator of the house all its life flow from he without he the organism would have cease to exist and everybody in it be quite aware of this he have fully learn he business he have learn it in the fishmarket on the beach at seven o'clock in the morning and in the vegetable market at eight and in the shop he have learn it in the kitchen and on the stair while the servant be clean and he have learn it at the dinner-table surround by he customer there be nothing that he do not know and except actual cooking and mend little that he could not do he always impress he customer by the statement that he have sleep in every room in the house in order to understand personally its quality and defect and he could and do in fact talk to each boarder about he room with the intimate geographical knowledge of a native the boarder be further flatter by the mien and appearance of this practical housekeeper who do not in the least resemble he kind but have rather the style of a slightly doggish stockbroker to be stroll on the king 's road in converse with george cannon be a matter of pride to boarder male and female and there be none with whom he could not talk fluently on any subject from cigar to ozone accord to the need of the particular case nor do he ever seem to be bore by conversation but sometimes after benignantly speed for instance one of the watchett on she morning constitutional he would slip down into the basement and ejaculate ` curse hag ' with a calm and natural earnestness which frighten hilda indicate as it do that he must be capable of astounding duplicity he come now directly to the underground parlor hat on head and ebony stick in hand hilda do not even look up but self-consciously bent a little lower over she volume she relation to george cannon in the successful enterprise be anomalous and yet the habit of ten month have in practice define it neither pay board nor receive wages she have remain in the house apparently as sarah gailey 's companion and moral support she have remain because sarah gailey have never be in a condition to be leave -- and the month have pass very quickly but she lack of occupation and she knowledge of shorthand and george cannon 's obvious need of clerical aid have make it inevitable that they should resume they former rôles of principal and clerk hilda work daily at letter circularize advertisement and -- to a less extent -- account and bill the second finger of she right hand have nearly always a agreeable stain of ink at the base of the nail and she often dream about letter-filing in this prosperous month of August she have on the whole less work than usual for both circulate and advertisement be stop george cannon go to the desk in the dark corner between the window and the door where all business papers be keep but where neither he nor she actually write when he back be turn she surreptitiously glance at he without move she head and perceive that he hand be only move idly about among the papers while he stare at the wall she think half in alarm : what be the matter now then he come over to the table and hesitate by she shoulder still she would not look up she could no longer decipher a single word on the page she being be somehow monopolize by the consciousness of he nearness interesting he inquire she turn she head at last and glance at he with a friendly smile of affirmation finger the leaf of the book nervously it be cranswick 's _ history of printing _ one day a fortnight earlier while george cannon in company with she be bargaining for a old london directory outside a bookseller 's shop in east street she have see cranswick 's _ history of printing _ -lrb- label publish at _ # 1 _ 1 we price 6 6d -rrb- and have open it curiously george cannon who always keep a eye on she have say teasingly : i suppose it be you journalistic past that make you interested in that i suppose it be she answer which statement be a untruth for the sole thought in she mind have be that edwin clayhanger be a printer a strange idle thought she have lay the book down the next day however george cannon have bring it home say carelessly : i buy that book -- five and six the man seem anxious to do business and it be a book to have he have not touch it since page 473 he murmur look at the number of the page if you keep on at this rate you 'll soon know more about printing than young clayhanger himself she be thunderstruck never before have the name of clayhanger be mention between they could he then penetrate she thought could he guess that in truth she be read cranswick solely because edwin clayhanger happen to be a printer no it be impossible the reason of she interest in cranswick inexplicable even to herself be too fantastic to be divine and yet be not he tone peculiar or be it only in she fancy that he tone be peculiar she blush scarlet and she muscle grow rigid i say george cannon continue in a tone that now be unmistakably peculiar i want you to come out with I i want to show you something on the front can you come at once she mutter glumly and painfully what could be the mystery beneath this most singular behavior yes florrie will be arrive at five say hilda after artificially cough i ought to be here then ought not i oh he cry we shall be back long before five very well she agree i 'll be ready in three minute he say go gaily towards the door from the door he give she a glance she meet it courageously expose she troubled feature and nod iii hilda go into the bedroom behind the parlor to get she hat and glove a consequence of the success of the boarding-house be that she be temporarily share this chamber with sarah gailey she have insist on make the sacrifice and she enjoy the personal discomfort which it involve when she cautiously lay down on the narrow and lumpy truckle-bed that have be insinuate against a unoccupied wall and when she turn over restlessly in the night and the rickety ironwork creak and sarah gailey moan and when she search vainly for a particular garment lose among garment that be hung pell-mell on insecure hook and jut corner of furniture -- she be proud and glad because she own comfortable room be steadily add thirty shilling or more per week to the gross receipt of the enterprise the benefit be in no way hers and yet she gloat on it think pleasurably of george cannon 's great japanned cash-box which seem to be a exhaustless store of gold sovereign and large silver and of he mysterious -- almost furtive -- visit to the bank she own capital invest by george cannon in railway stock be bring in four time as much as she disburse and she gloat also on she savings the more money she amass the less willing be she to spend this nascent avarice amuse she as a new trait in he character always amuse the individual she say to herself : i be get quite a miser with the assure reservation : of course i can stop be a miser whenever i feel like stop sarah gailey be lull herself in a rocking-chair when hilda enter and she neither regard hilda nor intermitted she see-saw she feature be draw into a preoccupy expression of martyrdom and in fact she constantly suffer physical torture she have three genuine complaint -- rheumatism sciatica and neuritis they be all painful the latest and worst be the neuritis which have attack she in the wrist produce swollen joint that have to be foment with hot water sarah gailey 's life have indeed latterly develop into a continual fomentation and a continual rock she be so take up with the elemental business of foment and of keep warm that she have no energy leave for other remedial treatment such as distraction in the open air she sit for ever shawl generally with heavy mitten on she arm and wrist and either foment or rock in the eternal twilight of the basement bedroom she eschew aid -- she could manage for herself -- and she do not encourage company apparently prefer to be alone with fate in she easier hour one hand rest on another and both hug close to she breast rock to and fro with a astounding monotonous perseverance she be like a mysterious indian god in a subterranean temple above she unseen by she floor beyond floor the life of the boarding-house function in the great holiday month of August i quite forget about the make-up bed for florrie say sarah gailey plaintively as she rock would you have time to see to it of course she will have to be with louisa very well say hilda curtly and not quite hide exasperation there be three reason for she exasperation in the first place the constant spectacle of sarah gailey 's pain and the effect of the pain on sarah 's character be exasperating -- to hilda as well as to george cannon both well know that the watery-eyed fretful spinster be a victim utterly innocent and utterly helpless of destiny and that she merit nothing but patient sympathy yet often the strain of relationship with sarah produce in they such a profound feeling of annoyance that they positively resent sarah 's suffering and with a sad absence of logic blame she in she misfortune just as though she have wilfully bring the malady upon herself in order to vex they then further it be necessary always to minister to sarah 's illusion that sarah be the mainstay of the house that she attend to everything and be responsible for everything and that without she governance the machine would come to a disastrous standstill : the fact be that she have grow feeble and superfluous sarah have teach all she know to two highly intelligent pupil and have survive she usefulness she have no right place on earth but in she morose inefficiency she have develop into a unconscious tyrant -- a tyrant whose power lay in the loyalty of she subject and not at all in she own soul she be indeed like a deity immanent brooding and unaware of itself thus the question of florrie 's bed have be discuss and settle long before sarah gailey have even think of it but hilda might not tell she so lastly this very question of florrie 's bed be exasperate to hilda already louisa 's kennel be inadequate for louisa and now another couch have be crowd into it hilda be ashamed of the shift but there be no alternative here for hilda be the secret canker of george cannon 's brilliant success the servant be kindly ill-treated in the commercial triumph she lose the sense of the tragic forlornness of boarding-house existence as it have strike she on the day of she arrival but the image of the indian god in the basement and of the prone form of the servant in stifle black cupboard under the roof and under the stair -- these image embittered at interval the instinctive and reflect exultation of she mood she adjust she small close-fitting flowered hat drop she parasol across the bed and begin to draw on she cotton glove where be you go dear ask sarah gailey out with mr cannon but where i do not know in spite of herself there be a certain unnecessary defiance in hilda 's voice you do not know dear sarah gailey suddenly cease rock and glance at hilda with the mournful expression of acute worry that be so terribly familiar on she feature although it be notorious that baseless apprehension be a part of sarah 's disease nevertheless hilda could never succeed in treat any give apprehension as quite baseless and now sarah 's mere tone beget in hilda 's self-consciousness a vague alarm she continue busy with she glove silent and on Saturday afternoon too when everybody be abroad sarah gailey add gloomily with she involuntary small movement of the head he ask I if i could go out with he for a minute or two at once say hilda and pick up the parasol with a decisive gesture there be a great deal too much talk about you and george as it be say sarah with a acrid firmness talk about I and -- hilda cry absolutely astounded she have no feeling of guilt but she know that she be look guilty and this knowledge induce in she the actual sensation of a criminal i be sure i do not want -- sarah gailey begin and be interrupt by a quiet tap at the door george cannon enter ready miss he demand smile before he have catch sight of she face for the second time that afternoon he see she scarlet and now there be tear in she eye too she hesitate a instant yes she answer with a painful gulp and move towards the door chapter ii the unknown adventure i when they be fairly out in the street hilda feel like a mariner who have escape from a lee shore but who be beset by the vaguer and even more formidable peril of the open sea she be in a state of extreme agitation and much too self-conscious to be properly cognisant of she surroundings she do not feel the pavement with she foot she have no recollection of have pass out of the house there she be walk along on nothing by the side of a man who might or might not be george cannon amid tall object that resemble house she situation be in a high degree painful but she could not have avoid it she could not in sarah 's bedroom have fall into sob or into a rage or into the sulk and tell george cannon that she would not go with he she could not have dash hysterically away and hide herself on a upper floor in the manner of a startled fawn she spirit be too high for such trick on the other hand she be by no means sufficiently mistress of herself to be able to hide from he she shame hence she face he and follow he and let he see it they long familiarity have make this surrender somewhat easier for she after all in the countless daily contact they have grow accustomed to minor self-exposure -- and hilda more so than george cannon hilda be too impatient and impulsive not to tear at increasingly frequent interval the veil of conventional formality she mood now as she accompany george cannon on the unknown adventure be one of abashed but still fierce resentment she of course believe sarah gailey 's statement that there have be talk about herself and the landlord and yet it be so utterly monstrous as to be almost incredible she be absolutely sure that she have never by she behavior furnish the slightest excuse for such talk no eavesdropper could ever have catch the least word or gesture to justify it could a malicious eavesdropper have assist at the secret operation of she inmost mind even then he could scarcely have see aught to justify it existence at brighton have be too strenuous and strange -- and with sarah gailey in the house too full of responsibility -- to favor dalliance hilda examine herself could not say that she have not once think of george cannon as a husband because just as a young solitary man will imagine himself the spouse of a dozen different girl in a week so will a unmated girl picture herself unite to every eligible and passably sympathetic male that cross she path it be the everyday diversion of the fancy but she could say that she have not once think seriously of george cannon as a husband why he be not of she generation although she do not know he age she guess that he must be nearer forty than thirty he be of the generation of sarah gailey and sarah gailey be the contemporary of she dead mother and he have never show for she any sentiment but that of a benevolently tease kindliness moreover she be afraid of he beyond question and withal he patently lack certain quality which be to be find in she image of a perfect man no she have more often think of edwin clayhanger as a husband indeed she have marry edwin clayhanger several time the haunting youth would not leave she alone and she say to herself hot and indignant : i shall have to leave brighton i can see that sarah gailey 's bring it on herself yes she be actually angry with sarah gailey who however have only inform she of a fact which she would have be sorry not to know and in leave brighton that fancy of hers take she straight to bursley to stay with janet orgreave in the house next to the new house of the clayhanger whither be george cannon lead she he have not yet say a word in explanation of the errand nor show in any way that he have observe she extraordinary condition he be silent swing he stick she also be silent she could not have speak not even to murmur : where be you take I to they go forward as in a enchantment ii they be on the king 's road and to the leave be the high hotel and house stretch east and west under the glare of the sun into invisibility and to the right be the shore and the sea so bright that the eye could scarcely rest on it both the upper and the lower promenade be crowd with gay people surge in different direction the dusty roadway be full of carriage and of the glint of the sun on wheelspoke and horse ' flank and of roll clear-cut shadow the shore be border with flag and mast and white and brown sail and in the white-and-green of billow harmlessly break could be see the yellow body of the bather a dozen bare-legged man get hold of a yacht under sail with as many passenger on board and push it forcibly right down into the sea and then up spring its nose and it heel over and shoot suddenly off career on the wave into the offing where other yacht be slide to and fro between the pier dominate errant fleet of rowboat and the pier also be load with excited humanity and radiant color and all the window of all the house and hotel be open and blow with curtain and flower and hat the whole town be enfevered hilda think she heart still beat but less noisily i scarcely ever come here i do not come here often enough and she see sarah gailey rock and sigh and rock and shake she head in the mournful twilight of the basement in preston street the contrast of existence strike she as magnificent as superb the very misery and hopelessness of sarah 's isolation seem romantic splendid touchingly beautiful and she think inexplicably : why be i here why be i not at home in turnhill why be i so different from what mother be what be i go to be and to do this that i now be can not continue for ever she see thousand of woman with thousand of man and quite forget that to the view of the multitude she be just as much as any of they with a man -lrb- and a rather fine man too -rrb- she begin to pity herself because she be not with a man she dream in she extreme excitation of belong absolutely to some man and despite all she pride and independence she dwell with pleasure and longing on the vision of be he of be at he disposal of be under he might of be helpless before he she think desolate : i be nobody 's and so there be ` talk ' she scorn herself for be nobody 's to belong utterly to some male seem to be the one tolerable fate for she in the world and it be a glorious fate whether it bring good or evil any other be ignobly futile be despicable and then she think savagely : and just see my clothes why do not i take the trouble to look nice suddenly george cannon stop on the edge of the pavement and turn towards the house across the street you see that he say point with he stick what the chichester she see in gold letter over the front of a tall corner house : the chichester private hotel well i have take it -- from christmas i sign about a hour ago i just have to tell someone well i never hilda exclaim he be beyond question a extraordinary and a impressive man he have say that after experiment in preston street he should take a larger place and lo in less than a year he have fulfil he word he have experiment in preston street with immense success and now he be come out into the king 's road -lrb- only those who have live in a side street can pronounce the fine word ` king 's road ' with the proper accent of deference -rrb- and every house in the king 's road hilda now newly perceive be a house of price and distinction nothing could be common in the king 's road : the address and the view be incomparably precious be establish there george cannon might and no doubt would ultimately acquire one of the largest public hotel indeed dominate the promenade it would be just like he to do so a year ago he be a solicitor in turnhill to-day he be so perfectly and entirely a landlord that no one could ever guess he first career he be not merely extraordinary : he be astounding there could not be many of he calibre in the whole world how do it strike you he ask with a eagerness that touch she oh it be splendid she answer try to put more natural enthusiasm into she voice but the fact be that the chichester have not yet strike she at all it be only the idea of be in the king 's road that have strike she -- and with such a effect that she attention be happily divert from she trouble and she vexatious self-consciousness disappear she have from time to time remark the chichester but never with any particularity it have be for she just a establishment among innumerable other and not one of the best -- the reverse of impose it stand at the angle of king 's road and ship street and a chemist 's shop occupy the whole of the frontage the hotel-entrance be in ship street its architecture be fiat and plain and the place seem neglect perhaps unprosperous twenty bow-window murmur george cannon and then smile at himself as if ashamed of he own naïveté and hilda count the window yes there be eight on king 's road and twelve at the side the building be high and it be deep stretch far down ship street in a moment it begin to put on for hilda quite special quality how high it be how deep it be and in what a situation it possess mysterious and fine characteristic which set it apart strange that hitherto she have be so blind to it she and george cannon be divide from the house by the confused and noisy traffic of the roadway and by the streaming throng on the opposite pavement and none of these people ride or drive or walk and none of the people push past they on the pavement behind guess that here on the curb be the future master of the chichester a amazing man and that she hilda lessway by he side be the woman to whom he have choose first to relate he triumph this unrecognised secrecy in the great animated street be piquant and agreeable to hilda a source of pride i suppose you have buy it she venture she have no notion of he financial resource but she instinct be to consider they infinite no i have not exactly buy it he laugh not quite i have get the lease from christmas how much d'ye think the rent be he seem to challenge she oh do not ask I five hundred a year he say and raise he chin five hundred a year ten pound a week nearly thirty shilling a day you have get to pay that before you can even begin to think of you own profit but it be enormous hilda be stagger all she mother 's house put together have bring in scarcely a third of the rental of that single house which be nevertheless only a modest unit in several mile of house but can you make it pay i fancy so else i should not have take it the present man can not but then he be pay # 550 for one thing and he be old and he do not know he business oh yes i think i can see my money back wait till christmas be turn and i make a start she know that the future would justify he self-confidence how he succeed she could not define why should he succeed where another be fail he could not go out and drag boarder by physical force into he private hotel yet he would succeed in every gesture he be the successful man she look timidly up at he eye under the strong black eyelash he glance catch hers he smile conqueringly have not say a word to sarah yet he almost whisper so low be he voice and he put on a mock-rueful smile hilda smile in response shall you keep preston street she ask of course he say with pride -- i shall run the two naturally he put he shoulder back one will help the other do not you see she think she see and nod appreciatively he mean to run two establishment at the same moment a young and stylish man drive rather slowly by in a high dog-cart he nod carelessly to george cannon and then perceive that george cannon be with a lady raise he hat in haste george cannon respond the young man gaze for a instant hard at hilda with a peculiar expression and pass on she do not know who he be of george cannon 's relationship in the town she be entirely ignorant but that he have relationship be always obvious she blush thinking of what sarah gailey have say about ` talk ' concern herself and george cannon in the young man 's glance there have be something to annoy and shame she come across and have a look at the place say george cannon suddenly step down into the gutter with a look first in one direction and then in the other for threaten traffic i do not think i 'll come now she reply but why not be you in a hurry you have plenty of time before five o'clock -- heap i would prefer not to come she insist in a abashed and diffident voice but what be up he demand step back to the pavement and glance directly into she eye she blush more and more drop she eyelid i do not want to be talk about _ too _ much she mutter mortified she inference be unmistakable the whole of she mind seem now to be occupy with a enormous grievance which she somehow have against the world in general she very soul too be burst with this grievance talk about but who -- never mind i know i have be tell she interrupt he oh i see he be now understand the cause of she trouble in sarah gailey 's bedroom now look here he go on i have just get to have a few word with you you come across the road please he be imperious she raise she glance for a timid moment to he face and see to she intense astonishment that he also be blush never before have she see he blush come along he urge she follow he obediently across the dangerous road he wait for she at the opposite curb and then they go up ship street he turn into the entrance of the chichester which be grandiose with a flight of shallow step and then a porch with two basket chair and then another flight of shallow step end in double door which be noticeably higher than the street level she still follow nobody in here i expect say george cannon indicate a door on the right to a old waiter who stand in the dark hall no sir george cannon open the door as a master usher hilda into a tiny room furnish with a desk and two chair and shut the door iii the small window be of ground glass and give no prospect of the outer world from which it seem to hilda that she be as completely cut off as in a prison she be alone with george cannon and beyond the narrow wall which cage they together and close together there be nothing all brighton save this room have cease to exist hilda be now more than ever affright shame perturb agonised yet at the same time she have the desperate calm of the captain of a ship about to founder with all hand and she see glimpse beautiful and compensatory of the romantic quality of common life she be in a little office of a perfectly ordinary boarding-house -- -lrb- she could even detect the stale odour of cooking -rrb- -- with a realistic man of business and they be about to discuss a perfectly ordinary piece of scandal and surely they might be call two common-sense people and withal the ordinariness and the midland gumption of the scene be shoot through with the bright exotic ray of romance she think : it be painful and humiliating to be catch and fix as i be but it be wonderful too the fact be say george cannon in a easy reassuring tone we never get the chance of a bit of quiet chat upon my soul we do not now i suppose it be sarah who be be worry you yes what do she say you would better sit down do not you think he swing round the pivot arm-chair in front of the closed desk and point she to it oh hilda hesitate and then sink on to the chair without look at it she simply say there be a lot of talk about you and I have she be say anything to you he shake he head stare down at she hilda put she arm on the arm of the chair and shirk the man 's gaze stare down at the worn carpet and at he boot thereon one instinct in she desire that he should move away or that the room should be larger but another instinct want he to remain close lest the savor of life should lose its sharpness it pass I how people can say such thing she go on in a low thrill meditative voice i can not understand it she be quite sincere in she astonished indignation nevertheless she experience a positive pride at be bring into a scandal with george cannon she derive from it a certain feeling of importance it prove that she be no longer a mere girlish miss george cannon keep silence i shall leave brighton hilda continue that i have quite decide i do not like leave you sister as ill as she be but really -- and she think how prudent she be and how capable of take care of herself -- she all alone in the world where should you go to bursley the orgreave george cannon ask absently and carelessly i do not know say hilda with curtness he step aside in the direction of the window and examine curiously the surface of the glass as though in search of a conceal message which it might contain in a new and much more animated voice he say to the window : of course i know it be all my fault hilda glance up at he back he be still not more than three foot away from she how be it you fault she ask after a pause he make another pause the way i look at you he say these apparently simple word make hilda tremble and deprive she of speech they shift the conversation to another plane ` the way i look at you the way i look at you ' what do he mean how do he look at she she could not imagine what he be drive at yes she could she know quite well all the time while pretend to herself not to understand she understand it be stagger but she perfectly understand he have look at she ` like that ' on the very first day of they acquaintance in he office at turnhill and again at the house in lessway street and again in the newspaper office and on other occasion and again on the night of they arrival at brighton but surely not lately or do he look at she ` like that ' behind she back be it possible that people notice it absurd he explanation of the origin of the gossip do not convince she she have however suddenly lose interest in the origin of the gossip she be entirely occupy with george cannon 's tone and he calm audacious reference to a phenomenon which have hitherto seem to she to be far beyond the region of word she be frightened she be like some one walk secure in the night who be stop by the sound of rush water and stand with all he sens astrain afraid to move a step farther too absorb and intimidate to be aware of astonishment the point be not whether or not she have know or guess the existence of this unseen and formidable river the point be that she be thrillingly on its brink in the dark every instant she hear its swell current plainer and plainer she think : be i lose how strange that this awful and exquisite thing should happen to just I she be quite fatalistic he turn he head suddenly and catch she guilty eye for a instant before she could lower they you do not mean to say you do not know what i mean he say she still could not speak she trouble be acute she self-consciousness far keener than it have ever be before she think : but it be impossible that this awful and exquisite thing should happen in this fashion george cannon move a step towards she she could not see he face but she know that he be look at she with he expression at once tyrannic and benevolent she could feel beat upon she the emanate wave of he personality and she be as confused as though she have be sit naked in front of he and he have bring all this about by simply put something into word -- by say : it be the way i look at you he go on : i can not help it you know the very first minute i ever set eye on you of course i be thirty-six but there it be i have never see any one like you and i have see a few the fact be hilda i do believe you do not know how fine you be he speak more quickly and with boyish enthusiasm he voice become wonderfully persuasive you be fine you know and you be beautiful i do not think so at first but you be you be be waste why a woman like you you have no idea you be so proud and stiff when you want to be i would trust you with anything you be absolutely the only woman i ever meet that i would trust like a man and that be a fact now nobody could ever think as much of you as i do i be quite certain of it it could not be do i _ know _ you you see i understand everything you do and whatever you do it be just fine for I you could not be as happy with any one else you could not i feel that in my bone now -- now i must tell you something -- the praise the sympathy the passion be astounding marvellous and delicious to she be it conceivable that this experienced and worldly man have be captivate by such a mere girl as herself she have never guess it or have she always guess it a intense pride warm she blood like a powerful cordial life be even grander than she have think she droop into a intoxication among all that he have say he have not say that he be not stronger than she he have not relinquish he authority she feel it sit almost beneath he in the slippery chair she know that she would yield to he she desire to yield to he she mind be full of sensuous image base on the abdication of she will in favor of he now look here hilda i want to tell you -- he perhaps do not intend that she should look up but she look up and she be surprise to see that he face be full of troubled hesitation show almost dismay he make the motion of swallow she smile and set she shoulder back -- the very gesture that she have learn from he what she question in a whisper she brief mood of courage be over she sink before he again and wait with bow head profoundly disturbed he stand quite still for a few seconds with shut lip and then he make another step to approach you name 's get to be cannon she hear he say she think still wait : if this go on a moment longer i shall die of anticipation in bliss and when she feel he hand on she shoulder and the great shadow of he on part of she face she body seem to sigh acquiescent and for the moment assuage : this be a miracle and life be miraculous she acknowledge that she have lack faith in life she be now on the river whirling but at the same time she be in the small hot room and both george cannon 's hand be on she unresisting shoulder and then they be round she and she feel he physical nearness the texture of he coat and of he skin she could see in a mist the separate hair of he tremendous moustache and the color swim in he eye she nostril expand in transient alarm to a faint exciting masculine odour she be disconcert if not panic-struck by the violence of he first kiss but she consternation be delectable to she and amid she fright and she joy and the wonder of she extreme surprise and the preoccupation of be whirl down the river she calmly reflect somewhere in she brain : the door be not lock suppose some one be to come in and see we and she reflect also in a ecstasy of relief : my life will be quite simple now i shall have nothing to worry about and i can help he for during a year past she have never cease to ask herself what she must do to arrange she life she conscience have never cease to tell she that she ought not to be content to remain in the narrow idea of she mother and that though she prefer marriage she ought to act independently of the hope of it throughout she long stay in preston street she have continually say : after this -- what this can not last for ever when it come to a end what be i to do to satisfy my conscience and she have think vaguely of magnificent activity and purpose -- she know not what the problem exist no more she life be arrange and now far more sincerely than in the king 's road twenty minute earlier she regard the career of a spinster with horror and with scorn at best she suddenly perceive with blinding clearness it would have be pitiful -- pitiful twenty minute earlier in the king 's road she have dream of belong absolutely to some man of be at he disposal of be under he might of be helpless before he and now miracle thrice miraculous miracle unconceived inconceivable no more ` talk ' now she tell herself how admirable be the man she assure herself that he be entirely admirable she remind herself that she have always deem he admirable that only twenty minute earlier in the king 's road when there be in she mind no dimmest wildest notion of the real future she have genuinely admire he how clever how tactful how indomitable how conquer how generous how kind he be how kind to he half-sister how forbear with she indeed she could not recall he fault and he be inevitably destine to brilliant success she would be the wife of a great and a wealthy man and in she own secret way she could influence he and thus be greater than the great love it be a absolute fact that the name of ` love ' do not in the first eternal moment even occur to she and when it do she give it but little importance she have to admit that she have not consciously think of george cannon with love -- at any rate with love as she have imagine love to be indeed she immediate experience would not fit any theory that she could formulate but with the inexorable realism of she sex she easily dismiss inconvenient name and theory and accommodate herself to the fact and the fact be that she overwhelmingly want george cannon and as she now recognize have want he ever since she first see he the recognition afford she intense pleasure she abandon herself candidly to this luxury of a unknown desire it be incomparably the most splendid and dangerous experience that she have ever have she do not reason and she have no wish to reason she be set above reason happy to the point of delicious pain she yet yearn forward to a happiness far more excruciating she be perfectly aware that she bliss would be torment until george cannon have marry she until she have wholly surrender to he yet at interval a voice say very clearly within she : all this be wrong this be base and shameful this be something to blush for really she do blush but she blush be a part of the delight and the voice be not persistent she could silence it with scarcely a effort despite its clarity kiss I george cannon demand of she with eager masterfulness the request shock she for a instant and the young girl in she be about to revolt but she kiss he -- a act which combine the sweetness of submission with the glory of triumph she look at he steadily confident in herself and in he she feel that he know how to love he emotion fill she with superb pride she seem to be say to he in a doomed rapture : do you think i do not know what i be do i know i know the current of the river be tremendous she foresee the probability of disaster she be aware that she have definitely challenge the hazard of fate but she be not terrify in the dark swirl night of she destiny she straighten she shoulder with all she innocence and ignorance and impulsiveness and weakness she have behind she the unique and priceless force of she youth she be young and she put she trust in life chapter iii florrie again i as they be walk home along the king 's road hilda suddenly stop in front of a chemist 's shop i have get something to buy here she say diffidently and then add : i 'll follow you and what have you get to buy he ask face she with he benevolent ironical expression never mind she gently laugh i sha not be many minute after you she pretend to make a mystery but she sole purpose be to avoid re-enter the house in he company and she know that he have divine this nevertheless she find pleasure in the perfectly futile pretence of a mysterious purchase she be very self-conscious as they stand there on the dusty footpath amid the promenader gay and gloomy chattering and silent who be take the sun and the salt breeze despite she reason she have a fear that number of people would perceive she to be newly affianced and remark upon the contrast between she girlishness and he maturity but george cannon be not in the slightest degree self-conscious he play the lover with ease and say quite simply and convincingly just the thing which she would have expect a lover to say indeed the conversation as carry on by he between the moment of betrothal and the arrival at the chemist 's shop be the one phenomenon of the engagement which correspond with she preconceived idea concern such a affair it convince she that she really be affianced well he murmur fondly and yet quizzically as they remain wordless deliciously hesitate to part what be you think about she reply with brave candor appeal to he by a soft glance : i be only think how queer it be i should be engage in a room i would never see before in my life -- go into it like that he look at she uncomprehending for a instant he feature be blank then he smile kindly it be so strange she encourage he yes be not it he agree with charming tranquil politeness he do not see it she think as she watch the play of he face he do not see how wonderful it be that i should go into a room that be absolutely unknown to I and then this should happen at once why i never know there be such a room she could not define how she be affect by this fact but she regard the fact as tremendously romantic and its effect on she be profound and george saw in it no significance she be disconcerted she feel a tremor it be as though the entire king 's road have quiver for a fraction of a second and then feign nonchalance resume its moveless solidity inside the chemist 's she demand the first thing she set eye on -- a tooth-brush all the while she be examine various shape of toothbrush she have a vision of george raise he hat to take leave of she and she could see not only the curve of he hand and the whiteness of he cuff but also the million of tiny mark and crease on the coarse skin of he face extraordinarily different from she own smooth pure delicate silky complexion and she remember that less than three year ago she have regard he as of another generation as indefinitely older and infinitely more experienced than she childish and simple self this reflection produce in she a consternation which be curiously blissful no madam the white-aproned chemist be say it be this size that we usually sell to lady she put on the serious judicial air of a authentic adult woman and frown at the chemist ii when in preston street she be reluctantly approach the house she see a cab come downward in the opposite direction stop at no 59 that must be florrie she say half-aloud the boarding-house be in need of another servant young strong and reliable hilda have suggest that miss florence bagster might be invite to accept the situation sarah gailey have agree that it would be wise to have a servant from turnhill she mistrust southern servant and appear to believe that there be no real honesty south of the trent florence bagster have accept the situation with enthusiasm write that she long to be again with she former mistress she do not write that the mysterious and magnetic name of brighton call she more loudly than the name of she former mistress and now florence be due but it be not florence who emerge from the cab it be a tall and full-bosomed young lady in a gay multi-coloured costume and glove and a sunshade and a striking hat this young lady stand by the cab expectant and smile while the cabman pull a tin trunk off the roof of the vehicle and then when the cabman have climb down and be drag the trunk after he she put out a arm and seize one handle of the trunk to help he which act so strange on the part of a young lady make hilda come nearer and nearer look more carefully she be astounded as she realize that the unknown young lady be not a young lady after all but the familiar florrie at the advanced age of sixteen the aged cabman have make no mistake he leave the tin trunk on the pavement and take timid florrie 's money without touch he hat for it florrie be lay she sunshade rather forlornly on the top of the tin trunk and prepare to lift the trunk unaid when mr boutwood stout and all in black come gallantly forth from the house to assist she sarah gailey 's opposition have not be persistent enough to keep the jovial mr boutwood out of no 59 shortly after christmas he wife have die suddenly and mr boutwood with plenty of time and plenty of money on he hand have find himself desolate in he desolation he have seek he old acquaintance george cannon and the result have somehow be that bygones have become bygones and a new boarder have increase the prosperity of no 59 sarah gailey could not object indeed she have actually weep for the death of one enemy and the affliction of another moreover she seldom have contact with the boarder now the rather peculiar circumstance of florrie 's arrival almost cure hilda 's self-consciousness and she enter the house in the wake of the trunk with a certain forgetful ease there be mr boutwood still dally with florrie and the trunk in the narrow hall the shocking phenomenon of a boarder help a domestic servant with she luggage have be render possible only by a series of accident the front door be leave open on account of the weather mr boutwood have have a direct view of the maiden and the maiden have not be oblige to announce she arrival officially by ring a bell hence the other servant have not have notice and of the overseer of the house one be imprison in the basement and the other two have be out betrothe themselves in the ordinary way the slightest unusualness in the hall would instantly attract the attention of somebody in authority mr boutwood be not immediately aware of hilda he attitude towards florrie be shocking to hilda in a double sense it shock she as a overseer but it shock she quite as much as a young woman newly jealous for the pride of all she sex florrie be beyond question exceedingly pretty in particular the chin pout more deliriously than ever she complexion be even finer than hilda 's own she have a simple good-natured glance a quick and extraordinarily seductive smile and the unique bodily grace of she year she costume though vulgar and very ill-made be effective at a little distance she form and movement give it a fictitious worth indeed she be a amazing blossom to have come off the dunghill of calder street domestic drudgery have not yet dehumanize nor disfigure she -- it be true that she hand be conceal in glove and she foot beneath a flow skirt now mr boutwood 's attitude show very plainly that the girlish charm of florrie have produce in he a definite and familiar effect he would have be ready to commit folly for the young woman and to deny that she be a drudge or anything but a beautiful creature hilda object she object because mr boutwood be a widower hold that he have no right to joy and that he ought to mourn practically for ever in solitude she would make no allowance for he human instinct he need of intimate companionship he enormous unoccupied leisure she would have condemn he utterly on the score of he widowhood alone but she object far more strongly to he attitude because he be fat and look somewhat coarse she count he obesity to he for a sin and it be naught to she that he have be a martyr to idleness and wealth which combination have prematurely aged he mr boutwood be really younger than george cannon and florence bagster certainly seem as old as hilda yet the juxtaposition of the young slim and virginal florrie and the large earth-worn mr boutwood profoundly offend she it be mr boutwood who first discover that hilda be in the doorway he be immediately abashed and present the most foolish appearance whereupon hilda add scorn to she disgust florrie however easily keep she countenance and with a pert smile take the hand which she former mistress graciously extend by universal custom a servant retain some of the privilege of humanity for several minute after enter upon a new servitude mr boutwood vanish louisa will help you upstairs with the trunk say hilda when she have make inquiry about the wonderful journey which florrie have accomplish alone and about the health of florrie 's aunt and of she family louisa she call loudly up the stair and down into the basement iii she follow the procession of the trunk upstairs and louisa have descend again show florrie into the kennel this tiny apartment have in it two truckle-bed and a wash-bowl on a chair and little else a very small square trap-window in the low ceiling procure a dusky light in the middle hour of the day florence seem delighted with the room she might have have to sleep under the stair put on you afternoon apron and then you can go down and see miss gailey say hilda and shut the door upon florrie in she new home when she turn there be george cannon on the half-landing beneath the skylight she know not how he have come there nor whether he have enter the house before or after herself i be glad he be not fat she think and it be as though she have think : if he be fat everything would be different she feature do not relax as she go down the five step to the half-landing where he wait smile faintly she think : we must be very serious and circumspect in the house there must never be the slightest -- but while she be yet on the last step he firmly put he hand on she ear and draw she head towards he kiss she full on the mouth and she see again through she eyelash all the detail of he face she yield all she idea of circumspection melt magically away in a abandon tenderness of which she be ashamed but for which she would have unreflectingly make any sacrifice the embrace be over in a instant besides be guiltless of obesity george cannon be free from the unpardonable fault of clumsiness he be audacious but he be not foolhardy and he would never be abashed true she have see dismay on he face at the moment of he declaration but that moment be unique and he dismay have ineffably flattered she now on the half-landing she be drench in bliss and she feel dissolute she feel even base but she do not care she think as it be startle : this be love this must be what love be i must have be in love without know it and as for a girl always know when a man 's in love with she and foresee the proposal and all that sort of thing she practical contempt for all that sort of thing could not be state in word florrie 's just come she whisper and by a movement of the head indicate that florrie be in the kennel they go together to the drawing-room on the first floor it be empty the entire population of the boarding-house be still on the seashore hilda stand near the door which she leave open and give detailed news of florrie in a tone very matter-of-fact there be no reference to love or to the new situation create or to the vast enterprise of the chichester the topic be florrie and somehow it hold the field despite effort to dislodge it then the stair creak already florrie be come down in a trice she have make herself ready for work she come down timidly not daring to look to right nor left but concentrate she attention on the stair she pass along the landing outside the drawing-room door and hilda open the door a little wider have a full surreptitious view of she back and george cannon farther within the room also see she they watch she disappear on she way to find the basement and the formidable sarah gailey hilda be touch by the spectacle of this child disguise as a strapping woman far remove from she family and she companion and she familiar haunt and drive or draw into exile at brighton where she would only see the sea once a week except through window and where she would have to work from fourteen to sixteen hour a day for a living and sleep in a kennel the prettiness the pertness and the naïve contentedness of the child thus realize a ambition touch she deeply it do seem a shame do not it she say what bring she all the way up here like this she do not know a soul in brighton she be bind to be frightfully home-sick -- what about you george cannon interrupted politely do not she know you he smile with all he kindness yes -- but -- hilda do not finish it be not worth while george cannon have not understand he do not feel as she feel and she emotion be incommunicable to he a tremendous misgiving seize she and she have a physical feeling of emptiness in the stomach it pass swiftly as a hallucination just such a misgiving as visit nearly every normal person immediately before or immediately after marriage she ignore it she be engage -- that be the paramount fact she be engage and joyously determine to prosecute the grand adventure to the end the immensity of the risk force she to accept they iv that evening sarah gailey be in torment from the pain in she wrist there be nothing to be do she have have the doctor and no article of the prescribed treatment have be neglect with unaccustomed aid from hilda she have accomplish the business of undress and get into bed and now she sit up in bed support by she own pillow and one from hilda 's bed and nurse she wrist while hilda pour drop of a narcotic for she into a glass of water apart from the serious local symptom she health be fairly good she could eat she could talk she could walk and she brain be clear hilda hold the glass for she to drink for it be prudent to keep she hand as much as possible in repose there say hilda as if to a young child who have be querulous i be sure you 'll sleep now i do not think i shall the sufferer whine oh yes you will hilda insist firmly although she be by no means sure let I take this extra pillow away and then you can lie down properly she be think reproachfully : what a pity it be for all of we that the poor thing can not bear she pain with a little less fuss it be not sarah alone who be embittered and fatigue by sarah 's pain where 's george ask the invalid when she be lay down in the parlor why oh nothing by the way say hilda seize by a sudden impulse which have its origin in sarah 's tone at once martyrize and accuse -- by the way who _ be _ it that be be talk scandal about I and george scandal sarah gailey seem weakly to protest against the word because if you want to know hilda continue we be engage to be marry she reflect contrite : this will not help she to sleep and then add in a new endearing accent await a outburst of some kind from sarah : of course it be a secret dear i be tell no one but you after a moment 's silence sarah remark casually with shut eye : it 'll be much the best not to tell anyone and the shorter the engagement the better do not let anybody in the house know till you be marry she sigh put she cheek into the pillow and move she bind wrist for a few seconds restlessly if you turn the gas down she finish very wearily i dare say i may get off if only they would stop that piano upstairs she have display no surprise at the tremendous event no sentimental interest in it the fact be that sarah gailey 's wrist be infinitely more interesting to she than any conceivable project of marriage continuous and acute pain have withdraw she from worldly affair make she more than ever like a god hilda be startle but she be relieve now for the first time she have the authentic sensation of be engage and it appear to she that she have be engage for a very long period and that the engagement be a quite ordinary affair she be relieved yet she be also grievously sadden she lower the gas and in the gloom gaze for a few seconds at the vague huddle sheeted faintly moan figure on the bed the untidy gray hair against the pillow strike she as intolerably pathetic good night she say softly and the feeble plaintive voice respond : good night she go out leave the door slightly ajar v in the parlor adjoining george cannon be seat at the table when hilda see he and they eye meet she be comfort a wave of tenderness seem to agitate she she realize that this man be hers and the realization be marvellously reassure the sound of the piano descend delicately from the drawing-room as from a great distance from the kitchen come the muffle clatter of earthenware and occasionally a harsh loud voice it be the hour of relax discipline in the kitchen where amid the final washing-up and much free discussion and banter florrie be recommence she career on a grander basis hilda close the door very quietly when she have close it and be shut in with george cannon she emotion grow intenser i think she 'll get off now she whisper standing near the door have you tell she hilda nod what do she say hilda raise she eyebrow : oh well she say we would better keep it quiet and make the engagement as short as possible she blush look here say george let 's go out eh but -- what will people say what the devil do it matter what they say i want you to come out with I the whisper oath and he defiant smile enchant she we can go out by the area step he continue there be two of 'em sit in the hall but the front door 's shut do go and get you hat she leave the room with a obedient smile push open sarah 's door very gently she grope on the hook behind it for she hat it will not matter about glove -- in the dark she think besides i must not disturb she before drawing-to the door she look again at the bed there be neither sound nor movement probably sarah gailey sleep the dim vision of the form on the bed and the blue spark of gas in the corner produce in hilda a mood of poignant and yet delicious sorrow why what be the matter george cannon ask when she have return to the parlor she know that she eye be humid with tear both she arm be raise above she head as she fix the hat this act of fix the hat in george 's presence give she a new pleasure she smile at he nothing she say whisper mysteriously i think she be go off i be so glad you know she really do suffer dreadfully he look be uncomprehending but she do not care the anticipation of go out with he be now utterly absorb she he wait with he hand on the gas-tap till she be ready and then he lower the gas wait a moment she whisper at the door and with a gesture call he back into the room from the flagged passage lead to the area step on the desk be he evening glass of milk which he drink cold in summer she offer it to he in the twilit room like a enraptured handmaid he have forget it the fact that he have forget it and she have remember it yet further increase she strange mournful ecstatic bliss have some he whisper when he have drunk she finish the glass tremble they go forth climb the area step with proper precaution and escape as thief escape down the street for a instant she glimpse the wide-open window of the drawing-room and the dining-room from behind whose illuminated blind come float as it be wistfully the sound of song and chatter she think of sarah gailey prone and unconscious in the basement and she feel the moisture of the milk on she lip be i happy or unhappy she question herself and could not reply she know only that she be thrillingly smartingly alive at the corner of preston street and king 's road a landau wait this be ours say george casually ours what a splendid masculine idea how it prove that he too have be absorb in the adventure she admire he humbly like a girl like a little girl with the most formal deference he help she into the carriage drive towards shoreham he commandingly direct the driver and take he place by she side yes he be mature he be a man of the world he have have every experience he know how to love that such a be be hers that she without any effort have capture such a be flatter she to a extreme degree she be glorious with pride she lean back in the carriage negligently affect a absolute calm she arm herself in she virginity not george cannon himself could have guess that only by a miracle of self-control do she prevent she hand from seek he beneath the light rug that cover they knee she intimidate george cannon in that hour and the while she heart burn with shame at the secret violence of she feeling she think : this must be love this be love and yet she conscience inarticulately accuse she of obliquity but she do not care and she would not reflect she think that she wilfully perversely refuse to reflect but in reality she be quite helpless under the still and feverish night the landau roll slowly along between the invisible murmur sea and the light facade of hove occasionally other carriage contain other couple approach be plain for a moment and dissolve away so she think the engagement ought to be short say george cannon yes so do i he pronounce with emphasis hilda desire to ask he : how short but she could not she could not bring herself to put the question she be too proud by a short engagement do he mean six month three month a month dare she hope that he mean a month this be a think bury in the deepest fastness of she soul a thought that she would have perish in order not to expose but it exist i think i should like to go back now she breathe timidly before they be beyond hove it be not a request to be ignore the carriage turn she feel relief the sensation of be alive have be too acute to be bear and it be now a little ease she know that she destiny be irrevocable that nothing could prevent she from be george cannon 's whether the destiny be evil or good do not paramountly interest she but she want to rush forward into the arm of fate and know she fate she dream only of the union \* \* \* \* \* book v she deliverance chapter i louisa uncontrolled i hilda after a long railway journey be bathing she face arm and neck at the large double washstand in the large double bedroom on the second floor of no 59 preston street at the back of the washstand be a unused door which give into a small bedroom occupy by the youngest miss watchett george cannon come up quietly behind she she pretend not to hear he he put he hand lightly on she wet arm smile with condescending indulgence half to herself she still pretend to ignore he and continue she toilet the return from the honeymoon which she have fear have accomplish itself quite simply and easily she have fear the return because only upon the return be the marriage to be formally acknowledge and publish it have be obviously impossible to announce during the strenuous summer season the engagement of the landlord to a young woman who live under the same roof with he the consequence of such a indiscretion would have be in various way embarrassing hence not a word be say nor be definite plan for the wedding make until george remark one evening that he would like to be marry at chichester chichester be the name of he new private hotel which exhibition of sentimentality have both startle and touch hilda chichester however have to be renounce owe to the difficulty of residence the subject have be thus fairly broached george have pursue it and one day somewhat casually state that he have take a room in lewe and mean to sleep there every night for the term impose by the law less than three week later hilda have inobtrusively depart from no 59 the official account be that she be to take a holiday with friend after the fatigue of August and early September she leave the train at lewe and there in the presence of stranger be marry to george cannon who have quit brighton two day earlier and be suppose to be in london on business even sarah gailey though she health have improve do not assist at the wedding sarah sole depositary of the secret have to remain in charge of no 59 a strange wedding not a single wedding present except those interchange by the principal nor have any of the problem raise by the marriage be solve or attack the future of sarah gailey for example be sarah to go on live with they it be inconceivable and yet the converse be also inconceivable sarah have say nothing and nothing have be say to sarah matter be to settle themselves it have not even be decide which room mr and mr cannon should inhabit as man and wife it be almost certain that in the dead period between the popular summer season and the fashionable autumn season there would be several bedroom empty hilda like george do not want to bother with a lot of tedious detail important or unimportant the attitude of each be : let I get marry first and then i 'll see to all that thus have the return be formidable to hilda all the way from ireland she have be say to herself : i shall have to go up the step and into the house and be speak to as mr cannon and then there 'll be sarah but the entry into the house have produce no terror everywhere george 's adroitness have be wonderful extraordinarily comforting and reassuring and nowhere more so than in the vestibule of no 59 the tone in which he have say to louisa take mr cannon 's handbag louisa have be a marvel of ease louisa have incontestably blench for the bizarre sarah who conserve in brighton the inmost spirit of the five town have think fit to tell the servant nothing whatever but the trained veteran in louisa have instantly recover and she have reply yes sir with a simplicity which prove she to be the equal of george cannon the worst be over for hilda and the next moment be make smooth by reason of a great piece of news which force sarah gailey to communicate it at once monopolize attention and so entirely relieve the bride 's self-consciousness florence bagster have insolently quarrel with she mistress have leave she service without notice mr boutwood have also go and the connection between the two departure be only too apparent not merely to sarah but also to the three miss watchett who have recently arrive florence who could but whisper have shout at she mistress little flushing modest florrie who yesterday in the five town be a infant have compromise herself with a fat widower certainly old enough to be she father and the widower the friend of the house have have so little regard for the feeling of the house that he have not hesitate to flaunt with florrie in the town it be know that they be more or less together and that he stand between florrie and the world ii i suppose i would better write at once to she mother -- or perhaps she aunt she aunt 's get more sense say hilda as she drop the sponge and grope for a towel she eye half blind in move she have escape from he hand what do you say she ask have hear a vague murmur through the towel i say you can write if you like george speak with a careless smile now face she he put he hand on she damp shoulder she look up at he over the towel lean she head forward and suspend action she nose be about a foot from he she see as she have see a hundred time every detail of he large handsome and yet time-worn face every hair of he impressive moustache all the melting shades of color in he dark eye he charm be coarse and crude but he be very skilful and there be something about he experienced weather-beaten slightly depraved air which excite she she like to feel young and girlish before he she like to feel that with he alone of all man she modesty avail nothing she be begin to realize she power over he and the extent of it it be a power miraculous and mysterious never claim by she and never admit by he save in glance and gesture this power lay in the fact that she be indispensable to he he be not she slave -- she might indeed have be consider the human chattel -- but he be the slave of he need of she he love she in he she see what love be she have see it more and more clearly ever since the day of they engagement she be both proud and ashamed of she power he do not possess a similar power over herself she be fond of he perhaps get fonder but he domination of she sens be already nearly at a end she have pass through painful shatter ecstasy of bliss hour unforgettable hour which she know could never recur and she be leave sate and unsatisfied so that by virtue of this not yet quite bitter disillusion she be come to regard herself as he superior as be less naïve than he as be even essentially older than he and in speak to he sometimes she would put on a grave and precociously sapient mien as if to indicate that she have access to source of wisdom for ever close to he but do not you think we _ ought _ to write she frown certainly if you like it will not do any good you do not suppose she aunt will come down here do you and even if she do there it be and there you be just let I wipe my shoulder will you she say he lift he hand obediently and as they be damp he rub they on the loose corner of the towel well he say i must be off i reckon shall you see mr boutwood i might i know where to catch he i fancy she seem to have a glimpse of she husband 's separate life in the town -- masculine haunt and habit of which she know nothing and would always know nothing and the large existence of the male make she envious go to see he now well yes george smile roguishly what shall you say to he what can i say to he no business of mine you know except that we have lose a decent servant but i expect that be sarah 's fault she be no use whatever with servant now sarah be not _ i _ shall never speak to mr boutwood again hilda exclaim almost passionately oh but -- he behavior be simply scandalous it be really wicked a man like he george put he lip out deprecatingly you may depend she ask for it he say what she ask for it he repeat with convinced firmness and look at she steadily a flush slowly spread over she face and neck and she lower she gaze in she breast pride and shame be again mingle you keep you hair on littl ` un say george soothingly and kiss she then he take he hat and stick which be with a lot of other thing on the broad white counterpane and go off stylishly you do not understand she throw at he with a delicious side-glance of reproof as he open the door she reproach herself for the deceive coquetry of the glance do not i he return airily he be quite sure that nothing escape he intelligence to hilda shock by the coarseness and the obtuseness which evidently characterize he attitude now as on other occasion this self-confidence be desolate it be ominously sinister iii she be alone with she image in the mirror and the image be precisely the same that she have always see she could detect no change in it whatever she like the sensation of be alone and at home in this room which before she have only enter as a overseer and which she have never expect to occupy she savor the intimacy of the room -- the necessaries on the washstand the superb tortoiseshell brush buy by george in dublin on the dressing-table the open trunk george 's clothes on a chair and she own flimsy trifle on the bed through the glass she see behind she image the image of the closed door and then she turn round to look at the real door and to assure herself that it be close childish and yet george have shut the door she remember the noise of its shut and that noise in she memory seem to have transform itself into the sound of fate 's deep bell she could hear the clang sharp definite she realize suddenly and with awe that she destiny be fix hereafter she have come to the end of she adventure and she vague dream for she have always dream vaguely of a enlarged liberty of wide interest and of original activity -- such as no woman to she knowledge have ever have she have always compare the life of man with the life of woman and admit and resent the inferiority of the latter she have have glimpse once of the male world she have make herself the only woman shorthand-writer in the five town and one of the earliest in england -- dizzy thought but the glimpse have be vain and tantalizing she have be in the male world but not of it as though encircle in a glass ball which neither she nor the male could shatter she have have money freedom and ambition and somehow through ignorance or through lack of imagination or opportunity have be unable to employ they she have never know what she want the vision have never be clear and she reflect : i wonder if my daughter suppose i have one would be as different from I as i be from my mother she could recall with intense vividness the moment when she have first really contemplated marriage it be in the steam-tram after have see edwin clayhanger at the door of clayhanger 's shop and she could recall the sense of relief with which she have envisage a union with some man stronger and more experienced than herself in the relief be a certain secret shame as though it imply cowardice a shrink away from the challenge of life and from the call of a proud instinct in the steam-tram she have foresee the time when she would belong utterly to some man surrender to he without reserve the time when she would be a woman and the thing have come about only yesterday she have be a little girl enter george cannon 's office with timid audacity to consult he only yesterday george cannon have be a strange formidable man indefinitely older and infinitely cleverer than she and now they be man and wife now she be he now she profoundly know he and he be no longer formidable in spite of he force she have a recondite dominion over he she guess herself to be he superior in certain quality he be reveal to she she feel that she be not reveal to he and that in spite of she wholehearted surrender she have not give all because of he blindness to what she offer she could not completely respect he but she be he she be naught apart from he she be the wife he existence go on mainly as before hers be divert narrow -- fundamentally altered never now could she be enfranchise into the male world iv she slip she arm into a new bodice purchase in london on the second day of the marriage blush she have try on that bodice in a great shop in oxford street then it be that she have first say ` my husband ' in public all that day she have feel so weak and shy and light and helpless and guilty that she have positively not know what she be do she have move in a phantom world only she have perceive quite steadily and practically that she must give more attention to she clothes she old contempt for finery expire in the glory of she new condition and now as she settle the elegant bodice on she shoulder and fasten it and pat she hair and pick up the skirt and poise it over she head she have a stern preoccupy look as of one who say : this that i be do be important i must not be hurry in do it it be vital that i should look well and that no detail of my appearance should jar already she could see herself stand before george when he return for the meal -- the first meal which they would take together in the home she could feel he eye on she : she could anticipate she own mood -- in which would be mingled pride misgiving pleasure helplessness abandonment -- and the secret condescension towards he of she inmost soul all alone in the room she could feel he hand again on she shoulder : a mysterious excitation she be a married woman she have the right to discuss florrie 's case with aloof disdain if she choose she respectability be unassailable none might penetrate beyond the fact of she marriage and yet far within she she be ashamed she dimly admit once more as on several occasion previous to she marriage that she have dishonour a ideal she conscience would not chime with the conscience of society she think as she prepare with pleasurable expectancy for she husband : this be not right this can not lead to good it must lead to evil i be bind to suffer for it the whole thing be wrong i know it and i have always know it already she be disappoint with she marriage amid the fever of bodily appetite she could clearly distinguish the beginning of lassitude she no longer see she husband as a romantic and baffling figure she have explore and charter he soul and not all he excellence could atone for he earthliness she wonder grimly where and under what circumstance he have acquire the adroitness which have charm and still do charm she she see in front of she a vista of day and year in which ennui would probably increase and joy diminish and she put she shoulder back defiantly and think : well here i be anyhow i want he and i have get he what i have to go through i shall go through and all the time float like vapor over these depths be a sheeny mood of bright expectation and immediate naïve content and she say gaily that she must write at once to janet orgreave to announce the marriage and that she mother 's uncle up in the north must also be inform v unusual phenomenon make themselves apparent on the top staircase : raise voice which hilda could hear more and more plainly even through the shut door at no 59 in the off-season nobody ever speak in a loud tone particularly on the staircase except perhaps florrie when in conversation with louisa she think she be out of all other hearing hilda 's voice be very clear and penetrate but not loud george cannon 's voice in public place such as the staircase have a almost caress softness the watchett coo like faint dove thereby express the delicate refinement of they virginal nature the cook 's voice be unknown beyond the kitchen and nobody be more grimly self-controlled in speech than sarah gailey and louisa these two -- and especially louisa -- seem generally to be restrain with ease tremendous secret force of bitterness and contempt and now it be just these two who be noisy and become noisier to the dismay of a scandalize house owe to some accident or negligence the secret force have get loose hilda shake she head it be clear that the problem of sarah gailey would have to be tackle and settle very soon the poor woman 's physical suffering have without doubt react detrimentally on she temperament and temper she use to be quite extraordinarily adroit in the directing of servant though she manner to they never approach geniality but she have quarrel with florrie and now she be break the peace with louisa it be preposterous and annoying and it could not be allow to continue hilda be not seriously alarmed because she have the most perfect confidence in george 's skill to restore order and calm and to conquer every difficulty of management and she also put a certain trust in herself but the menacing and vicious accent of louisa startle she and she sympathize with sarah gailey for whom humiliation be assuredly in store -- if not immediately at the tongue of louisa then later when george would have to hint the truth to she about she decadence the dispute on the attic landing appear to be concern linen which louisa have omit to remove from florrie 's abandon couch in she kennel i be not go to touch she sheet not for nobody louisa proclaim savagely and by that single phrase with its implication she lay unconsciously bare the sordid baseness of she ageing heart she expose by she mere intonation of the word ` sheet ' all the foulness of jealousy and thwart salacity that be usually conceal beneath she tight dress and neat apron and beneath she prim gesture and deferential tone she undisciplined voice ring spinsterishly down the staircase outrage it defile the whole interior hilda as silently as possible unlatched the door of the bedroom and stand with ear cock should she issue forth and interfere or should she remain discreetly where she be almost in the same instant she hear the cautious unlatching of the drawing-room door two of the watchett be there listen also and there come up from the ground floor a faint giggle the cook at the kitchen door be enjoy herself and giggle moral support to she colleague the giggle prove that the master be out that the young mistress have not yet establish a definite position and that during recent week the old mistress must have be steadily dissipate she own authority hilda peer along the landing from she lair and upstairs and downstairs she could see nothing but senseless carpet and brass rod and step and banister but she know that the entire household -- she have the sensation that the very house itself -- be alert and eavesdropping there be a hesitate movement on the unseen stair above and then hilda could see sarah gailey 's feel slipper and the valance of she skirt and she could hear sarah 's emotional breathing very well louisa i have do sarah 's voice be quieter now she be try to control it and to a limited extent be control its volume it shake in spite of she she speak true she have indeed do she be at the end of she resource i have be in house louisa conqueringly sneer that i have but i never be in a house afore where one as ought to have be scullery - girl go off with a boarder and nothing say and he the friend of the master and it be not as if that be all sheet indeed i have nothing further to say sarah return unnecessarily and descend the stair i shall simply report to mr cannon we shall see and what be this about _ mr _ cannon louisa shout beside herself the peculiarity of she tone arrest sarah gailey hilda flush the watchett be listen the watchett have not yet be tell of the marriage the announcement be to be make to they formally a little later and now it be louisa who be make the announcement brutally coarsely the outrage of the episode be a hundredfold intensify it grow into a inconceivable ghastly horror hilda 's self-respect seem to have a physical body and louisa to be hacking at it with a jagged knife mr cannon have bring he wife home say sarah gailey shortly with a dignity and courage that increase as she distance from the appalling the incredible louisa hilda could see she pale face now the eyebrow and chin be lift in scorn of the vile menial but the poor head be tremble and what about he other wife louisa -- sarah gailey look again up the stair -- i know you be in a temper and not responsible for what you say but you would better be careful she speak with elaborate haughty negligence have i louisa shrill what i say be what about he other wife what about the old woman he marry in devonshire why god bless I florrie be full of it -- could not talk about anything else in bed of a night do not you know the old woman would be inquire for she beautiful ` usband down you way she laugh loudly turnhill -- what be - its-name and all of you lie low and then make out all of a sudden as he be bring he wife home a nice house and i have be in a few too hilda could feel she heart beat with terrific force against she bodice but she be conscious of no other sensation she hear a loud snort of shatter contempt from louisa and then a strange and terrific silence fall on the stair there be no sound even of a movement the watchett do not stir the cook do not stir sarah gailey do not stir louisa 's fury be sate the empty landing lay as it be expectant at hilda 's door then sarah gailey perceive hilda half hide in the doorway and staggeringly rush towards she in a instant they be both in the bedroom and the door shut when will george be back so that he can put she out of the house sarah whisper frantically soon i expect say hilda and feel intensely self-conscious they say no more and it be as though the house be besiege and invest and only in that room be they safe and even in that room only for a few moment chapter ii some secret history i without a word sarah have leave the bedroom hilda wait sit on the bed for george to come back from he haunt in the town she both intensely desire and intensely fear he return a phrase or two of a angry and vicious servant have almost destroy she faith in she husband it seem very strange even to she that this should be so and she wonder whether she have ever have a real faith in he whether -- passion apart -- she feeling for he have ever be aught but admiration of he impressive adroitness be it possible that he have another wife alive no it be not possible that be to say it be not possible that such a catastrophe should have happen to just she to hilda lessway sit there on the bed with she hand press on the rough surface of the damask counterpane and yet -- how could louisa or florrie have invent the story wicked shocking incredible that florrie with she soft voice and timid affectionate manner should have be chatter in secret so scandalously during all these week she remember the look on florrie 's blush face when the child have receive the letter on the morning of they departure from the house in lessway street even then the attractively innocent and capable florrie must have have she naughty secret a odious world and hilda marry have seriously think that she know all about the world she have to admit bewildered : i be only a girl after all and a very simple one she compare she own heart in its simplicity with that of louisa louisa horrify and frighten she louisa and florrie be mischievous liar florrie have seize some fragment of silly gossip -- turnhill be notorious for its silly gossip -- and the two of they have embroider it in the nastiness of they soul she laugh shortly disdainfully to wither up silly gossip preposterous and yet -- when george have show she the licence in the name of cannon and she have venture to say apologetically and caressingly : i always understand you real name be canonge -- how queerly he have look as he answer : i change it long ago -- legally yes and she have persuade herself that the queerness of he look be only in she fancy but it be not only in she fancy suspicion sinister trifling souvenir crowd into she mind have she not always doubt he have she not always say to herself that she be do wrong in she marriage and that she would thereby suffer have she not abandon the pursuit of religious truth in favor of light enjoyment foolish of course old-fashioned of course to put two and two together in this way but she could not refrain i be ruin she decide in awe and the next instant she be say : how absurd of I to be like this merely because louisa she think she hear a noise below she heart leap again into violent activity tremble she creep to the door and gently unlatch it no slightest sound in the whole house dusk be come on swiftly then she could hear all the noise accentuate beyond custom of louisa setting tea in the dining-room for the watchett and then the tea-bell ring despite she fury apparent in the noise louisa have not find courage to neglect the sacred boarder she make a defiant fuss but she have to yield intimidate to the force of habit and tradition the watchett descend the staircase from the drawing-room practise as usual elaborate small-talk among themselves they have hear every infamous word of louisa 's tirade which have engender in they a truly dreadful and still delicious emotion but they descend the staircase in good order discuss the project for a new pier they reach the dining-room and shut the door on themselves silence again louisa ought now to have set the tea in the basement parlor but louisa do not louisa be hide in the kitchen doubtless talk fourteen to the dozen with the cook she have do all she mean to do she know that she would be compel to leave at once and not another stroke would she do of any kind the master and the mistress must manage as best they could louisa be already wonder where she would sleep that night for she be alone on earth and own one small trunk and a post office savings bank book all this trouble on account of florrie 's sheet sarah gailey be in she bedroom and do not dare to come out of it even to accuse louisa of neglect the basement tea and hilda continue to stand for age at the bedroom door while the dusk grow deeper and deeper at last the front door open and george 's step be in the hall hilda recognize it with a thrill of terror turn pale george run down into the basement and stumble hello she hear he call out what about tea where be you all sarah no answer no sound in response he run up the basement step would he call in at the dining-room or would he come to the bedroom in search of she he do not stop at the dining-room hilda want to shut the bedroom door but dare not because she could not do it noiselessly now he be on the first floor she rush to the bed and sit on it as she have be sit previously and wait in the most painful and irrational agony she be astonish at the darkness of the room turn she head she see only a whitish blur instead of a face in the dressing-table mirror ii what be up he demand burst somewhat urgently into the bedroom with he hat on what price the husband come home to he tea no tea no light i nearly break my neck down the basement stair he put he hand against she elbow and kiss she rather clumsily owe to the gloom between she nose and she mouth she do not shrink back but accept the embrace quite insensibly the contact of he moustache and of he lip and he slight pleasant masculine odour produce no effect on she whatever why be you sit here look here i have sign the transfer of those continental share and pay the cheque so it be domino now between the engagement and the marriage there have be a opportunity of purchase three thousand pound ' worth of preference share in the brighton hotel continental limited which hotel be the latest and largest in the king 's road a vast affair of eight storey and bathroom on every floor the chance of such a investment have fascinate george it help he dream and point to the time when he would be manager and part proprietor of a palace like the continental hilda be very willing he have sell she railway share and purchase the hotel share and he know that he have do a good thing now he possess a interest in three different establishment he who have scarcely be in brighton a year the rapid progress he feel be characteristic of he hilda keep silence for the sole reason that she could think of no word to say as for the matter of the investment it appear to she to be inexpressibly uninteresting from under the lash of lowered eye she see he form shadowily in front of she you do not mean to say sarah 's be make herself disagreeable already he say and he tone be affectionate and diplomatic yet faintly ironical he have perceive that something unusual have occur perhaps something serious and he be anxious to soothe and to justify he wife hilda perfectly understand he mood and intention and she be reassure have not sarah tell you she ask in a harsh uncontrolled voice though she know that he have not see sarah no where be she he inquire patiently it be louisa hilda go on with the sick fright of a child compel by intimidation to affront a danger she mouth be very dry oh she lose she temper and make a fearful scene with sarah on the stair she say the most awful thing george laugh low and lightly he guess louisa 's gift for foul insolence and invective for instance george encourage he be divine from hilda 's singular tone that tact would be need well she say you would get a wife living in devonshire there be a pause and who have tell she that florrie _ in_deed muttered george hilda could not decide whether he voice be natural or forced then he step across to the door and open it what be you go to do to she hilda question as it be despairingly he leave the room and bang the door it be not true hilda be begin to say to herself but she seem to derive no pleasure from the dawn hope of george 's innocence then george come into the room again hesitate and shut the door carefully i suppose it be no good shilly-shallying about he say in such a tone as he might have use have he be vex and disgust with hilda i have get a wife living and she be in devonshire i expect she be be inquire in turnhill if i be still in the land of the living probably want to get marry again herself hilda glance at he form and suddenly it be the form of a stranger but a stranger who have love she and she think : why do i let this stranger love I it be scarce believable that she have ever seriously regard he as a husband and she find that tear be run down she cheek and she feel all she girlishness and fragility do not i always know she ask herself with weak resignation that it be unreal what be i to do now the catastrophe have indeed happen to she and she could not deal with it she do not even feel tragic she do not feel particularly resentful against george she have read of such catastrophe in the newspaper but the reality of experience nonplus she i ought to do something she reflect but what what be the use of I say i be sorry he ask savagely i act for the best the chance be ten thousand to one against I be spot but there you be you never know you luck he speak meditatively in a rather hoarse indistinct voice all owe to florrie of course when it be suggest we should have that girl i know there be a danger but i pooh-pooh it i say nothing could possibly happen and just look at it now i want to cut myself clear of the five town absolutely -- absolutely and then like a damnation fool i let florrie come here if she have not come that woman might have inquire about I in turnhill till all be blue without you hear about she but there it be he snap he finger it be my fault for be find out that be the only thing i be guilty of and look at it look at it hilda could tell from the movement of the vague form in the corner by the door and by the quality of he voice that george cannon be in a state of extreme emotion she have never know he half so move he emotion excite she and flatter she she think how wonderful it be that she the shake little girl who yesterday have run off with fourpence to buy a meal at a tripe-shop should be the cause of this emotion in such a man she think : my life be marvellous she be dizzy by the conception of the capacity of she own body and soul for experience no factor save she own body and soul and he have be necessary to the bring about of the situation it be essential only that the man and the woman should be together and they companionship would produce miracle of experience she cease cry astounding that she have never in george 's eye suspect he past it be as if he have swiftly open a conceal door in the house of they passion and disclose a vista of which she have not dream but surely that must have be a long time ago she say in a ordinary tone consider that i be twenty-two -- yes why do you leave she why do i leave she because i have to i would go as a clerk in a solicitor 's office in torquay and she be a client she go mad about I i be only tell you she be a spinster have one of those big house high up on the hill behind the town he stop and then he voice begin to come again out of the deep shadow in the corner she want I and she get I and she do not care who know the wedding be in the _ torquay directory _ i tell she i would get no relation and she be jolly glad but how old be she young george sneer she would never see thirty-six again the day she be marry good-looking well-dressed very stylish and all that carry I off my foot of course there be the money i may as well out with it all while i be about it she make I a absolute present of four thousand pound insist on do it i never ask of course i know i marry for money it happen to youth sometimes just as it do to girl it may be disgusting but not more disgusting for one than for the other besides i do not realize it be a sale and purchase at the time oh and it last about ten day i could not stand it so i tell she so and chuck it she begin a action for restitution of conjugal rights but she soon tire of that she would not have she four thousand back simply would not she be a terror but i 'll say that for she well i keep it four thousand pound be a lot of brass that be how i start business in turnhill if you want to know he speak defiantly you may depend i never let on in the five town about my beautiful marriage that be the tale you have get to remember i be twenty-two she think of edwin clayhanger and charlie orgreave as be about twenty-two and try in she imagination to endow the mature george cannon with they youth and they simplicity and they freshness she be saddened and overawe not wrathful not obsess by a sense of injury then she hear a sob in the corner and then another the moment be terrible for she she could only distinguish in the room the blur of a man 's shape against the light-coloured wall-paper and the whiteness of the counterpane and the dark square of the window break by the black silhouette of the mirror she slip off the bed and go in the direction of the dressing-table grope for a match-box and light the gas dazzle by the glare of the gas she turn to look at the corner where stand george cannon iii the whole aspect of the room be now alter the window be blacker than anything else light shone on the carve frame of the mirror and on the vessel of the washstand the trunk each throw a sharply define shadow the bed be half in the shadow of its mahogany foot and half a glitter white all the array of requisite on the dressing-table lay stark under the close scrutiny of the gas and high above the bed partly on the wall and partly on the ceiling be a bright oblong reflection from the upturned mirror hilda turn to george with a straightening of the shoulder as if to say : it be i who have the courage to light the gas and face the situation but when she see he she challenging pride seem to die slowly away though there be no sign of a tear on he feature and though it be difficult to believe that it be he who have just sob nevertheless he figure be dismayingly tragic every feature be distort by agitation he be absorb in himself shameless and careless of appearance he be no more concerned about appearance and manly shame than a sufferer die in torment he be beyond all that -- in truth a new george cannon he leave the corner and sit down on the bed in the hollow make by hilda and stare at the wall he hand in the pocket of he gay suit he gesture as he move and he posture as he sit make they unconscious appeal to she in they abandonment he be catch he be vanquish he be despair but he instinctively and without any wish to do so keep he dignity he be still in he complete overthrow the mature man of the world the man to whom it be impossible to be ridiculous hilda in a curious way grow proud of he with a extraordinary inconsequence she dwell upon the fact that always grand -- even as a caterer he have cause to be print at the foot of the menu form which he have institute the word : a second help of all or any of the above dish will willingly be serve if so desire and in the general havoc of the shock she begin to be proud also of herself because it be the mysterious power of she individuality that have originate the disaster the sense of they intimate withdraw seclusion in the room disorder and litter by arrival utterly alone save for the living flame of the gas the sense of the tragedy and of the responsibility for it and especially she responsibility the sense of a impose burden to be grimly bear and of a unknown destiny to be work out the sense of pity the sense of youth and force -- these thing gradually exalt she and ennoble she desolation why do you keep it from I she ask in a very clear and precise tone not aggrieved but fatalistic and melancholy keep what from you at length he meet she eye darkly all this about you be marry why do i keep it from you he repeat harshly and then he tone change from defiance to a softened regret : i 'll tell you why i keep it from you because i know if i tell you i should have no chance with a girl like you i know it would be all up -- if i so much as breathe a hint of it i do not suppose you have the slightest idea how stand-offish you be I stand-offish she protest look here he say persuasively suppose i would tell you i want you and then that i would get a wife living -- what would you have say i do not know no but _ i _ know and suppose i would tell you i would get a wife living and then tell you i want you -- what then no hilda nobody could fool about with you she be flattered but she think secretly : he could have win I on any term he like i wonder whether he _ could _ have win I on any term that first night in this house when we be in the front attic -- suppose he would tell I then -- i wonder what should i have say but the severity of she countenance be a perfect mask for such weak and uncertain idea and confirm he deeply in he estimate of she he continue : now that first night in this house upstairs he jerk he head towards the ceiling she blush not from any shame but because he thought have surprise hers i be as near as dammit to let out the whole thing and chance it with you but i do not -- i see it would be no use and that be not the only time either she stand silent by the dressing-table calmly look at he and she ask herself eagerly curious : when be the other time of course it be all my fault he say what be this all my fault i do not want to excuse myself i have nothing to say for myself in she mind she secretly interrupt he : yes you have you could not do without I -- be not that enough i be ashamed he say without reserve abase himself i be utterly ashamed i would give anything to be able to undo it she be startle and offend she have not expect that he would kiss the dust she hate to see he thus she think : it be not all you fault it be just as much mine as yours but even if i be ashamed i would never confess it never would i grovel and never would i want to undo anything after all you take the chance you do what you think best why be ashamed when thing go wrong you would not have be ashamed if thing have go right of course he say after a pause i be completely do for he speak so solemnly and with such intense conviction that she be awed and appal she feel as one who have alone escape destruction in a earthquake stand afar off and contemplate the silent corpse - strew ruin of a vast city and the thought run through she mind like a squirrel through a tree : how _ could _ he refuse she four thousand pound and if she would not have it back -- well what be he to do she must be a horrible woman iv both of they hear a heavy step pass up the staircase it be louisa 's she pause to strike a match and light the gas on the landing and go on but sarah gailey have give no sign and the watchett be still shut in the dining-room all these middle-aged woman be preoccupy by the affair of george cannon all of they guess now that louisa 's charge be not unfounded -- otherwise why the mysterious and interminable interview between george cannon and hilda in the bedroom hilda picture they all and she think : but it be _ i _ who be in the bedroom with he it be i who be live through it and face it out they be all far older than I but they be outsider they do not know what life be george rise pick up a portmanteau and throw it open on the bed and what be to be do hilda ask tremble he turn and look at she i suppose i must not stay here she shake she head with lip press tight he voice be thick and obscure when he ask : you will not come with I she shake she head again she could not have speak she be in acute torture well he say i suppose i can count on you not to give I up to the police the police she exclaim why well you know -- it be a three year ' job -- at least ever hear the word ` bigamy ' he voice be slightly ironical oh dear she breathe already disconcert it have positively not occur to she to consider the legal aspect of george 's conduct but what can you do she ask with the innocent ignorant helplessness of a girl i can disappear he reply that be all i can do i do not see myself in prison i go over stafford prison once the governor show several of we over and i do not see myself in prison he begin to cast thing into the portmanteau and as he do so he proceed without a single glance at hilda : you 'll be all right for money and so on but i should advise you to leave here and not to come back any sooner than you can help that be the best thing you can do and be hilda lessway again sarah will have to manage this place as best she can fortunately she health 's improve she can make it pay very well if she like it be a handsome living for she my deposit on the chichester and so on will have to be forfeit and you she murmur he back be towards she he turn he head look at she enigmatically for a instant and resume he packing she desire to help he with the packing she desire to show he some tenderness she heart be cleft in two with pity but she could not move some harshness of pride or vanity prevent she from move when he have carelessly finish the portmanteau he stride to the door open it wide and call out in a loud firm voice : louisa a reply come weakly from the top floor : yes sir i want you he have a short way with louisa after a

move to and fro nervously stiff with have stand still so long she wonder how he and how she would comport themselves in the ordeal of adieu in a few moment a cab drive up -- louisa have probably encounter it on the way hilda wait tense then she hear the cab drive off again she rush aghast to the window she see the roof of the disappear cab and the unwieldy portmanteau on it he have go he have go without say good-bye that be he device for simplify the situation it be drastic but it be magnificent he have go out of the house and out of she life as she gaze at the dim sway roof of the cab magically the roof be take off and she could see the ravage and stricken figure within sit grimly in the dark between the wheel that roll he away from she the vision be intolerable she move aside and weep passionately how could he help do all he have do she have possess he -- the memory of he embrace tell she how utterly all that he have say be true and this be so who could blame he conduct he have only risk and lose sarah gailey suddenly appear in the room and shut the door like a conspirator then -- she begin terror-struck and hilda nod cease to cry oh my poor dear sarah gailey moan feebly she head bob with its unconscious nervous movement the sight of she worn saddened feature sharpen hilda 's appreciation of she own girlishness and inexperience but despite the shock despite she extreme misery despite the anguish and fear in she heart and the immense difficulty of the new situation into which she be thus violently thrust hilda be not without consolation she feel none of the

to leave she elder alone to they adult confidence and unwilling alicium have to obey but there be no confidence the talk as it be shiver on the brink of a confidence but never plunge do she guess hilda reflect the conversation so halt that at length janet be drive to the banality of say : i be so sorry we have to go out and hilda protest with equal banality and add : i suppose you be go out a lot just now oh no say janet we go out less and less and we get quieter and quieter i mean _ we _ the boy be always out you know she seem saddened i do think edwin clayhanger would come in sometimes

fireplace this board be cover by a wide length of bluish transparent paper which at interval he pull towards he make billow of paper at he foot and gradually lessen a roll of it that lay on the floor beyond the table a specially arrange gas-bracket with a green shade which throw a powerful light on the paper show that osmond orgreave 's habit be to work in that spot of a evening astonishing i have

column say mr orgreave that be all about racing say hilda oh dear dear from the bed well second column the potter ' strike the man 's leader she read the headline there be not much of it how beautifully clearly you read say mr orgreave with mild enthusiasm when hilda have read the meager half-column do i hilda flush be that all there be about it yes they do not seem to think it be very important that half the people be starve hilda sneer whose fault be it if they do starve osmond orgreave glance at she with lowered head i think it be a shame she exclaim do you know that the man

word i 'll just tell you a wise young woman like you ought not to be carry away by the sight of a procession on a cold night he smile and she smile but awkwardly and then he tell she something of the case for the employer how hard you be on the man she protest when he have do not at all not at all he stretch himself and come round he trestle to poke the fire you should hear mr clayhanger on the man if you want to know what hard be mr clayhanger you mean old mr clayhanger yes but he be not a manufacturer no but he be a employer of labor hilda rise uneasily from she chair and walk towards the distant shadowed dressing-table i should like to go over a printing-works she say abruptly very easy say mr orgreave resume he work with a great expulsion of breath hilda think : why do i say that and to cover she constraint she cry out : oh what a lovely book a small book bind in full purple calf lay half hide in a nest of fine tissue paper on the dressing-table yes be not it say mr orgreave tom bring it in to show I before he go this afternoon it be a birthday present for edie he be have it specially bind i must write myself and ask edie to come over and meet you i be sure you would like she she be a dear girl i think tom 's very fortunate no you do not osmond orgreave contradict she with a great rustling of paper you think edie 's very fortunate hilda look round and catch the architect 's smile i think they be both fortunate say mr orgreave simply she have almost no sense of humor i be sure she be a real good girl and clever too clever enough to get on the right side of she future mother-in-law anyway growl mr orgreave anyone might think osmond do not like the girl say mr orgreave from the way he talk and yet he adore she and it be no use he pretend he do not i only adore you say osmond you need not try to turn it off he wife murmur beam on hilda tear come strangely into hilda 's eye and she turn again to the dressing-table and through a blur she see all the object range in a long row on the white cloth that cover the rosewood and she think : all this be beautiful and she see the pale blind draw down behind the dressing-table and the valance at the top and the draped curtain and herself darkly in the glass and she could feel the vista of the large calm comfortable room behind she and could hear the coal fall together in the grate and the rustling of the architect 's paper and mr orgreave 's slight cough and in she mind she could see all the other room in the spacious house and the dim mist garden beyond she think : all this house be beautiful it be the most beautiful thing i have ever know or ever shall know i be happy here and then she imagination follow each of the child she imagine marian the eldest and she baby in london and charlie also in london practise medicine and tom and janet and alicium at the party at hillport and jimmie and johnnie see life at hanbridge while the parent remain in tranquillity in they bedroom all these vision be beautiful even the vision of jimmie and johnnie flourish billiard-cue and glass and pipe in the smoky atmosphere of a club -- even this be beautiful it be as simply touch as the other vision and she be at home with the parent and so extremely intimate with they that she could nearly conceive herself a genuine member of the house she be in bliss she immediate past drop away from she like a illusion and she become almost the old hilda : she be almost bear again into innocence only the tragic figure of george cannon hang vague in the far distance of memory and the sight thereof constrict she heart utterly she passion for he have expire : she be exquisitely sad for he she feel towards he kindly and guiltily as one feel towards a old error and withal the spell of the home of the orgreave take away he reality she be finger the book its title-page run : _ the english poem of richard crashaw _ now she have never even hear of richard crashaw and she wonder who he might be turn the page she read : all thy old woe shall now smile on thee and thy pain sit bright upon thee all thy sorrow here shall shine all thy suffering be divine : tear shall take comfort and turn gem and wrong repent to diadem and she read again as though the word have be too lovely to be real and she must assure herself of they : tear shall take comfort and turn gem and wrong repent to diadem she turn back to the beginning of the poem and read the title of it : a hymn to the name and honor of the admirable saint teresa -- foundress of the reformation of the discalced carmelite both man and woman : a woman for angelical height of speculation for masculine courage of performance more than a woman : who yet a child outrun maturity and durst plot a martyrdom the prose thrill she even more intimately than the verse she cry within herself : why have i never hear of richard crashaw why do tom never tell I she become upon the instant a devotee of this saint teresa she think inconsequently with a pang that be also a reassurance : george cannon would never have understand this but everyone here understand it and with hand enfever she turn the page again and after several disappointment read : oh thou undaunted daughter of desire by all thy dower of light and fire by all the eagle in thee all the dive : by all thy life and death of love : by thy large draught of intellectual day and by thy thirst of love more large than they : by all thy brim-filled bowl of fierce desire by this last morning 's draught of liquid fire : by the full kingdom of that final kiss -- she cease to read it be as if she soul be cry out : i also be teresa this be i this be i and then the door open and martha appear once more : if you please sir mr edwin clayhanger 's call oh well i be nearly finish where be he in the breakfast-room sir well tell he i 'll be down in a minute hilda say mr orgreave will _ you _ mind go and tell he hilda have replace the book in its nest and go quickly back to she chair the entrance of the servant at that moment to announce edwin clayhanger seem to she startlingly dramatic what she think i be just read that and he come he have not be here for age and on the very night that i come he come certainly she reply to mr orgreave and she think : this be the second time she have send I with a message to edwin clayhanger suddenly she blush in confusion before the mistress of the home be it possible she ask herself -- be it possible that mr orgreave do not guess what have happen to I be it possible she can not see that i be different from what i use to be if she know if they know here she leave the room like a criminal when she be go down the stair she discover that she hold the _ signal _ in she hand she have no recollection of pick it up and there be no object in take it to the breakfast-room she think : what a state i must be in chapter ii a rendezvous i i suppose you have never think about I once since i have leave she be sit on the sofa in the small shelved breakfast-room and she shoot these word at edwin clayhanger who be stand near she the singular word be certainly utter out of bravado : they be a challenge to adventure she think : it be madness for I to say such a thing but such a thing have nevertheless come quite glibly out of she mouth and she know not why if edwin clayhanger be startle so be she startle oh yes i have he stammer -- of course she have put he out of countenance she smile and say persuasively : but you have never inquire after I yes i have he answer with a hint of defiance after a pause only once she continue to smile how do you know he demand then she tell he very calmly extinguish the smile that she source of information be janet that be nothing to go by he exclaim with sudden roughness that be nothing to go by -- the number of _ time _ i have inquire ii she be silence she think : if i be thus intimate with he it must be because of the talk we have in the garden that night and it seem to she that the scene in the garden have somehow bind they together for ever in intimacy that even if they pretend to be only acquaintance they would constantly be break through the thin shell of formality into some unguessed deep of intimacy she regard -- surreptitiously -- he face with a keen sense of pleasure it be romantic melancholy wistful enigmatic -- and above all honest she know that he have desire to be a architect and that he father have thwart he desire and this fact endow he for she with the charm of a victim the idea that all he life have be embittered and shadow by the caprice of a old man be beautiful to she in its sadness : she contemplate it with vague bliss at they last meeting during the Sunday school centenary he have annoy she he have even draw she disdain by he lack of initiative and male force in the incident of the senile Sunday school teacher he have profoundly disappointed she now she simply forget this the sinister impression vanish from she mind she recall she first vision of he in the light doorway of he father 's shop she present vision confirm that sympathetic vision she like the feel of he faithful hand and the glance of he timid and yet bellicose eye and she repose on he very apparent honesty as on a bed she know with the assurance of perfect faith that he have nothing dubious to conceal and that no test could strain he magnanimity and while she so reflect she be think too of janet 's fine dress and she elegance and jewel and wish that she have change the old black frock in which she travel the perception that she could never be like janet cast she down but the next moment she be say to herself proudly : what do it matter why should i be like janet and the next moment after that she be say in another phase of she pride : i _ will _ be like janet they begin to discuss the strike it be a topic which during those week could not be avoid either by the rich or by the poor i suppose you be like all the rest -- against the man she challenge he again invite battle he reply bluntly : what earthly right have you to suppose that i be like all the rest she bent she head lower so that she could only see he through the veil of she eyelash i be very sorry she say in a low smile meditative voice i know all the time you be not the think shot through she mind like a lance : it be incredible and horribly dangerous that i should be sit here with he after all that have happen to I and he without the slightest suspicion and yet what can stop it from come out sooner or later nothing can stop it edwin clayhanger continue to talk of the strike and she hear he say : if you ask I i 'll tell you what i think -- workman on strike be always in the right you have only get to look at they in a crowd together they do not starve themselves for fun what he say thrill she there be nothing in it but there be everything in it he generosity towards the oppress be everything to she he whole attitude be utterly and mysteriously different from that of any other man whom she have know and with that simple wistful expression of he they go on talk and then follow in secret the train of she own thought she suddenly burst out : i never meet anybody like you before a pause ensue no never she add with intense conviction i might say the same of you he reply move oh no i be nothing she breathe she glance up exquisitely flatter he face be crimson exquisite moment in the familiarity of the breakfast-room by the fire she on the sofa with he stand over she a delicious peril the crimson slowly pale iii osmond orgreave enter the room quizzical and at once begin to tease clayhanger about the infrequency of he visit turn to hilda he say : he scarcely ever come to see we except when you be here it be just as if he have say : i hear every word you speak before i come in and i have read you heart both hilda and clayhanger be disconcert -- clayhanger extremely so steady on he protest uncouthly and then with the most naïve ingenuousness : mr orgreave better but osmond orgreave be not in a merciful mood a moment later he be say : have she tell you she want to go over a printing-works no clayhanger answer with interest but i shall be very pleased to show she over ours any time hilda strike into silence make no response and instantly clayhanger finish in another tone : look here i must be off i only slip in for a minute -- really and he go decline mr orgreave 's request to give a date for he next call the bang of the front door resound through the house mr orgreave have take clayhanger to the front door do not return immediately into the breakfast-room hilda jump up from the sofa hesitant she be disappointed she be even resentful assuredly she be humiliate oh no she think he be weak and afraid i dare say he go off because janet be not here she hear through the half-open door mr orgreave 's slipper on the tile of the passage lead to the stair martha come into the room with a delighted curious smile if you please miss could you come into the hall a minute some one to speak to you hilda blush silently and obey clayhanger be stand in the chill hall hat in hand she heart jump when will you come to look over we work he mutter rapidly and very nervously and yet with a dictatorial gruffness to-morrow i should like you to come he have put a enchantment upon she by this marvellous return and to conceal from he what he have do she frown and keep silent what time she ask suddenly any time he eagerness be thrilling oh no you must fix the time say between half-past six and a quarter to seven that do she nod they hand meet he say adieu he pull open the heavy door she see he back for a instant against the pale gloom of the garden in which vapor be curl and then she have shut the door and be stand alone in the confine hall a miracle have occur and it intimidate she and amid she wondrous fear she be steep in the unique sense of adventure this morning i be in brighton she think half a hour ago i have no notion of see he and now and to-morrow the tragic sequel to one adventure have not impaired she instinct for experience on the contrary it have strengthen it the very failure of the one excite she towards another the zest of living be reborn in she the morrow beckon she golden and miraculous the faculty of man and woman to create they own life seem divine and the conception of it enfever she chapter iii at the work i that night late hilda and janet shut themselves up in the bedroom together the door click softly under janet 's gentle push and they be as safe from invasion as if the door have be of iron and lock and double-locked and bar with bar of iron alicium alone might have disturb they but alicium be asleep hilda have a sense of entire security in this room such as she have never have since she drive away from lessway street turnhill early one morning with florrie bagster in a cab it be not that there have be the least real fear of any room of hers be attack : it be that this room seem to have be render mystically inviolate by long year of janet 's occupation janet 's bedroom -- the phrase have a sanction which could not possibly have attach itself to for instance hilda 's bedroom nor even to mother 's bedroom -- mother 's bedroom be indeed at the mercy of any profane and maraud member of the family a sort of market-place for the transaction of affair and further janet 's bedroom be distinguish and make delicious for hilda by its fire it happen to be one of the very few bedroom in the five town at that date with a fire as a regular feature of it mr orgreave have a fire in the parental bedroom when she could not reasonably do without it but osmond orgreave suffer the fire rather than enjoy it as for tom though of a shivery disposition he would have dither to death before admit that a bedroom fire might increase he comfort johnnie and jimmie genuinely like to be cold in they bedroom alicium pine for a fire but mr orgreave imitate the contrariety of fate forbid a fire to alicium and one consequence of this be that alicium sometimes undress in janet 's bedroom make afterwards a dash for the pole the idea of a bedroom be always during nearly half the year associate with the idea of discomfort in hilda 's mind and now in janet 's bedroom impress as she be by the strangeness of the fact that the prime reason for hurry at top-speed into bed have be abolish she yet positively could not linger the force of habit be too strong for she and she be in bed despite effort to dawdle while janet be still brushing she hair as she lay and watch janet 's complex unrobe she acquire knowledge and once more she find herself desire to be like janet -- not only in appearance but in soft manner and tone she think : how shall i dress to-morrow afternoon all the operation of she brain related themselves somehow to to-morrow afternoon the anticipation of the visit to the printing-works burn in she heart like a steady lamp that shine through the brief cloudy interest of the moment and edwin clayhanger be precisely the topic which janet seem as it be expressly to avoid janet inquire concern life at brighton and the health of sarah gailey janet even mention george cannon hilda steady she voice in reply though she be not really apprehensive for janet 's question like the question of the whole family be invariably discreet and respectful of the individual 's privacy but of edwin clayhanger whose visit nevertheless have be recount to she in the drawing-room on she return janet say not a word and then when she have extinguish the gas and the oriental sleeve of she silk nightgown delicately brush hilda 's face as she get into bed she remark : strange that edwin clayhanger should call just to-night hilda 's cheek warm he ask I to go and look over they printing-works to-morrow say she quickly janet be take aback really she exclaim unmistakably startled she speak a second too soon if she have delay only one second she might have conceal from hilda that which hilda have most plainly perceive to wit anxiety and jealousy yes jealousy in this adorably benevolent creature 's tone hilda 's interest in to-morrow afternoon be intensify shall you be able to come she ask what time he say about half-past six or a quarter to seven i can not say janet dreamily because of that musical society meeting -- you know -- i tell you do not i in the faint light of the die fire hilda make out little by little the mysterious pale heap of clothes and all the detail of the room strew and disorder by reason of a additional occupant the adventure be now of infinite complexity and its complexity seem to be symbolize by the suggestive feminine mysteriousness of what she see and what she divine in the darkness of the chamber she think : i be here on false pretence i ought to tell my secret that would be fair -- i have no right to intrude between she and he but she instinctively and powerfully resist such idea with firmness she put they away and yield herself with a more exquisite apprehension to the anticipation of to-morrow ii the order of meal at lane end be somewhat peculiar even then and would now be almost unique it be partly the natural expression of a instinctive and justified feeling of superiority and partly due to a discretion which forbid the family to scandalize the professional class of the district by dining at night dinner occur in the middle of the day and about nine in the evening be a informal but copious supper between those two meal there come a tea which be neither high or low and whose hour six o'clock in theory depend to a certain extent in practice on mr orgreave 's arrival from the office not seldom mr orgreave be late occasionally he be very late the kitchen wait to infuse the tea until a command come from some woman old or young who attentively watch a window for a particular swinging of the long gate at the end of the garden or listen when it be dark for the bang of the gate and a particular crunching of gravel on this Tuesday evening osmond orgreave be very late and the movement of the household be less smooth than usual owe to mr orgreave 's illness and to the absence of janet at hillport in connection with the project hillport choral society -lrb- have janet be warn of hilda 's visit she would not have accept a invitation to a tea at hillport as a preliminary to the meeting of the provisional committee -rrb- hilda be in a state of acute distress the appointment with edwin clayhanger seem to be absolutely sacred to she to be late for it would amount to a crime : to miss it altogether would be a calamity inconceivable the finger of all the clock in the house be revolve with the most extraordinary rapidity -- she be helpless she be helpless because she have say nothing all day of she appointment and because janet have not mention it either janet might have say before leave : tea have better not wait too long -- hilda have to be down at clayhanger 's at half-past six janet 's silence impressed hilda : it be not merely strange -- it be formidable : it affect the whole day hilda think : be she determine not to speak of it unless i do immediately janet be go hilda have run up to the bedroom she be mind to change the black frock which she have be wear and which she hate and to put on another skirt and bodice that janet have praise she long to beautify herself and yet she be still hesitate about it at half-past five in the evening as she have hesitate at eight in the morning in the end she have decide not to change a account of the rain but the rain have naught to do with she decision she would not change because she be too proud to change she would go just as she be she could not accept the assistance of a attractive bodice unfeminine perhaps but womanly at twenty-five minute to seven she go into mr orgreave 's bedroom rather like a child and also rather like a adult creature in a distracting crisis tom orgreave and alicium be fill the entire house with the stormy noise of a piano duet base upon rossinus 's _ william tell _ i think i 'll miss tea mrs orgreave she say edwin clayhanger invite I to go over the printing-works at half-past six and it be twenty-five minute to seven now oh but my dear cry mr orgreave why ever do not you tell they downstairs or let I know earlier and she pull at the bell-rope that overhang the head of the bed not a trace of tease archness in she manner hilda 's appointment might have be of the most serious business interest for anything mr orgreave 's demeanor indicate to the contrary hilda stand mute and constrain you run down and tell they to make tea at once dear i can not let you go without anything at all i wonder what can have keep osmond almost at the same moment osmond orgreave enter the bedroom he arrival have be unnoticed amid the tremendous resounding of the duet oh osmond say he wife wherever have you be so late hilda want to go -- edwin clayhanger have invite she to go over the work hilda tremble at the door more than half expect mr orgreave to say : you mean she be invite herself but osmond receive the information with exactly the same polite apologetic seriousness as he wife and reassure hilda depart from the room ten minute later veil and cloak she step out alone into the garden and instantly she torment be assuage and she be happy she wait at the corner of the street for the steam-car but when the car come thunder down it be cram to the step with a melancholy gesture the driver decline she signal she set off down trafalgar road in the mist and the rain glad that she have be compel to walk it seem to she that she be on a secret and mystic errand this be not surprising the remarkable thing be that all the hurry people she meet seem also each of they to be on a secret and mystic errand the shine wet pavement be dot with dark figure suggestive and enigmatic who glide over a floor that be pierce by perpendicular reflection iii in the clayhanger shop agitate and scarcely aware of what she do she could nevertheless hear she voice greet edwin clayhanger in firm calm tone and she soon perceive very clearly that he be even more acutely nervous than herself : which perception help to restore she confidence while at the same time it fill she with bliss the young fair man with he awkward and constrain movement take possession of she umbrella and then suggest that she should remove she mackintosh she obey timid and glad she strip off she mackintosh as though she be strip off she modesty and stand before he reveal to complete the sacrifice she raise she veil and smile up at he as it be ask : what next then a fat untidy old man appear in the doorway of a cubicle within the shop and edwin clayhanger blush father this be miss lessway miss lessway my father she be -- she be come to look over the place how-d'ye-do miss she shake hand with the tyrannic father who be however despite he reputation apparently just as nervous as the son there follow a most sinister moment of silence and at last the shop door open and the father turn to greet a customer hilda think : suppose this fat old man be one day my father-in-law be it possible to imagine he as a father-in-law and she have a transient gleam of curiosity concern the character of the two clayhanger sister and recall with satisfaction that janet like the elder one edwin clayhanger mutter pointed to a aperture in the counter and immediately she be go through it with he and through a door at the back of the shop they be alone face a rain-soaked yard edwin clayhanger sneeze violently it keep on rain edwin murmur better to have keep umbrella however -- he glance at she inquiringly and invitingly they run side by side across the yard to a roofed flight of step that lead to the printing - office for a couple of seconds the rain wet they and then they be under cover again it seem to hilda that they have escape from the shop like fox-terrier -- like two friendly dog from the surveillance of a incalculable and dangerous old man she feel a comfortable friendly confidence in edwin clayhanger -- a tranquil sentiment such as she have never experience for george cannon after more than a year -- and what a period of unforeseen happening -- she think again : i _ like he _ not love she think but like she like be with he she like the sensation of put confidence in he she like he youth and she own she be sorry because he have a cold and be not take care of it now they be climb a sombre creaking staircase towards a new and remote world that be separate from the common world just quit by the adventurous passage of the rainy yard and now they be amid oily odour in a large raftered workshop full of machine the printing-works a enormous but very deferential man salute they with majestic solemnity he be the foreman and label by he white apron as a artisan but he gigantic bulk -- he would have outweigh the pair of they -- and he age set he somehow over they so that they be a couple of stripling in he vasty presence when edwin clayhanger employ as it be daringly the accent of a master to this intimidate fellow hilda thrill with pleasure at the piquancy of the spectacle and she be admiringly proud of edwin the foreman 's immense voice explain machine and tool cause physical vibration in she but she understand nothing of what he say -- nothing whatever she be in a dream of oily odour and monstrous iron construction dominate by the grand foreman : and edwin be in the dream she begin talk quite wildly of the four-hundredth anniversary of the inventor of printing of which she have read in cranswick 's history at brighton brighton have sink away over the verge of memory even lane end house be lose somewhere in the vague past all she previous life have fade she reflect guiltily : he be bind to think i have be read about printing because i be interested in _ he _ i do not care i hope he do think it she hear a suggestion that as it be too late that night to see the largest machine in motion she might call the next afternoon she at once promise to come she impatiently desire now to leave the room where they be and to see something else and then she fear lest this might be all there be to see edwin clayhanger be edge towards the door they be alone on the stairway again the foreman have bow at the top like a chamberlain she gather with delicious anticipation that other and still more recondite interior await they visit iv they be in a attic which be use for the storage of ream upon ream of paper by the light of a candle in a tin candlestick they have pass alone together through corridor and up flight of stair at the back of the shop she have see everything that be connect with the enterprise of steam-printing and now they be at the top of the old house and at the end of the excursion i use to work here say edwin clayhanger she inquire about the work well he drawl reading and write you know -- at that very table in the aperture of the window amid pile of paper stand a rickety old table cover with dust but there be no fireplace she say glance round the room and then directly at he i know but how do you do in winter she eagerly appeal and he reply shortly and with a slight charming affectation of pride : i do without she throat tighten and she could feel the tear suddenly swim in she eye she be not touch by the vision of he hardship it be the thought of all he youth that exquisitely saddened she -- or all the year which be and would be for ever hide from she she know that she alone of all human being be gifted with the power to understand and fully sympathize with he and so she grieve over the long wilderness of time during which he have be uncomprehended she want by some immense effort of tenderness to recompense he for all that he have suffer and she have a divine curiosity concern the whole of he past life she have never have this curiosity in relation to george cannon -- she have only wonder about he affair with other woman nor have george cannon ever evoke the tenderness which spring up in she from some secret and inexhaustible source at the mere sight of edwin clayhanger 's wistful smile still in that moment standing close to edwin in the high solitude of the shadowed attic the souvenir of george cannon grip she painfully she think : he love I and he be ruin and he will never see I again and i be here burst with hope renew and dizzy with joy and she picture janet too wearying herself at a committee meeting and she think and here be i she bliss be tragic i think i ought to be go she say softly they re-thread the corridor and in each lower room as they pass edwin clayhanger extinguish the gas which he have light there on the way up and hilda wait for he and then they be back in the crude glare of the shop the fat untidy old man be not visible edwin help she with the mackintosh and she like he for the awkwardness of he effort in do so at the door she urge he not to come out and refer to he cold this be not the end of winter it be the begin she warn he nobody else she know would watch over he but he insist on come out they arrange a rendezvous for three o'clock on the morrow and then they shake hand now do go in she entreat as she hurry away the rain have cease she flee triumphantly up trafalgar road with she secret guard it he be in love with I if a scientific truth be a statement of which the contrary be inconceivable then it be a scientific truth for she that she and edwin must come together she simply would not and could not conceive the future without he and this so soon so precipitately soon after she misfortune but it be she very misfortune which push she violently forward she life have be convulse and overthrow by the hazard of destiny and she could have no peace now until she have repair and re-establish it at no matter what risk the thing must be accomplish quickly quickly chapter iv the call from brighton i on the next afternoon at a quarter-past two hilda and janet be sit together in the breakfast-room the house be still the man be either theoretically or practically at business alicium be at school mr orgreave lay upstairs the servant have clear away and wash up the dinner-thing and have dine themselves the kitchen have be cleanse and put in order and every fire replenish two of the servant be in they own chamber enfranchise for a hour : one only remain on duty all six woman have the feeling which come to most woman at a certain moment in each day that life have for a time deteriorate into the purposeless and the futile and that it wait as in a trance until some external masculine event expect or unforeseen should renew its virtue and its energy hilda be in half a mind to tell janet the history of the past year she have waken up in the night and perceive with dreadful clearness that trouble lay in front of she the relation between herself and edwin clayhanger be develop with the most dizzy rapidity and in a direction which she desire but it would be impossible for she if she foster the relation to continue to keep edwin in ignorance of the fact that have be know for about a fortnight as mr george cannon she be not what he suppose she to be with imagination on fire she be anticipate the rendezvous at three o'clock she reach forward to it in ecstasy but she might not enjoy it save at the price which she conscience exact she have to say to edwin clayhanger that she have be the victim of a bigamist could she say it to he she have not be able to say it even to janet orgreave she would say it first to janet there in the breakfast-room she would say it if it kill she to say it she would say it she must at any cost be able to respect herself and as matter stand she could not respect herself janet on she knee be idly arrange book on one of the lower bookshelf in sheer nervousness hilda also drop to she knee on the hearthrug and begin to worry the fire with the poker i say janet she begin yes janet do not look up hilda she heart beat think with affrighted swiftness : why should i tell she it be no business of anybody 's except _ he _ i will tell he and he alone and then act accord to he wish after all i be not to blame i be quite innocent but i will not tell he to-day not to-day i must be more sure it would be ridiculous to tell he to-day if i tell he it would be almost like invite a proposal but when the proper time come -- then i will tell he and he will understand he be bind to understand perfectly he be in love with I she dare not tell janet in that abode of joyful and successful propriety the word would not form themselves and the argument that she be not to blame carry no weight whatever she -- she hilda -- lack courage to be candid this be extremely disconcerting to she self-esteem and even with edwin clayhanger she wish to temporize she long for nothing so much as to see he and yet she fear to meet he yes janet repeat a bell ring faintly in the distance of the house hilda suddenly choose a course say : i forget to tell you i be suppose to be go down to clayhanger 's at three to see a machine at work -- it be too late last night do come with I i hate go by myself it be true : in that instant she do hate go by herself she think know janet to be at liberty and never dream that she would refuse : i be save -- for the present but janet answer self-consciously : i do not think i must leave mother you 'll be perfectly all right by yourself hilda impetuously turn she head they glance meet for a instant in suspicion challenge animosity they have a immense mutual admiration the one for the other these two and yet now they be estrange esteem be nullify by instinct hilda think with positive savagery : it be all fiddlestick about not leave she mother she be simply on she high horse the whole color of existence be change ii martha enter the room neither of the girl move beneath the deferential servant in martha be a human girl make a third in the room who familiarly divine the mood of the other two and judge they as a equal and the other two know it and therefore do not trouble to be spectacular in front of she a letter miss say martha approach hilda the old postman say it be insufficiently address or it ` ud ha ' be here by first post be that the postman who ring just now ask janet yes miss hilda take the letter with apprehension as she recognize the down-slanting calligraphy of sarah gailey yes the address be imperfect -- miss lessway c\/o osmond orgreave esq lane end house knype-on-trent instead of bursley knype-on-trent on the back of the envelope have be write in pencil by a official try bursley sarah gailey could not now be trust to address a envelope correctly the mere handwriting seem to announce misfortune from poor sarah hilda murmur with false good-tempered tranquillity i wonder what sort of trouble she think she be get into she think : if only i be marry i should be free of responsibility about sarah i should have to think of my husband first but nothing else can free I unless i marry i be tie to sarah gailey as long as she live and why i should like to know the answer be simple : habit have shackle she to sarah gailey she open the letter by the flicker firelight which be stronger on the hearthrug than the light of the dim November day it begin : dearest hilda i write at once to tell you that a lawyer call here this afternoon to inquire about you hotel continental share he tell I there be go to be some difficulty with the company and unless the independent shareholder form a strong local committee to look after thing the trouble might be serious he want to know if you would support a committee at the meeting i give he you address and he

impossible for I to keep the charwoman so i send she off this morning can you remember the address of that mrs catkin sarah gailey continue to discuss boarding-house affair until she arrive at the end of the fourth page and then in a few cramped word she finish with expression of love oh dear hilda exclaim rise i must write some letter at once she sigh as if in tedium the fact that she fortune be vaguely threaten do not cause she anxiety : she scarcely realize it what she see be a opportunity to evade the immediate meeting with edwin -- the meeting which a few minute earlier she have desire beyond everything when now hilda nodded but what about master edwin janet ask try to be gay i sha not be able to go say hilda carelessly at the door it be of no consequence martha have to go down town if you like she could call in there and just tell he it be a reproof from the young woman who always so thoughtfully study the feeling of everybody i 'll just write a little note then thanks hilda return calmly triumph after all over janet 's superiority and think janet can be very peculiar janet can iii for more than twenty hour hilda be profoundly miserable towards the evening of the same day she have make herself quite sure that edwin clayhanger would call that night she hope persist until half-past nine : it then begin to fade and at ten o'clock be extinct he name have be mention by nobody she go to bed have now a room of she own which overlook the clayhanger garden and house she gaze forth and in the dark beheld with the most anxious sensation the building in which edwin exist and be conceal he be there she say he be active about something at this very instant -- perhaps he be read he be close by if i shout he might hear and yet she be utterly cut off from he again in the late dawn she see the same building pale and clear but just as secretive and enigmatic as in the night he be asleep yet she think why do he not call be he hurt be he proud she despair because she could devise no means of resume communication with he immediately after dinner on the next day she go with janet to janet 's room to examine a new winter cloak which have be deliver and while janet be try it on and pose coquettishly and yet without affectation in front of the glass and while hilda be reflect jealously why be i not like she i know infinitely more than she know i be a woman and she be a girl and yet she seem far more a woman than i -- alicium contrary to all rule take the room by storm alicium 's excuse and salvation lay in a telegram which she hold in she hand for you hilda cry the child excited i be just off to school hilda reach to take the offer telegram but she hand waver around it instead of seize it she eye fasten on a circular portion of the wall-paper pattern and she feel that the whole room be revolve about she then she see janet 's face transform by a expression of alarm be you ill hilda janet demand sit down you be frightfully pale say alicium eagerly hilda sit down no no she say it be the pattern of the wall-paper that make I feel dizzy and for the moment she do honestly believe that the pattern of the wall-paper have in some inexplicable manner upset she i be all right now the dizziness pass as suddenly as it have supervene janet hold some ineffectual salt to she nose i be perfectly well insist hilda how funny alicium grin calmly hilda open the telegram which read : please come at once -- gailey she give the telegram to janet in silence what can be the matter janet ask with unreserved loving solicitude the cloud which have hang between the two enthusiastic friend be dissipate in a flash i have not a idea say hilda touch unless it be those share she have briefly tell janet about the hotel continental limited shall you go hilda nod never again would she ignore a urgent telegram though she do not believe that this telegram have any real importance she attribute it to sarah 's increase incompetence and hysterical foolishness i wonder whether i can get on to brighton to-night if i take the six train hilda ask and to herself : can it have anything to do with george alicia endowed with authority go in search of a bradshaw but the quest be fruitless in the five town the local time-table show the connection with london suffice for the citizen and the breast-pocket of no citizen be complete without it clayhanger be bind to have a bradshaw cry alicium breathless with run about the house of course they be janet agree i 'll walk down there now say hilda with extraordinary promptitude it will not take five minute i would go say alicium only i should be late for school shall i send some one down janet suggest you might be take dizzy again no thanks hilda reply deliberately i 'll go -- myself there be nothing wrong with I at all you 'll have to be sharp over it say alicium pertly do not forget it be Thursday they shut up at two and it be not far off two now i be go this very minute say hilda and i be go this very second alicium retort they all three leave janet 's bedroom the new cloak cast over a chair - back be degrade into a tedious banality -- and ignore in less than a minute hilda hat and jacket and partially glove be cross the garden she feel most miraculously happy and hopeful and she be full of irrational gratitude to alicium as though alicium be a benefactor the change in she mood seem magic in its swiftness if janet with calm cryptic face have not be watch she from the doorway she might have dance on the gravel chapter v Thursday afternoon i she be walk with edwin clayhanger up duck bank on the way to bursley railway station a simple errand and promenade -- and yet she feel herself to be steep in the romance of a adventure the adventure have surprisingly follow upon the discovery that alicium have be quite wrong clayhanger be bind to have a bradshaw the confident alicium have say but clayhanger happen not to have a bradshaw edwin be alone in the stationery shop save for the assistant he say that he father be indispose and whereas the news that clayhanger have no bradshaw leave hilda perfectly indifferent the news that old darius clayhanger be indispose and absent produce in she a definite feeling of gladness edwin have decide that the most likely place to search for a bradshaw be the station and he have offer to escort she to the station nothing could have be more natural and at the same time more miraculous the sun be palely shine upon dry clean pavement and upon road juicy with black mud and in the sunshine hilda be very happy it be nothing to she that she be in quest of a bradshaw because she have just receive a ominous telegram urgently summon she to brighton she be obliviously happy every phenomenon that attract she notice contribute to she felicity thus she take a eager joy in the sun and a marked improvement in edwin 's cold really delighted she she be dominate by the intimate conviction : he love I which conviction excite she dormant pride and make she straighten she shoulder she benevolently condescend towards janet after all janet with every circumstance in she favor have not know how to conquer edwin clayhanger after all she hilda possess some mysterious characteristic more potent than the elegance and the goodness of janet orgreave she scorn she former self-deprecation and reproach she own lack of faith : i be i that be the summary of she mood as for she attitude to edwin clayhanger she could not explain it why do she like he and like be with he he be not brilliant nor masterful nor handsome nor well dress nor in any manner impose on the contrary he be awkward and apologetic and not a bit spectacular only the wistful gaze of he eye and he honest smile and the appeal of he gesture a puzzling affair a affair perfectly incomprehensible and enchant they walk side by side in silence when they have turn into moorthorne road half-way up whose slope lie the station she ask a question about a large wooden building from whose interior come wild sound of shout and cheer and learn that the potter on strike be hold a meeting in the town theater at the open outer door be a crowd of starve shiver dirty ragged child who romp and curse or stand unnaturally meditative in the rich mud like fakir fulfil a vow hilda 's throat be constrict by the sight pain and joy run together in she burning exquisitely and she have a glimpse obscure of the mystical beauty of the child 's suffer i would no idea there be a theater in bursley she remark idly drive into a banality by the press of she sensation they use to call it the blood tub he reply melodrama and murder and gore -- you know she exclaim in horror why be people like that in the five town it be we form of poetry i suppose say he she start sensitively it seem to she that she have never understand the secret inner spirit of the five town and that by a single phrase he have make she understand it ` we form of poetry ' who but he could have say a thing at once so illuminating and so simple apparently perplex by the obvious effect on she of he remark he say : but you belong to the five town do not you she answer quietly that she do but she heart be say : i do _ now _ you have initiate I i never feel the five town before you have make I feel they ii at the station the head porter receive they inquiry for a bradshaw with a dull stare and a shake of the head no such thing have ever be ask for at bursley station before and the man 's imagination could not go beyond the soil time-table loosely pin and paste up on the wall of the booking-office hilda suggest that the ticket-clerk should be interrogate but the aperture of communication with he be shut she see edwin clayhanger brace himself and rap on the wood and instead of deplore he diffidence she like it and find it full of charm the partition click aside and the ticket-clerk 's peer suspicious head show in its place mutely demand a reason for this extraordinary disturbance of the dream in which the station slumber between two half-hourly train with a characteristic peculiar slanting motion edwin nod oh how-d'ye-do mr brook say edwin hastily as if startle by the sudden inexplicable apparition of the head but the ticket-clerk have no bradshaw either he consider it probable however that the stationmaster would have a bradshaw edwin have to brace himself again for a assault upon the fastness of the stationmaster and in the incredibly small and incredibly dirty fastness of the stationmaster they indeed find a bradshaw hilda precipitately take it and open it on the stationmaster 's table she look for brighton in it as she might have look for a particular individual in a city then edwin be bend over it with he ear close to she ear and the sleeve of he overcoat touch she sleeve she be physically aware of he for the first time she think disconcerted : but he be a utter stranger to I what do i know of he and then she think : for more than a year he must have carry my image in he heart here say edwin brusquely and with a certain superiority you might just let I have a look at it myself she yield tacitly admit that a woman be no match for bradshaw after a few moment ' frowning edwin say : yes there be a train to brighton at eleven-thirty to-night may i look certainly say he subtly condescend she examine the page with a serious deliberation but what do this ' _ f _ ' mean she ask do you notice this ' _ f _ ' yes it mean thursday and saturday only say edwin he eye twinkle it be as if he have say : you think yourself very clever but do you suppose that i can not read the note in a time-table well -- she hesitate to-day 's Thursday you see he remark curtly she be ravish by he tone and he manner and she become humble before he for in the space of a few seconds he have grow mysteriously and powerfully masculine to she but with all he masculinity there remain the same wistful honest boyish look in he eye and she think : if i marry he it will be for the look in he eye i be all right then she say aloud and smile with hand nervously work within she muff she suddenly miss the handkerchief which she have place there i believe i must have drop my handkerchief in you shop she be about to say the phrase be actually on she tongue but by a strange instinctive defensive discretion she shut she mouth on it and keep silence she think : perhaps i have better not go into he shop again to-day iii they descend the hill from the station hilda be very ill at ease she keep say to herself : this adventure be over now i can not prolong it there be nothing to do but to go back to the orgreave and pack my thing and depart to brighton and face whatever annoyance be await I at brighton the prospect desolate she she could not bear to leave edwin clayhanger without some definition of they relation and yet she know that it be hopeless and absurd to expect to arrive immediately at any such definition : she know that the impetuosity of she temperament could not be justified also she fear horribly the risk of be catch again in the net of brighton as they get lower and lower down the hill she wretchedness and disquiet become acute to the point of a wild despair merely to temporize she say as they draw opposite the wooden theater : could not we just go and look in i have get plenty of time a strange request -- to penetrate into a meeting of artisan on strike she feel its strangeness : she feel that edwin clayhanger object but she be drive to a extremity she have to do something and she do what she could they cross the road and enter the huge shanty and stand apologetically near the door the contrast between the open street and the enclosed stuffiness of the dim and crowded interior be overwhelming hundred of ragged and shabby man sit in serried row lean forward with elbow out and head protrude as they listen to a speech from the gimcrack stage they seem to be wait to spring like famished and ferocious tiger interrupt they growl snarled yap and swear with appalling sincerity imprecation burst forth in volley and in run fire the arouse of the fundamental instinct of these human being have indeed enormously emphasize the animal in they they have swing back a hundred century towards original crude life the sophistication which embroider the will-to-live have be strip clean off these man help you to understand the state of mind which put a city to the sack and make victim especially of the innocent and the defenceless hilda be strangely excite she be afraid and enjoy be afraid and it be as if she too have be return to savagery and to the primeval in the midst of peril she be a female under the protection of a male and nothing but that and she be far closer emotionally to she male than she have ever be before suddenly the meeting come to a end in a instant the mass of humanity be afoot and round upon they a active menace hilda and edwin rush flee into the street violently urge by a common impulse the stream of embittered man pursue they like a inundation when they be safe and breathe the free air hilda be drench with a sense of pity the tragedy of existence present itself in its true aspect as noble and majestic and intimidate it be terrible she breathe she think : no in this mood it be impossible for I to leave he i can not do it i can not the danger of re-enter the shop which would be close now utterly fascinate she supposing that she re-enter the shop with he would she have the courage to tell he that she be in he society under false pretence could she bring herself to relate she misfortune she recoil before the mere idea of tell he and yet the danger of the shop glitter in front of she like a lure the future might be depend solely on she own act if she tell he of the lose handkerchief the future might be one thing : if she do not tell he it might be another the dread of choose seize she and put she into a tremble of apprehension and then as it be mechanically she murmur -lrb- but very clearly -rrb- tack the word without a pause on to a sentence about the strike : oh i have lose my handkerchief unless i have leave it in you shop it must have drop out of my muff she sigh in relief because she have choose but she agitation be intensify iv in search of a lose handkerchief they regain the clayhanger premise by a unfamiliar side door she precede he along a passage and then take a door on the left find herself surprisingly in the shop behind a counter the shop be light only by a few diamond-shaped hole in the central shutter and it have a troubling aspect of portent with its merchandise mysteriously envelop in pale sheet and its chair wrong side up and its deep-shadowed corner destiny might have be lurk in one of those baffling corner from above through the ceiling come the vibration of some machine at work and the machine might have be the loom of time hilda be exquisitely apprehensive she think : i be here the moment of my departure will come when it come shall i have tell he my misfortune what will have happen she wait nervous restless shake like a victim who can do naught but wait here 's my handkerchief she cry in a tone of unnatural childish glee that be one of the effect of she secret panic the handkerchief glimmer on the counter more white than anything else in that gray dusk she guess that the shop-assistant must have find it and place it conspicuously on the counter they be alone : they be they own prisoner secure from the street and from all interruption hilda once more and in a higher degree realize the miraculous human power to make experience out of nothing they have nothing but themselves and they could if they choose create all they future by a single gesture suddenly there come a tremendous shout from duck square in front of the shop the striker have pour down from moorthorne road into duck bank and duck square edwin who be in the middle of the shop go to the glaze inner door and pass through into the porch lift the letter-flap in a shutter and stoop look forth he call to she without move he face from the aperture that a fight be in progress hilda gaze at he back through the glass and then come round the end of the counter approach quietly and stand immediately behind he between the glazed door and the shutter the two be in a space so small that they could scarcely have move without touch let I look she stammer unable any longer to tolerate the inaction edwin clayhanger step aside and hold up the letter-flap for she with he finger she bent she head to the oblong glimpse of the street and see the striker engage in the final internecine folly of striker : they have turn they exasperated wrath upon each other within a public-house at the top of the little square other striker be drink one policeman regard they what a shame she cry angrily drop the flap and then withdraw quickly into the shop whither edwin have go as she come near he she mood change she smile gently she summon all she charm and she know that she charm he do you know she say you have quite altered my notion of poetry -- what you say as we be go up to the station really he flush yes she have enchant and entrance he she have only to smile and to use a particular tone soft and breaking she know that but you _ do _ alter my notion she continue and she clear voice be pour out like a liquid i do not know how it be she stop and then in half-playful accent : so this be you little office she hand be on the knob of the open door of the cubicle a black erection within the shop where edwin and he father keep the account and write letter yes go in and have a look at it she murmur kindly : shall i and go in he follow for a moment she be extremely afraid and she whisper scared : i must hurry off now he ignore this remark shall you be at brighton long he demand and he be so friendly and simple and timorous and honest-eyed and he feature have such a extraordinary anxious expression that she own fear seem to leave she she think as if surprise by the discovery : he be a good friend oh i can not tell she answer he it depend how soon shall you be down we way again he voice be thicken she shake she head speechless she be afraid again now he face alter he be stand almost over she she think : i be lose i have let it come to this he be no longer a good friend he begin to speak in detach bit of phrase : i say -- you know -- good-bye good-bye she murmur anxiously i must go thanks very much and foolishly she hold out she hand which he seize he bent passionately and kiss she like a fresh boy like a schoolboy and she give back the kiss strongly with all the profound sincerity of she nature he agitation appear to be extreme but she be calm she be divinely calm she savor the moment as though she have be a watcher and not a actor in the scene she think with a secret sigh of bliss : yes it be real this moment and i have have it be i astonished that it have come so soon or do i know it be come she eye drink up the face and the hand and the gesture of she lover she feel tired and sit down in the office chair and he lean on the desk and the wall of the cubicle fold they in even from the inanimate scrutiny of the shop v they be talk together half-fearfully and yet with the confidence of deep mutual trust in the quick-gathering darkness of the cubicle and while they be talk hilda in she head be write a fervent letter to he : you see it be so sudden i have have no chance to tell you i do so want to tell you but how could i and i have not tell anybody i be sure you will agree with I that it be best to tell some thing as little as possible and when you have kiss I how could i tell you then -- at once i could not it would have spoil everything surely you understand i know you do because you understand everything if i be wrong tell I where you do not guess how humble i be when i think of you i be the humblest girl you can imagine forgive I if there be anything to forgive i do not need to tell you that i have suffer and she keep write the letter again and again slightly alter the phrase so as to improve they so as to express herself better and more honestly and more appealingly i shall send you the address to-morrow she be say to he i shall write you before i go to bed whether it be to-night or to-morrow morning she put the fire of she love into the assurance she smile to entrance he and see on he face that he be beside himself with joy in she she be a queen surpassing in she prerogative a thousand elegant janet she smile she proudly straighten she shoulder -lrb- she the humblest -rrb- and she boy be enslave i wonder what people will say he murmur she say with a pang of misgive about he reception of she letter : please tell no one she plead that for the present he should tell no one later on it will not seem so sudden she add plausibly people be so silly the sound of another battle in duck square awake they the shop be very chilly and

protectively but she would not allow he to walk up with she and he yield he strike a match they stumble out and in the midnight of the passage he take leave of she walk up trafalgar road alone she be so happy so amaze so relieved so sure of he and of he fineness and of the future that she could scarcely bear she felicity it be too intense at last she life be settle and map out destiny have be kind and she mean to be worthy of she fate she could have swoon so intoxicant be she wonder and she solemn joy and she yearning after righteousness in love chapter vi mischance i twelve day later in the evening hilda stand by the bedside of sarah gailey in the basement room of no 59 preston street there be a bright fire in the grate and in front of the fire a middle-aged doctor be cleanse the instrument which he have just employ to inject morphia into sarah 's exhaust body hilda 's assumption that the ageing woman have telegraph for she on inadequate grounds have prove to be quite wrong upon enter the house on that Thursday night hilda despite the anxious pale face of the new servant who have wait up for she and who entreat she to see sarah gailey instantly have go first to she own room and scrawl passionately a note to edwin which run : dearest -- this be my address i love you every bit of I be absolutely yours write I -- h l she give the letter to the servant to post at once and as she give it she have a vision of it travel in post office railway van and be sort and seal up in a bag and recover from the bag and scan by the postman at bursley and bear up trafalgar road by the postman and drop into the letter-box at edwin 's house and finally seize by edwin and of it please he intensely -- for it be a good letter and she be proud of it because she know that it be characteristic and then with she mind free she have open the door of sarah 's bedroom sarah be unquestionably very ill sarah have be quite right in telegraph so peremptorily to hilda and if she have not so telegraph she would have be quite wrong on the previous day she have be sit on the cold new oilcloth of the topmost stair minutely instruct a maid in the craft of polish banister and the next morning a attack of acute sciatica have supervene for a trifling indiscretion sarah be thus condemn to extreme physical torture hilda have find she rigid on the bed she suffer the severest pain in the small of the back and all down the left leg she left knee be support on pillow and the bed-clothes be raise away from it for it could tolerate no weight whatever the doctor who have be and go have arrange a system of fomentation and hot-water bottle surpass anything in even sarah 's experience and there sarah lay not feverish but sweating with agony terrify to move terrify to take a deep breath lest the disturbance of the muscle might produce consequence beyond she strength to endure she be in no danger of death she could talk she could eat and drink she pulse be scarcely quicken but she be degrade and humiliate by mere physical anguish to the condition of a brute this be she lot in life all through that first night hilda stay with she try to pretend that sarah be a woman and in the morning she have assume control of the house she have she secret to console she it remain a secret because there be no one to whom she could relate it sarah have no ear for news unconnected with she malady and indeed to tell sarah as sarah be would have be to carry callousness to the point of insult and so hilda amid she enormous labor and fatigue have live with she secret which from be a perfumed delight turn in two day to something subtly horrible to something that by its horror prevent she from write to edwin aught but the briefest missive she have exist from hour to hour from one minute apprehensively to the next day and night hardly sleep devour inwardly by a fear at once monstrous and simple at once convincing and incredible as for the letter which mentally she have compose a hundred time to edwin and which she owe to he it have become fantastic and then inconceivable to she ii one of the new servant enter the room and hand a letter to hilda and leave the room and shut the door the envelope be address miss lessway 59 preston street brighton in edwin clayhanger 's beautiful handwriting every evening come thus a letter which he have post in bursley on the previous day hilda think : will this contain another reproach at my irregularity i can not bear it if it do and she gaze at the handwriting and in particular at she own name and she own name seem to be the name of somebody else of some strange young woman she feel dizzy the door of sarah 's wardrobe be ajar and in the mirror of it hilda could see herself obscurely a black-robed strange young woman with untidy hair and white cheek and huge dark stare heavy eye with pouch beneath they the image waver in the mirror she think : here it be again this awful feeling surely i be not go to faint she could hear sarah 's sigh breath : she could hear the singing of the shaded gas-flame she turn she gaze away from the mirror and see sarah 's gray head inadvertently nod as it always nod then the letter slip out of she hand she glance down at the floor in pursuit of it : the floor be darkly revolving she think : be i really faint this time i must not faint i have get to arrange about that bacon to-night and -- oh lot of thing sarah be not a bit better and i must sit with she until she get off to sleep she leg tremble and she be terrorize by extraordinary novel sensation of insecurity oh she murmur weakly iii you have only faint say the doctor in a low voice she perceive little by little that she be lie flat on the floor at the foot of sarah 's bed and that he be kneel beside she the bed throw a shadow on they both but she could see he benevolent face anxious and yet reassuring rather clearly what she whisper in feeble despair she feel that she resistance be definitely break from higher up at the level of the hidden bed come the regular plaintive respiration of sarah gailey you must take care of yourself better than this say the doctor perhaps this be a day when you ought to be rest she answer resign no it be not that i believe i be go to have a child you must she stop oh say the doctor with discretion be that it strange how the direct word would create a new situation she have not tell the doctor that she have be through the ceremony of marriage and have be victimize she have tell he nothing but the central and final thought in she mind and lo the new situation be bring into be and the doctor be accept it he be not emit astounded ` but -- ' she directness have make all possible ` but ' seem ridiculous and futile and have make the expression of curiosity seem offensive she lay on the floor impassive she be no longer horrify by expectancy well say the doctor we must see i think you can sit up now can not you three-quarter of a hour afterwards she go into sarah 's room alone she be aware of no emotion whatever she merely desire as a professional nurse might have desire to see if sarah sleep sarah be not sleep she moan as she moan continually when awake hilda bent over she tremble head whose right side press upon the pillow how queer think hilda how awful that she do not even hear what i say to he it will almost kill she when she do know sarah 's eye blink without stir without shift she horizontal preoccupy gaze from the wall she mutter peevishly : what be that you be say about go to have a child startle hilda move back a little from the bed the doctor say there be no doubt i be hilda answer coldly how queer sarah say i quite think -- but of course a girl like you be could not be sure i should like another biscuit but i do not want the osborne -- the other she resume she moaning iv on the follow Saturday morning -- rather more than a fortnight after she engagement to edwin clayhanger -- hilda come out of the kitchen of no 59 preston street and shut the door on a nauseating malodorous mess of broken food and greasy plate in the midst of which two servant be noisily gobble down they late breakfast and dispute with a frown of disgust on she face she look into sarah gailey 's bedroom sarah though vaguely better be still in constant acute pain and she knee still repose on a pillow and be protect from the upper bed-clothes and she still could not move hilda put on a smile for sarah gailey who nod morosely and then extinguish the smile as if it have be expensive gas burning to no purpose she pass into the basement sitting-room and slake the fire there with a gesture of irresolution she lift the lid of the desk in the corner and gaze first at a little pile of four unopened letter address to she in edwin 's handwriting and then at a volume of crashaw which the enthusiastic tom orgreave have send to she as a reward for she appreciation of crashaw 's poem she release the lid suddenly and go upstairs to she bedroom chat sugarily for a instant on the way with the second miss watchett in the bedroom she don she street thing and then she descend she have to go to the registry office in north street about a new cook she stop at the front door and then surprisingly go down once more into the basement sitting-room stand up at the desk she write this letter : darling janet -- i be now marry to george cannon the marriage be not quite public but i tell you before anybody and you might tell edwin clayhanger -- you loving h l least say soonest mend and the conciseness would discourage question she insert the letter into a envelope which she address and stamp and then she flee with it from the house and in two minute it be in a letter-box and she be walk slowly along the king 's road past the shop the letter be the swift and desperate sequel to several day ' absolutely sterile reflection it say enough for the moment later she could explain that she husband have leave she she could not write to edwin she could not bring herself to write anything to he she could not confess nor beg for forgiveness nor even for sympathetic understanding she could not admit the uninstructed rashness which have lead she to assume positively on inadequate grounds that she union with george cannon have be fruitless she must suffer and he also must suffer rather than let he know in any conceivable manner that all unwitting she be bear the child of another at the moment of she betrothal to himself she prefer to be regard as a jilt of the very worst kind strange that she should choose the rôle of deceiver instead of the rôle of victim strange that she would sooner be hate and scorn than pity strange that she would not even give edwin the opportunity of treat she as a widow but so it be for she the one possible attitude towards edwin be the attitude of silence in the silence of the grave she love for he exist as she walk along the chill promenade she look with discreet curiosity at every woman she meet to see she condition this matter which before she have never think of now obsess she and all woman be divide for she into two class the expectant and the other also she self-consciousness be extreme more so even than it have be after she mother 's death she be not frighten -- yet she be assuredly not panic-struck rather she mood be grim harsh and calmly bitter she think : i suppose george must be inform it affect she queerly that if she take it into she head she need never go back to preston street she be free she owe nothing to anybody and yet she would go back she would require a home soon and she would require a livelihood for the share of the brighton hotel continental limited promise to be sterile and be already unsaleable but apart from these consideration she would have go back for sarah gailey -- because sarah gailey be entirely dependent on she she detest sarah despite sarah 's suffering and yet by she conscience she be for ever bind to she the future loomed appalling sarah 's career be finish she could not be anything but a burden and a torment she last year would probably be dreadful both for herself and for other the prospects of the boarding-house be not radiant hilda could direct the enterprise but not well she could work but she have not the art of make other work already the place be slightly at six and seven and she loathe it she loathe the whole business of cater along the entire length of the king 's road the smell of basement kitchen ascend to the pavement and offend the nose and hilda see all brighton as a colossal and disgusting enlargement of the kitchen at no 59 she see the background and the pit of brighton -- that which underlie and hide behind and be not see the grandeur of the king 's road be naught to she she glance pierce it and it fade to a hallucination beyond it she envisage the year to come the messy and endless struggle the necessary avarice and trickery incidental to it -- and perhaps the ultimate failure she would never make money -- she feel that she be not bear to make money -- especially by dodge and false politeness out of idle empty-noddled boarder she would lose it and lose it and she picture what she would be in ten year : the hard-driven landlady up to every subterfuge -- with a child to feed and educate and perhaps a bedridden querulous invalid to support and there be no alternative to the tableau she go by the chichester which tower with all its story above she head who would take it now george cannon would have make it pay he would have make anything pay how she be definitely cut off from the magnificence of the king 's road the side street be she destiny the side street and shabbiness and it be all george 's fault -- and hers the poverty if it come would be george 's fault alone for he have squander she money in a speculation it astounded she that george so shrewd and well balanced should have make a investment so foolish she do not realize that a passion for a business enterprise as for a woman be capable of destroy the balance of any man and george cannon have have both passion and then she see florrie bagster on the other side of the street walk leisurely by the sea-wall alone if mr boutwood have have a more generous and wild disposition he might have allow florrie to ruin he in six month of fur and carriage and champagne but mr boutwood though a dog be a careful dog especially at those moment when the conventional dog can refuse nothing florrie be well and warmly dress -- no more and she be on foot hilda 's gaze fasten on she and immediately divine from the cut and fall of the coat that florrie have something to conceal from every one but she mr boutwood and whereas florrie tread the pavement with a charming little air that waver between impudence and modesty between timid meekness and conceit hilda blush with shame and pity she on one footpath and florrie on the other soon she think i shall not be able to walk along this road she have sin she admit that she have sin against some quality in herself but how innocently and how ignorantly and what a tremendous punishment for so transient a weakness and new consequence still more disastrous than any she have foresee present themselves one after another george have escape but a word of open scandal a single whisper in the ear of the old creature down at torquay might actuate machinery that would reach out after he and drag he back and plant he in jail george the father of she child in jail it be all a matter of chance sheer chance she begin to perceive what life really be and the immense importance of hazard therein nevertheless without frailty without defection what could chance have do she begin to perceive that this that she be live through be life she bite she lip grief shame disillusion hardship peril catastrophe exile above all exile these have to be face and they would be face she recall the firiest verse of crashaw and she set she shoulder back there be the stuff of a woman in she only a little while and she have see before she a beloved boy entrance by she charm she have now no charm where now be the soft virgin and yet somehow magically miraculously the soft virgin be still there and the invincible vague hope of youth and the irrepressible consciousness of power be almost ready to flame up afresh contrary to all reason and irradiate she starless soul note : -- _ the
