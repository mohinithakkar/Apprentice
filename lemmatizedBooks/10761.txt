stevenson -lrb- 1 -rrb- be bear at edinburgh on the 13 November 1850 he father thoma and he grandfather robert be both distinguished light-house engineer and the maternal grandfather balfor be a professor of moral philosophy who live to be ninety year old there be therefore a combination of _ lux et veritas _ in the blood of young loui stevenson which in _ dr jekyll and mr hyde _ take the form of a luminous portrayal of a great moral idea in the language of pope stevenson 's life be a long disease even as a child he weak lung cause great anxiety to all the family except himself but although death love a shine mark it take over forty year of continuous practice for the grim archer to send the black arrow home it be perhaps fortunate for english literature that he health be no better for the boy crave a active life and would doubtless have become a engineer he make a brave attempt to pursue this call but it be soon evident that he constitution make it impossible after desultory schooling and a immense amount of general reading he enter the university of edinburgh and then try the study of law although the thought of this profession become more and more repugnant and finally intolerable he pass he final examination satisfactorily this be in 1875 he have already begin a series of excursion to the south of france and other place in search of a climate more favorable to he incipient malady and every return to edinburgh prove more and more conclusively that he could not live in scotch mist he have make the acquaintance of a number of literary man and he be consume with a burning ambition to become a writer like ibsen 's _ master-builder _ there be a troll in he blood which draw he away to the continent on inland voyage with a canoe and lonely tramp with a donkey these give he material for book full of brilliant picture shrewd observation and irrepressible humor he contribute various article to magazine which be immediately recognize by critic like leslie stephen as bear the unmistakable mark of literary genius but they attract almost no attention from the general reading public and they author have only the consciousness of good work for he reward in 1880 he be marry stevenson 's first successful work be _ treasure island _ which be publish in book form in 1883 and have already become a classic this do not however bring he either a good income or general fame he great reputation date from the publication of the _ strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde _ which appear in 1886 that work have a instant and unqualified success especially in america and make its author 's name know to the whole english-speaking world _ kidnap _ be publish the same year and another masterpiece _ the master of ballantrae _ in 1889 after various experiment with different climate include that of switzerland stevenson sail for america in August 1887 the winter of 1887-88 he spend at saranac lake under the care of dr trudeau who become one of he best friend in 1890 he settle at samoa in the pacific here he enter upon a career of intense literary activity and yet find time to take a active part in the politics of the island and to give valuable assistance in internal improvement the end come suddenly exactly as he would have wish it and precisely as he have unconsciously predict in the last radiant triumphant sentence of he great essay _ ae triplex _ he have be at work on a novel _ st ive _ one of he poorer effort and whose composition grow steadily more and more distasteful until he find that he be actually write against the grain he throw this aside impatiently and with extraordinary energy and enthusiasm begin a new story _ weir of hermiston _ which would undoubtedly have be he masterpiece have he live to complete it in luminosity of style in nobleness of conception in the almost infallible choice of word this astonishing fragment easily take first place in stevenson 's production at the end of a day spend in almost feverish dictation the third of December 1894 he suddenly faint and die without regain consciousness death have not be suffer to take so much as a illusion from he heart in the hot-fit of life a-tiptoe on the highest point of be he pass at a bind on to the other side the noise of the mallet and chisel be scarcely quench the trumpet be hardly do blow when trail with he cloud of glory this happy-starred full-blooded spirit shot into the spiritual land he be bury at the summit of a mountain the body be carry on the shoulder of faithful samoan who might have sing browning 's noble hymn let we begin and carry up this corpse singing together leave we the common croft the vulgar thorpe each in its tether sleep safe on the bosom of the plain that be the appropriate country there man 's thought rarer intenser self-gathered for a outbreak as it ought chafe in the censer leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop seek we sepulture on a tall mountain thither we path lie wind we up the height : wait ye the warn we low life be the level 's and the night 's he be for the morning step to a tune square chest erect each head ` ware the beholder this be we master famous calm and dead bear on we shoulder here -- here be he place where meteor shoot cloud form lightning be loosen star come and go let joy break with the storm peace let the dew send lofty design must close in like effect loftily lie leave he -- still loftier than the world suspect living and die ii personality and character stevenson have a motley personality which be sufficiently evident in he portrait there be in he the puritan the man of the world and the vagabond there be something too of the obsolete soldier of fortune with the cock and feathered hat worn audaciously on one side there be also a touch of the elfin the uncanny -- the mysterious charm that belong to the borderland between the real and the unreal world -- the element so conspicuous and so indefinable in the art of hawthorne writer so different as defoe cooper poe and sir thoma browne be see with vary degree of emphasis in he literary temperament he be whimsical as a imaginative child and everyone have notice that he never grow old he buoyant optimism be base on a chronic experience of physical pain for pessimist like schopenhauer be usually man in comfortable circumstance and of excellent bodily health he courage and cheerfulness under depressing circumstance be so splendid to contemplate that some critic believe that in time he _ letter _ may be regard as he greatest literary work for they be priceless in they unconscious revelation of a beautiful soul great as stevenson be as a writer he be still greater as a man so many admirable book have be write by man whose character will not bear examination that it be refresh to find one master-artist whose daily life be so full of the fruit of the spirit as he romance have bring pleasure to thousand of reader so the spectacle of he cheerful march through the valley of the shadow of death be a constant source of comfort and inspiration one feel ashamed of cowardice and petty irritation after witness the steady courage of this man he philosophy of life be totally different from that of stoicism for the stoic say grin and bear it and usually succeed in do neither stevenson seem to say laugh and forget it and he show we how to do both stevenson have the rather unusual combination of the artist and the moralist both element be mark in he writings to a very high degree the famous and oft-quoted sonnet by he friend the late mr henley give a vivid picture : thin-legged thin-chested slight unspeakably neat-footed and weak-fingered : in he face -- lean large-honed curved of beak and touch with race bold-lipped rich-tinted mutable as the sea the brown eye radiant with vivacity -- there show a brilliant and romantic grace a spirit intense and rare with trace on trace of passion impudence and energy valiant in velvet light in ragged luck most vain most generous sternly critical buffoon and poet lover and sensualist a deal of ariel just a streak of puck much antony of hamlet most of all and something of the shorter catechist he be not primarily a moral teacher like socrate or thoma carlyle nor do he feel within he the voice of a prophetic mission the virtue of he writings consist in they wholesome ethical quality in they solid health fresh air be often better for the soul than the swinging of the priest 's censer at a time when the school of zolum be at its climax stevenson open the window and let in the pleasant breeze for the morbid and unhealthy period of adolescence he book be more healthful than many serious moral work he purge the mind of uncleanness just as he purge contemporary fiction as stevenson 's correspondence with he friend like sidney colvin and william archer reveal the social side of he nature so he correspondence with the unseen power in which he believe show that he character be essentially religious a man 's letter be often a truer picture of he mind than a photograph and when these epistle be direct not to man and woman but to the supreme intelligence they form a real revelation of they writer 's heart nothing betray the personality of a man more clearly than he prayer and the follow petition that stevenson compose for the use of he household at vailima bear the stamp of its author at morning the day return and bring we the petty round of irritating concern and duty help we to play the man help we to perform they with laughter and kind face let cheerfulness abound with industry give we to go blithely on we business all this day bring we to we rest bed weary and content and undishonoured and grant we in the end the gift of sleep iii stevenson 's versatility stevenson be a poet a dramatist a essayist and a novelist besides write many political geographical and biographical sketch as a poet he fame be steadily wane the tendency at first be to rank he too high owe to the undeniable charm of many of the poem in the _ child 's garden of verse _ the child 's view of the world as set forth in these song be often originally and gracefully express but there be little in stevenson 's poetry that be of permanent value and it be probable that most of it will be forget this fact be in a way a tribute to he genius for he greatness as a prose writer have simply eclipse he reputation as a poet he play be failure they illustrate the familiar truth that a man may have positive genius as a dramatic writer and yet fail as a dramatist there be law that govern the stage which must be obey play-writing be a great art in itself entirely distinct from literary composition even brown the most intensely dramatic poet of the nineteenth century be not nearly so successful in he drama as in he dramatic lyric and romance he essay attract at first very little attention they be too fine and too subtle to awaken popular enthusiasm it be the success of he novel that draw reader back to the essay just as it be the vogue of sudermann 's play that make he earlier novel popular one have only to read such essay however as those print in this volume to realize not only they spirit and charm but to feel instinctively that one be read english literature they be exquisite work of art write in a almost impeccable style by many judicious reader they be place above he work of fiction they certainly constitute the most original portion of he entire literary output it be astonishing that this young scotchman should have be able to make so many actually new observation on a game so old as life there be a shrewd insight into the motive of human conduct that make some of these graceful sketch belong to the literature of philosophy use the word philosophy in its deepest and broadest sense the essay be fill with whimsical paradox keen and witty as those of bernard shaw without have any of the latter 's cynicism iconoclasm and sinister attitude toward morality for the real foundation of even the lightest of stevenson 's work be invariably ethical he fame as a writer of prose romance grow brighter every year he supreme achievement be to show that a book might be cram with the most wildly exciting incident and yet reveal profound and acute analysis of character and be write with consummate art he tale have all the fertility of invention and breathless suspense of scott and cooper while in literary style they immeasurably surpass the finest work of these two great master he best complete story be i think _ treasure island _ there be a peculiar brightness about this book which even the most notable of the later work fail to equal nor be it a trifling feat to make a blind man and a one-legged man so formidable that even the reader be afraid of they those who complain that this be merely a pirate story forget that in art the subject be of comparatively little importance whereas the treatment be everything to say as some do that there be no difference between _ treasure island _ and a cheap tale of blood and thunder be equivalent to say that there be no difference between the sistine madonna and a chromo virgin iv the personal essay the personal essay be a peculiar form of literature entirely different from critical essay like those of matthew arnold and from purely reflective essay like those of bacon it be a species of write somewhat akin to autobiography or firelight conversation where the writer take the reader entirely into he confidence and chat pleasantly with he on topic that may be as widely apart as the immortality of the soul and the proper color of a necktie the first and supreme master of this manner of write be montaigne who belong in the front rank of the world 's greatest writer of prose montaigne talk endlessly on the most trivial subject without ever become trivial to those who really love reading and have some sympathy with humanity montaigne 's _ essay _ be a perpetual refuge and delight and it be interesting to reflect how far in literary fame this man who talk about he meal he horse and he cat outshine thousand of scholarly and talented writer who discuss only the most serious theme in politics and religion the great english prose writer in the field of the personal essay during the seventeenth century be sir thoma browne thoma fuller and abraham cowley though walton 's _ compleat angler _ be a kindred work browne 's _ religio medicus _ and he delightful _ garden of cyrus _ old tom fuller 's quaint _ good thought in bad time _ and cowley 's charming _ essay _ be admirable example of this school of composition burton 's wonderful _ anatomy of melancholy _ be a colossal personal essay some of the papers of steele and addison in the _ tatler _ _ guardian _ and the _ spectator _ be of course notable but it be not until the appearance of charle lamb that the personal essay reach its climax in english literature over the page of the _ essay of elia _ hover a immortal charm -- the charm of a nature inexhaustible in its humor and kindly sympathy for humanity thackeray be another great master of the literary easy-chair and be to some reader more attractive in this attitude than as a novelist in america we have have a few writer who have reach eminence in this form begin with washington irving and include donald g mitchell whose _ reverie of a bachelor _ have be read by thousand of people for over fifty year as a personal essayist stevenson seem already to belong to the first rank he be both eclectic and individual he bring to he pen the reminiscence of varied reading and a wholly original touch of fantasy he be literally steep in the gorgeous gothic diction of the seventeenth century but he realize that such a prose style as illumine the page of william drummond 's _ cypress grove _ and browne 's _ urn burial _ be a lost art he attempt to imitate such write only in he youthful exercise for he own genius be force to express itself in a original way all of he personal essay have that air of distinction which attract and hold one 's attention as powerfully in a book as it do in social intercourse everything that he have to say seem immediately worth say and worth hearing for he be one of those rare man who have a interesting mind there be some literary artist who have style and nothing else just as there be some great singer who have nothing but a voice the true test of a book like that of a individual be whether or not it improve upon acquaintance stevenson 's essay reflect a personality that become brighter as we draw nearer this fact make he essay not merely entertaining reading but worthy of serious and prolonged study -lrb- note 1 : he name be originally robert lewis balfor stevenson he later drop the balfor and

-rrb- _ essay of robert loui stevenson i on the enjoyment of unpleasant place it be a difficult matter -lrb- 1 -rrb- to make the most of any give place and we have much in we own power thing look at patiently from one side after another generally end by show a side that be beautiful a few month ago some word be say in the _ portfolio _ as to a austere regimen in scenery and such a discipline be then recommend as healthful and strengthen to the taste that be the text so to speak of the present essay this discipline in scenery -lrb- 2 -rrb- it must be understand be something more than a mere walk before breakfast to whet the appetite for when we be put down in some unsightly neighborhood and especially if we have come to be more or less dependent on what we see we must set ourselves to hunt out beautiful thing with all the ardor and patience of a botanist after a rare plant day by day we perfect ourselves in the art of see nature more favourably we learn to live with she as people learn to live with fretful or violent spouse : to dwell lovingly on what be good and shut we eye against all that be bleak or inharmonious we learn also to come to each place in the right spirit the traveller as brantôme quaintly tell we _ fait des discors en soi pour se soutenir en chemin _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- and into these discourse he weave something out of all that he see and suffer by the way they take they tone greatly from the vary character of the scene a sharp ascent bring different thought from a level road and the man 's fancy grow lighter as he come out of the wood into a clearing nor do the scenery any more affect the thought than the thought affect the scenery we see place through we humor as though differently color glass we be ourselves a term in the equation a note of the chord and make discord or harmony almost at will there be no fear for the result if we can but surrender ourselves sufficiently to the country that surround and follow we so that we be ever think suitable thought or tell ourselves some suitable sort of story as we go we become thus in some sense a center of beauty we be provocative of beauty -lrb- 4 -rrb- much as a gentle and sincere character be provocative of sincerity and gentleness in other and even where there be no harmony to be elicit by the quickest and most obedient of spirit we may still embellish a place with some attraction of romance we may learn to go far afield for association and handle they lightly when we have find they sometimes a old print come to we aid i have see many a spot light up at once with picturesque imagination by a reminiscence of callot or sadeler or paul brill -lrb- 5 -rrb- dick turpin -lrb- 6 -rrb- have be my lay figure for many a english lane and i suppose the trossach would hardly be the trossach -lrb- 7 -rrb- for most tourist if a man of admirable romantic instinct have not people it for they with harmonious figure and bring they thither they mind rightly prepare for the impression there be half the battle in this preparation for instance : i have rarely be able to visit in the proper spirit the wild and inhospitable place of we own highland i be happier where it be tame and fertile and not readily pleased without tree -lrb- 8 -rrb- i understand that there be some phase of mental trouble that harmonise well with such surroundings and that some person by the dispense power of the imagination can go back several century in spirit and put themselves into sympathy with the hunt houseless unsociable way of life that be in its place upon these savage hill now when i be sad i like nature to charm I out of my sadness like david before saul -lrb- 9 -rrb- and the thought of these past age strike nothing in I but a unpleasant pity so that i can never hit on the right humor for this sort of landscape and lose much pleasure in consequence still even here if i be only let alone and time enough be give i should have all manner of pleasure and take many clear and beautiful image away with I when i leave when we can not think ourselves into sympathy with the great feature of a country we learn to ignore they and put we head among the grass for flower or pore for long time together over the changeful current of a stream we come down to the sermon in stone -lrb- 10 -rrb- when we be shut out from any poem in the spread landscape we begin to peep and botanise we take a interest in bird and insect we find many thing beautiful in miniature the reader will recollect the little summer scene in _ wuther height _ -lrb- 11 -rrb- -- the one warm scene perhaps in all that powerful miserable novel -- and the great feature that be make therein by grass and flower and a little sunshine : this be in the spirit of which i now speak and lastly we can go indoors interior be sometimes as beautiful often more picturesque than the show of the open air and they have that quality of shelter of which i shall presently have more to say with all this in mind i have often be tempt to put forth the paradox that any place be good enough to live a life in while it be only in a few and those highly favor that we can pass a few hour agreeably for if we only stay long enough we become at home in the neighborhood reminiscence spring up like flower about uninteresting corner we forget to some degree the superior loveliness of other place and fall into a tolerant and sympathetic spirit which be its own reward and justification look back the other day on some recollection of my own i be astonish to find how much i owe to such a residence six week in one unpleasant country-side have do more it seem to quicken and educate my sensibility than many year in place that jump more nearly with my inclination the country to which i refer be a level and treeless plateau over which the wind cut like a whip for mile on mile it be the same a river indeed fall into the sea near the town where i reside but the valley of the river be shallow and bald for as far up as ever i have the heart to follow it there be road certainly but road that have no beauty or interest for as there be no timber and but little irregularity of surface you see you whole walk expose to you from the beginning : there be nothing leave to fancy nothing to expect nothing to see by the wayside save here and there a unhomely-looking homestead and here and there a solitary spectacled stone-breaker -lrb- 12 -rrb- and you be only accompany as you go doggedly forward by the gaunt telegraph-post and the hum of the resonant wire in the keen sea-wind to one who have learn to know they song in warm pleasant place by the mediterranean it seem to taunt the country and make it still bleaker by suggest contrast even the waste place by the side of the road be not as hawthorne like to put it take back to nature by any decent covering of vegetation wherever the land have the chance it seem to lie fallow there be a certain tawny nudity of the south bare sunburnt plain color like a lion and hill clothe only in the blue transparent air but this be of another description -- this be the nakedness of the north the earth seem to know that it be naked and be ashamed and cold -lrb- 13 -rrb- it seem to be always blow on that coast indeed this have pass into the speech of the inhabitant and they salute each other when they meet with breezy breezy instead of the customary fine day of farther south these continual wind be not like the harvest breeze that just keep a equable pressure against you face as you walk and serve to set all the tree talk over you head or bring round you the smell of the wet surface of the country after a shower they be of the bitter hard persistent sort that interfere with sight and respiration and make the eye sore even such wind as these have they own merit in proper time and place it be pleasant to see they brandish great mass of shadow and what a power they have over the color of the world how they ruffle the solid woodland in they passage and make they shudder and whiten like a single willow there be nothing more vertiginous than a wind like this among the wood with all its sight and noise and the effect get between some painter and they sober eyesight so that even when the rest of they picture be calm the foliage be color like foliage in a gale -lrb- 14 -rrb- there be nothing however of this sort to be notice in a country where there be no tree and hardly any shadow save the passive shadow and cloud or those of rigid house and wall but the wind be nevertheless a occasion of pleasure for nowhere could you taste more fully the pleasure of a sudden lull or a place of opportune shelter the reader know what i mean he must remember how when he have sit himself down behind a dyke on a hill-side he delight to hear the wind hiss vainly through the cranny at he back how he body tingle all over with warmth and it begin to dawn upon he with a sort of slow surprise that the country be beautiful the heather purple and the faraway hill all marbled with sun and shadow wordsworth in a beautiful passage -lrb- 15 -rrb- of the prelude have use this as a figure for the feeling strike in we by the quiet by-street of london after the uproar of the great thoroughfare and the comparison may be turn the other way with as good effect : meanwhile the roar continue till at length escape as from a enemy we turn abruptly into some sequestered nook still as a shelter would place when wind blow loud i remember meet a man once in a train who tell I of what must have be quite the most perfect instance of this pleasure of escape he have go up one sunny windy morning to the top of a great cathedral somewhere abroad i think it be cologne cathedral the great unfinished marvel by the rhine -lrb- 16 -rrb- and after a long while in dark stairway he issue at last into the sunshine on a platform high above the town at that elevation it be quite still and warm the gale be only in the lower stratum of the air and he have forget it in the quiet interior of the church and during he long ascent and so you may judge of he surprise when rest he arm on the sunlit balustrade and look over into the _ place _ far below he he see the good people hold on they hat and lean hard against the wind as they walk there be something to my fancy quite perfect in this little experience of my fellow-traveller 's the way of man seem always very trivial to we when we find ourselves alone on a church-top with the blue sky and a few tall pinnacle and see far below we the steep roof and foreshorten buttress and the silent activity of the city street but how much more must they not have seem so to he as he stand not only above other man 's business but above other man 's climate in a golden zone like apollo 's -lrb- 17 -rrb- this be the sort of pleasure i find in the country of which i write the pleasure be to be out of the wind and to keep it in memory all the time and hug oneself upon the shelter and it be only by the sea that any such sheltered place be to be find between the black worm-eaten headland there be little bight and haven well screen from the wind and the commotion of the external sea where the sand and weed look up into the gazer 's face from a depth of tranquil water and the sea-bird scream and flicker from the ruin crag alone disturb the silence and the sunshine one such place have impress itself on my memory beyond all other on a rock by the water 's edge old fight man of the norse breed have plant a double castle the two stand wall to wall like semi-detached villa and yet feud have run so high between they owner that one from out of a window shoot the other as he stand in he own doorway there be something in the juxtaposition of these two enemy full of tragic irony it be grim to think of bearded man and bitter woman take hateful counsel together about the two hall-fire at night -lrb- 18 -rrb- when the sea boom against the foundation and the wild winter wind be loose over the battlements and in the study we may reconstruct for ourselves some pale figure of what life then be not so when we be there when we be there such thought come to we only to intensify a contrary impression and association be turn against itself -lrb- 19 -rrb- i remember walk thither three afternoon in succession my eye weary with be set against the wind and how drop suddenly over the edge of the down i find myself in a new world of warmth and shelter the wind from which i have escape as from a enemy -lrb- 20 -rrb- be seemingly quite local it carry no cloud with it and come from such a quarter that it do not trouble the sea within view the two castle black and ruinous as the rock about they be still distinguishable from these by something more insecure and fantastic in the outline something that the last storm have leave imminent and the next would demolish entirely it would be difficult to render in word the sense of peace that take possession of I on these three afternoon it be help out as i have say by the contrast the shore be batter and bemaul by previous tempest i have the memory at heart of the insane strife of the pigmy who have erect these two castle and live in they in mutual distrust and enmity and know i have only to put my head out of this little cup of shelter to find the hard wind blow in my eye and yet there be the two great tract of motionless blue air and peaceful sea look on unconcerned and apart at the turmoil of the present moment and the memorial of the precarious past there be ever something transitory and fretful in the impression of a high wind under a cloudless sky it seem to have no root in the constitution of thing it must speedily begin to faint and wither away like a cut flower and on those day the thought of the wind and the thought of human life come very near together in my mind we noisy year do indeed seem moment -lrb- 21 -rrb- in the being of the eternal silence : and the wind in the face of that great field of stationary blue be as the wind of a butterfly 's wing the placidity of the sea be a thing likewise to be remembered shelley speak of the sea as hunger for calm -lrb- 22 -rrb- and in this place one learn to understand the phrase look down into these green water from the broken edge of the rock or swimming leisurely in the sunshine it seem to I that they be enjoy they own tranquillity and when now and again it be disturb by a wind ripple on the surface or the quick black passage of a fish far below they settle back again -lrb- one could fancy -rrb- with relief on shore too in the little nook of shelter everything be so subdue and still that the least particular strike in I a pleasurable surprise the desultory crackling of the whin-pod -lrb- 23 -rrb- in the afternoon sun usurp the ear the hot sweet breath of the bank that have be saturate all day long with sunshine and now exhale it into my face be like the breath of a fellow-creature i remember that i be haunt by two line of french verse in some dumb way they seem to fit my surroundings and give expression to the contentment that be in I and i keep repeat to myself -- mon coeur est un luth suspendu -lrb- 24 -rrb- sitôt qu'on le touche il résonne i can give no reason why these line come to I at this time and for that very cause i repeat they here for all i know they may serve to complete the impression in the mind of the reader as they be certainly a part of it for I and this happen to I in the place of all other where i like least to stay when i think of it i grow ashamed of my own ingratitude out of the strong come forth sweetness -lrb- 25 -rrb- there in the bleak and gusty north i receive perhaps my strongest impression of peace i see the sea to be great and calm and the earth in that little corner be all

yet this should not be idleness so call which do not consist in do nothing but in do a great deal not recognize in the dogmatic formulary of the ruling class have as good a right to state its position as industry itself it be admit that the presence of people who refuse to enter in the great handicap race for sixpenny piece be at once a insult and a disenchantment for those who do a fine fellow -lrb- as we see so many -rrb- take he determination vote for the sixpence and in the emphatic americanism go for they -lrb- 4 -rrb- and while such a one be plough distressfully up the road it be not

with most subject be to do they well therefore please to remember this be a apology it be certain that much may be judiciously argue in favor of diligence only there be something to be say against it and that be what on the present occasion i have to say to state one argument be not necessarily to be deaf to all other and that a man have write a book of travels in montenegro be no reason why he should never have be to richmond -lrb- 8 -rrb- it be surely beyond a doubt that people should be a good deal idle in youth for though here and there a lord macaulay may escape from school honor -lrb- 9 -rrb- with all he wit about he most boy pay so dear for they medal that they never afterwards have a shot in they locker and begin the world bankrupt and the same hold true during all the time a lad be educate himself or suffer other to educate he it must have be a very foolish old gentleman who address johnson at oxford in these word : young man ply you book diligently now and acquire a stock of knowledge for when year come upon you you will find that pore upon book will be but a irksome task the old gentleman seem to have be unaware that many other thing besides read grow irksome and not a few become impossible by the time a man have to use spectacles and can not walk without a stick book be good enough in they own way but they be a mighty bloodless substitute for life it seem a pity to sit like the lady of shalott -lrb- 10 -rrb- peer into a mirror with you back turn on all the bustle and glamour of reality and if a man read very hard as the old anecdote remind we he will have little time for thought if you look back on you own education i be sure it will not be the full vivid instructive hour of truantry that you regret you would rather cancel some lack-lustre period between sleep and waking -lrb- 11 -rrb- in the class for my own part i have attend a good many lecture in my time i still remember that the spin of a top be a case of kinetic stability i still remember that emphyteusis be not a disease nor stillicide -lrb- 12 -rrb- a crime but though i would not willingly part with such scrap of science i do not set the same store by they as by certain other odds and end that i come by in the open street while i be play truant this be not the moment to dilate on that mighty place of education which be the favorite school of dickens and of balzac -lrb- 13 -rrb- and turn out yearly many inglorious master in the science of the aspect of life suffice it to say this : if a lad do not learn in the street it be because he have no faculty of learn nor be the truant always in the street for if he prefer he may go out by the garden suburb into the country he may pitch on some tuft of lilac over a burn and smoke innumerable pipe to the tune of the water on the stone a bird will sing in the thicket and there he may fall into a vein of kindly think and see thing in a new perspective why if this be not education what be we may conceive mr worldly wiseman -lrb- 14 -rrb- accost such a one and the conversation that should thereupon ensue : -- how now young fellow what dost thou here truly sir i take mine ease be not this the hour of the class and should ` st thou not be ply thy book with diligence to the end thou mayest obtain knowledge nay but thus also i follow after learn by you leave learn quotha after what fashion i pray thee be it mathematics no to be sure be it metaphysics nor that be it some language nay it be no language be it a trade nor a trade neither why then what be ' t indeed sir as a time may soon come for I to go upon pilgrimage i be desirous to note what be commonly do by person in my case and where be the ugliest slough and thicket on the road as also what manner of staff be of the best service moreover i lie here by this water to learn by root-of-heart a lesson which my master teach I to call peace or contentment hereupon mr worldly wiseman be much commove with passion and shake he cane with a very threatful countenance break forth upon this wise : learn quotha say he i would have all such rogue scourge by the hangman and so he would go he way ruffle out he cravat with a crackle of starch like a turkey when it spread its feather now this of mr wiseman be the common opinion a fact be not call a fact but a piece of gossip if it do not fall into one of you scholastic category a inquiry must be in some acknowledged direction with a name to go by or else you be not inquire at all only lounge and the workhouse be too good for you it be suppose that all knowledge be at the bottom of a well or the far end of a telescope sainte-beuve -lrb- 15 -rrb- as he grow older come to regard all experience as a single great book in which to study for a few year ere we go hence and it seem all one to he whether you should read in chapter xx which be the differential calculus or in chapter xxxix which be hear the band play in the garden as a matter of fact a intelligent person look out of he eye and hearken in he ear with a smile on he face all the time will get more true education than many another in a life of heroic vigil there be certainly some chill and arid knowledge to be find upon the summit of formal and laborious science but it be all round about you and for the trouble of look that you will acquire the warm and palpitating fact of life while other be fill they memory with a lumber of word one-half of which they will forget before the week be out you truant may learn some really useful art : to play the fiddle to know a good cigar or to speak with ease and opportunity to all variety of man many who have ply they book diligently and know all about some one branch or another of accept lore come out of the study with a ancient and owl-like demeanor and prove dry stockish and dyspeptic in all the better and brighter part of life many make a large fortune who remain underbred and pathetically stupid to the last and meantime there go the idler who begin life along with they -- by you leave a different picture he have have time to take care of he health and he spirit he have be a great deal in the open air which be the most salutary of all thing for both body and mind and if he have never read the great book in very recondite place he have dip into it and skim it over to excellent purpose might not the student afford some hebrew root and the business man some of he half-crown for a share of the idler 's knowledge of life at large and art of live nay and the idler have another and more important quality than these i mean he wisdom he who have much look on at the childish satisfaction of other people in they hobby will regard he own with only a very ironical indulgence he will not be hear among the dogmatist he will have a great and cool allowance for all sort of people and opinion if he find no out-of-the-way truth he will identify himself with no very burn falsehood he way take he along a by-road not much frequented but very even and pleasant which be call commonplace lane and lead to the belvedere of commonsense -lrb- 16 -rrb- thence he shall command a agreeable if no very noble prospect and while other behold the east and west the devil and the sunrise he will be contentedly aware of a sort of morning hour upon all sublunary thing with a army of shadow run speedily and in many different direction into the great daylight of eternity the shadow and the generation the shrill doctor and the plangent war -lrb- 17 -rrb- go by into ultimate silence and emptiness but underneath all this a man may see out of the belvedere window much green and peaceful landscape many firelit parlor good people laugh drinking and make love as they do before the flood or the french revolution and the old shepherd -lrb- 18 -rrb- tell he tale under the hawthorn extreme _ busyness _ whether at school or college kirk or market be a symptom of deficient vitality and a faculty for idleness imply a catholic appetite and a strong sense of personal identity there be a sort of dead-alive hackneyed people about who be scarcely conscious of live except in the exercise of some conventional occupation bring these fellow into the country or set they aboard ship and you will see how they pine for they desk or they study they have no curiosity they can not give themselves over to random provocation they do not take pleasure in the exercise of they faculty for its own sake and unless necessity lay about they with a stick they will even stand still it be no good speaking to such folk : they _ can not _ be idle they nature be not generous enough and they pass those hour in a sort of coma which be not dedicate to furious moiling in the gold-mill when they do not require to go to the office when they be not hungry and have no mind to drink the whole breathing world be a blank to they if they have to wait a hour or so for a train they fall into a stupid trance with they eye open to see they you would suppose there be nothing to look at and no one to speak with you would imagine they be paralyse or alienate and yet very possibly they be hard worker in they own way and have good eyesight for a flaw in a deed or a turn of the market they have be to school and college but all the time they have they eye on the medal they have go about in the world and mixed with clever people but all the time they be think of they own affair as if a man 's soul be not too small to begin with they have dwarf and narrow theirs by a life of all work and no play until here they be at forty with a listless attention a mind vacant of all material of amusement and not one think to rub against another while they wait for the train before he be breech he might have clamber on the box when he be twenty he would have stare at the girl but now the pipe be smoke out the snuffbox empty and my gentleman sit bolt upright upon a bench with lamentable eye this do not appeal to I as be success in life but it be not only the person himself who suffer from he busy habit but he wife and child he friend and relation and down to the very people he sit with in a railway carriage or a omnibus perpetual devotion to what a man call he business be only to be sustain by perpetual neglect of many other thing and it be not by any means certain that a man 's business be the most important thing he have to do to a impartial estimate it will seem clear that many of the wisest most virtuous and most beneficent part that be to be play upon the theater of life be fill by gratuitous performer and pass among the world at large as phase of idleness for in that theater not only the walk gentleman singing chambermaid and diligent fiddler in the orchestra but those who look on and clap they hand from the bench do really play a part and fulfil important office towards the general result you be no doubt very dependent on the care of you lawyer and stockbroker of the guard and signalman who convey you rapidly from place to place and the policeman who walk the street for you protection but be there not a thought of gratitude in you heart for certain other benefactor who set you smile when they fall in you way or season you dinner with good company colonel

anything he could call a service than to he whole circle of ostentatious friend for he think a good companion emphatically the greatest benefactor i know there be people in the world who can not feel grateful unless the favor have be do they at the cost of pain and difficulty but this be a churlish disposition a man may send you six sheet of letter-paper cover with the most entertaining gossip or you may pass half a hour pleasantly perhaps profitably over a article of he do you think the service would be greater if he have make the manuscript in he heart 's blood like a compact with the devil do you really fancy you should be more beholden to you correspondent if he have be damn you all the while for you importunity pleasure be more beneficial than duty because like the quality of mercy -lrb- 20 -rrb- they be not strain and they be twice bless there must always be two to a kiss and there may be a score in a jest but wherever there be a element of sacrifice the favor be confer with pain and among generous people receive with confusion there be no duty we so much underrate as the duty of be happy by be happy we sow anonymous benefit upon the world which remain unknown even to ourselves or when they be disclose surprise nobody so much as the benefactor the other day a ragged barefoot boy run down the street after a marble with so jolly a air that he set every one he pass into a good humor one of these person who have be deliver from more than usually black thought stop the little fellow and give he some money with this remark : you see what sometimes come of look

entrance into a room be as though another candle have be light we need not care whether they could prove the forty-seventh proposition they do a better thing than that they practically demonstrate the great theorum of the liveableness of life consequently if a person can not be happy without remain idle idle he should remain it be a revolutionary precept but thanks to hunger and the workhouse one

a great way to put humanity in error nay in many philosophy the error have be embody and lay down with every circumstance of logic although in real life the bustle and swiftness in leave people little time to think have not leave they time enough to go dangerously wrong in practice as a matter of fact although few thing be speak of with more fearful whispering than this prospect of death few have less influence on conduct under healthy circumstance we have all hear of city in south america build upon the side of fiery mountain and how even in this tremendous neighborhood the inhabitant be not a jot more impressed by the solemnity of mortal condition than if they be delving garden in the greenest corner of england there be serenade and supper and much gallantry among the myrtles overhead and meanwhile the foundation shudder underfoot the bowels of the mountain growl and at any moment living ruin may leap sky-high into the moonlight and tumble man and he merry-making in the dust in the eye of very young people and very dull old one there be something indescribably reckless and desperate in such a picture it seem not credible that respectable married people with umbrella should find appetite for a bit of supper within quite a long distance of a fiery mountain ordinary life begin to smell of high-handed debauch when it be carry on so close to a catastrophe and even cheese and salad it seem could hardly be relish in such circumstance without something like a defiance of the creator it should be a place for nobody but hermit dwelling in prayer and maceration or mere born-devil drown care in a perpetual carouse and yet when one come to think upon it calmly the situation of these south american citizen form only a very pale figure for the state of ordinary mankind this world itself travel blindly and swiftly in overcrowded space among a million other world travel blindly and swiftly in contrary direction may very well come by a knock that would set it into explosion like a penny squib and what pathologically look at be the human body with all its organ but a mere bagful of petard the least of these be as dangerous to the whole economy as the ship 's powder-magazine to the ship and with every breath we breathe and every meal we eat we be put one or more of they in peril if we cling as devotedly as some philosopher pretend we do to the abstract idea of life or be half as frightened as they make out we be for the subversive accident that end it all the trumpet might sound -lrb- 4 -rrb- by the hour and no one would follow they into battle -- the blue-peter might fly at the truck -lrb- 5 -rrb- but who would climb into a sea-going ship think -lrb- if these philosopher be right -rrb- with what a preparation of spirit we should affront the daily peril of the dinner-table : a deadlier spot than any battlefield in history where the far greater proportion of we ancestor have miserably leave they bone what woman would ever be lure into marriage so much more dangerous than the wildest sea and what would it be to grow old for after a certain distance every step we take in life we find the ice grow thinner below we foot and all around we and behind we we see we contemporary go through by the time a man get well into the seventy he continued existence be a mere miracle and when he lay he old bone in bed for the night there be a overwhelming probability that he will never see the day do the old man mind it as a matter of fact why no they be never merrier they have they grog at night and tell the raciest story they hear of the death of people about they own age or even younger not as if it be a grisly warning but with a simple childlike pleasure at have outlive someone else and when a draught might puff they out like a flutter candle or a bit of a stumble shatter they like so much glass they old heart keep sound and unaffrighted and they go on bubble with laughter through year of man 's age compare to which the valley at balaclava -lrb- 6 -rrb- be as safe and peaceful as a village cricket-green on Sunday it may fairly be question -lrb- if we look to the peril only -rrb- whether it be a much more daring feat for curtius -lrb- 7 -rrb- to plunge into the gulf than for any old gentleman of ninety to doff he clothes and clamber into bed indeed it be a memorable subject for consideration with what unconcern and gaiety mankind prick on along the valley of the shadow of death the whole way be one wilderness of snare and the end of it for those who fear the last pinch be irrevocable ruin and yet we go spin through it all like a party for the derby -lrb- 8 -rrb- perhaps the reader remember one of the humorous device of the deify caligulum : -lrb- 9 -rrb- how he encourage a vast concourse of holiday-maker on to he bridge over baia -lrb- 10 -rrb- bay and when they be in the height of they enjoyment turn loose the praetorian guard -lrb- 11 -rrb- among the company and have they toss into the sea this be no bad miniature of the dealings of nature with the transitory race of man only what a chequered picnic we have of it even while it last and into what great water not to be cross by any swimmer god 's pale praetorian throw we over in the end we live the time that a match flicker we pop the cork of a ginger-beer bottle and the earthquake swallow we on the instant be it not odd be it not incongruous be it not in the highest sense of human speech incredible that we should think so highly of the ginger-beer and regard so little the devour earthquake the love of life and the fear of death be two famous phrase that grow harder to understand the more we think about they it be a well-known fact that a immense proportion of boat accident would never happen if people hold the sheet in they hand instead of make it fast and yet unless it be some martinet of a professional mariner or some landsman with shattered nerve every one of god 's creature make it fast a strange instance of man 's unconcern and brazen boldness in the face of death we confound ourselves with metaphysical phrase which we import into daily talk with noble inappropriateness we have no idea of what death be apart from its circumstance and some of its consequence to other and although we have some experience of live there be not a man on earth who have fly so high into abstraction as to have any practical guess at the meaning of the word _ life _ all literature from job and omar khayyam to thoma carlyle or walt whitman -lrb- 12 -rrb- be but a attempt to look upon the human state with such largeness of view as shall enable we to rise from the consideration of live to the definition of life and we sage give we about the best satisfaction in they power when they say that it be a vapor or a show or make out of the same stuff with dream -lrb- 13 -rrb- philosophy in its more rigid sense have be at the same work for age and after a myriad bald head have wag over the problem and pile of word have be heap one upon another into dry and cloudy volume without end philosophy have the honor of lay before we with modest pride she contribution towards the subject : that life be a permanent possibility of sensation -lrb- 14 -rrb- truly a fine result a man may very well love beef or hunting or a woman but surely surely not a permanent possibility of sensation he may be afraid of a precipice or a dentist or a large enemy with a club or even a undertaker 's man but not certainly of abstract death we may trick with the word life in its dozen sens until we be weary of trick we may argue in term of all the philosophy on earth but one fact remain true throughout -- that we do not love life in the sense that we be greatly preoccupy about its conservation that we do not properly speak love life at all but live into the view of the least careful there will enter some degree of providence no man 's eye be fix entirely on the pass hour but although we have some anticipation of good health good weather wine active employment love and self-approval the sum of these anticipation do not amount to anything like a general view of life 's possibility and issue nor be those who cherish they most vividly at all the most scrupulous of they personal safety to be deeply interested in the accident of we existence to enjoy keenly the mixed texture of human experience rather lead a man to disregard precaution and risk he neck against a straw for surely the love of living be stronger in a alpine climber roping over a peril or a hunter ride merrily at a stiff fence than in a creature who live upon a diet and walk a measure distance in the interest of he constitution there be a great deal of very vile nonsense talk upon both side of the matter : tear divine reduce life to the dimension of a mere funeral procession so short as to be hardly decent and melancholy unbeliever yearning for the tomb as if it be a world too far away both side must feel a little ashamed of they performance now and again when they draw in they chair to dinner indeed a good meal and a bottle of wine be a answer to most standard work upon the question when a man 's heart warm to he viand he forget a great deal of sophistry and soar into a rosy zone of contemplation death may be knock at the door like the commander 's statue -lrb- 15 -rrb- we have something else in hand thank god and let he knock pass bell be ring all the world over all the world over and every hour -lrb- 16 -rrb- someone be parting company with all he ache and ecstasy for we also the trap be lay but we be so fond of life that we have no leisure to entertain the terror of death it be a honeymoon with we all through and none of the longest small blame to we if we give we whole heart to this glowing bride of ours to the appetite to honor to the hungry curiosity of the mind to the pleasure of the eye in nature and the pride of we own nimble body we all of we appreciate the sensation but as for care about the permanence of the possibility a man 's head be generally very bald and he sens very dull before he come to that whether we regard life as a lane lead to a dead wall -- a mere bag 's end -lrb- 17 -rrb- as the french say -- or whether we think of it as a vestibule or gymnasium where we wait we turn and prepare we faculty for some more noble destiny whether we thunder in a pulpit or pule in little atheistic poetry-book about its vanity and brevity whether we look justly for year of health and vigor or be about to mount into a bath-chair as a step towards the hearse in each and all of these view and situation there be but one conclusion possible : that a man should stop he ear against paralyse terror and run the race that be set before he with a single mind no one surely could have recoil with more heartache and terror from the thought of death than we respected lexicographer and yet we know how little it affect he conduct how wisely and boldly he walk and in what a fresh and lively vein he speak of life already a old man he venture on he highland tour and he heart bind with triple brass do not recoil before twenty-seven individual cup of tea -lrb- 18 -rrb- as courage and intelligence be the two quality best worth a good man 's cultivation so it be the first part of intelligence to recognize we precarious estate in life and the first part of courage to be not at all abashed before the fact a frank and somewhat headlong carriage not look too anxiously before not dally in maudlin regret over the past stamp the man who be well armored for this world and not only well armored for himself but a good friend and a good citizen to boot we do not go to coward for tender dealing there be nothing so cruel as panic the man who have least fear for he own carcass have most time to consider other that eminent chemist who take he walk abroad in tin shoe and subsist wholly upon tepid milk have all he work cut out for he in considerate dealings with he own digestion so soon as prudence have begin to

considerable than a halfpenny post card who would project a serial novel after thackeray and dickens have each fall in mid-course -lrb- 22 -rrb- who would find heart enough to begin to live if he dally with the consideration of death and after all what sorry and pitiful quibble all this be to forego all the issue of live in a parlor with a regulate temperature -- as if that be not to die a hundred time over and for ten year at a stretch as if it be not to die in one 's own lifetime and without even the sad immunity of death as if it be not to die and yet be the patient spectator of we own pitiable change the permanent possibility be preserved but the sensation carefully hold at arm 's length as if one keep a photographic plate in a dark chamber it be better to lose health like a

franklin there can be no fairer ambition than to excel in talk to be affable gay ready clear and welcome to have a fact a thought or a illustration pat to every subject and not only to cheer the flight of time among we intimate but bear we part in that great international congress always sit where public wrong be first declare public error first correct and the course of public opinion shaped day by day a little nearer to the right no measure come before parliament but it have be long ago prepare by the grand jury of the talker no book be write that have not be largely compose by they assistance literature in many of its branch be no other than the shadow of good talk but the imitation fall far short of the original in life freedom and effect there be always two to a talk give and take compare experience and accord conclusion talk be fluid tentative continually in further search and progress while write word remain fixed become idol even to the writer find wooden dogmatism and preserve fly of obvious error in the amber -lrb- 3 -rrb- of the truth last and chief while literature gag with linsey-woolsey can only deal with a fraction of the life of man talk go fancy free -lrb- 4 -rrb- and may call a spade a spade -lrb- 5 -rrb- it can not even if it would become merely aesthetic or merely classical like literature a jest intervene the solemn humbug be dissolve in laughter and speech run forth out of the contemporary groove into the open field of nature cheery and cheer like schoolboy out of school and it be in talk alone that we can learn we period and ourselves in short the first duty of a man be to speak that be he chief business in this world and talk which be the harmonious speech of two or more be by far the most accessible of pleasure it cost nothing in money it be all profit it complete we education found and foster we friendship and can be enjoy at any age and in almost any state of health the spice of life be battle the friendliest relation be still a kind of contest and if we would not forego all that be valuable in we lot we must continually face some other person eye to eye and wrestle a fall whether in love or enmity it be still by force of body or power of character or intellect that we attain to worthy pleasure man and woman contend for each other in the list of love like rival mesmerist the active and adroit decide they challenge in the sport of the body and the sedentary sit down to chess or conversation all sluggish and pacific pleasure be to the same degree solitary and selfish and every durable bond between human being be found in or heighten by some element of competition now the relation that have the least root in matter be undoubtedly that airy one of friendship and hence i suppose it be that good talk most commonly arise among friend talk be indeed both the scene and instrument of friendship it be in talk alone that the friend can measure strength and enjoy that amicable counter-assertion of personality which be the gauge of relation and the sport of life a good talk be not to be have for the ask humor must first be accord in a kind of overture or prologue hour company and circumstance be suit and then at a fit juncture the subject the quarry of two heated mind spring up like a deer out of the wood not that the talker have any of the hunter 's pride though he have all and more than all he ardor the genuine artist follow the stream of conversation as a angler follow the winding of a brook not dally where he fail to kill he trust implicitly to hazard and he be reward by continual variety continual pleasure and those change prospects of the truth that be the best of education there be nothing in a subject so call that we should regard it as a idol or follow it beyond the prompting of desire indeed there be few subject and so far as they be truly talkable more than the half of they may be reduce to three : that i be i that you be you and that there be other people dimly understand to be not quite the same as either wherever talk may range it still run half the time on these eternal line the theme be set each play on himself as on a instrument assert and justify himself ransack he brain for instance and opinion and bring they forth new-minted to he own surprise and the admiration of he adversary all natural talk be a festival of ostentation and by the law of the game each accept and fan the vanity of the other it be from that reason that we venture to lay ourselves so open that we dare to be so warmly eloquent and that we swell in each other 's eye to such a vast proportion for talker once launch begin to overflow the limit of they ordinary self tower up to the height of they secret pretension and give themselves out for the hero brave pious musical and wise that in they most shine moment they aspire to be so they weave for themselves with word and for a while inhabit a palace of delight temple at once and theater where they fill the round of the world 's dignity and feast with the god exult in kudos and when the talk be over each go he way still flush with vanity and admiration still trail cloud of glory -lrb- 6 -rrb- each decline from the height of he ideal orgie not in a moment but by slow declension i remember in the _ entr ` acte _ of a afternoon performance come forth into the sunshine in a beautiful green garden corner of a romantic city and as i sit and smoke the music move in my blood i seem to sit there and evaporate _ the fly dutchman _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- for it be that i have be hear -rrb- with a wonderful sense of life warmth well-being and pride and the noise of the city voice bell and march foot fall together in my ear like a symphonious orchestra in the same way the excitement of a good talk life for a long while after in the blood the heart still hot within you the brain still simmer and the physical earth swim around you with the color of the sunset natural talk like plough should turn up a large surface of life rather than dig mine into geological stratum mass of experience anecdote incident cross-light quotation historical instance the whole flotsam and jetsam of two mind force in and in upon the matter in hand from every point of the compass and from every degree of mental elevation and abasement -- these be the material with which talk be fortify the food on which the talker thrive such argument as be proper to the exercise should still be brief and seize talk should proceed by instance by the apposite not the expository it should keep close along the line of humanity near the bosom and business of man at the level where history fiction and experience intersect and illuminate each other i be i and you be you with all my heart but conceive how these lean proposition change and brighten when instead of word the actual you and i sit cheek by jowl the spirit house in the live body and the very clothes utter voice to corroborate the story in the face not less surprising be the change when we leave off to speak of generality -- the bad the good the miser and all the character of theophrastus -lrb- 8 -rrb- -- and call up other man by anecdote or instance in they very trick and feature or trading on a common knowledge toss each other famous name still glowing with the hue of life communication be no longer by word but by the instancing of whole biography epic system of philosophy and epoch of history in bulk that which be understand excel that which be speak in quantity and quality alike idea thus figure and personify change hand as we may say like coin and the speaker imply without effort the most obscure and intricate thought stranger who have a large common ground of reading will for this reason come the sooner to the grapple of genuine converse if they know othello and napoleon consuelo and clarissa harlowe vautrin and steenie steenson -lrb- 9 -rrb- they can leave generality and begin at once to speak by figure conduct and art be the two subject that arise most frequently and that embrace the widest range of fact a few pleasure bear discussion for they own sake but only those which be most social or most radically human and even these can only be discuss among they devotee a technicality be always welcome to the expert whether in athletics art or law i have hear the best kind of talk on technicality from such rare and happy person as both know and love they business no human being -lrb- 10 -rrb- ever speak of scenery for above two minute at a time which make I suspect we hear too much of it in literature the weather be regard as the very nadir and scoff of conversational topic and yet the weather the dramatic element in scenery be far more tractable in language and far more human both in import and suggestion than the stable feature of the landscape sailor and shepherd and the people generally of coast and mountain talk well of it and it be often excitingly present in literature but the tendency of all live talk draw it back and back into the common focus of humanity talk be a creature of the street and market-place feeding on gossip and its last resort be still in a discussion on moral that be the heroic form of gossip heroic in virtue of its high pretension but still gossip because it turn on personality you can keep no man long nor scotchman -lrb- 11 -rrb- at all off moral or theological discussion these be to all the world what law be to lawyer they be everybody 's technicality the medium through which all consider life and the dialect in which they express they judgment i know three young man who walk together daily for some two month in a solemn and beautiful forest and in cloudless summer weather daily they talk with unabated zest and yet scarce wander that whole time beyond two subject -- theology and love and perhaps neither a court of love -lrb- 12 -rrb- nor a assembly of divine would have grant they premise or welcome they conclusion conclusion indeed be not often reach by talk any more than by private thinking that be not the profit the profit be in the exercise and above all in the experience for when we reason at large on any subject we review we state and history in life from time to time however and specially i think in talk art talk become effective conquer like war widen the boundary of knowledge like a exploration a point arise the question take a problematical a baffling yet a likely air the talker begin to feel lively presentiment of some conclusion near at hand towards this they strive with emulous ardor each by he own path and struggle for first utterance and then one leap upon the summit of that matter with a shout and almost at the same moment the other be beside he and behold they be agree like enough the progress be illusory a mere cat 's cradle have be wind and unwind out of word but the sense of joint discovery be none the less giddy and inspiring and in the life of the talker such triumph though imaginary be neither few nor far apart they be attain with speed and pleasure in the hour of mirth and by the nature of the process they be always worthily share there be a certain attitude combative at once and deferential eager to fight yet most averse to quarrel which mark out at once the talkable man it be not eloquence not fairness not obstinacy but a certain proportion of all of these that i love to encounter in my amicable adversary they must not be pontiff hold doctrine but huntsman quest after element of truth neither must they be boy to be instruct but fellow-teacher with whom i may wrangle and agree on equal term we must reach some solution some shadow of consent for without that eager talk become a torture but we do not wish to reach it cheaply or quickly or without the tussle and effort wherein pleasure lie the very best talker with I be one whom i shall call spring-heel would jack -lrb- 13 -rrb- i say so because i never know anyone who mingle so largely the possible ingredient of converse in the spanish proverb the fourth man necessary to compound a salad be a madman to mix it : jack be that madman i know not what be more remarkable the insane lucidity of he conclusion the humorous eloquence of he language or he power of method bring the whole of life into the focus of the subject treated mix the conversational salad like a drunken god he double like the serpent change and flash like the shake kaleidoscope transmigrate bodily into the view of other and so in the twinkling of a eye and with a heady rapture turn question inside out and fling they empty before you on the ground like a triumphant conjuror it be my common practice when a piece of conduct puzzle I to attack it in the presence of jack with such grossness such partiality and such wear iteration as at length shall spur he up in its defense in a moment he transmigrate don the required character and with moonstruck philosophy justify the act in question i can fancy nothing to compare with the _ vim _ of these impersonation the strange scale of language fly from shakespeare to kant and from kant to major dyngwell -lrb- 14 -rrb- -- as fast as a musician scatter sound out of a instrument -- the sudden sweeping generalisation the absurd irrelevant particularity the wit wisdom folly humor eloquence and bathos each startling in its kind and yet all luminous in the admire disorder of they combination a talker of a different calibre though belong to the same school be burly -lrb- 15 -rrb- burly be a man of great presence he command a larger atmosphere give the impression of a grosser mass of character than most man it have be say of he that he presence could be feel in a room you enter blindfold and the same i think have be say of other powerful constitution condemn to much physical inaction there be something boisterous and piratic in burly 's manner of talk which suit well enough with this impression he will roar you down he will bury he face in he hand he will undergo passion of revolt and agony and meanwhile he attitude of mind be really both conciliatory and receptive and after pistol have be out-pistol would -lrb- 16 -rrb- and the welkin ring for hour you begin to perceive a certain subsidence in these spring torrent point of agreement issue and you end arm-in-arm and in a glow of mutual admiration the outcry only serve to make you final union the more unexpected and precious throughout there have be perfect sincerity perfect intelligence a desire to hear although not always to listen and a unaffected eagerness to meet concession you have with burly none of the danger that attend debate with spring-heel would jack who may at any moment turn he power of transmigration on yourself create for you a view you never hold and then furiously fall on you for hold it these at least be my two favorite and both be loud copious intolerant talker this argue that i myself be in the same category for if we love talk at all we love a bright fierce adversary who will hold he ground foot by foot in much we own manner sell he attention dearly and give we we full measure of the dust and exertion of battle both these man can be beat from a position but it take six hour to do it a high and hard adventure worth attempt with both you can pass day in a enchanted country of the mind with people scenery and manners of its own live a life apart more arduous active and glowing than any real existence and come forth again when the talk be over as out of a theater or a dream to find the east wind still blow and the chimney-pot of the old battered city still around you jack have the far finer mind burly the far more honest jack give we the animated poetry burly the romantic prose of similar theme the one glance high like a meteor and make a light in darkness the other with many change hue of fire burn at the sea-level like a conflagration but both have the same humor and artistic interest the same unquenched ardor in pursuit the same gust of talk and thunderclap of contradiction cockshot -lrb- 17 -rrb- be a different article but vastly entertaining and have be meat and drink to I for many a long evening he manner be dry brisk and pertinacious and the choice of word not much the point about he be he extraordinary readiness and spirit you can propound nothing but he have either a theory about it ready-made or will have one instantly on the stock and proceed to lay its timber and launch it in you presence let I see he will say give I a moment i _ should _ have some theory for that a blither spectacle than the vigor with which he set about the task it be hard to fancy he be possess by a demoniac energy welding the element for he life and bend idea as a athlete bend a horseshoe with a visible and lively effort he have in theorise a compass a art what i would call the synthetic gusto something of a herbert spencer -lrb- 18 -rrb- who should see the fun of the thing you be not bind and no more be he to place you faith in these brand-new opinion but some of they be right enough durable even for life and the poorest serve for a cock-shy -- as when idle people after picnic float a bottle on a pond and have a hour 's diversion ere it sink whichever they be serious opinion or humor of the moment he still defend he venture with indefatigable wit and spirit hit savagely himself but take punishment like a man he know and never forget that people talk first of all for the sake of talk conduct himself in the ring to use the old slang like a thorough glutton -lrb- 19 -rrb- and honestly enjoy a tell facer from he adversary cockshot be bottled effervescency the swear foe of sleep three-in-the-morning cockshot say a victim he talk be like the driest of all imaginable dry champagne sleight of hand and inimitable quickness be the quality by which he live athelred -lrb- 20 -rrb- on the other hand present you with the spectacle of a sincere and somewhat slow nature think aloud he be the most unready man i ever know to shine in conversation you may see he sometimes wrestle with a refractory jest for a minute or two together and perhaps fail to throw it in the end and there be something singularly engage often instructive in the simplicity with which he thus expose the process as well as the result the work as well as the dial of the clock withal he have he hour of inspiration apt word come to he as if by accident and come from deeper down they smack the more personally they have the more of fine old crusted humanity rich in sediment and humor there be saying of he in which he have stamp himself into the very grain of the language you would think he must have wear the word next he skin and sleep with they yet it be not as a sayer of particular good thing that athelr be most to be regard rather as the stalwart woodman of thought i have pull on a light cord often enough while he have be wield the broad-axe and between we on this unequal division many a specious fallacy have fall i have know he to battle the same question night after night for year keep it in the reign of talk constantly apply it and re-apply it to life with humorous or grave intention and all the while never hurry nor flagging nor take a unfair advantage of the fact jack at a give moment when arise as it be from the tripod can be more radiantly just to those from whom he differ but then the tenor of he thought be even calumnious while athelr slower to forge excuse be yet slower to condemn and sit over the welter of the world vacillate but still judicial and still faithfully contend with he doubt both the last talker deal much in point of conduct and religion study in the dry light -lrb- 21 -rrb- of prose indirectly and as if against he will the same element from time to time appear in the troubled and poetic talk of opalstein -lrb- 22 -rrb- he various and exotic knowledge complete although unready sympathy and fine full discriminative flow of language fit he out to be the best of talker so perhaps he be with some not _ quite _ with I -- _ proxime accessit _ -lrb- 23 -rrb- i should say he sing the praise of the earth and the art flower and jewel wine and music in a moonlight serenade manner as to the light guitar even wisdom come from he tongue like singing no one be indeed more tuneful in the upper note but even while he sing the song of the siren he still hearken to the bark of the sphinx jarring byronic note interrupt the flow of he horatian humor he mirth have something of the tragedy of the world for its perpetual background and he feast like don giovannus to a double orchestra one lightly sound for the dance one peal beethoven -lrb- 24 -rrb- in the distance he be not truly reconcile either with life or with himself and this instant war in he member sometimes divide the man 's attention he do not always perhaps not often frankly surrender himself in conversation he bring into the talk other thought than those which he express you be conscious that he keep a eye on something else that he do not shake off the world nor quite forget himself hence arise occasional disappointment even a occasional unfairness for he companion who find themselves one day give too much and the next when they be wary out of season give perhaps too little purcel -lrb- 25 -rrb- be in another class from any i have mention he be no debater but appear in conversation as occasion rise in two distinct character one of which i admire and fear and the other love in the first he be radiantly civil and rather silent sit on a high courtly hilltop and from that vantage-ground drop you he remark like favor he seem not to share in we sublunary contention he wear no sign of interest when on a sudden there fall in a crystal of wit so polished that the dull do not perceive it but so right that the sensitive be silence true talk should have more body and blood should be louder vainer and more declaratory of the man the true talker should not hold so steady a advantage over whom he speak with and that be one reason out of a score why i prefer my purcel in he second character when he unbend into a strain of graceful gossip singing like the fireside kettle in these mood he have a elegant homeliness that ring of the true queen anne i know another person -lrb- 26 -rrb- who attain in he moment to the insolence of a restoration comedy speaking i declare as congreve -lrb- 27 -rrb- write but that be a sport of nature and scarce fall under the rubric for there be none alas to give he answer one last remark occur : it be the mark of genuine conversation that the saying can scarce be quote with they full effect beyond the circle of common friend to have they proper weight they should appear in a biography and with the portrait of the speaker good talk be dramatic it be like a impromptu piece of act where each should represent himself to the greatest advantage and that be the best kind of talk where each speaker be most fully and candidly himself and where if you be to shift the speech round from one to another there would be the greatest loss in significance and perspicuity it be for this reason that talk depend so wholly on we company we should like to introduce falstaff and mercutio or falstaff and sir toby but falstaff in talk with cordelium seem even painful most of we by the protean -lrb- 28 -rrb- quality of man can talk to some degree with all but the true talk that strike out all the slumber best of we come only with the peculiar brethren of we spirit be found as deep as love in the constitution of we be and be a thing to relish with all we energy while yet we have it and to be grateful for forever ii -lrb- 29 -rrb- in the last paper there be perhaps too much about mere debate and there be nothing say at all about that kind of talk which be merely luminous and restful a higher power of silence the quiet of the evening share by ruminate friend there be something aside from personal preference to be allege in support of this omission those who be no chimney-cornerer who rejoice in the social thunderstorm have a ground in reason for they choice they get little rest indeed but restfulness be a quality for cattle the virtue be all active life be alert and it be in repose that man prepare themselves for evil on the other hand they be bruise into a knowledge of themselves and other they have in a high degree the fencer 's pleasure in dexterity display and prove what they get they get upon life 's term pay for it as they go and once the talk be launch they be assure of honest deal from a adversary eager like themselves the aboriginal man within we the cave-dweller still lusty as when he fight tooth and nail for root and berry scent this kind of equal battle from afar it be like he old primaeval day upon the crag a return to the sincerity of savage life from the comfortable fiction of the civilised and if it be delightful to the old man it be none the less profitable to he younger brother the conscientious gentleman i feel never quite sure of you urbane and smile coterie i fear they indulge a man 's vanity in silence suffer he to encroach encourage he on to be a ass and send he forth again not merely contemn for the moment but radically more contemptible than when he enter but if i have a flush bluster fellow for my opposite bent on carry a point my vanity be sure to have its ear rub once at least in the course of the debate he will not spare I when we differ he will not fear to demonstrate my folly to my face for many nature there be not much charm in the still chambered society the circle of bland countenance the digestive silence the admire remark the flutter of affectionate approval they demand more atmosphere and exercise a gale upon they spirit as we pious ancestor would phrase it to have they wit well breathe in a uproarious valhallum -lrb- 30 -rrb- and i suspect that the choice give they character and fault be one to be defend the purely wise be silence by fact they talk in a clear atmosphere problem lie around they like a view in nature if they can be show to be somewhat in the wrong they digest the reproof like a thrashing and make better intellectual blood they stand correct by a whisper a word or a glance remind they of the great eternal law but it be not so with all other in conversation seek rather contact with they fellow-men than increase of knowledge or clarity of think the drama not the philosophy of life be the sphere of they intellectual activity even when they pursue truth they desire as much as possible of what we may call human scenery along the road they follow they dwell in the heart of life the blood sound in they ear they eye lay hold of what delight they with a brutal avidity that make they blind to all besides they interest rivet on people live loving talk tangible people to a man of this description the sphere of argument seem very pale and ghostly by a strong expression a perturb countenance flood of tear a insult which he conscience oblige he to swallow he be bring round to knowledge which no syllogism would have convey to he he own experience be so vivid he be so superlatively conscious of himself that if day after day he be allow to hector and hear nothing but approve echo he will lose he hold on the soberness of thing and take himself in earnest for a god talk might be to such a one the very way of moral ruin the school where he might learn to be at once intolerable and ridiculous this character be perhaps commoner than philosopher suppose and for person of that stamp to learn much by conversation they must speak with they superior not in intellect for that be a superiority that must be prove but in station if they can not find a friend to bully they for they good they must find either a old man a woman or some one so far below they in the artificial order of society that courtesy may be particularly exercise the best teacher be the aged to the old we mouth be always partly close we must swallow we obvious retort and listen they sit above we head on life 's raise dais and appeal at once to we respect and pity a flavor of the old school a touch of something different in they manner -- which be freer and rounder if they come of what be call a good family and often more timid and precise if they be of the middle class -- serve in these day to accentuate the difference of age and add a distinction to gray hair but they superiority be found more deeply than by outward mark or gesture they be before we in the march of man they have more or less solve the irk problem they have battle through the equinox of life in good and evil they have hold they course and now without open shame they near the crown and harbor it may be we have be strike with one of fortune 's dart we can scarce be civil so cruelly be we spirit toss yet long before we be so much as think upon the like calamity befall the old man or woman that now with pleasant humor rally we upon we inattention sit compose in the holy evening of man 's life in the clear shine after rain we grow ashamed of we distress new and hot and coarse like villainous roadside brandy we see life in aerial perspective under the heaven of faith and out of the worst in the mere presence of contented elder look forward and take patience fear shrink before they like a thing reprove not the flitting and ineffectual fear of death but the instant dwelling terror of the responsibility and revenge of life they speech indeed be timid they report lion in the path they counsel a meticulous -lrb- 31 -rrb- footing but they serene mar face be more eloquent and tell another story where they have go we will go also not very greatly fear what they have endure unbroken we also god help we will make a shift to bear not only be the presence of the aged in itself remedial but they mind be store with antidote wisdom 's simple plain consideration overlook by youth they have matter to communicate be they never so stupid they talk be not merely literature it be great literature classic in virtue of the speaker 's detachment stud like a book of travel with thing we should not otherwise have learn in virtue i have say of the speaker 's detachment -- and this be why of two old man the one who be not you father speak to you with the more sensible authority for in the paternal relation the oldest have lively interest and remain still young thus i have know two young man great friend each swear by the other 's father the father of each swear by the other lad and yet each pair of parent and child be perpetually by the ear this be typical : it read like the germ of some kindly -lrb- 32 -rrb- comedy the old appear in conversation in two character : the critically silent and the garrulous anecdotic the last be perhaps what we look for it be perhaps the more instructive a old gentleman well on in year sit handsomely and naturally in the bow-window of he age scanning experience with revert eye and chirping and smile communicate the accident and read the lesson of he long career opinion be strengthened indeed but they be also weed out in the course of year what remain steadily present to the eye of the retire veteran in he hermitage what still minister to he content what still quicken he old honest heart -- these be the real long-lived thing -lrb- 33 -rrb- that whitman tell we to prefer where youth agree with age not where they differ wisdom lie and it be when the young disciple find he heart to beat in tune with he grey-bearded teacher 's that a lesson may be learn i have know one old gentleman whom i may name for he be now gather to he stock -- robert hunter sheriff of dumbarton -lrb- 34 -rrb- and author of a excellent law-book still re-edited and republish whether he be originally big or little be more than i can guess when i know he he be all fall away and fall in crooked and shrunken buckle into a stiff waistcoat for support trouble by ailment which keep he hobble in and out of the room one foot gouty a wig for decency not for deception on he head close shave except under he chin -- and for that he never fail to apologise for it go sore against the tradition of he life you can imagine how he would fare in a novel by miss mather -lrb- 35 -rrb- yet this rag of a chelsea -lrb- 36 -rrb- veteran live to he last year in the plenitude of all that be best in man brim with human kindness and staunch as a roman soldier under he manifold infirmity you could not say that he have lose he memory for he would repeat shakespeare and webster and jeremy taylor and burke -lrb- 37 -rrb- by the page together but the parchment be fill up there be no room for fresh inscription and he be capable of repeat the same anecdote on many successive visit he voice survive in its full power and he take a pride in use it on he last voyage as commissioner of lighthouse he hail a ship at sea and make himself clearly audible without a speaking trumpet ruff the while with a proper vanity in he achievement he have a habit of eke out he word with interrogative hem which be puzzling and a little wearisome suit ill with he appearance and seem a survival from some former stage of bodily portliness of yore when he be a great pedestrian and no enemy to good claret he may have point with these minute gun he allocution to the bench he humor be perfectly equable set

or any of the passion that debase a life so honest and compose a soul like a ancient violin so subdue to harmony respond to a touch in music -- as in that dining-room with mr hunter chat at the eleventh hour under the shadow of eternity fearless and gentle the second class of old people be not anecdotic they be rather hearer than talker listen to the young with a amuse and critical attention to have this sort of intercourse to perfection i think we must go to old lady woman be better hearer than man to begin with they learn i fear in anguish to bear with the tedious and infantile vanity of the other sex and we will take more from a woman than even from the oldest man in the way of bite comment bite comment be the chief part whether for profit or amusement in this business the old lady that i have in my eye be a very caustic speaker she tongue after year of practice in absolute command whether for silence or attack if she chance to dislike you you will be tempt to curse the malignity of age but if you chance to please even slightly you will be listen to with a particular laughing grace of sympathy and from time to time chastise as if in play with a parasol as heavy as a pole-axe it require a singular art as well as the vantage-ground of age to deal these stunning correction among the coxcomb of the young the pill be disguise in sugar of wit it be administer as a compliment -- if you have not pleased you would not have be censure it be a personal affair -- a hyphen _ a trait d'union _ -lrb- 45 -rrb- between you and you censor age 's philander for she pleasure and you good incontestably the young man feel very much of a fool but he must be a perfect malvolio -lrb- 46 -rrb- sick with self-love if he can not take a open buffet and still smile the correction of silence be what kill when you know you have transgress and you friend say nothing and avoid you eye if a man be make of gutta-percha he heart would quail at such a moment but when the word be out the worst be over and a fellow with any good-humour at all may pass through a perfect hail of witty criticism every bare place on he soul hit to the quick with a shrewd missile and reappear as if after a dive tingle with a fine moral reaction and ready with a shrink readiness one-third loath for a repetition of the discipline there be few woman not well sun and ripen and perhaps toughen who can thus stand apart from a man and say the true thing with a kind of genial cruelty still there be some -- and i doubt if there be any man who can return the compliment the class of man represent by vernon whitford in _ the egoist _ -lrb- 47 -rrb- say indeed the true thing but he say it stockishly vernon be a noble fellow and make by the way a noble and instructive contrast to daniel deronda he conduct be the conduct of a man of honor but we agree with he against we conscience when he remorsefully consider its astonishing dryness he be the best of man but the best of woman manage to combine all that and something more they very fault assist they they be help even by the falseness of they position in life they can retire into the fortify camp of the propriety they can touch a subject and suppress it the most adroit employ a somewhat elaborate reserve as a means to be frank much as they wear glove when they shake hand but a man have the full responsibility of he freedom can not evade a question can scarce be silent without rudeness must answer for he word upon the moment and be not seldom leave face to face with a damning choice between the more or less dishonourable wriggle of deronda and the downright woodenness of vernon whitford but the superiority of woman be perpetually menaced they do not sit thron on infirmity like the old they be suitor as well as sovereign they vanity be engage they affection be too apt to follow and hence much of the talk between the sex degenerate into something unworthy of the name the desire to please to shine with a certain softness of lustre and to draw a fascinating picture of oneself banish from conversation all that be sterling and most of what be humorous as soon as a strong current of mutual admiration begin to flow the human interest triumph entirely over the intellectual and the commerce of word consciously or not become secondary to the commercing of eye but even where this ridiculous danger be avoid and a man and woman converse equally and honestly something in they nature or they education falsify the strain a instinct prompt they to agree and where that be impossible to agree to differ should they neglect the warning at the first suspicion of a argument they find themselves in different hemisphere about any point of business or conduct any actual affair demand settlement a woman will speak and listen hear and answer argument not only with natural wisdom but with candor and logical honesty but if the subject of debate be something in the air a abstraction a excuse for talk a logical aunt sally then may the male debater instantly abandon hope he may employ reason adduce fact be supple be smile be angry all shall avail he nothing what the woman say first that -lrb- unless she have forget it -rrb- she will repeat at the end hence at the very juncture when a talk between man grow brighter and quicker and begin to promise to bear fruit talk between the sex be menace with dissolution the point of difference the point of interest be evade by the brilliant woman under a shower of irrelevant conversational rocket it be bridge by the discreet woman with a rustle of silk as she pass smoothly forward to the nearest point of safety and this sort of prestidigitation juggle the dangerous topic out of sight until it can be reintroduce with safety in a altered shape be a piece of tactic among the true drawing-room queen the drawing-room be indeed a artificial place it be so by we choice and for we sin the subjection of woman the ideal impose upon they from the cradle and wear like a hair-shirt with so much constancy they motherly superior tenderness to man 's vanity and self-importance they managing art -- the art of a civilised slave among good-natured barbarian -- be all painful ingredient and all help to falsify relation it be not till we get clear of that amusing artificial scene that genuine relation be found or idea honestly compare in the garden on the road or the hillside or _ tête-à-tête _ and apart from interruption occasion arise when we may learn much from any single woman and nowhere more often than in married life marriage be one long conversation chequer by dispute the dispute be valueless they but ingrain the difference the heroic heart of woman prompt she at once to nail she color to the mast but in the interval almost unconsciously and with no desire to shine the whole material of life be turn over and over idea be strike out and share the two person more and more adapt they notion one to suit the other and in process of time without

fit to be call by the name of read the process itself should be absorb and voluptuous we should gloat over a book be rapt clean out of ourselves and rise from the perusal we mind fill with the busiest kaleidoscopic dance of image incapable of sleep or of continuous think the word if the book be eloquent should run thence-forward in we ear like the noise of breaker and the story if it be a story repeat itself in a thousand color picture to the eye it be for this last pleasure that we read so closely and love we book so dearly in the bright troubled period of boyhood eloquence and think character and conversation be but obstacle to brush aside as we dig blithely after a certain sort of incident like a pig for truffle -lrb- 1 -rrb- for my part i like a story to begin with a old wayside inn where towards the close of the year 17 -- several gentleman in three-cocked hat be play bowl a friend of mine prefer the malabar coast -lrb- 2 -rrb- in a storm with a ship beat to windward and a scowling fellow of herculean proportion stride along the beach he to be sure be a pirate this be further afield than my home-keeping fancy loved to travel and design altogether for a larger canvas than the tale that i affect give I a highwayman and i be full to the brim a jacobite -lrb- 3 -rrb- would do but the highwayman be my favorite dish i can still hear that merry clatter of the hoof along the moonlit lane night and the come of day be still relate in my mind with the doings of john rann or jerry abershaw -lrb- 4 -rrb- and the word postchaise the great north road -lrb- 5 -rrb- ostler and nag still sound in my ear like poetry one and all at least and each with he particular fancy we read story-book in childhood not for eloquence or character or thought but for some quality of the brute incident that quality be not mere bloodshed or wonder although each of these be welcome in its place the charm for the sake of which we read depend on something different from either my elder use to read novel aloud and i can still remember four different passage which i hear before i be ten with the same keen and lasting pleasure one i discover long afterwards to be the admirable opening of _ what will he do with it _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- it be no wonder i be please with that the other three still remain unidentified one be a little vague it be about a dark tall house at night and people grope on the stair by the light that escape from the open door of a sickroom in another a lover leave a ball and go walk in a cool dewy park whence he could watch the light window and the figure of the dancer as they move this be the most sentimental impression i think i have yet receive for a child be somewhat deaf to the sentimental in the last a poet who have be tragically wrangle with he wife walk forth on the sea-beach on a tempestuous night and witness the horror of a wreck -lrb- 7 -rrb- different as they be all these early favorite have a common note -- they have all a touch of the romantic drama be the poetry of conduct romance the poetry of circumstance the pleasure that we take in life be of two sort -- the active and the passive now we be conscious of a great command over we destiny anon we be lift up by circumstance as by a break wave and dash we know not how into the future now we be please by we conduct anon merely please by we surroundings it would be hard to say which of these mode of satisfaction be the more effective but the latter be surely the more constant conduct be three part of life -lrb- 8 -rrb- they say but i think they put it high there be a vast deal in life and letter both which be not immoral but simply a-moral which either do not regard the human will at all or deal with it in obvious and healthy relation where the interest turn not upon what a man shall choose to do but on how he manage to do it not on the passionate slip and hesitation of the conscience but on the problem of the body and of the practical intelligence in clean open-air adventure the shock of arm or the diplomacy of life with such material as this it be impossible to build a play for the serious theater exist solely on moral grounds and be a standing proof of the dissemination of the human conscience but it be possible to build upon this ground the most joyous of verse and the most lively beautiful and buoyant tale one thing in life call for another there be a fitness in event and place the sight of a pleasant arbor -lrb- 9 -rrb- put it in we mind to sit there one place suggest work another idleness a third early rising and long ramble in the dew the effect of night of any flow water of light city of the peep of day of ship of the open ocean call up in the mind a army of anonymous desire and pleasure something we feel should happen we know not what yet we proceed in quest of it and many of the happiest hour of life fleet by we in this vain attendance on the genius of the place and moment it be thus that tract of young fir and low rock that reach into deep sounding particularly torture and delight I something must have happen in such place and perhaps age back to member of my race when i be a child i try in vain to invent appropriate game for they as i still try just as vainly to fit they with the proper story some place speak distinctly certain dank garden cry aloud for a murder certain old house demand to be haunt certain coast be set apart for ship-wreck other spot again seem to abide they destiny suggestive and impenetrable miching mallecho -lrb- 10 -rrb- the inn at burford bridge -lrb- 11 -rrb- with its arbor and green garden and silent eddy river -- though it be know already as the place where keat write some of he _ endymion _ and nelson part from he emma -- still seem to wait the come of the appropriate legend within these ivied wall behind these old green shutter some further business smoulder wait for its hour the old hawe inn at the queen 's ferry make a similar call upon my fancy there it stand apart from the town beside the pier in a climate of its own half inland half marine -- in front the ferry bubble with the tide and the guard-ship swinging to she anchor behind the old garden with the tree american seek it already for the sake of lovel and oldbuck who dine there at the beginning of the _ antiquary _ but you need not tell I -- that be not all there be some story unrecorded or not yet complete which must express the meaning of that inn more fully so it be with name and face so it be with incident that be idle and inconclusive in themselves and yet seem like the beginning of some quaint romance which the all-careless author leave untold how many of these romance have we not see determine at they birth how many people have meet we with a look of meaning in they eye and sink at once into trivial acquaintance to how many place have we not draw near with express intimation -- here my destiny await I -- and we have but dine there and pass on i have live both at the hawe and burford in a perpetual flutter on the heel as it seem of some adventure that should justify the place but though the feeling have I to bed at night and call I again at morning in one unbroken round of pleasure and suspense nothing befall I in either worth remark the man or the hour have not yet come but some day i think a boat shall put off from the queen 's ferry fraught with a dear cargo and some frosty night a horseman on a tragic errand rattle with he whip upon the green shutter of the inn at burford -lrb- 12 -rrb- now this be one of the natural appetite with which any lively literature have to count the desire for knowledge i have almost add the desire for meat be not more deeply seat than this demand for fit and striking incident the dullest of clown tell or try to tell himself a story as the feeblest of child use invention in he play and even as the imaginative grow person join in the game at once enrich it with many delightful circumstance the great creative writer show we the realisation and the apotheosis of the day-dream of common man he story may be nourish with the reality of life but they true mark be to satisfy the nameless longing of the reader and to obey the ideal law of the day-dream the right kind of thing should fall out in the right kind of place the right kind of thing should follow and not only the character talk aptly and think naturally but all the circumstance in a tale answer one to another like note in music the thread of a story come from time to time together and make a picture in the web the character fall from time to time into some attitude to each other or to nature which stamp the story home like a illustration crusoe -lrb- 13 -rrb- recoil from the footprint achille shout over against the trojan ulyss bend the great bow christian run with he finger in he ear these be each culminate moment in the legend and each have be print on the mind 's eye forever other thing we may forget we may forget the word although they be beautiful we may forget the author 's comment although perhaps it be ingenious and true but these epoch-making scene which put the last mark of truth upon a story and fill up at one blow we capacity for sympathetic pleasure we so adopt into the very bosom of we mind that neither time nor tide can efface or weaken the impression this then be the plastic part of literature : to embody character thought or emotion in some act or attitude that shall be remarkably striking to the mind 's eye this be the highest and hardest thing to do in word the thing which once accomplish equally delight the schoolboy and the sage and make in its own right the quality of epic compare with this all other purpose in literature except the purely lyrical or the purely philosophic be bastard in nature facile of execution and feeble in result it be one thing to write about the inn at burford or to describe scenery with the word-painter it be quite another to seize on the heart of the suggestion and make a country famous with a legend it be one thing to remark and to dissect with the most cut logic the complication of life and of the human spirit it be quite another to give they body and blood in the story of ajax -lrb- 14 -rrb- or of hamlet the first be literature but the second be something besides for it be likewise art english people of the present day -lrb- 15 -rrb- be apt i know not why to look somewhat down on incident and reserve they admiration for the clink of teaspoon and the accent of the curate it be think clever to write a novel with no story at all or at least with a very dull one reduce even to the lowest term a certain interest can be communicate by the art of narrative a sense of human kinship stir and a kind of monotonous fitness comparable to the word and air of _ sandy 's mull _ preserve among the infinitesimal occurrence record some people work in this manner with even a strong touch mr trollope 's inimitable clergyman naturally arise to the mind in this connection but even mr trollope -lrb- 16 -rrb- do not confine himself to chronicle small beer mr crawley 's collision with the bishop 's wife mr melnette dally in the desert banquet-room be typical incident epically conceive fitly embody a crisis or again look at thackeray if rawdon crawley 's blow be not deliver _ vanity fair _ would cease to be a work of art that scene be the chief ganglion of the tale and the discharge of energy from rawdon 's fist be the reward and consolation of the reader the end of _ esmond _ be a yet wider excursion from the author 's customary field the scene at castlewood be pure duma -lrb- 17 -rrb- the great and wily english borrower have here borrow from the great unblushing french thief as usual he have borrow admirably well and the breaking of the sword round off the best of all he book with a manly martial note but perhaps nothing can more strongly illustrate the necessity for mark incident than to compare the living fame of _ robinson crusoe _ with the discredit of _ clarissa harlowe _ -lrb- 18 -rrb- _ clarissa _ be a book of a far more startling import work out on a great canvas with inimitable courage and unflagging art it contain wit character passion plot conversation full of spirit and insight letter sparkling with unstrained humanity and if the death of the heroine be somewhat frigid and artificial the last day of the hero strike the only note of what we now call byronism -lrb- 19 -rrb- between the elizabethan and byron himself and yet a little story of a ship-wrecked sailor with not a tenth part of the style nor a thousandth part of the wisdom explore none of the arcana of humanity and deprive of the perennial interest of love go on from edition to edition ever young while _ clarissa _ lie upon the shelf unread a friend of mine a welsh blacksmith be twenty-five year old and could neither read nor write when he hear a chapter of _ robinson _ read aloud in a farm kitchen up to that moment he have sit content huddle in he ignorance but he leave that farm another man there be day-dream it appear divine day-dream write and print and bind and to be buy for money and enjoy at pleasure down he sit that day painfully learn to read welsh and return to borrow the book it have be lose nor could he find another copy but one that be in english down he sit once more learn english and at length and with entire delight read _ robinson _ it be like the story of a love-chase if he have hear a letter from _ clarissa _ would he have be fire with the same chivalrous ardor i wonder yet _ clarissa _ have every quality that can be show in prose one alone except -- pictorial or picture-making romance while _ robinson _ depend for the most part and with the overwhelming majority of its reader on the charm of circumstance in the highest achievement of the art of word the dramatic and the pictorial the moral and romantic interest rise and fall together by a common and organic law situation be animated with passion passion clothe upon with situation neither exist for itself but each inhere indissolubly with the other this be high art and not only the highest art possible in word but the highest art of all since it combine the greatest mass and diversity of the element of truth and pleasure such be epic and the few prose tale that have the epic weight but as from a school of work ape the creative incident and romance be ruthlessly discard so may character and drama be omit or subordinate to romance there be one book for example more generally love than shakespeare that captivate in childhood and still delight in age -- i mean the _ arabian night _ -- where you shall look in vain for moral or for intellectual interest no human face or voice greet we among that wooden crowd of king and genie sorcerer and beggarmen adventure on the most naked term furnish forth the entertainment and be find enough duma approach perhaps nearest of any modern to these arabian author in the purely material charm of some of he romance the early part of _ monte cristo _ down to the finding of the treasure be a piece of perfect story-telling the man never breathe who share these move incident without a tremor and yet farium be a thing of packthread and dantès -lrb- 20 -rrb- little more than a name the sequel be one long-drawn error gloomy bloody unnatural and dull but as for these early chapter i do not believe there be another volume extant where you can breathe the same unmingled atmosphere of romance it be very thin and light to be sure as on a high mountain but it be brisk and clear and sunny in proportion i see the other day with envy a old and a very clever lady setting forth on a second or third voyage into _ monte cristo _ here be story which powerfully affect the reader which can be reperus at any age and where the character be no more than puppet the bony fist of the showman visibly propel they they spring be a open secret they face be of wood they belly fill with bran and yet we thrillingly partake of they adventure and the point may be illustrate still further the last interview between lucy and richard feveril -lrb- 21 -rrb- be pure drama more than that it be the strongest scene since shakespeare in the english tongue they first meeting by the river on the other hand be pure romance it have nothing to do with character it might happen to any other boy and maiden and be none the less delightful for the change and yet i think he would be a bold man who should choose between these passage thus in the same book we may have two scene each capital in its order : in the one human passion deep call unto deep shall utter its genuine voice in the second accord circumstance like instrument in tune shall build up a trivial but desirable incident such as we love to prefigure for ourselves and in the end in spite of the critic we may hesitate to give the preference to either the one may ask more genius -- i do not say it do but at least the other dwell as clearly in the memory true romantic art again make a romance of all thing it reach into the highest abstraction of the ideal it do not refuse the most pedestrian realism _ robinson crusoe _ be as realistic as it be romantic : -lrb- 22 -rrb- both quality be push to a extreme and neither suffer nor do romance depend upon the material importance of the incident to deal with strong and deadly element banditti pirate war and murder be to conjure with great name and in the event of failure to double the disgrace the arrival of haydn -lrb- 23 -rrb- and consuelo at the canon 's villa be a very trifling incident yet we may read a dozen boisterous story from begin to end and not receive so fresh and stir a impression of adventure it be the scene of crusoe at the wreck if i remember rightly that so bewitch my blacksmith nor be the fact surprising every single article the castaway recover from the hulk be a joy for ever -lrb- 24 -rrb- to the man who read of they they be the thing that should be find and the bare enumeration stir the blood i find a glimmer of the same interest the other day in a new book _ the sailor 's sweetheart _ -lrb- 25 -rrb- by mr clark russell the whole business of the brig _ morning star _ be very rightly feel and spiritedly write but the clothes the book and the money satisfy the reader 's mind like thing to eat we be deal here with the old cut-and-dry legitimate interest of treasure trove but even treasure trove can be make dull there be few people who have not groan under the plethora of goods that fall to the lot of the _ swiss family robinson _ -lrb- 26 -rrb- that dreary family they find article after article creature after creature from milk kine to piece of ordnance a whole consignment but no inform taste have preside over the selection there be no smack or relish in the invoice and these riches leave the fancy cold the box of goods in verne 's _ mysterious island _ -lrb- 27 -rrb- be another case in point : there be no gusto and no glamour about that it might have come from a shop but the two hundred and seventy-eight australian sovereign on board the _ morning star _ fall upon I like a surprise that i have expect whole vista of secondary story besides the one in hand radiate forth from that discovery as they radiate from a striking particular in life and i be make for the moment as happy as a reader have the right to be to come at all at the nature of this quality of romance we must bear in mind the peculiarity of we attitude to any art no art produce illusion in the theater we never forget that we be in the theater and while we read a story we sit waver between two mind now merely clap we hand at the merit of the performance now condescend to take a active part in fancy with the character this last be the triumph of romantic story-telling : when the reader consciously play at be the hero the scene be a good scene now in character-study the pleasure that we take be critical we watch we approve we smile at incongruity we be move to sudden heat of sympathy with courage suffering or virtue but the character be still themselves they be not we the more clearly they be depict the more widely do they stand away from we the more imperiously do they thrust we back into we place as a spectator i can not identify myself with rawdon crawley or with eugène de rastignac -lrb- 28 -rrb- for i have scarce a hope or fear in common with they it be not character but incident that woo we out of we reserve something happen as we desire to have it happen to ourselves some situation that we have long dally with in fancy be realize in the story with entice and appropriate detail then we forget the character then we push the hero aside then we plunge into the tale in we own person and bathe in fresh experience and then and then only do we say we have be read a romance it be not only pleasurable thing that we imagine in we day-dream there be light in which we be willing to contemplate even the idea of we own death way in which it seem as if it would amuse we to be cheat wound or calumniate it be thus possible to construct a story even of tragic import in which every incident detail and trick of circumstance shall be welcome to the reader 's thought fiction be to the grown man what play be to the child it be there that he change the atmosphere and tenor of he life and when the game so chime with he fancy that he can join in it with all he heart when it please he with every turn when he love to recall it and dwell upon its recollection with entire delight fiction be call romance walter scott be out and away the king of the romantic _ the lady of the lake _ have no indisputable claim to be a poem beyond the inherent fitness and desirability of the tale it be just such a story as a man would make up for himself walk in the best health and temper through just such scene as it be lay in hence it be that a charm dwell undefinable among these slovenly verse as the unseen cuckoo fill the mountain with he note hence even after we have fling the book aside the scenery and adventure remain present to the mind a new and green possession not unworthy of that beautiful name _ the lady of the lake _ -lrb- 29 -rrb- or that direct romantic opening -- one of the most spirited and poetical in literature -- the stag at eve have drunk he fill the same strength and the same weakness adorn and disfigure the novel in that ill-written ragged book _ the pirate _ -lrb- 30 -rrb- the figure of cleveland -- cast up by the sea on the resounding foreland of dunrossness -- move with the blood on he hand and the spanish word on he tongue among the simple islander -- singing a serenade under the window of he shetland mistress -- be conceive in the very highest manner of romantic invention the word of he song through grove of palm sing in such a scene and by such a lover clench as in a nutshell the emphatic contrast upon which the tale be build in _ guy manner _ -lrb- 31 -rrb- again every incident be delightful to the imagination and the scene when harry bertram land at ellangowan be a model instance of romantic method ' i remember the tune well ' he say ` though i can not guess what should at present so strongly recall it to my memory ' he take he flageolet from he pocket and play a simple melody apparently the tune awake the corresponding association of a damsel she immediately take up the song -- ` be these the link of forth she say or be they the crook of dee or the bonny wood of warroch head that i so fain would see ' ` by heaven ' say bertram ` it be the very ballad ' on this quotation two remark fall to be make first as a instance of modern feeling for romance this famous touch of the flageolet and the old song be select by miss braddon for omission miss braddon 's idea -lrb- 32 -rrb- of a story like mr todger 's idea of a wooden leg -lrb- 33 -rrb- be something strange to have expound as a matter of personal experience meg 's appearance to old mr bertram on the road the ruin of derncleugh the scene of the flageolet and the dominie 's recognition of harry be the four strong note that continue to ring in the mind after the book be lay aside the second point be still more curious the reader will observe a mark of excision in the passage as quote by I well here be how it run in the original : a damsel who close behind a fine spring about half-way down the descent and which have once supply the castle with water be engage in bleaching linen a man who give in such copy would be discharge from the staff of a daily paper scott have forget to prepare the reader for the presence of the damsel he have forget to mention the spring and its relation to the ruin and now face to face with he omission instead of try back and start fair cram all this matter tail foremost into a single shambling sentence it be not merely bad english or bad style it be abominably bad narrative besides certainly the contrast be remarkable and it be one that throw a strong light upon the subject of this paper for here we have a man of the finest creative instinct touch with perfect certainty and charm the romantic juncture of he story and we find he utterly careless almost it would seem incapable in the technical matter of style and not only frequently weak but frequently wrong in point of drama in character part indeed and particularly in the scotch he be delicate strong and truthful but the trite obliterated feature of too many of he hero have already wearied two generation of reader at time he character will speak with something far beyond propriety with a true heroic note but on the next page they will be wade wearily forward with a ungrammatical and undramatic rigmarole of word the man who could conceive and write the character of elspeth of the craigburnfoot -lrb- 34 -rrb- as scott have conceive and write it have not only splendid romantic but splendid tragic gift how come it then that he could so often fob we off with languid inarticulate twaddle it seem to I that the explanation be to be find in the very quality of he surprising merit as he book be play to the reader so be they play to he he conjure up the romantic with delight but he have hardly patience to describe it he be a great day-dreamer a seer of fit and beautiful and humorous vision but hardly a great artist hardly in the manful sense a artist at all he please himself and so he please we of the pleasure of he art he taste fully but of its toil and vigil and distress never man know less a great romantic -- a idle child note this essay first appear in _ longman 's magazine _ for November 1882 vol i pp 69-79 five year later it be publish in the volume _ memory and portrait _ -lrb- 1887 -rrb- follow by a article call _ a humble remonstrance _ which should really be read in connection with this essay as it be a continuation of the same line of think in the eternal conflict between romanticism and realism stevenson be heart and soul with the former and fortunately he live long enough to see the practical effect of he own precept and influence when he begin to write realism in fiction seem to have absolute control when he die a tremendous reaction in favor of the historical romance have already set in that reach its climax with the death of the century stevenson 's share in this romantic revival be greater than that of any other english writer and as a english review remark if it have not be for he most of the new author would have be howell and jame young man this paper be write at davo in the winter of 1881-2 and in

and fly far beyond folly have dare to resuscitate the theory of animal machine the dog 's instinct and the automaton-dog in this age of psychology and science sound like strange anachronism a

and man after and perhaps before the different duration of they life be that the one can speak and that the other can not the absence of the power of speech confines the dog in the development of he intellect it hinder he from many speculation for word be the beginning of metaphysic at the same blow it save he from many superstition and he silence have win for he a higher name for virtue than he conduct justify the fault of the dog -lrb- 5 -rrb- be many he be vainer than man singularly greedy of notice singularly intolerant of ridicule suspicious like the deaf jealous to the degree of frenzy and radically devoid of truth the day of a intelligent small dog be pass in the manufacture and the laborious communication of falsehood he lie with he tail he lie with he eye he lie with he protest paw and when he rattle he dish or scratch at the door he purpose be other than appear but he have some apology to offer for the vice many of the sign which form he dialect have come to bear a arbitrary meaning clearly understand both by he master and himself yet when a new want arise he must either invent a new vehicle of meaning or wrest a old one to a different purpose and this necessity frequently recur must tend to lessen he idea of the sanctity of symbol meanwhile the dog be clear in he own conscience and draw with a human nicety the distinction between formal and essential truth of he punning perversion he legitimate dexterity with symbol he be even vain but when he have tell and be detect in a lie there be not a hair upon he body but confess guilt to a dog of gentlemanly feeling theft and falsehood be disgraceful vice the canine like the human gentleman demand in he misdemeanor montaigne 's _ je ne sais quoi de genéréux _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- he be never more than half ashamed of have bark or bite and for those fault into which he have be lead by the desire to shine before a lady of he race he retain even under physical correction a share of pride but to be catch lie if he understand it instantly uncurl he fleece just as among dull observer he preserve a name for truth the dog have be credit with modesty it be amazing how the use of language blunt the faculty of man -- that because vainglory find no vent in word creature supply with eye have be unable to detect a fault so gross and obvious if a small spoil dog be suddenly to be endow with speech he would prate interminably and still about himself when we have friend we should be force to lock he in a garret and what with he whine jealousy and he foible for falsehood in a year 's time he would have go far to weary out we love i be about to compare he to sir willoughby patterne -lrb- 7 -rrb- but the patterne have a manlier sense of they own merit and the parallel besides be ready han christian andersen -lrb- 8 -rrb- as we behold he in he startling memoirs thrilling from top to toe with a excruciating vanity and scout even along the street for shadow of offence -- here be the talk dog it be just this rage for consideration that have betray the dog into he satellite position as the friend of man the cat a animal of franker appetite preserve he independence but the dog with one eye ever on the audience have be wheedle into slavery and praise and pat into the renunciation of he nature once he cease hunting -lrb- 9 -rrb- and become man 's plate-licker the rubicon be cross thenceforth he be a gentleman of leisure and except the few whom we keep work the whole race grow more and more self-conscious mannered and affect the number of thing that a small dog do naturally be strangely small enjoy better spirit and not crush under material care he be far more theatrical than average man he whole life if he be a dog of any pretension to gallantry be spend in a vain show and in the hot pursuit of admiration take out you puppy for a walk and you will find the little ball of fur clumsy stupid bewildered but natural let but a few month pass and when you repeat the process you will find nature bury in convention he will do nothing plainly but the simplest process of we material life will all be bent into the form of a elaborate and mysterious etiquette instinct say the fool have awaken but it be not so some dog -- some at the very least -- if they be keep separate from other remain quite natural and these when at length they meet with a companion of experience and have the game explain to they distinguish themselves by the severity of they devotion to its rule i wish i be allow to tell a story which would radiantly illuminate the point but man like dog have a elaborate and mysterious etiquette it be they bond of sympathy that both be the child of convention the person man or dog who have a conscience be eternally condemn to some degree of humbug the sense of the law in they member -lrb- 10 -rrb- fatally precipitate either towards a frozen and affected bearing and the converse be true and in the elaborate and conscious manners of the dog moral opinion and the love of the ideal stand confess to follow for ten minute in the street some swaggering canine cavalier be to receive a lesson in dramatic art and the culture conduct of the body in every act and gesture you see he true to a refined conception and the dullest cur behold he prick up he ear and proceed to imitate and parody that charming ease for to be a high-mannered and high-minded gentleman careless affable and gay be the inborn pretension of the dog the large dog so much lazier so much more weigh upon with matter so majestic in repose so beautiful in effort be bear with the dramatic means to wholly represent the part and it be more pathetic and perhaps more instructive to consider the small dog in he conscientious and imperfect effort to outdo sir philip sidney -lrb- 11 -rrb- for the ideal of the dog be feudal and religious -lrb- 12 -rrb- the ever-present polytheism the whip-bearing olympus of mankind rule they on the one hand on the other they singular difference of size and strength among themselves effectually prevent the appearance of the democratic notion or we might more exactly compare they society to the curious spectacle present by a school -- usher monitor and big and little boy -- qualify by one circumstance the introduction of the other sex in each we should observe a somewhat similar tension of manner and somewhat similar point of honor in each the larger animal keep a contemptuous good humor in each the smaller annoy he with wasp-like impudence certain of practical immunity in each we shall find a double life produce double character and a excursive and noisy heroism combine with a fair amount of practical timidity i have know dog and i have know school hero that set aside the fur could hardly have be tell apart and if we desire to understand the chivalry of old we must turn to the school playfield or the dungheap where the dog be troop woman with the dog have be long enfranchise incessant massacre of female innocent have change the proportion of the sex and pervert they relation thus when we regard the manners of the dog we see a romantic and monogamous animal once perhaps as delicate as the cat at war with impossible condition man have much to answer for and the part he play be yet more damnable and parlous -lrb- 13 -rrb- than corin 's in the eye of touchstone but he intervention have at least create a imperial situation for the rare survive lady in that society they reign without a rival : conscious queen and in the only instance of a canine wife-beater that have ever fall under my notice the criminal be somewhat excuse by the circumstance of he story he be a little very alert well-bred intelligent skye as black as a hat with a wet bramble for a nose and two cairn-gorm -lrb- 14 -rrb- for eye to the human observer he be decidedly well-looking but to the lady of he race he seem abhorrent a thorough elaborate gentleman of the plume and sword-knot order he be bear with the nice sense of gallantry to woman he take at they hand the most outrageous treatment i have hear he bleat like a sheep i have see he streaming blood and he ear tattered like a regimental banner and yet he would scorn to make reprisal nay more when a human lady upraise the contumelious whip against the very dame who have be so cruelly misuse he my little great-heart give but one hoarse cry and fall upon the tyrant tooth and nail this be the tale of a soul 's tragedy -lrb- 15 -rrb- after three year of unavailing chivalry he suddenly in one hour throw off the yoke of obligation have he be shakespeare he would then have write _ troilus and cressida _ -lrb- 16 -rrb- to brand the offend sex but be only a little dog he begin to bite they the surprise of the lady whom he attack indicate the monstrosity of he offence but he have fairly beat off he better angel fairly committed moral suicide for almost in the same hour throw aside the last rag of decency he proceed to attack the aged also the fact be worth remark show as it do that ethical law be common both to dog and man and that with both a single deliberate violation of the conscience loosen all but while the lamp hold on to burn say the paraphrase the greatest sinner may return -lrb- 17 -rrb- i have be cheer to see symptom of effectual penitence in my sweet ruffian and by the handle that he accept uncomplainingly the other day from a indignant fair one i begin to hope the period of _ sturm und drang _ -lrb- 18 -rrb- be close all these little gentleman be subtle casuist the duty to the female dog be plain but where compete duty rise down they will sit and study they out like jesuit confessor -lrb- 19 -rrb- i know another little skye somewhat plain in manner and appearance but a creature compact of amiability and solid wisdom he family go abroad for a winter he be receive for that period by a uncle in the same city the winter over he own family home again and he own house -lrb- of which he be very proud -rrb- reopen he find himself in a dilemma between two conflict duty of loyalty and gratitude he old friend be not to be neglect but it seem hardly decent to desert the new this be how he solve the problem every morning as soon as the door be open off post coolin to he uncle 's visit the child in the nursery salute the whole family and be back at home in time for breakfast and he bit of fish nor be this do without a sacrifice on he part sharply feel for he have to forego the particular honor and jewel of he day -- he morning 's walk with my father and perhaps from this cause he gradually weary of and relax the practice and at length return entirely to he ancient habit but the same decision serve he in another and more distressing case of divide duty which happen not long after he be not at all a kitchen dog but the cook have nurse he with unusual kindness during the distemper and though he do not adore she as he adore my father -- although -lrb- bear snob -rrb- he be critically conscious of she position as only a servant -- he still cherish for she a special gratitude well the cook leave and retire some street away to lodgings of she own and there be coolin in precisely the same situation with any young gentleman who have have the inestimable benefit of a faithful nurse the canine conscience do not solve the problem with a pound of tea at christmas no longer content to pay a fly visit it be the whole forenoon that he dedicate to he solitary friend and so day by day he continue to comfort she solitude until -lrb- for some reason which i could never understand and can not approve -rrb- he be keep lock up to break he of the graceful habit here it be not the similarity it be the difference that be worthy of remark the clearly marked degree of gratitude and the proportional duration of he visit anything further remove from instinct it be hard to fancy and one be even stir to a certain impatience with a character so destitute of spontaneity so passionless in justice and so priggishly obedient to the voice of reason there be not many dog like this good coolin and not many people but the type be one well marked both in the human and the canine family gallantry be not he aim but a solid and somewhat oppressive respectability he be a swear foe to the unusual and the conspicuous a praiser of the golden mean a kind of city uncle modify by cheeryble -lrb- 20 -rrb- and as he be precise and conscientious in all the step of he own blameless course he look for the same precision and a even greater gravity in the bearing of he deity my father it be no sinecure to be coolin 's idol he be exact like a rigid parent and at every sign of levity in the man whom he respect he announce loudly the death of virtue and the proximate fall of the pillar of the earth i have call he a snob but all dog be so though in vary degree it be hard to follow they snobbery among themselves for though i think we can perceive distinction of rank we can not grasp what be the criterion thus in edinburgh in a good part of the town there be several distinct society or club that meet in the morning to -- the phrase be technical -- to rake the backet -lrb- 21 -rrb- in a troop a friend of mine the master of three dog be one day surprise to observe that they have leave one club and join another but whether it be a rise or a fall and the result of a invitation or a expulsion be more than he could guess and this illustrate pointedly we ignorance of the real life of dog they social ambition and they social hierarchy at least in they dealings with man they be not only conscious of sex but of the difference of station and that in the most snobbish manner for the poor man 's dog be not offend by the notice of the rich and keep all he ugly feeling for those poorer or more ragged than he master and again for every station they have a ideal of behavior to which the master under pain of derogation will do wisely to conform how often have not a cold glance of a eye inform I that my dog be disappointed and how much more gladly would he not have take a beating than to be thus wound in the seat of piety i know one disrespectable dog he be far liker a cat care little or nothing for man with whom he merely coexist as we do with cattle and be entirely devote to the art of poach a house would not hold he and to live in a town be what he refuse he lead i believe a life of troubled but genuine pleasure and perish beyond all question in a trap but this be a exception a marked reversion to the ancestral type like the hairy human infant the true dog of the nineteenth century to judge by the remainder of my fairly large acquaintance be in love with respectability a street-dog be once adopt by a lady while still a arab he have do as arab do gambolling in the mud charge into butcher ' stall a cat-hunter a sturdy beggar a common rogue and vagabond but with he rise into society he lay aside these inconsistent pleasure he steal no more he hunt no more cat and conscious of he collar he ignore he old companion yet the canine upper class be never bring to recognize the upstart and from that hour except for human countenance he be alone friendless shear of he sport and the habit of a lifetime he still live in a glory of happiness content with he acquire respectability and with no care but to support it solemnly be we to condemn or praise this self-made dog we praise he human brother and thus to conquer vicious habit be as rare with dog as with man with the more part for all they scruple-mongering and moral think the vice that be bear with they remain invincible throughout and they live all they year glory in they virtue but still the slave of they defect thus the sage coolin be a thief to the last among a thousand peccadillo a whole goose and a whole cold leg of mutton lay upon he conscience but wogg -lrb- 22 -rrb- whose soul 's shipwreck in the matter of gallantry i have recount above have only twice be know to steal and have often nobly conquer the temptation the eighth be he favorite commandment there be something painfully human in these unequal virtue and mortal frailty of the best still more painful be the bearing of those stammer professor -lrb- 23 -rrb- in the house of sickness and under the terror of death it be beyond a doubt to I that somehow or other the dog connect together or confound the uneasiness of sickness and the consciousness of guilt to the pain of the body he often add the torture of the conscience and at these time he haggard protestation form in regard to the human deathb a dreadful parody or parallel i once suppose that i have find a inverse relation between the double etiquette which dog obey and that those who be most addict to the showy street life among other dog be less careful in the practice of home virtue for the tyrant man but the female dog that mass of carneying -lrb- 24 -rrb- affectation shine equally in either sphere rule she rough posse of attendant swain with unwearying tact and gusto and with she master and mistress push the art of insinuation to they crowning point the attention of man and the regard of other dog flatter -lrb- it would thus appear -rrb- the same sensibility but perhaps if we could read the canine heart they would be find to flatter it in very marked degree dog live with man as courtier round a monarch steep in the flattery of he notice and enriched with sinecure to push they favor in this world of pickings and caress be perhaps the business of they life and they joy may lie outside i be in despair at we persistent ignorance i read in the life of we companion the same process of reason the same antique and fatal conflict of the right against the wrong and of unbitted nature with too rigid custom i see they with we weakness vain false inconstant against appetite and with we one stalk of virtue devote to the dream of a ideal and yet as they hurry by I on the street with tail in air or come singly to solicit my regard i must own the secret purport of they life be still inscrutable to man be man the friend or be he the patron only have they indeed forget nature 's voice or be those moment snatch from courtiership when they touch nose with the tinker 's mongrel the brief reward and pleasure of they artificial life doubtless when man share with he dog the toil of a profession and the pleasure of a art as with the shepherd or the poacher the affection warm and strengthen till it fill the soul but doubtless also the master be in many case the object of a merely interested cultus sit aloft like loui quatorze -lrb- 25 -rrb- give and receive flattery and favor and the dog like the majority of man have but forget they true existence and become the dupe of they ambition note this article originally appear in _ the english illustrated magazine _ for may 1883

through my boyhood and youth i be know and point out for the pattern of a idler -lrb- 1 -rrb- and yet i be always busy on my own private end which be to learn to write i keep always two book in my pocket one to read one to write in as i walk my mind be busy fitting what i see with appropriate word when i sit by the roadside i would either read or a pencil and a penny version-book would be in my hand to note down the feature of the scene or commemorate some halting stanza thus i live with word and what i thus write be for no ulterior use it be write consciously for practice it be not so much that i wish to be a author -lrb- though i wish that too -rrb- as that i have vow that i would learn to write that be a proficiency that tempt I and i practice to acquire it as man learn to whittle in a wager with myself description be the principal field of my exercise for to any one with sens there be always something worth describe and town and country be but one continuous subject but i work in other way also often accompany my walk with dramatic dialogue in which i play many part and often exercise myself in write down conversation from memory this be all excellent no doubt so be the diary i sometimes try to keep but always and very speedily discard find they a school of posturing -lrb- 2 -rrb- and melancholy self-deception and yet this be not the most efficient part of my training good though it be it only teach I -lrb- so far as i have learn they at all -rrb- the lower and less intellectual element of the art the choice of the essential note and the right word : thing that to a happier constitution have perhaps come by nature and regard as training it have one grave defect for it set I no standard of achievement so that there be perhaps more profit as there be certainly more effort in my secret labor at home whenever i read a book or a passage that particularly please I in which a thing be say or a effect render with propriety in which there be either some conspicuous force or some happy distinction in the style i must sit down at once and set myself to ape that quality i be unsuccessful and i know it and try again and be again unsuccessful and always unsuccessful but at least in these vain bout i get some practice in rhythm in harmony in construction and the co-ordination of part i have thus play the sedulous ape to hazlitt to lamb to wordsworth to sir thoma browne to defoe to hawthorne to montaigne to baudelaire and to obermann -lrb- 3 -rrb- i remember one of these monkey trick which be call _ the vanity of moral _ : it be to have have a second part _ the vanity of knowledge _ and as i have neither morality nor scholarship the name be apt but the second part be never attempt and the first part be write -lrb- which be my reason for recall it ghostlike from its ash -rrb- no less than three time : first in the manner of hazlitt second in the manner of ruskin -lrb- 4 -rrb- who have cast on I a pass spell and third in a laborious pasticcio of sir thoma browne so with my other work : _ cain _ a epic be -lrb- save the mark -rrb- a imitation of _ sordello : robin hood _ a tale in verse take a eclectic middle course among the field of keat chaucer and morri : in _ monmouth _ a tragedy i recline on the bosom of mr swinburne in my innumerable gouty-footed lyric i follow many master in the first draft of _ the king 's pardon _ a tragedy i be on the trail of no lesser man than john webster in the second draft of the same piece with staggering versatility i have shift my allegiance to congreve and of course conceive my fable in a less serious vein -- for it be not congreve 's verse it be he exquisite prose that i admire and seek to copy even at the age of thirteen i have try to do justice to the inhabitant of the famous city of peeble -lrb- 5 -rrb- in the style of the _ book of snob _ so i might go on for ever through all my abortive novel and down to my later play -lrb- 6 -rrb- of which i think more tenderly for they be not only conceive at first under the brace influence of old duma but have meet with resurrection : one strangely better by another hand come on the stage itself and be play by bodily actor the other originally know as _ semirami : a tragedy _ i have observe on bookstall under the _ alia _ of _ prince otto _ but enough have be say to show by what art of impersonation and in what purely ventriloquial effort i first see my word on paper that like it or not be the way to learn to write whether i have profit or not that be the way it be so keats learn -lrb- 7 -rrb- and there be never a finer temperament for literature than keat 's it be so if we could trace it out that all man have learn and that be why a revival of letter be always accompany or herald by a cast back to earlier and fresher model perhaps i hear someone cry out : but this be not the way to be original it be not nor be there any way but to be bear so nor yet if you be bear original be there anything in this training that shall clip the wing of you originality there can be none more original than montaigne -lrb- 8 -rrb- neither could any be more unlike cicero yet no craftsman can fail to see how much the one must have try in he time to imitate the other burn -lrb- 9 -rrb- be the very type of a prime force in letter : he be of all man the most imitative shakespeare himself the imperial proceeds directly from a school it be only from a school that we can expect to have good writer it be almost invariably from a school that great writer these lawless exception issue nor be there anything here that should astonish the considerate before he can tell what cadence he truly prefer the student should have try all that be possible before he can choose and preserve a fitting key of word he should long have practice the literary scale -lrb- 10 -rrb- and it be only after year of such gymnastic that he can sit down at last legion of word swarm to he call dozen of turn of phrase simultaneously bid for he choice and he himself know what he want to do and -lrb- within the narrow limit of a man 's ability -rrb- able to do it and it be the great point of these imitation that there still shine beyond the student 's reach he inimitable model let he try as he please he be still sure of failure and it be a very old and a very true say that failure be the only highroad to success i must have have some disposition to learn for i clear-sightedly condemn my own performance i like do they indeed but when they be do i could see they be rubbish in consequence i very rarely show they even to my friend and such friend as i choose to be my confidant i must have choose well for they have the friendliness to be quite plain with I padding say one another write : i can not understand why you do lyric so badly no more could i thrice i put myself in the way of a more authoritative rebuff by send a paper to a magazine these be return and i be not surprise nor even pained if they have not be look at as -lrb- like all amateur -rrb- i suspect be the case there be no good in repeat the experiment if they have be look at -- well then i have not yet learn to write and i must keep on learning and live lastly i have a piece of good fortune which be the occasion of this paper and by which i be able to see my literature in print and to measure experimentally how far i stand from the favor of the public ii the speculative society be a body of some antiquity and have count among its member scott brougham jeffrey horner benjamin constant robert emmet and many a legal and local celebrity besides by a accident variously explain it have its room in the very building of the university of edinburgh : a hall turkey-carpeted hung with picture look when light up at night with fire and candle like some goodly dining-room a passage-like library wall with book in they wire cage and a corridor with a fireplace bench a table many print of famous member and a mural tablet to the virtue of a former secretary here a member can warm himself and loaf and read here in defiance of senatus-consult he can smoke the senatus look askance at these privilege look even with a somewhat vinegar aspect on the whole society which argue a lack of proportion in the learn mind for the world we may be sure will prize far higher this haunt of dead lion than all the living dog of the professorate i sit one December morning in the library of the speculative a very humble-minded youth though it be a virtue i never have much credit for yet proud of my privilege as a member of the spec proud of the pipe i be smoking in the tooth of the senatus and in particular proud of be in the next room to three very distinguished student who be then converse beside the corridor fire one of these have now he name on the back of several volume and he voice i learn be influential in the law court of the death of the second you have just be read what i have to say and the third also have escape out of that battle of life in which be fight so hard it may be so unwisely they be all three as i have say notable student but this be the most conspicuous wealthy handsome ambitious adventurous diplomatic a reader of balzac and of all man that i have know the most like to one of balzac 's character he lead a life and be attend by a ill fortune that could be properly set forth only in the _ comédie humaine _ he have then he eye on parliament and soon after the time of which i write he make a showy speech at a political dinner be cry up to heaven next day in the _ courant _ and the day after be dash lower than earth with a charge of plagiarism in the _ scotsman _ report would have it -lrb- i daresay very wrongly -rrb- that he be betray by one in whom he particularly trust and that the author of the charge have learn its truth from he own lip thus at least he be up one day on a pinnacle admire and envy by all and the next though still but a boy he be publicly disgrace the blow would have break a less finely temper spirit and even he i suppose it render reckless for he take flight to london and there in a fast club dispose of the bulk of he considerable patrimony in the space of one winter for year thereafter he live i know not how always well dress always in good hotel and good society always with empty pocket the charm of he manner may have stand he in good stead but though my own manners be very agreeable i have never find in they a source of livelihood and to explain the miracle of he continued existence i must fall back upon the theory of the philosopher that in he case as in all of the same kind there be a suffering relative in the background from this genteel eclipse he reappear upon the scene and presently seek I out in the character of a generous editor it be in this part that i best remember he tall slender with a not ungraceful stoop look quite like a refined gentleman and quite like a urbane adventurer smile with a engaging ambiguity cock at you one peak eyebrow with a great appearance of finesse speaking low and sweet and thick with a touch of burr tell strange tale with singular deliberation and to a patient listener excellent effect after all these up and downs he seem still like the rich student that he be of yore to breathe of money seem still perfectly sure of himself and certain of he end yet he be then upon the brink of he last overthrow he have set himself to find the strangest thing in we society : one of those periodical sheet from which man suppose themselves to learn opinion in which young gentleman from the university be encourage at so much a line to garble fact insult foreign nation and calumniate private individual and which be now the source of glory so that if a man 's name be often enough print there he become a kind of demigod and people will pardon he when he talk back and forth as they do for mr gladstone and crowd he to suffocation on railway platform as they do the other day to general boulanger and buy he literary work as i hope you have just do for I we father when they be upon some great enterprise would sacrifice a life building it may be a favorite slave into the foundation of they palace it be with he own life that my companion disarm the envy of the god he fight he paper single-handed trust no one for he be something of a cynic up early and down late for he be nothing of a sluggard daily earwigging influential man for he be a master of ingratiation in that slender and silken fellow there must have be a rare vein of courage that he should thus have die at he employment and doubtless ambition speak loudly in he ear and doubtless love also for it seem there be a marriage in he view have he succeed but he die and he paper die after he and of all this grace and tact and courage it must seem to we blind eye as if there have come literally nothing these three student sit as i be say in the corridor under the mural tablet that record the virtue of machean the former secretary we would often smile at that ineloquent memorial and think it a poor thing to come into the world at all and leave no more behind one than machean and yet of these three two be go and have leave less and this book perhaps when it be old and foxy and some one pick it up in a corner of a book-shop and glance through it smile at the old graceless turn of speech and perhaps for the love of _ alma mater _ -lrb- which may be still extant and flourishing -rrb- buy it not without haggle for some penny -- this book may alone preserve a memory of jame walter ferrier and robert glasgow brown they thought run very differently on that December morning they be all on fire with ambition and when they have call I in to they and make I a sharer in they design i too become drunken with pride and hope we be to find a university magazine a pair of little active brother -- livingstone by name great skipper on the foot great rubber of the hand who keep a book-shop over against the university building -- have be debauch to play the part of publisher we four be to be conjunct editor and what be the main point of the concern to print we own work while by every rule of arithmetic -- that flatterer of credulity -- the adventure must succeed and bring great profit well well : it be a bright vision i go home that morning walk upon air to have be choose by these three distinguish student be to I the most unspeakable advance it be my first draught of consideration it reconcile I to myself and to my fellow-men and as i steer round the railing at the tron i could not withhold my lip from smile publicly yet in the bottom of my heart i know that magazine would be a grim fiasco i know it would not be worth reading i know even if it be that nobody would read it and i keep wonder how i should be able upon my compact income of twelve pound per annum payable monthly to meet my share in the expense it be a comfortable thought to I that i have a father the magazine appear in a yellow cover which be the best part of it for at least it be unassuming it run four month in undisturbed obscurity and die without a gasp the first number be edit by all four of we with prodigious bustle the second fall principally into the hand of ferrier and I the third i edited alone and it have long be a solemn question who it be that edit the fourth it would perhaps be still more difficult to say who read it poor yellow sheet that look so hopefully in the livingstone ' window poor harmless paper that might have go to print a _ shakespeare _ on and be instead so clumsily deface with nonsense and shall i say poor editor i can not pity myself to whom it be all pure gain it be no news to I but only the wholesome confirmation of my judgment when the magazine struggle into half-birth and instantly sicken and subside into night i have send a copy to the lady with whom my heart be at that time somewhat engage and who do all that in she lay to break it and she with some tact pass over the gift and my cherish contribution in silence i will not say that i be please at this but i will tell she now if by any chance she take up the work of she former servant that i think the better of she taste i clear the deck after this lose engagement have the necessary interview with my father which pass off not amiss pay over my share of the expense to the two little active brother who rub they hand as much but methought skip rather less than formerly have perhaps these two also embark upon the enterprise with some graceful illusion and then review the whole episode i tell myself that the time be not yet ripe nor the man ready and to work i go again with my penny version-book have fall back in one day from the print author to the manuscript student iii from this defunct periodical i be go to reprint one of my own papers the poor little piece be all tail-foremost i have do my best to straighten its array i have prune it fearlessly and it remain invertebrate and wordy no self-respecting magazine would print the thing and here you behold it in a bind volume not for any worth of its own but for the sake of the man whom it purport dimly to represent and some of whose saying it preserve so that in this volume of memory and portrait robert young the swanston gardener may stand alongside of john todd the swanston shepherd not that john and robert draw very close together in they life for john be rough he smell of the windy bra and robert be gentle and smack of the garden in the hollow perhaps it be to my shame that i like john the better of the two he have grit and dash and that salt of the old adam that please man with any savage inheritance of blood and he be a wayfarer besides and take my gipsy fancy but however that may be and however robert 's profile may be blur in the boyish sketch that follow he be a man of a most quaint and beautiful nature whom if it be possible to recast a piece of work so old i should like well to draw again with a maturer touch and as i think of he and of john i wonder in what other country two such man would be find dwelling together in a hamlet of some twenty cottage in the woody fold of a green hill note this article make its first appearance

the most influential book -lrb- 3 -rrb- and the truest in they influence be work of fiction they do not pin the reader to a dogma which he must afterwards discover to be inexact they do not teach he a lesson which he must afterwards unlearn they repeat they rearrange they clarify the lesson of life they disengage we from ourselves they constrain we to the acquaintance of other and they show we the web of experience not as we can see it for ourselves but with a singular change -- that monstrous consuming _ ego _ of ours be for the nonce strike out to be so they must be reasonably true to the human comedy and any work that be so serve the turn of instruction but the course of we education be answer best by those poem and romance where we breathe a magnanimous atmosphere of thought and meet

quite pass away kent 's brief speech -lrb- 5 -rrb- over the die lear have a great effect upon my mind and be the burthen of my reflection for long so profoundly so touchingly generous do it appear in sense so overpowering in expression perhaps my dearest and best friend outside of shakespeare be d'artagnan -- the elderly d'artagnan of the _ vicomte de bragelonne _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- i know not a more human soul nor in he way a finer i shall be very sorry for the man who be so much of a pedant in moral that he can not learn from the captain of musketeer lastly i must name the _ pilgrim 's progress

contact we drink they up like water and be better yet know not how it be in book more specifically didactic that we can follow out the effect and distinguish and weigh and compare a book which have be very influential upon I fall early into my hand and so may stand first though i think its influence be only sensible later on and perhaps still keep grow for it be a book not easily outlive : the _

dozen way a nobler view of life than they or they contemporary the next book in order of time to influence I be the new testament and in particular the gospel accord to st matthew i believe it would startle and move any one if they could make a certain effort of imagination and read it freshly like a book not droningly and dully like a portion of the bible any one would then be able to see in it those truth which we be all courteously suppose to know and all modestly refrain from apply but upon this subject it be perhaps better to be silent i come next to whitman 's _ leave of grass _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- a book of singular service a book which tumble the world upside down for I blow into space a thousand cobweb of genteel and ethical illusion and have thus shake my tabernacle of lie set I back again upon a strong foundation of all the original and manly virtue but it be once more only a book for those who have the gift of reading -lrb- 11 -rrb- i will be very frank -- i believe it be so with all good book except perhaps fiction the average man life and must live so wholly in convention that gun-powder charge of the truth be more apt to discompose than to invigorate he creed either

original not in the page of the popular epitomiser who be bind by the very nature of he task to make we feel the difference of epoch instead of the essential identity of man and even in the original

very generally understand it consist first of all in a vast intellectual endowment -- a free grace i find i must call it -- by which a man rise to understand that he be not punctually right nor those from whom he differ absolutely wrong he may hold dogma he may hold they passionately and he may know that other hold they but coldly or hold they differently or hold they not at all well if he have the gift of read these other will be full of meat for he they will see the other side of proposition and the other side of virtue he need not change he dogma for that but he may change he reading of that dogma and he must supplement and correct he deduction from it a human truth which be always very much a lie hide as much of life as it display it be man who hold another truth or as it seem to we perhaps a dangerous lie who can extend we restricted field of knowledge and rouse we drowsy conscience something that seem quite new or that seem insolently false or very dangerous be the test of a reader if he try to see what it mean what truth excuse it he have the gift and let he read if he be merely hurt or offend or exclaim upon he author 's folly he have better take to the daily papers he will never be a reader and here with the aptest illustrative force after i have lay down my part-truth i must step in with its opposite for after all we be vessel of a very limited content not all man can read all book it be only in a choose few that any man will find he appoint food and the fittest lesson be the most palatable and make themselves welcome to the mind a writer learn this early and it be he chief support he go on unafraid lay down the law and he be sure at heart that most of what he say be demonstrably false and much of a mingled strain and some hurtful and very little good for
