crumble strand the adriatic filcheth near and far -- in that same past where dante 's dream-day be that one francesca give she youthful gold unto a aged carle to bolt and bar though all the love which great young heart can hold how could she give that love unto a miser old nay but young paolo be the happy lad a youth of dream eye yet dauntless foot who all francesca 's wealth of loving have one brave to scale a wall and steal the fruit nor fear because some dotard own the root yea one who wear he love like sword on thigh and keep not all he valor for he lute one who could dare as well as sing and sigh ah then be heart to love but they be long go by ye lily-wife so happy in the nest whose joy within the gate of duty spring blame not love 's poor who if they would be blest must steal what come to you with marriage ring : ye pity the poor lark whose scarce-tried wing faint in the net while still the morning air with brown free throat of all he brethren sing and can it be ye will not pity she whose youth be as a lark all lose to singing there in opportunity of dear-bought joy rich be this twain for old lanciotto he who be she lord be brother of she boy and in one home together dwell the three with brother two beside and he and she sit at one board together in one fane they voice rise upon one hymn ah I beneath one roof each night they limb have lie as now in death they share the one eternal pain as much as common man can love a flower unto lanciotto be francesca dear ` tis not on such love wield he jealous power and therefore paolo move he not to fear though he so green with youth and he so sere nor yet indeed be wrong the hidden thing grow at each heart unknown of each a year -- two egg still silent in the nest through spring may draw so near to June and not yet time to sing yet oft indeed through day that give no sign have but francesca turn about and read paolo 's bright eye that only dare to shine on the dear gold that glorify she head ere all the light have from they circle flee and the gray honor darken all he face : they have not come to June and nothing say day follow day with such a even pace nor night succeed night and leave no starry trace or surely have the flower paolo press in some sweet volume when he put it by tell how he mistress draw it to she breast and call upon he name when none be nigh have but the scarf he kiss with piteous cry but breathe again its secret unto she or have but one of every little sigh each leave for each be love 's true messenger : they surely have not keep that winter all the year yea love lay hushed and wait like a seed some laggard of the season still abe though the sun call and gentle zephyr plead and hope that wait long must deem it dead yet lo to-morrow see its shine head singing at dawn ` mid all the garden throng : ah have it known it have be earlier speed -- be it for fear of day it sleep so long or be its dream of singing sweeter than the song but what poor flower can symbol all the might and all the magnitude great love of thee ah be there aught can image thee aright in earth or heaven how great or fair it be we watch the acorn grow into the tree we watch the patient spark surprise the mine but what be oak to thy ygdrasil-tree what the mad mine 's convulsive strength to thine that wreck a world but bid heaven 's soar steeple shine a god that have no earthly metaphor a blinding word that have no earthly rhyme love we can only call and no name more as the great lonely thunder roll sublime as the great sun doth solitary climb and we have but themselves to know they by just so love stand a stranger amid time : the god be there the great voice speak on high we pray ` what art thou lord ' but win we no reply so in the dark grow love but fear to flower dream to himself but never speak a word burn like a prisoned fire from hour to hour sing he dear song like a unheeded bird wait the summon voice so long unheard wait with weary eye the gracious sign to bring he rose and tell the dream he dare the tremulous moment when the star should shine and each should ask of each and each should answer -- ` thine ' winter to-day but lo to-morrow spring they wait long but oh at last it come come in a silver hush at evening francesca toy with thread upon a frame hard by young paolo read of knight and dame that long ago have love and pass away : he have no other way to tell he flame she dare not listen any other way -- but even that be bliss to lover poor as they the world grow sweet with wonder in the west the while he read and while she listen there and many a dream from out its silken nest steal like a curl incense through the air yet look she not on he nor do he dare : but when the lover kiss in paradise he voice sink and he turn he gaze on she like a young bird that flutter ere it fly -- and lo a shine angel call he from she eye then from the silence spring a kiss like flame and they hang lose together while around the world be change no more to be the same meadow or sky no little flower or sound again the same for earth grow holy ground : while in the silence of the mount moon infinite love throb in the strain bind of that great kiss the long-delaying boon grant indeed at last but end ah so soon as the great sobbing fulness of the sea fill to the throat some void and ache cave till all its hollow tremble silently press with sweet weight of softly-lapping wave : so kiss those mighty lover glad and brave and as a sky from which the sun have go tremble all night with all the star he give a firmament of memory of the sun -- so thrill and thrill each life when that great kiss be do but coward shame that have no word to say in passion 's hour with sudden icy clang slew the bright morn and through the tarnished day a iron bell from light to darkness ring : she shut she ear because a throstle sing she dare not hear the little innocent bird and a white flower make she poor head to hang -- to be so white once she be white as curd but now -- ` alack ' ` alack ' she speak no other word the pearly line on yonder hill afar within the dawn when mount the lark and sing by the great angel of the morning star -- that be he love and all free fair fresh thing that move and glitter while the daylight spring : to thus know love and yet to spoil love thus to lose the dream -- o silly beating wing -- great dream so splendid and miraculous : o lord o lord have mercy have mercy upon we she turn she mind upon the holy one whose love lose here be love in heaven tenfold she think of lucy that most bless of nun who send she blue eye on a plate of gold to he who woo she daily for she love -- ` mine eye ' ` mine eye ' ` here -- go in peace they be ' but ever love come through the midnight grove young love with wild eye watch from afar and call and call and call until the morning star ah poor francesca ` tis not such as thou that up the stony steep of heaven climb take thou thy heaven with thy paolo now -- sweet saint of sin saint of a deathless rhyme song shall defend thee at the bar of time dante shall set thy fair young glowing face on the dark background of he theme sublime and thou and he in you superb disgrace still on that golden wind of passion shall embrace \* \* \* \* \* so love this twain but whither have they pass ah I that dark must always follow day that love 's last kiss be surely kiss at last howe'er so wildly the poor lip may pray : merciful god be there no other way and pen o must thou of the end write the hour lanciotto find they where they lay fold together weary with delight within the sumptuous petal of the rose of night yea for lanciotto find they : many a hour ere they dear joy have run its doomèd date have they in silken nook and blossom bower all unsuspect the bless apple eat who now must grind its core predestinate kiss kiss poor lose lover nor deny one little tremor of its bliss for fate cometh upon you and the dark be nigh where all unkissed unkissing learn at length to lie bent on some journey of the state 's concern they deem he and indeed he ride thereon but question paolo -- ` what if he return ' ` nay love indeed he be securely go as thou art surely here beloved one he go ere sundown and we moon be here -- a fear love in this heart that yet know none ' how could he fright that little velvet ear with last night 's dream and all its ghostly fear so do he yield he to she eager breast and half forget but could not quite forget no sweetest kiss could put that fear to rest and all its haggard vision chill he yet they warder moon in nameless trouble set there seem a traitor echo in the place a moan wind that moan for lover meet and once above she head 's deep sink embrace he see -- death at the window with he yellow face have that same dream catch old lanciotto 's rein bent in a weary huddle on he steed in darkling haste along the blindfold lane make a clatter halt in all that speed : -- ` fool fool ' he cry ' o dotard fool indeed so ho they wanton while the old man ride ' and on the night flash picture of the deed ` come ' -- and he dig he charger 's panting side and all the homeward dark tear by in roar tide as some great lord of acre when a thief steal from he park some flower he never see call it a lily fair beyond belief prison the wretch and fine before he free such jealous madness do lanciotto seize : all in a instant be francesca dear he claim the wife he never care to please all in a instant seem he castle near -- and those poor lover sleep forget at last they fear he horse leave steam at he journey 's end up through he palace stair with spring tread he stride the silence meet he like a friend fain to dissuade he from that deed of dread make a breeze about he burning head lay large hand of comfort on he soul within the ash of he cheek burn red a long-shut rise of youth as to the goal of death he speed as once to love 's own tryst he steal he catch a sound as of a rose 's breath he catch another breath of deeper lung rose-leaf and oak-leaf on the wind of death he draw aside the arras where they cling in the dim light so lovely and so young -- they lay in sin as in a cradle there twin babe that in one bosom nestle hung : even lanciotto pause ah will he spare who could not quite forgive a wrong that be so fair the grave old clock tick somewhere in the gloom a dozen wait seconds rise and fall ere he pale dagger flicker in the room then quench its corpse-light in they bosom ' swell -- ` thus dear i mate you evermore in hell ' they blood run warm about they and they sigh for the mad smiter do he work too well just draw together softly and so die fall very still and strange and move not side by side yea move not though two hour he watch the twain and hear they blood drip drip upon the floor twice with stern voice he speak to they again and then a little tenderly once more -- ` thus dear in hell i mate you evermore ' and when the curious finger of the day unravel all the dark and morning wear and the young light play round they where they lay the soul be many league upon the hellward way young love nb -- _ this sequence of poem have appear in former edition under the title of ` love platonic _ ' i 1 surely at last o lady the sweet moon that bringeth in the happy singing weather groweth to pearly queendom and full soon shall love and song go hand in hand together for all the pain that all too long have wait in deep dumb darkness shall have speech at last and the bright babe death give the love he mate shall leap to light and kiss the weep past for all the silver morning be a-glimmer with gleam spear of great apollo 's host and the night fadeth like a spend out swimmer hurl from the headland of some shine coast o happy soul thy mouth at last be singing drunken with wine of morning 's azure deep sing on my soul the world beneath thee swing a bough of song above a sea of sleep 2 who be the lady i sing ah how can i tell thee she praise for whom all my life 's but the string of a rosary painful of day which i count with a curious smile as a miser who hoardeth he gain though a madhearted spendthrift the while i but gather to waste again yea i pluck from the tree of the year as a country maid greedy of flower each day brim over with tear and i scatter like petal its hour and i trample they under my foot in a frenzy of cloven-hoofed swine and the breath of they die be sweet and the blood of they heart be as wine o i throw I low down on the ground and i bury my face in they death and only i rise at the sound of a wind as it scattereth as it scattereth sweetly the dry leaf wither and brittle and sere of day of old year that have die -- and o it be sweet in my ear and i rise I and build I a pyre of the whisper skeleton thing and my heart laugheth low with the fire laugheth high with the flame as it spring and above in the flicker glare i mark I the bough of my tree my tree of the year grow bare grow bare with the scant day to be then i turn to my bead and i pray for the axe at the root of the tree -- last flower last bead -- ah last day that shall part I my darling from thee and i pray for the knife on the string of this rosary painful of day : but who be the lady i sing ah how can i tell thee she praise ii i make this rhyme of my lady and I to give I ease of my misery of my lady and I i make this rhyme for lover in the after-time and i weave its warp from day to day in a golden loom deep hide away in my secret heart where no one go but my lady 's self and -- no one know with bended head all day i pore on a joyless task and yet before my eye all day through each weary hour breathe my lady 's face like a dewy flower like rain it come through the dusty air like sun on the meadow to think of she o sweet as violet in early spring the flower-girl to the city bring o healing-bright to wintry eye as primrose-gold ` neath northern sky -- but o for fit thing to compare with the joy i have in the thought of she so all day long doth she holy face bring fragrance to the barren place and whensoe'er it come nearest I my loom it weaveth busily some day there be when the loom be still and my soul be sad as a autumn hill but how to tell the bless time when my heart be one glowing prayer of rhyme think on the hum afternoon within some busy wood in June when nettle patch drunk with the sun be fiery outpost of the shade while gnat keep up a dizzy reel and the grasshopper perch upon he blade loud drone he fairy threshing-wheel : -- hour when some poet-wit might feign the drowsy tune of the throbbing air the weave of the gossamer in secret nook of wood and lane -- the gossamer silk night-robe of the flower flutter apart by amorous morning hour yea as the weave of the gossamer if truly that the mystic golden boom be the strange rapture of my hidden loom as i sit in the light of the thought of she and it weaveth weaveth day by day this parti-coloured roundelay weave for ease of misery weave this rhyme of my lady and I weave weave this warp of rhyme for lover in the after-time my lady lover may never be mine in the same sweet way that thine be thine my lady and i may never stand by the holy altar hand in hand my lady and i may never rest through the golden midnight breast to breast nor share long day of happy light sweet move in each other 's sight : yea even must we ever miss the honey of the chastest kiss iii but song arise thee on a greater wing nor twitter robin-like of love nor sing a pretty dalliance with grief -- but try some metre like a sky wherein to set star that may linger yet when i thy master shall have come to die twitter and tweet thy carolling of little thing of fair and sweet for it be meet o robin red that little theme have little song that little head have little dream and long but we have starry business such a grief as autumn 's dead by some forget sheaf while all the distance echo of the wain grief as a ocean 's for some sudden isle of live green that stay with it a while then to oblivious deluge plunge again grief as of alp that yearn but never reach grief as of death for life of night for day : such grief o song how hast thou strength to teach how hope to make assay iv once once we meet and then there come like a pentecostal flame a word and i say not only think she hear all i never say but sing worship wrapt in the hidden tongue of a ambiguous song how we meet what need to say when or where year ago or yesterday here or there all the song be -- once we meet she and i once but never to forget till we die all the song be that we meet never now -- ` hast thou yet forget sweet ' ` love hast thou ' v the day of the two daffodil ` the daffodil be fine this year ' i say ' o yes but see my crocus ' say she and so we enter in and sit at talk within a little parlor bower about with garden-noise fill with garden scent as some sweet sea-shell ring with pearly chime and sigh out fragrance of its mother 's breast we sit at talk and all the afternoon whisper about in change silence of flush and sudden light and gathering shade as though some maestro draw out organ stop somewhere in heaven as two within a boat on the wide sea we sit at talk the hour lap unheeded round we as the wave and as such two will ofttimes pause in speech gaze at high heaven and draw deep to they heart the infinite azure then meet eye again and flash it to each other without word first and then with voice tremble as trumpet tremble with fierce breath voice cadenced too as deep as the deep sea aeolian voice voice of star-space and the pine-wood 's voice in dewy morning life 's own awful voice : so do we talk gaze with god 's own eye into life 's deep -- ah how they throb with star and be we not ourselves like pulse sun who once a aeon meet within the void so fiery close forget how far away each orbit sweep and dream a little space of fiery wedding so we heart make answer lightning all that afternoon through purple mist of riddled speech and when at last the sun we sentinel make sign beneath the tree of come night and we arise and pass across the threshold to the flower again we know a presence walk in the grove and a voice speak through the evening 's cool unknown before : though love have work no wrong he rune be speak and another rhyme writ in he poem by the master life ` pray pluck I some ' i say she bring I two for daffodil be very fine that year -- o very fine but daffodil no more vi why do she marry he why do she marry he ah say why how be she fancy catch what be the dream that he draw she by or be she only buy give she she gold for a girlish whim a freak of a foolish mood or be it some will like a snake in he lay a charm upon she blood love of he limb be it that think you body of bullock build sap in the bone and spring in the thew a lusty youth unspilled but be it so that a maid be win such a maiden maid as she she face like a lily all white in the sun for such mere male as he ah why do the field with they white and gold to farmer clod belong who though he have reap and stack and sell have never hear they song nay seek not a answer comfort ye the poet hear they call and so dear love will i comfort I -- he have thy lease that be all vii the lamp and the star yea let I be ` thy bachelere ' ` tis sweeter than thy lord how should i envy he my dear the lamp upon he board still make he little circle bright with boon of dear domestic light while i afar watch he window in the night worship a star for which he have no bolt or bar yea dear thy ` bachelere ' viii orbit two star once on they lonely way meet in the heavenly height and they dream a dream they might shine alway with undivided light melt into one with a breathless throe and beam as one in the night and each forget in the dream so strange how desolately far sweep on each path for who shall change the orbit of a star yea all be a dream and they still must go as lonely as they be ix never -- ever my mouth to thy mouth ah never ah never my breast from thy breast eternity sever but my soul to thy soul for ever and ever x love 's poor yea love i know and i would have it thus i know that not for we be springtide passion with he fire and flower i know this love of ours life not nor yet may live by the dear food that lip and hand can give not love that we in some high dream despise the common lover 's common paradise ah god if thou and i but one short hour they blessedness might try how could we poor one teach those happy one who half forget they rich : for if we thus endure ` tis only love because we be so poor xi comfort of dante down where the unconquered river still flow on one strong free thing within a prison 's heart i draw I with my sacred grief apart that it might look that spacious joy upon : and as i mused lo dante walk with I and he face spake of the high peace of pain till all my grief glow in I throbbingly as in some lily 's heart might glow the rain so like a star i listen till mine eye catch that lone land across the water-way wherein my lady breathe -- now breathing be -- ' o dante ' then i say ` she more than i should know thy comfort go to _ she _ i pray ' ` nay ' answer he ` for she have beatrice ' xii a lose hour god give we a hour for we tear one hour out of all the year for all the year be another 's gold give in a cruel troth of old and how do we spend he boon that sweet miraculous flower bear to die in a hour late bear to die so soon do we watch it with breathless breath by slow degree unfold do we taste the innermost heart of it the honey of each sweet part of it suck all its hidden gold to the very dregs of its death nay this be all we do with we hour -- we tear it to piece that precious flower like any daisy with listless mirth we shed its petal upon the earth and children-like when it all be do we cry unto god for another one xiii meet once more o lady i have look on thee once more thou too hast look on I as thou hadst say and though the joy be pain the pain be bliss bliss that more happy lover well may miss : captive feast richly on a little bread so be we very rich who be so poor xiv a June lily -lrb- _ the poet dramatise he lady 's loneliness _ -rrb- alone once more alone how like a tomb my little parlor sound which only now yearn like some holy chancel with he voice so still so empty surely one might fear the wall should meet in ruinous collapse that hold no more he music yet they stand firm in a foolish firmness meaningless as frescoed sepulchre some pharaoh build but never come to sleep in build indeed for -- that gray moth to flit in like a ghost alone another feast-day come and go watch through the week as in my garden there i watch a seedle grow from blade to bud impatient for its blossom so this day have bloom at last and we have pluck its flower and share its sweetness and once more the time be as that stalk from which but now i pluck its last june-lily as a parting sign yea but he seem to love it yet if he but crave it in deceit of tenderness to make my heart glow brighter with a lie will it indeed be cherish as he say or will he keep it near he book a while and when grow rank forget it in he glass and leave it for the maid who dust he room to clear away and cast upon the heap or may be will he bury it away in some old drawer with other mummy-flower nay but i wrong thee dear one think so my boy my love my poet nay i know thy lonely room tomb-like to thee as mine tomb-like as tomb of some return ghost seem only bright about my lily-flower and mayhap while i wrong thee thus in think thou bendest o'er it feign for some ease of part ache conceit of poet-wit on petal and on stamen -- let I try if lily be alike thine be as this i wonder if thy reading tally too six petal with a dewdrop in they heart six pure brave year a ivory cup of tear six pearly-pillared stamen golden-crowned grow from out the dewdrop and a seventh soar alone trilobe and mystic green six pearl-bright year aflower with gold of joy spring from the heart of those brave tear-fed year : but what that seventh single stamen be my little wit must leave for thee to tell but neither poet nor a sibyl thou what brave conceit have he my poet build no jugglery of number that mean nought that can mean nought for ever unto we xv regret one ask of regret and i make reply : to have hold the bird and let it fly to have see the star for a moment nigh and lose it through a slothful eye to have pluck the flower and cast it by to have one only hope -- to die xvi love afar love art thou lonely to-day lose love that i never see love that come noon or come
