list of illustration nick think she adorable in she gray motor bonnet santa barbara mission with its history and romance angelum be enchant with the peninsula of monterey they be not tree but people either nymph or witch the world be a sea billow with mountain prologue on a great ship a woman sail away from the old world wish to forget in she mind be the thought of a far-off place toward which she be travel there be no figure in this mental picture she paint it as a mere flowery background for she be very tired of people in the new world a man live and work and dream -- when he have time between this woman and this man lay six thousand mile of land and sea they be two among many million and they do not know of each other 's existence there be no visible reason why they ever should know or why they should ever meet yet sometimes when the moon shone on the sea the woman say to herself that the bright path pave the water with gold seem to lead on and on beyond the horizon as if it might go all the way to the golden gate and the golden gate be the port of adventure where every unexpected thing can happen i in a garden i wonder what make nick so late carman gaylor think hover in the doorway between the dim cool hall and the huge veranda that be like a out-of-doors drawing-room though she speak english well -- almost as well as if she have not be bear in spain and make she greatest success in the city of mexico -- carman think in spanish for she heart be spanish and she beauty too she be always handsome but she be beautiful as she come out into the sunset gold which seem mean for she as stage light be turn on for the heroine of a play and there be something about carman which suggest strong drama even the setting in which she frame herself be like a ideal scene for a first act the house be not very old and not really spanish but it have be design by a architect who know carman with the purpose of give a spanish effect he have know exactly the sort of background to suit she a background as expensive as picturesque a millionaire husband have pay for it there be many veranda and pergola but this immense out-of-doors room have wide archway instead of pillar curtain with white and purple passion flower and the creamy stucco of the house-wall and the ruddy spanish tile which already look mellow with age be half hide with climb rose and grapevine three shallow step of pansy-coloured brick go all the length of the gallery descend to a terrace floor with the same brick which hold dim tint of purple old rise gray and yellow almost like a fade persian rug when carman have look past the fountain across the lawn down the path cut between pink oleander where the man she expect ought to appear she trail she white dress over terrace and grass to peer under the green roof of the bamboo forest it be like a temple with tall pillar of priceless jade that support a roof of the same gray-green star in a vague pattern with the jewel of sunset carman do not see the beauty of the magic temple though she be conscious of she own she hate to think that nick hilliard should keep she waiting and there be cruelty in the clutch she make at a cluster of orange blossom as she pass a long row of tree in terra-cotta pot on the terrace under the bamboo she scatter a handful of creamy petal on the golden brown earth and rub they into the ground with the point of she bronze shoe then she hold up she hand to she face to smell the sweetness crush out of the blossom why do not nick come there be a short cut lead from the land which she have select off she own immense ranch to sell to nick hilliard and this way he sometimes take if he be in a hurry but she know that he love the path between the pink wall of oleander and prefer to come by it though it be longer he ought to have be with she at least ten minute ago for she have ask he to come early she have say in the letter which she give old simeon harp to take to nick this be you last night there be a great great many thing i want to talk to you about but there be only one thing about which she wish nick hilliard to talk to she and there be two reason why she expect he to talk of it to-night one reason be because he be go east and plan to be go a month a dreadful plan which she fear and detest the second reason concern the anniversary of a certain event some people would have call the event a tragedy but to carmen it have make life worth live other people 's tragedy be shadowy affair to she if she have not to suffer from they it be one of she pleasure to dress beautifully in a style that might have seem exaggerated on a different type of woman and would have be extravagant for any except the mistress of a fortune but never have carmen take more pain than to-night when she expect only one guest she white chiffon and silver tissue might have be a wedding gown she adore jewellery and have be almost a slave to she love for it until she begin to value something else more -- something which unfortunately she money could not buy though she hope and pray she face might win it she have quantity of diamond emerald and ruby -- she favorite stone -- but instinct have tell she that even one would spoil the effect she wish to make to-night she wear only a long rope of pearl which would have suit a bride and as she stand in the shadow of she bamboo temple the pearl drink iridescent light : green from the jade-coloured tree pink from rose trail over arbor and gold from the californium poppy thick among the grass of course any one of many reasonable thing might have happen to delay nick he be busy busier even than when he have be foreman of the gaylor ranch a year ago but carman could not bear to think that he would let mere reasonable thing keep he away from she just this night of all other for exactly a year -- a year to-day a year this morning so it be already more than a year -- she have cease to be a slave and she have have everything she want except one thing perhaps she have that too yet she be not sure : and she could hardly wait to be sure nobody but nick could make she so and he ought to be in joyful haste to do it he be not cold blood one could not look at nick and think he that yet to she he sometimes seem indifferent carman make herself believe that it be he respect which hold he back how desperately she want to know yet there be a strange pleasure in not know such as she might never feel again when she be sure suddenly far off there be a rustling in the bamboo forest a figure like a shadow but darker than other shadow move in the distance carman 's heart jump she take a step forward then stop it be not nick hilliard after all but old simeon harp the squirrel poisoner come from the direction of nick 's ranch bring she a message maybe she feel she could not possibly bear it if nick be not come and she hate he at the bare thought that he might send a excuse at the last moment what be it sim she call out sharply as the queer gnarl figure of the old man hobble nearer nothing my lady simeon harp answer in the husky voice of one who be or have be a drunkard nothing only i be over at nick 's finishin ' up a bit of my work and he say would i tell you he be sorry to be late he be have somebody with he all afternoon and no time to pack till just now but he 'll be along presently harp be a englishman with some fading sign about he of decent birth decent education and upbringing but such sign be blur and almost obliterate by the habit which have degrade he he would have be dead or in prison or the poorhouse year ago if carman have not choose to rescue he more through a whim than from genuine charity she mother 's people have be english and somehow she have not care to see a englishman throw to the dog in this country which be not hers nor he in day when she word be law for the infatuate and brutal man whose death anniversary it now be this bit of human driftwood -- failure drunkard rascal -- have be find trespassing on the ranch if carman have not choose to show she power over old grizzly gaylor by protect the poor wretch harp would have meet the fate he probably deserve but she have amuse herself and save he sick and forlorn he have be nurse back to something like health in the house of one among many gardener since then he have be she slave she dog he call she my lady and she rather like the name she like the worship admiration in the red-lidded eye which have once be handsome and she believe what he often say that there be nothing on earth he would not do for she once or twice the thought have pierce she brain like a sharp needle that perhaps he have already do a thing for she -- a great thing but it be better not to know not even to guess fortunately the idea have apparently never occur to any one else and of course it never could now yet there have be a very curious look in simeon harp 's eye a year ago when -- not that it prove anything there be always a more or less curious look in he eye he be altogether a curious person perhaps a little mad or at any rate vague especially be he vague about he reason for leave he native land to emigrate to america he say it be so long ago and he have go through so much that he have forget there be some thing it be as well to forget since carman have know he simeon harp have try he luck as a water diviner but fail sometimes when he most wish to succeed in that profession he have now definitely settle down as squirrel poisoner to the neighborhood those pest to farmer and ranchman ground squirrel have give the strange old man a chance to build up a reputation of a sort as a squirrel poisoner he be a brilliant success who give you permission to call mr hilliard ` nick ' carmen ask not very sternly for she be please to have news from the other ranch after all if nick have have a visitor he might not be to blame why everybody call he ` nick ' explain simeon huskily but i will not if it be not you will my lady oh i do not care if _ he _ do not only -- she break off slightly confuse even to this old wretch she could not say it be not suitable that you should use my future husband 's christian name as if he be down on the same level with a man like you she could not be sure that nick would be she husband though it seem practically certain besides if hilliard be nick to everybody it be a token of he popularity and nick himself be the last man to forget that he have rise to he present place by climb up from the lowest ring of the ladder -- the ladder of poverty she could not imagine he put on air as he would call it though she think it might be better if he be less of the hail-fellow-well-met and more of the master in manner among he own cattleman and particularly with the wild riff-raff that have rush to he land with the oil boom who be with he -- some man i suppose she ask of the squirrel poisoner who stand quietly adoring she with eye dim by drink and year he have so settle down on he rheumatic old joint that he have become dwarfish in stature as well as gnarled in shape and look a gnomelike thing gaze up at the tall young woman oh yes it be a man of course simeon assure she there could not be any woman for he who know you it seem to I my lady and you be never as handsome as you be this night it warm the heart to set eye on you like the wine you give I on you birthday to drink you health

have some of that wine to-night thank you my lady it be a anniversary too he mumble lower he husky voice for the last word but carman hear they you remember that she exclaim without stop to think or

the last skin cure to-day as it happen maybe that 'll bring you _ good _ luck oh i hope so she cry here 's nick -- mr hilliard harp announce nod he gray head in the direction of the oleander path to which carmen 's back be turn as she stand she wheel quickly and see a tall young man come toward she with long stride instantly she forget simeon harp and do not even see he as he hobble away pull on to he head the moth-eaten cap of squirrel fur which he always wear summer and winter as if for a sign of he trade ii nick nick hilliard snatch off he sombrero as he come swing along the oleander path he be tall fully six foot in height and look taller than he be be lean and hard with long straight leg which could carry he very fast over great stretch of country also he have a way of hold he head high a way which a man get if he be in the habit of gaze toward far horizon he have a well-cut nose a good chin and a mouth that mean strength of purpose though some of he friend laugh at he for a womanish curve of the upper lip luckily nick do not mind be laugh at by he friend he face be almost as brown as he hair for the sun have darken the one and bleached the other but the hair be nice hair with a glow of auburn in it which contrast not uninterestingly with he black straight brow it be however the brilliance of the brook-brown eye which make nick a handsome man and not merely a good-looking fellow it be because of he eye that woman turn in the street for another glance when he go into bakersfield or fresno but nick never know that they turn he like pretty girl and enjoy they society but be too busy to seek it and have have little of it in he life it do not occur to he that he have quality to attract woman indeed he waste few thought upon himself as a individual not enough perhaps for he give he whole attention to he work work be what he like best even without the ultimate success it bring but lately he have begin to long for a change he have a strong wish to go east and a reason for the wish carman hold out both hand and enjoy see how white they look in nick 's sunburned slightly freckled one he shake hers frankly warmly and apologize for he rig which be certainly far from conventional i be ashamed of myself for blowin ' in on you this way he say especially as you be so mighty fine i hope you 'll excuse I for you know i pull out to-night and jim beach be bringin ' the buggy along here for I with my grip in it if i would pike back home afterward my visit with you would have be a cut game ah i be glad you arrange not to go back say carman i want you to stay with I as long as you can i like you in those clothes she smile at he as if she would like he in anything but nick be think about jim beach wonder if the boy would have trouble with the flea-bitten gray which he himself have newly break to harness all the same carman go on though i like they you have not get much vanity if you mean to wear those thing to travel east and land in new york why what be the matter with 'em mr gaylor nick ask he speak carelessly in the matter of accent as well as of he feeling about the clothes he cut off he word in a slipshod way as if he have never have time to think much about the value or beauty of the english language still though he speech be not that of a cultivate man it do not grate on the ear he voice be singularly pleasant even sweet with something of boyish gaiety in it the thing be all right nick and you be all right in they you need not worry say carman only -- well i do not believe there 'll be anything else like they -- or like you either -- in new york nick look himself over indifferently he wear a soft white shirt with a low collar turn over a black scarf tie anyhow there be a leather belt round he waist which obviate the need of a waistcoat or suspenders he short coat and trousers be of navy blue serge everything he have on be neat and of good material but carman smile when she think of this tall belted figure hat with a gray sombrero on the back of its head arrive at one of the best hotel in new york nick be pretty sure to go to one of the best hotel he want to see life no doubt and get he money 's worth she smile be as tender as carman 's smile could be however and she be please that he be not dress up to make a impression on pretty woman in the east i do not care what anybody think about I in new york say he as long as _ you _ excuse I for not have on my sunday-go-to-meeting rag to dine with you i do not mind the rest i think you be never come she say change the subject so do i by george i think the fellow 'd never go be it a deputation to say good-bye lord no mr gaylor it be a chap you do not know i guess i only run up against he lately since i sell my gusher to the unite oil company he be they lawyer -- and do some work for the railroad too smart sort of man he seem to be though kind of stiff when you first know he : between forty and forty-five maybe : name 's henry morehouse a brother of a bank manager in san francisco jame morehouse the banker be a very rich important man say carman somewhat impressed by the idea of nick 's new friend who have stay too long i have never meet he family myself you know how close i be keep till a year ago but i have hear of they they be in with the falconer set and that lot so it show they be smart what do henry morehouse want make up to you nick it be oil business bring we together and he seem to take a sort of likin ' to I we care about some o ' the same thing -- book and that now he be go east -- maybe on more oil business anyhow he propose we share a stateroom on the limited and he be be recommendin ' he hotel in new york i be kind of plannin ' to be a swell and hang out at the waldorf-astorium to see the nob at home but he place sound nice and i like bein ' with he pretty well he be light up with bright idea and maybe he 'll pass on some to I he business will not keep he long he think and he be promise he brother jame to look after a lady who be landing from europe about the time we be due in new york he 'll meet she ship and if she do not want to stay east any length of time he 'll bring she back to californium she mean to settle out here carman 's face harden into anxious line though she keep up a smile of interest she look older than she have look when she hold out she hand to nick she have be about twenty-six then now she be over thirty be the lady young or old she ask i do not know anything about she nick answer with a ring of truthfulness in he voice which carmen 's keen ear accept all i can tell you be that she be a mr may a relation or friend of franklin merriam the big californium millionaire who die east about ten year ago -- about the time i be first cowpunching on you ranch oh the franklin merriam who make such stack of money irrigate desert land he own somewhere in the southern part of the state carman sigh with relief i have hear of he of course he must have be middle-aged when he die so probably this woman 's old or oldish i suppose so nick readily agree great king be not it mighty sweet here to-night it look like heaven i guess and you be like -- like -- if this be heaven be i a angel _ do _ i seem like that to you well no -- not exactly my idea of a angel somehow : though i do not know he reflect aloud you be sure handsome enough -- for anything mr gaylor but i have always think of angel lily white with moonlight hair and starry eye you be quite poetical retorted carman pique but other man have tell I my eye be star he look straight into they and at the hot pomegranate color which blaze up in she olive cheek like a reflection of the sunset and carman look back at he with she big splendid eye it be a man 's look he give she a man 's look at a woman but not a man 's look at the woman he want no he answer they be not star they be more like the sun at noon in midsummer when so many flower be pourin ' out perfume you can hardly keep you sens carmen be no longer hurt that be the best compliment i ever have and i have have a good many she laugh besides -- come from you nick i believe it be the first you ever pay I right out in so many word be it a compliment nick ask doubtfully and boyishly well i be real glad i be smart enough to bring one off i speak out just what come into my mind and i would have feel mighty bad if you would be cross i be not cross she assure he i would rather be a woman -- for you -- than a angel angel be cold far-off impossible thing that man can not grasp besides they wing would probably moult nick laugh a pleasant soft laugh half under he breath say i do not picture angel with wing the sort that flit into my mind when i be tire out after a right hard day and feel kind of lonesome for something beautiful i do not know hardly what -- only something i have never have -- that sort of angel be a woman too and not cold though far above I of course she have starry eye and moonlight hair -- lot of it hang down in wave that could almost drown she but i guess after all -- as you say -- that sort 's not my line i 'll never come in the light she make with she shine and if i should by accident she would not go shoot any of she starry glance my way carman be vex again i do not know you be so sentimental nick he look half ashamed well i do not know i be either till it pop out he grin but i suppose ` most every man have sentimental spell maybe even he would not be worth he salt if he have not sometimes i think that way but my spell do not come on often when they do it be generally night in spring -- like this when special kind of night-thought come flyin ' along like moth -- thought about past and future but lately since that bless little oil town have be croppin ' up like a bed of mushroom round my big gusher -- or rather the company 's gusher as it be now -- i have have my mind on that more than anything else unless it be be my ditch gee there be as much romance about irrigation in this country i guess as there be about angel which you can see only in dream for you see every day when you be wide awake the miracle of you ditch you just watch you desert stretch or you meanest grazin ' meadow turn into fairyland i say mr gaylor have you ever read a mighty fine book -- old but good and fresh as to-morrow 's bread -- call _ the arabian night _ i do not know i dare say i read some of it when i be a little girl reply carman wonder what nick be lead up to it be for child be not it i reckon it be for every one with the right stuff in 'em say nick anyhow i have not grow up enough to get beyond it i do not mean ever to turn the boy that live inside of I out-of-door if i ever do anything to make he so mad that he quit i 'll be finish -- dry up that book _ the arabian night _ have get a dead clinch on I you know when i run into bakersfield i like to have a browse in the bookstore it sort of rest I and seein ' the picture in that book make I buy it -- a birthday present for my affectionate self -- you birthday carman break in tired of this book talk but not tire of anything that concern he you never tell I that be bad of you how old nick i be not sure to a year or so twenty-nine quite some age be not it but there be lot i want to do before i be old i do not know though as i mean ever to be old of course you never will be carmen agree with he aloud but she be think in a undertone : only twenty-nine and i be thirty-three he will not be old ever or for a long time but i will i be that kind i be afraid my mother be i have get no time to lose but to-day 's mine nick must love I really though maybe he be too use to I to know it without be stir up by something unusual but i 'll try my hardest to make he know it to-night go on about you ` arabian night ' she say to give herself time for the arrange of she tactic oh well all i really begin to say be this : i be read the story of aladdin and a enchanted cave of jewel he drop into there be a magic ring and a lamp in the story too that you could rub and get pretty near anything you want so i be think this irrigation business of ours in californium be like rub that lamp it throw open door of dark cave in desert and give up enchanted garden full of jewelled fruit and flower then rub the smoky old lamp again and you get a spout of oil -- another gift which make you feel as if a genie would chuck it to you look at my gusher for instance just think mr gaylor if you do not mind my talk this way about myself -- you sell I my land slice it right off you own ranch -- let I have it darn cheap too when the boss die -- i want to keep you as near as possible nick when people begin to be silly and say i ought not to have a young man like you on the place as foreman with I alone and eld go i need you badly and i would have be glad to give you land for nothing if you would have take it gracious i have get so much leave i do not know what to do with it or would not if you be not where you can advise I that be you generous way of puttin ' thing say nick and it be walkin ' along toward you bring up these fairy-book thought so strong my land 's all right though my house be a shack and i have not get any flower-garden except in my head but over here be another world and i be sayin ' to myself how i owe the biggest thing of my life to you true i be take out my wages in calf while the boss be alive and he be lettin ' I put my brand on 'em by the hundred but square as he be with I he would never have sell the land for the price you do not only that but when i strike oil a month or so after he go look what happen i have not the capital to do any good 'twa you put the money in my hand for the well-sinking and -- but you insist on mortgage every acre you buy -- you cattle and everything you have to I so that take away the credit cry carman touch by he gratitude and happy in the renew assurance that this man be hers besides all you do and spend seem likely to harm more than help when everybody say you would not get enough oil to pay for sink you well it be only when the gusher burst out by accident and take every one by surprise that you trouble be over if there be any such thing as accident nick mumble he eye far away from carman the longer i live the more i think there be not it be all arrange by something big up there beyond where the sun 's sinking and the moon 's rise but maybe you 'll say that be sentimental like the angel-thought i do not mean it that way though i have get a almighty lot to thank the something for -- as well as to thank you it be not i who take the gusher off you hand anyhow and save you the expense of cope with it say carman so i suppose you think it be heaven send you those man to buy what oil land you want to sell and start lucky star city i guess that be who it be not that i deserve any special kindness from that quarter nick laugh my mother use to talk a lot about those thing you know and though i be only a little shaver when she die i have remember most all that be connect with she carman do not speak she know the history of nick 's terrible childhood and early youth long ago he have tell she how he grandfather a californium pioneer of good southern family a successful judge have turn a only son away penniless because the boy of twenty choose to take for a wife a pretty little dressmaker of no family at all how the couple have go east to live on a few hundred dollar leave to the boy by a aunt how he have hope and expect to succeed in new york as a journalist and writer how he have fail and starve with he bride how he have fade out of life while nick be a baby how the girl-widow have take in sew to support she child and when she could not get that have wash or scrub and how as nick become a wise worried old man of four or five year he have be able to help earn the family living by sell the newspaper which have refuse he dead father 's contribution nick have not enlarged upon he adventure after this stage of he youthful career merely sketch they in the baldest manner when it have be necessary to present he credentials to the boss -- old grizzly gaylor but in one way or other it have leak out that the boy have learn to read and write and cipher at a night school in new york not have time for such frill as schooling by day and carman could not help know that he have go on study and think out he own rather queer idea about heaven and earth ever since in spite of the most strenuous interruption -- for she have be ashamed occasionally by happen to discover how much nick know he have read everybody and everything from plato to schopenhauer whereas it bore carman unspeakably to read anything except novel and verse which she like sometimes in magazine because they pathos or passion might have be write round she she know how nick as a little boy have sweep shop and find all sort of odd job how he have be errand boy and district messenger in a uniform of which he have be proud because it make he feel almost like a soldier how after he mother 's death he have get he long-cherished wish to go west by work on the railway and eventually become a brakesman after that short experience cowpunching day have come and after several year in a subordinate position on eldridge gaylor 's ranch he have at twenty-five be make foreman but by this time he be already a familiar figure in she life -- the life which she have choose and hate after it be choose except for nick hilliard who have always loom large in it though she see little of he until a year ago except perhaps with the old man she have marry for he money and hate for he brutality carman believe that nick hilliard 's way and good look have help even more than he courage and cleverness to win he success and recognition with eldridge gaylor it have be different he think of no man 's pleasant look or way though even upon the corrugated iron of he nature a woman 's beauty have have influence and he have marry carman off the comic opera stage in the city of mexico where he have go to see a great bullfight ten year ago when he have bring she home to he famous ranch willing for a while to be she slave and give she everything she want she have find nick a cowpuncher among other cowpuncher and she have see how he make old grizzly respect he but he promotion have come through a row and a attempt at murder the boss by a drunken foreman drive mad by a blow from the short whip gaylor carry about the ranch nick have save he employer 's life risk he own -- for he be unarmed at the moment and to he surprise the reward have be the discharge foreman 's place carman shiver a little even now remember that night and how she have worship nick for he bravery she have never since cease to worship he though he have do a great many thing which irritated she extremely such as save old grizzly 's life once again : but those year be past as she wonder whether nick would like she to talk with he about he mother or whether that subject be too delicate to pursue a musical japanese gong sound from a side gallery oh it must be half-past seven she say i order dinner early so we could talk afterward by moonlight -lrb- i love talk in moonlight -rrb- before the time for you to go you can give I you arm if you like nick of course nick like though he have never take a lady to dinner in that way before and he feel proud if a little awkward as a bare creamy arm lay itself on he coat-sleeve slowly and without speak they walk along a flower-bordered path that skirt the lawn on one side and on the other a canal full to the brim of glittering water which reflect the sky and the two figure it be a place and a hour make for love iii the anniversary they do not dine in the house though one of the show room be a huge dining-hall like a glorified refectory in a old spanish mission after the beginning of April and sometimes long before carman seldom take a meal indoors unless she be attack by one of she fierce fit of depression and have a whim to hate the sun she and nick mount the step pass the fountain which spout diamond spray through a round head make of some flowering water-plant go on round a corner carman 's dress brushing fall camellia petal or pink shell of broken rose and so come to another veranda this be pergola as well it have no roof but beam of old spanish chestnut so draped with wistarium and rose that the whole out-of-doors room be canopy with leaf and hang cluster of flower only a faint filter of sun or moonshine could steal through and such ray as penetrate seem to be dye pink and purple by drain through the flower suspend from the beam be big iridescent pearl-shell know in southern californium as abalone and in the rainbow-tinted half-globe gleam electric light subdue by dull gold glass but neither these nor the tall shaded lamp on the low wall of the terrace nor the hidden electric bulb in the fountain basin be allow to shine out yet as carman say she like to talk by moonlight and now over in the east behind magnolia and palm tree the moon have be bear while the sun die in the west if it have be she wedding-night dinner carman could not have be more careful in order the different dish and plan the decoration of the table usually whether she be alone or have guest -lrb- as she have sometimes though society have never take she up -rrb- she leave everything to she chinese head-cook who be a worthy rival of any parisian _ chef _ and the beautifying of she table to the artistic japanese youth whose one business in life be to think out new flower-combination this however be not only the anniversary of the day which have give she freedom but she hope it might be one to remember for a sweeter reason besides nick hilliard be to be enchant to be make conscious of himself and she as the only man the only woman worth thinking of in the world the air be sweet with the fragrance of orange-blossom and the deep-red velvet rose which be carman 's own flower nick be a water drinker by preference and because he be a open-air man also because it have be necessary for he to set a example but to-night carman make he sip a little iced champagne and she drink to the success of he first visit east since boyhood -- to he safe and speedy home-coming because this be home nick you home she say it would kill I if you see any place you like better and if you make up you mind that you want to sell out and live in new york no fear say nick no man ever leave paradise unless he be drive out by flame sword then you will not be go long she ask play with the abalone chowder on she plate not more than a month anyhow maybe a few day less if i get homesick though it would hardly be worth while to go so far for a shorter time after stay west so many year without a single break first i count on poke round in some of we old haunt -- poor mother 's and mine -- and then when i be way down in the dump i 'll yank myself up again with a little fun -- theater and roof-garden and such-like you have see good play in san francisco say carman yes san franciso 's a great place only i have not have time to go there once in a blue moon and just now it be those old association pull -- something seem draw and draw I to the east it be like a voice call my name -- ` nick -- nick i want you come ' funny be not it carman be not sure that it be funny for she be superstitious beyond all thing and at that moment it happen that she could hear the moan note of dove -- a sound which she believe always bring she bad luck what kind of a voice be it she ask laugh rather shrilly not a woman 's i hope i guess it be that angel 's i be tell you about nick smile carman motion the chinese butler to fill she guest 's glass which he have hardly touch do not let 's talk any more of angel she say let 's talk of I and you nick do you know what to-night be a year since i be free ` at the end of a year ' i always say to myself ` twelve long month of hypocritical respect pay to the memory of a person who be more brute than man but not a day more when the twelve month be over then -- happiness -- new life ' do not you consider i be justified in feel like that nick think for a moment not look at carman he gaze out through the tear curtain of rose into the silver of the moonlight over the wide lawn with its fountain toward the wall of tree which screen from sight the roll billow of the ranch-meadow with they cattle they shine canal-like irrigation-ditch they golden grain they alfalfa they fruit and flower all this wealth and much more old grizzly gaylor have give the pretty young singer in exchange for she beauty and the pleasure of snatch she away from other man despite the boss 's notorious failing it grate on hilliard to hear carman rejoice aloud because she husband be underground and she be free of he now that he back be turn forever probably you be right nick say yet -- it kind of rub I up the wrong way to listen to you talkin ' like that in particular just this very night why in particular this very night she ask sharply well -- i guess it be only conventional because why be twelve month more important than fourteen or any other number but it be the feeling of a anniversary i suppose a year ago to-day he breathe he last -- and he do not want to die it sort of seem as if to-day ought to be sacred to he no matter what he be and -- maybe i be a dash hypocrite and do not know it but it do not suit my idea of you to get the feeling that you set up to-night as festival i expect i be wrong though and you ought to be lecturin ' I instead of I you i do not want to lecture you nick whether you understand I or not say carman but the dinner and the meaning of the feast be spoil for she in a instant she could have bite she tongue out because it have speak the wrong word -- word which jar on nick at the very moment when she most wish to charm he she know with a heavy weight of premonition that this moonlight talk she have plan would give she nothing worth have now to try to make nick feel she power would do more harm than good because the night have suddenly become haunt by the spirit of the dead man i be punish she think superstitiously but she exert herself to be cheerful lest nick should go east disgusted with she and that would be the end of all iv a girl in mourning angelum may sit in she chair on the promenade-deck of the _ adriatic _ and feel peacefully conscious that she be rest body and brain the ship be not crowd for it be spring and the great tide of travel have turn in the opposite direction -- toward europe on either side of she chair be several which be unoccupied and a soothing silence hover round she through which she could listen to the whisper of the sea as the ship glide on to the land of hope loneliness give a real joy to angelum for young as she be she have live through a ordeal and have take a step which mean high nervous tension lead up to a supreme decision she be glad all be over and well over desperately glad that she courage have not fail oh how thankful i be she say again and again under she breath still she vaguely envy some of the family party on the ship who appear happy and unite not that she want they to talk to she witty lively people could be very nice when you be in the mood for they but agonizing when you be not and since it be not permissible to cover human being up like canary when you have tire of they or send they away like child when they have prattle enough angelum cuddle down among she cushion and rug glad to be let alone for the first time in she life but there be a young mother with a small imp of a curly-haired girl who fascinate she and make she think once when the imp fall on the deck to be catch up and kiss until a wail end in a laugh angelum say to herself if my mother have be like that everything would have be different for I saunterer for exercise or flirtation often turn for a glance at angelum what they see be a slim girl with pearly fair skin big gray eye quantity of wavy hair of so pale a yellow-brown that it be like gold under the mourning hat she wear she low black collar make the slender throat that rise out of it white as a lily the oval of she face be perfect and when she read or close she eye as she sometimes do the long lash many shades darker than she hair and the delicate arch of the brown eyebrow give she the soft sweet look of a child asleep always the glance be more admiring than curious but they be curious too for every one be wonder who she be in spite of she youth there be something of pride and distinction about she which make it seem that she could not be a ordinary sort of person you have never hear of a mere miss smith or mr brown yet all the swell on board have be duly account for and recognize she be not one of they what a pretty girl people say and she seem to be travel alone unless she friend be too sick to come out of they cabin apparently she have not even bring a maid -- yet what lovely clothes she have though so simple and all black perhaps she be in mourn for she father or she mother or some near relation she be too young to be a widow angelum do not much mind these glance or this gentle curiosity for no normal woman object to be think pretty but it be delightful to feel sure that no one know who she be if she be on the passenger-list as the princess di sereno she would be more stare at and bother than that poor fat duchess of dorsetshire who be too near-sighted to recognize she at a distance thank goodness each glance throw she way would have be a annoyance for there would have be nothing flattering in any spice of interest she title give some silly creature might have stare at she because she be a princess but -- far worse -- other would have look because they know all about she these would have buzz : why that be the princess di sereno do not you know the only child of the californium millionaire who die about ten year ago so suddenly while he wife and little daughter be in europe the girl marry that roman prince paolo di sereno who use to make such a sensation go about in a aeroplane and gamble high at monte carlo -- awfully handsome man a lot older than she he must have be nearly forty and she seventeen when she marry he she mother make the match of course : girl just out of school -- the wedding be not six week after she be present in england the prince meet she there have english relation like most of the roman nobility but the interesting part of the story be this : they never live together as husband and wife the bride either find out some secret the prince have keep from she -lrb- which be what people believe -rrb- or else there be a mysterious row the first hour after the wedding anyhow something happen he go off the same day and leave she with she mother afterward he come back but it be a open secret that the two be no more than stranger or you might say polite acquaintance though they live at opposite end of he palace in rome which she money restore and he country place near frascatus there be never the least scandal only wild curiosity now she have cut the whole thing apparently could not stand the empty sort of life or else he do something worse than usual at which she draw the line angelum do not much care whether people in rome know the truth or not that no longer greatly matter to she because she mean never never to go back to rome or to see paolo di sereno or any of he friend -- who have never really be she friend but she do not want people on the ship to know because she be tire of be talk about and she hope be to begin a new and different life for herself she have nothing to conceal but she have never feel any pride or pleasure in be a princess and after the flattery and disillusion the misery and foolish extravagance of the last hateful brilliant six year everything connect with they and the historic title she dead father 's money have buy be be eagerly obliterate by franklin merriam 's daughter she know little about she forebear on she father 's side except that they be english whereas paolo have century behind he cram full of glorious ancestor whose deed be celebrate on tapestry of great beauty and value she one tolerable memory of paolo be that he have never touch she hand since they marriage but the memory of she father be sacred she adore he and be never weary of recall thing he have say to she pleasure he have plan for she as a child and above all he story of californium whither she be now bind angelum have take the name of mr may may because may be she birth-month and also she middle name give by she father whereas angelum have be she mother 's choice therefore she be just superstitious enough to feel that may might bring happiness since she father 's memory be the single unshadowed spot in she life of twenty-three year a brilliant life it would have seem to most woman one to be envy but angelum could not see why the lash which shaded she slate-gray eye have that upward curl which show a undying sense of humor and she have be a merry little girl with flash of wit which have enchant franklin merriam before she be snatch away to europe at eleven never to see he again even at school where she have be dump -lrb- as mr merriam 's intimate enemy put it -rrb- angelum have keep the girl laugh now though she have imagine she gay spirit dead with childhood she begin to be visit by its ghost she amuse herself on shipboard with a thousand thing and a thousand thought which make she feel the best of chum with she new friend and companion angelum may i have come back from twenty-three to seventeen she think and pretend that there have never be a angelum di sereno that scornful young person who have forbid the prince to come near she on learn that there be another whom he should have marry instead of millionaire merriam 's daughter when she be a little girl in boston -lrb- where mr merriam have insist upon living -rrb- angelum use to sit on she father 's knee and as he curl she yellow hair over he finger he weave romance of the golden west reluctantly desert for he wife 's sake and though many illusion have break like bright bubble this ideal still glitter before angelum 's eye she have be promise by she father that she should visit californium with he when mother bring she back from europe but he have die and mother have not bring she back so now she be go to make the pilgrimage alone not only do she intend to see the place she father have describe but when she have see all and could choose she mean to buy land and make a home for herself she first real home wherever she decide to live the house must be like the one where she father have be bear -- long and low build of adobe there must be a patio with a fountain in the middle and the room must be keep cool by the roof of a veranda shade the window like a great overhang eyelid lovely flower she would have of course but the garden must be as unlike a italian garden as possible italy be beautiful but she do not wish to be remind of that country or any other in europe where she have wander in search of forgetfulness she have little fear that ghost of the past would come to haunt she in she new home for though the prince di sereno have once care for she in he way she have strike at he pride and make he hate she in the end at last he have be glad to let she go out of he life for she have make arrangement by which he keep more than half she money there be no danger that he would try to snatch she back again and as for european friend and acquaintance it be unlikely that such worldly person would care to come to the place she mean to select it would be far from the path of tourist the eight-day voyage pass pleasantly for angelum she have speak to no one except steward and stewardess for take she meal on deck she have not come into contact with other passenger the mourning she wear for she mother who have die four month before in london seem to set she apart from other though have it not be for the cause of she mourning probably she would not now be on she way to america it be a few week after mr merriam 's death when she have recover from the shock which be hardly sorrow that angelum say to herself : now she be beyond be grieve by anything i do and i can go away -- for good for the girl have be under the frail cold woman 's sway as the strong man franklin merriam have be in he time and mr merriam have derive such pleasure from have a daughter who be a princess di sereno that angelum could hardly have find courage to deprive she of it at home both in the country and at she palace in rome the princess have be wait on by two french maid one of whom dress she while the other keep she belongings in order when she travel as she often do one or both go with she to egypt to algeria to russium to pari or to england but mr may have no maid and landing in new york it seem that she be the only person who do not meet with a welcome from friend on the dock suddenly she cease to enjoy she isolation for the first time since leave rome on a long visit to relative in america -lrb- accord to newspaper paragraph -rrb- the princess di sereno do not hug she loneliness and she secret she hardly know what to do as she stand under the big letter m wait to have she luggage examine she fellow m 's as well as all the other letter appear to be have desperate trouble with the custom-house man who claw out the contents of they trunk and then calmly leave the cowed owner to stuff everything back as best they could angela 's heart beat fast when she turn come and she wish for long-nosed hard-voiced josephine as a bulwark but the ordeal be not as bad as she expect she look at she inquisitor with the air of a hunt child who have get lose and hardly hope ever to be find so the protective instinct be arouse and the wind be temper to the shear lamb in half a hour after the ship have dock mr may be inquire of a large oblige irishman -lrb- who have a vast store of knowledge concern all useful subject -rrb- how on earth she be to secure a cab she hotel be decide upon and room engage a old friend of mr merriam a cosmopolitan american woman have once praise the hotel valmont angelum have remember and drive from twenty-third street up into the forty new york be almost as strange to she as if she have never see it before indeed she have see little of it for the merriam have live in boston and angelum be only eleven when she bid she father and america good-bye how vividly that day come back to she now she could see she father and feel he kiss as he say never mind little girl when mother bring you back then we 'll have the time of we life -- just you and i -- in californium together but that day do not bear thinking of and by and by rattle through the bright busy street in the vivify sunshine she begin to feel happy again as well as very young and eager this be the gate of my future and i be drive into it she think the hotel valmont which mr corning have say be small loomed impose to angelum 's eye as she taxicab stop before the ever-revolving glass wheel of the fifth avenue door the building tower to a height of sixteen or seventeen storey at least and appear only a lesser mountain among mountain a polite man in livery bow she through the swift whirl of the glass wheel and she find herself in a large hall with floor and wall of marble formally cut laurel-tree grow in huge pot and the gilded ceiling be higher than those of the palazzo di sereno there be many desk and she explain to one of a dozen clerk that she be mrs av may who have cable for a bedroom and sitting-room she be expect and she suite be ready would she kindly register and the young man admire the face frame in gold hair and black straw push forward a ponderous volume that lay open on the counter as angelum pull off she glove and take the pen she lay down a gold chain-bag which she always carry hang on she arm angelum be use to it and she have no idea that it might be consider ostentatious in travel it be convenient as well as pretty which be all she think of nor do she notice that several person group near the desk look at she and at the bag which be edge with diamond and sapphire a diamond or two and a sapphire or two sparkle and gleam on she finger as she write but except for she ring and a small plain brooch she have no jewellery which be mean to show under the black chiffon of she blouse however there be a glimmer of pearl which she wear night and day for safety mr a v may she write then pause before give herself a habitation everybody else on the page be place as well as name london be as good a background as any for a unknown mr may so she provide herself with it and then move she arm abruptly she gold bag fall on the floor naturally a man who have be lean on the counter look at angelum spring to pick it up but another man be before he pull off a wide-brimmed gray hat which have be push to the back of he head he hold out the gold bag a little awkwardly i guess you drop this lady he say angelum be on the point of laugh she be use to drop she bag a dozen time a day and have some one pick it up for she but it have be funny to see it snap away by this tall oddly clad fellow from under the dapper gentleman 's rather sharp nose of course she do not laugh but smile gratefully instead and she could not help stare a little at the retriever of she lose property so also do the other and smaller man stare this person be well dress and have a slight pointed moustache like a german officer 's yes it be mine thank you very much say angelum and she think : what a extraordinary-looking man but how handsome he might be dress for a play -- only somehow he do not look like a actor whatever he be he be the real thing the wide gray sombrero remain in the young man 's hand he be so tall that he make most of those stand near look insignificant yet they on the other hand make he conspicuous it be a long way up to he face but when angelum 's eye have climb to that height she see that it be attractive and the eye splendid even compelling so that it be difficult to remove hers at once and discreetly from they influence the type of man be new to she and the look which he give she be new somehow he be a wild uncivilized kind of handsomeness she think like that of a noble untame creature of the forest change by enchantment into a man and thrust into modern clothes yet the look he give she be not uncivilize only surprised rather boyish and as if the brilliant eye have suddenly light upon something good which they have be seek very odd and a little exciting angelum find the look if the young man 's clothes be modern they be far from be fashionable not at all the sort of clothes to suit the background of a marble hall in a new york hotel he shirt be of some soft white material which do not seem to be starch and a low collar be turn down over a black loosely tie cravat like a sailor 's instead of a waistcoat he wear a leather belt of the sort in which one would quite expect to see a knife or revolver sticking out he blue serge suit be of a country cut the trousers rather short and tight for the long straight leg and the shoe be wide in the toe thick in the sole all these detail angelum note in one quick glance and admire the tall brown eccentricity as she might have admire a fine bronze statue out of place in the wrong surroundings she wonder from what sort of niche the statue have transplant itself in she mind there be no room whatever for the little man with the pointed moustache so she forget he existence mighty pleased to -- do any service for you lady stammer the bronze statue and though he voice be pleasant it have not the culture accent to which angelum be accustomed besides it be quaint to be address as lady london cabbie and beggar call one lidy but they be a law unto themselves still it sound rather nice as he say it : pleased to do any service for you lady she nod politely as she move away follow the bellboy who have the key of she room and as she reach the lift something make she glance back the sombrero be on the dark head again and the head be bent over the hotel register where mr may have write she name the man be either look at that or write he own angelum incline to the latter supposition probably this wild creature of forest have just arrive in new york from somewhere very far away perhaps from she father 's golden west the country of the sun as the lift flash she with horrifying swiftness up to the twelfth floor she still seem to hear the echo of the pleasant voice say pleased to do any service for you lady a few minute later however she forget the incident of the drop bag in admire she pretty suite of white and green room the bath and the cedar-lined wardrobe in the wall which she remember as typically american she feel like a child examine a new playhouse suddenly she be sure that she would get on well with american that she would like they and they she though until to-day she have be afraid that she country-people in they own land would seem to she like stranger although she have not make up she mind how long she would stay in new york before go west she unpack a great many thing without stop to think that perhaps she be give herself useless trouble then when she have scatter quantity of dress petticoat hat and cloak in both room she pause bewildered everything she have take out on shipboard look wrinkled and rather haggard she wish after all that she have bring josephine though she have not be fond of she or of the other she do not know what to do with the thing and never could she get they all back again when it should be time to leave the hotel it be as josephine have prophesy how the frenchwoman would enjoy say it be as i warn madame la princesse perhaps a servant of the hotel would help I she think and a call through the telephone bring to the door a tall dark irish girl who would have be pretty if she eye and cheek have not be stain with cry at first glance angelum be interested for she be begin to be happy and could not bear to think that any one who come near she be miserable at all time too she have quick sympathy and could read the secret of sad or happy eye in a flash as she pass they in the street though less sensitive person see nothing noteworthy and often she long to hurry back to some stranger as if a voice have cry after she which she could not let cry in vain now as she talk to the maid about the unpack unspoken sympathy go out from she in a magnetic current which the irish girl feel she tear-blurred blue eye fix themselves on the young lady in black and she have a strong exciting impression that some blessing hover near she which she could take hold of if only she have courage indeed miss i 'll love to help you she say ` twill be a rale pleasure -- and not many come my way these day i be sorry for that angelum tell she perhaps you be homesick i think you must have come not long ago from a green island which every one love you be right miss the irish eye brim over and i be homesick enough to die but not so much fur oireland as fur a place i niver set eye on angelum be interested you be homesick for a place you never set eye on then some one you love must be there this time the tear could not be keep back the young woman have begin she work of gather up angelum 's belongings and lest the tear should fall on a lace nightgown she be folding she lay it on a chair to search wildly for she handkerchief do excuse I if ye can miss she choke i have no right to make a fool o ' meself in front of you but you be that kind i get fill up like it be the state of oregon i

so far west the man you come from ireland to marry will surely send for you then how happy you 'll be by and by a long by and by i be afraid miss oh why be not there money enough angelum begin to plan how she might make the course of true love run smooth though in these day she be not as rich as she have be there be to begin with the girl answer you see miss he send for I to meet he in new york and 'twa he pay I way over he would buy land in oregon and irritated it as they call it -- and be doin ' wonderful the idea be he should meet I at the ship and we would get marry and go west man and wife but he partner cheat he out of he eye and the trick only come out when i be on the water so instead o ' findin ' I tim i find a letter the poor boy 's have to start all over again and i tuk service waitin ' till he can scrape up the money to fetch I out i may be go quite near oregon myself before long say angelum impulsively do you think you could learn to be my maid and would you like to go with I like it the girl echo turn white and then red ` twould be heaven i be not too happy here the housekeeper 's get a ` clow ' on I and indade i have do a bit of maidin ' to a lady in the ould

sure ma'am but 'twa because ye look so young it never enter I head ye could be marry and perhaps even a widow angelum do not speak and at once the girl make sure that she have hit upon the truth with she last word the lovely lady be in black for she husband to whom she must have be marry when almost a child my name 's kate mcginni ma'am she go quickly on and though i have get no recommendation in writin ' because i think to take a husband and not service i can get a good word from the priest and -- you face tell I enough angelum break in i know you be a good girl and that you 'll be a comfort

ticket will be off we mind oh but do not it seem too good to be true why not say too good _ not _ to be true ask angelum whose optimism to-day be ready to triumph over past stumbling-block it be settle then -- if the hotel will let you off i have giv ' in I notice miss -- madam i mean reply the girl hastily there be some thing i do not think tim would like about I bein ' in a hotel and i be lookin ' out for a private place I time 's up here day after to-morrow but oh ma'am there be a thing i have not tell ye -- indade 'twa because i forget not that i mean to desave maybe when ye know

they i like you for you loyalty she say and i shall like timmy too cat be misunderstand people they can be splendid friend and black cat be suppose to bring luck i should love to have timmy bring _

i be afraid I name would be as black in yer eye as the cat so that be why i break it to ye gently and now i be reward for everything angelum laugh again i fancied i be all alone in the world she say to herself and here i be collect a family she have luncheon bring to she own sitting-room when kate have put away everything and go quantity of flower she order too -- american beauty rose which look extraordinarily intelligent and companionable she think then most of the afternoon she spend in pore over map plan what she call she pilgrimage and a little before six she be ready to go down and buy she ticket west at the travel bureau which she hear exist in the hotel afterward she mean to take a stroll and see fifth avenue by sunset not once since enter she room have she consciously remember the bronze statue in the marble hall however she recall he and think most likely he be out amusing himself and see new york but no there he be sit rather dejectedly in a large rocking-chair and as she eye find he he find she instantly he whole aspect change the statue come to life he listless expression brighten to the puzzling intentness with which he have look at she in the morning as she pass near he on she way to the travel bureau he get up and stand like a soldier at attention see this angelum go by quickly without seem to glance at he for she be afraid that he mean to speak and she hope that he would not for she do not want to snub he she need not have fear however he make no sign but look at she as if she be a pass queen for whom it be a man 's duty and pleasure to get to he foot angelum would have bow in recognition of the morning 's courtesy but dare not lest after all he should be encourage to speak for he type be so new to she that she do not understand it in the least it be however rather a agreeable mystery and she see he feature by feature without appear to lift she eye it be too bad that he have be foolish enough to discard he become costume of the morning for a conventional suit of clothes which it be painfully certain he must have buy ready-made the thing do not fit too well though they have probably cost a good deal and they be astonishingly like advertisement of man 's clothes which angelum have see in american magazine on shipboard they do they best to give he he money 's worth by spoil he splendid look and turn he into something different from what nature have intend he broad shoulder be increase in size by the padded cutaway coat until they seem out of proportion he collar be a inch too high and he be evidently wretched in it also he have the look in he eye of a man whose boot be so tight that he wish to die he fancy waistcoat and maroon necktie must have be force upon he by a ruthless salesman who would stop at no crime in the way of trade and the consciousness of these atrocity and the largeness of he scarf-pin have reduce the poor fellow to the depths of gloom in one hand he hold a pair of yellowish kid glove which hang limp and feeble like the dead body of small animal and on the floor near he foot as if draw attention to the brilliance of he patent-leather shoe be the latest extravagance in silk hat my spoilt statue angelum think i believe he be as sorry for himself as i be for he who know though perhaps i be mistaken and he be as proud as punch in that case i give he up but she would not have believe any one who have tell she that she and she alone be the cause of the tragic change he have wish to appear well in she eye and have go about it in the way that seem best v what happen in the night walk down fifth avenue after buy ticket via washington and new orlean to lo angele mr may happen to see a poster advertising a recital by a violinist she have always contrived to miss at once she decide to go and as it be for that night there be just time to hurry back to the hotel dine and dress she be lucky enough to get a box in which she sit hide behind curtain and the evening would have be a success if the carriage order to take she home have not be delay by a slight accident she have to wait for it and be much later than she have expect to be in get back to the hotel theater be over supper be be eat in the loui seize restaurant into which angelum could see as she get into the lift and upstairs shoe have already be put outside bedroom door in front of the one next she own she see two pair which make she smile a little for though she could not be certain she fancy that she recognize they one pair be stout unfashionable make for country wear the other look several size smaller glitter with the uncompromising newness of patent leather and be ultra smart in shape poor statue she say to herself if they be he how dreadfully the new one must have hurt he then she go into she own room where kate presently come to undress she with affectionate if inexperienced hand angelum be still excite by all the event of the day she first in she own country since childhood and fancy that she would not be able to sleep but soon she forget everything and lay dead to the world very still very white in the light that steal through the window very beautiful drown in the wave of she hair then at last she begin to dream of italy that she be there that she have never come away and that there be no escape she moan faintly in she sleep and rouse herself enough to know that she be dream try to wake and succeed breathing hard after she fight to conquer the dream it be not true she tell herself press she face caressingly against the pillow because it be a american pillow not a italian one in the palazzo di sereno and because it make she feel safe so she lay for a minute or two comforting herself with the thought that all bad and frightening thing be leave behind in the past with a door double-locked by a golden key shut forever between it and she nothing disagreeable could happen now and she be fall asleep once more when a slight noise make she heart jump then she and she heart both keep very still for it seem that the noise be in the room not far from she bed it come again and angelum realize that it be at one of the two window both of which be open at she request kate have pull the dark blind halfway up and angelum would have laugh at the suggestion that a thief could creep into a room on the twelfth story nevertheless the night glow of the great city silhouette the figure of a man black against the shine of the half-raised window-pane it be kneel on the wide stone sill outside and slowly with infinite caution be push the heavy window-sash up higher so that it might be possible to crawl underneath and slip into the room as she stare incredulous at first then drive to believe angelum guess how the seem miracle have be perform the man have creep along the cornice which belt the wall on a level a few foot lower than the line of the window-sill she remember notice this as one suddenly recall some forget detail in a photograph a clever thief might make the perilous passage help himself along by one window-sill after another until he reach the one he want angelum turn sick she first thought being of the immense drop from she window to the ground if he should fall be the word that spring to she lip then she remember that it would be better for she if he should fall he mean to rob and perhaps to murder she she ought to wish that he might slip but she seem to hear a crash to see a sight of horror and could not make the wish she lay motionless she thought confuse by the knock of she heart if she jump out of bed and run across the room to the telephone the man could see she then know that she be awake and caution on he part unnecessary he would fling up the window jump in and choke she into silence what can i do she ask herself in two or three minute more the slow stealthy lifting of the window-sash would be finish and the thief would be in the room she ring and she gold bag with a good deal of money in it lay on the dressing-table if only he would be satisfy with these she might lie still and let he act but she watch be under the pillow and she pearl be round she throat the pearl be worth far more than the bag and the black shadow out there must know that she have many thing worth take or it would not be at she window now what can i do suddenly she think of a thing she could do and without stop to ask whether there be something else better she lean out of bed and knock on the door between she room and the next the door be fasten but rap with one hand with the other she slip back the bolt quick -- quick -- help she call a thief be get in at my window there be a faint click the switching on of electric light the swift push back of a bolt and the door fly open the shoe she have see in the hall have tell she the truth it be the man she expect who stand for the fifth part of a second in the doorway of she darkened room then lithe and noiseless as a indian make for the window the thief be take completely by surprise when angelum suddenly cry out he have be in the act of let himself down to the floor by slip under the window-sash raise just high enough for he to squeeze through he have half turn on the wide ledge so as to get he leg through first and land on he knee therefore he be seize at a disadvantage the most agile gymnast could not have pull himself back from under the window-frame balance he body steadily again on the stone ledge outside and have begin to crawl away toward safety all in those few seconds before the cry and its answer he do he snaky practice best but it be not quite good enough the man from the next room be too quick for he and he be catch like a rat in a trap angelum sit up in bed watch the thing do not seem real at all it be but a scene in a play the black figure drag along the floor like a parcel then jerk to its foot to have both arm pinion behind its back and in a brief moment with scarce a sound the light from the next room let she see the two man clearly : the tall one in pajamas as he must have spring out of bed at she call : the little one in black with a mask of crape or some thin material over the upper part of he face now in the silent struggle the mask have become disarrange to show a small light pointed moustache she recognize it and know in a instant why she have be think worth rob this be the creature who have try to pick up she gold bag he have see she ring and perhaps have spy the pearl take care she gasp a warning he may have a revolver as she speak she sink back on the pillow feel suddenly limp and powerless as she lay drown in the long wave of hair that flow round she like moonlight the little sneak will not get to draw it if he have say the tall man in a tone so quiet that angelum be strike with surprise it seem wonderful that one who have just fight as he have could have keep control of breath and head he voice do not even sound excited though here be tremble do not be scare he go on the mean galoot a prairie-dog could tear he to piece i be not frighten -- now she answer oh thank you for come you have save my life can not i help i might go to the telephone and call -- no do nothing of the sort she neighbor command there must be no ructions in you room i be go to take this thing to my quarter the story 'll be he be get into my window when i wake up and nab he oh exclaim angelum rouse to understanding and appreciation for I that would be good -- but for you -- for I it be all right too and you do not come on in this act lady he 'll tell she say i guess not not unless he be in a hurry to see what it be like down where he go next if he so much as peep while i be in reach i 'll shake he till he spine stick out of he head like a telegraph-pole or if he wait till he think i can not get at he i 'll scatter he over the landscape with my gun if i fire across a court-room he see i be the kind of man to keep my word these threat be utter in the same quiet voice and the speaker go on in a different tone i 'll tell you what you _ can _ do lady if you do not mind i hate to trouble you but maybe ` twould be best for I not to try it with one hand and he in the other if you would slip into my room and push up the window nearest this way a few inch higher it would bear I out better when i say he come through there angela sit up again and reach out for she white silk dressing-gown which lay across the foot of the bed wrap it hastily round she she run into she neighbor 's room as she flash by he where he stand hold he captive he think more and more of he angel vision with the moonlight hair and it seem a strange almost miraculous coincidence that he should behold it in real life after describe he dream to carmen gaylor the nearest window angelum repeat respect the man 's shrewdness and presence of mind the nearest window be the one to open because the thief have come crawl along in that direction on the cornice and soon it would be find out which room he have occupy since he must be stay in the hotel she push up the heavy sash already raise some inch and turn saw that the silent sulky prisoner have be drag in by she champion thank you lady say the latter briskly now you just go back to sleep and forget this -- cut it out the rest 's my business but -- how can i let you have all this trouble on you shoulder stammer angelum you 'll have to bear witness against he there 'll be a trial or something you may be delay keep from do thing you want to do -- you can sure bet there be nothing on god 's earth i want to do so much as keep a lady out of this business she neighbor assure she now go back to you room please and lock you door they eye meet and angelum feel herself thrill with admiration of this new type which have set she wonder the forest creature turn into a man be a man indeed good night then she say i can not thank you enough -- for everything she flit away she small bare foot show white and pink under the lace of night-dress and dressing-gown she lock she door obediently as she have be tell but she do not go back to bed or try to forget there be a big easy chair not far from the door she have just close and she subside into it limply realize that she have go through a strenuous experience huddle there a minute later she hear she neighbor 's voice speak through the telephone and be consume with curiosity as to how he be keep the wriggle prisoner quiet he must have contrived to tie the wretch somehow she tell herself or perhaps he be strong enough to hold he with one hand he be the sort of man who would always think of a expedient and know how to carry it out it seem dreamlike that such a scene as she imagination picture be really pass in the next room where all be so quiet save for the calm voice talk at the telephone and angelum could not help listen anxiously hope to catch a few word after the first murmur at the telephone through the thick mahogany door there fall a silence more exciting to the listener than the indistinct sound have be then suddenly there be a stir and the mumble of several heavy hushed voice after that dead silence again which remain unbroken evidently the police have be send for have come have listen to the story of the attempt theft as tell by the thief 's captor angelum be sure he version have not be contradict or she would certainly have hear a shot the forest creature would have keep he word but he have not be tempt and the thief have be carry away angela wonder whether she neighbor have go too -- or whether he remain in the next room take he own advice to she and try to forget she would not be surprise if he be able to sleep quite calmly vi when the table be turn next morning angelum say nothing to kate of what have happen in the night she thought be full of the affair but since the true version be to be suppress it would be better to have no confidant she ask however to see a morning paper and when it come be disappoint to find no paragraph concern the thief at the hotel valmont she do not know anything about the making of newspaper but take it for grant that the story have be too late for press and become very eager to meet she neighbor that she might hear all at first hand from he she pass he hurriedly the day before she head bent because she be afraid he mean to speak and she would have to snub he but now the table be turn she dress and go down early make a excuse to glance over a quantity of magazine and papers in the big hall hope that he might appear but he do not it be almost she tell herself as if he be punish she for avoid he yesterday by pay she back in she own coin not that she believe he be really do so yet it be extremely aggravating that he should keep out of the way he ought to have understand that she would want to know what happen after the first chapter of the story be bring to a close by the shut of the door because she be wait for he -lrb- whether she acknowledge this or not -rrb- and because he do not come angelum thought of the man every moment without be able to put he out of she mind he have show such astonishing tact as well as pluck last night and be so good-looking that he very lack of cultivation make he more interesting as a study she would have like to ask the hotel people about he whence he come and what be he name but of course she do nothing of the sort all she do be to make various pretext for linger in the hall till nearly luncheon time and then the arrival of evening papers partly explain to she mind the mystery of the man 's absence also they make she a present of he name and a few other personal item nick hilliard of californium make hotel thief feel small be the head of a conspicuous half-column which catch she eye the say thief it seem be know to friend and enemy as officer dutchy he have work with success in chicago and the middle west but be a comparative stranger in new york he claim to have be a officer in the german army but probably lie though he have evidently be a soldier at one time he have numerous alias and speak with a german accent he name appear on the register of the valmont as count von osthaven and he admit a attempt to enter the room occupy by mr hilliard have reach it by a daring passage along a stone cornice from he own window four room to the leave on the twelfth storey the case against officer dutchy would be a interesting one as he previous career be -- accord to the reporter -- full of good story mr hilliard be hope however that it might be hurry on and off take up as little time as possible as he have use for every moment other than hang about a court-room give evidence bear in new york he have go west while a boy and have never since be in the east till a day or two ago when he have arrive from the neighborhood of bakersfield californium with the avowed intention of enjoy himself naturally he do not want to have he enjoyment curtail by business angelum feel guilty it be she fault that the poor young man 's holiday be spoil she ought not to have let he take she burden on he shoulder but it be too late to repent now she could not come forward and tell the real story for that would do he harm since it would differ from he version she could atone only by show she gratitude in some way because he come from californium she long to show how friendly and kind she could be to a man of she father 's country -- a man worthy of that country and its tradition she begin to think she lunch in a quiet corner of the restaurant but mr nickson hilliard of californium do not show himself and at last angelum go up to she own room disappointed hardly have she close the door however when a knock send she fly to open it again a bellboy have bring a note and she spring to the conclusion that it must be from mr hilliard he have find out she name and have write to tell what have happen behind the closed door -- the loose end of the story which the newspaper have not get never would get from any one concerned but the bright pink of excitement and interest which have spring to she face die away as she open the envelope and glance down the first page of the letter which be head doctor beal 's nursing home she read : madam : i be request by mr henry morehouse of san francisco to express he regret at not be able to meet you ship and offer he service as he hope to do at the request of he elder brother mr jame morehouse of the fidelity trust bank san francisco mr h morehouse be come east on law business when he brother suggest that he make himself useful to you and he be look forward to do so have know the late mr franklin merriam on start however mr morehouse be far from well and find himself so much worse on reach new york that he be oblige to consult a doctor the result be a immediate operation of appendicitis this be perform successfully yesterday and mr morehouse feel strong enough to express -lrb- through I -rrb- he regret wish to explain why he fail in case he brother may have let you know that he intend to meet you yours faithfully n millar -lrb- nurse in doctor beal 's private hospital -rrb- mr jame morehouse -lrb- in whose bank there be fund for mr may -rrb- have not inform she of he brother 's intention and though she be sorry to hear of the poor man 's suffering she could not regret he failure to meet she at the ship she do not wish to be help nor tell how to see thing nor be personally conduct to californium she enjoy be free and vague able to stop as long or as short a time as she like on the way she want to see only place which she _ want _ to see not place which she ought to want to see for there be sure to be a difference \* \* \* \* \* nevertheless she write a gracious answer to the letter and order flower send to doctor beal 's nursing home for mr henry morehouse then she proceed to forget he unconscious of the direct influence he illness be to have upon she future she think far more about mr nickson hilliard whom she have avoid yesterday and who seem to avoid she to-day the fact that the letter which have bring color to she face be from a strange unwanted mr morehouse vex the princess unreasonably with nickson hilliard who ought to have write if he could not call to tell he story and when she hear nothing from he see nothing of he it be in resentment that she leave new york next morning though it be entirely subconscious the real thought in she mind be : since he do not choose to take the chance when he have it now he sha not have it at all for a woman of twenty-three be very young it be annoy to be cut off in the midst of a adventure by the hero of the adventure when you have flatter yourself that the poor fellow be yearning to know you if angelum be unjust to hilliard she be not a isolate instance for all woman be unjust to all man especially to those in whom they be begin to take a interest angelum do not know that she be interested in nickson hilliard and would have laugh if any one have suggest the idea from a personal point of view but in she social reign as the princess di sereno she have be a good deal spoil -- by every one except the prince vaguely and like a petted child she have take it for grant that all man be glad to be nice to she and she think the forest creature be show himself a backwoods creature -- rude and unenlightened angelum love the sea and choose to travel on it whenever she could the trip from new york to new orlean be even more interesting than she have expect from tale of she father 's for the ship steam along the coast in blue and golden weather turn into the gulf of mexico after round the long point of florida cut the silk woof of azure day by day a great longing to be happy knock at angelum 's heart like something unjustly imprison demand to be let out she have never feel it so strongly before it must be she think the tonic of the air which make she conscious of youth and life eager to have thing happen and be in the midst of they but kate be a comfort almost a friend and timmy the cat be a priceless treasure no town in america perhaps could have contrast more sharply with new york than new orlean angelum feel this even as the ship move slowly along the great canal and slip into the dark turbid gold of the mississippus river the drowsy landscape on either side be southern landscape and among live-oaks drape with mourning flag of moss and magnolia-trees gemm with bud there be planter ' house which seem all roof and balcony buzzard fly up suddenly out of rice-field as the ship round a curve -- creature big and long-legged as the stork of holland and algerium the wharf when the ship dock at last be fill with bale of cotton and it be as if all the negro in america must have come down to meet the boat she might have be walk into a old story of cable 's in the day befoh the wah she idea have be to travel on to the west next day but new orlean hold she she have leave the old world eagerly for the new but this bit of the old in the midst of the new make she feel as if she have stumble into a ancient spanish court in the middle of a modern skyscraper the contrast be sharp as the impress of a old seal in new wax and angelum love it she like she hotel too and say but half-heartedly each morning to-morrow i 'll go on with kate for duenna she wander through street which though they have historic french name remind she more of spain than of france with they row of balcony and glimpse of flowery patio pave with mossy stone or crack but still beautiful tile she make friend with a elderly french shopkeeper of the vieux carré who look as if carve out of ivory and yellowed with age he business be the selling of curiosity antique furniture bring in sailing ship from france when new orlean be in the make quaintly set jewel worn by famous beauty of the great old day brocade and velvet which have be they ball dress book which have andrew jackson 's name on yellow fly-leaf weird souvenir from the haunt house where terrible madame lalaurie tortured slave to death fetish which have belong to marie laveau the voodoo queen stick and stone of the varnished house where loui philippe live and letter write by nichola girod who plot to rescue napoleon from st helena and spirit he across the sea to new orlean the selling of these thing or rather the collect of they be the pleasure as well as the business of monsieur bienvenu and he have store in he mind as many legend of the old town as he have store treasure in he low-browed musky-smelling shop angelum spend she morning listen to he tale of slave-day and always she buy something before she bid he _ au revoir _ in the parisian french which enchant the old man you light up my place madame he say and insist with graceful gesture that she should not pay for she collection of old miniature necklace gilded crystal bottle illuminate book and ivory crucifix until the day fix for she departure once you pay madame you may not come again he smile i be superstitious i will not take you money till the last moment on the third day however angela decide that she must go she father 's country call with a voice she could hear above the music of the southern town the laughter of the pretty french girl and the chatter of black and brown baby who babble a language which be neither french spanish nor english but a mixture of all she buy more thing of monsieur bienvenu and also in other curiosity shop which she dare not mention to he since he one fail be a bitter jealousy of rival where be my gold bag kate have you get it she ask when the moment come to pay a hundred dollar for two or three snuff-box pick up in a place she have not visit until that day no ma'am you have it on yer arm when i notice last say kate look startled fur all the saint i hope ye have not lose it angelum too begin to look anxious not only be she bag valuable -- worth seven or eight hundred dollar -- but all she money be in it and a check-book she have bring out that morning to pay monsieur bienvenu the rather large sum she owe he still she be not greatly distressed she have lose that gold bag so many time have drop it from she lap when she get up leave it in motor-car or lie on the floor in friend ' house and always it have come back to she she cheer herself therefore by say that to-day would be no exception let I think where be we last kate she wonder the shop where i buy the lilac and silver steal be not it yes ma'am it be and indade if ye 'll not mind my sayin ' so i begged ye not to go in there the place look so disrespectable as if there might be measles or ` most anything and the man himself come poppin ' out to entice ye in like the spider with the fly we must go back at once and see if i leave the bag after pay for the steal say angelum and explain to the late owner of the snuff-box she hurry out with kate leave she parcel to be call for little mr isaac cohensohn of the brocade shop make a search but could not find the miss trinket unfortunately a number of people have be in since the lady leave stranger to he if madam be sure she have go out of the shop without the bag why somebody must have take it since then the question be who but she must apply to the police if only i have not stuff in that check-book angelum say to kate perhaps they would have cash a check in the hotel anyhow monsieur bienvenu would have take one for what i owe he now i be in the most horrid scrape i do not know how i be go to get out of it they walk back toward the shop of the snuff-box gloomily discuss the situation which be complicate by the fact that grow cautious since the attempt burglary at the valmont angelum have leave she most valuable jewellery in a bank at new york it be to be send on insure only when she finish she travel and settle down i 'll have to call the police i suppose she say though it be sure to do no good i shall never see my bag again i can telegraph to have the check stop at the san francisco bank but i have nearly five hundred dollar in the purse what shall i do about my hotel bill and everything and my railway ticket we 'll have to stay till i can get money suddenly because it seem impossible she want passionately to start at once always she have hate postpone thing somehow i _ will _ go she say to herself i do not know how -- but i will and she walk on with kate back to the hotel remember how she have tell the head clerk that this be she last day -- she be give up the room to-morrow and the hotel be cram because there be a convention of some sort it might be that she suite be already let for the next day she go to the desk ask abruptly if i find that i need to stop longer be my room free for to-morrow unfortunately we have just let they -- not as a suite but separately say the young man this be a big week for the crescent city you know and we have get people sleep in bathroom what shall i do angelum exclaim trouble break down reserve all my money and a check-book i have in my gold bag have be steal i 'll have to telegraph my bank and she have vision of be deposit in a bathroom with all she luggage and kate and tim the cat well that be a shame the clerk sympathize i 'll tell you what i can do a gentleman come in about a hour ago say he be look for a friend glance over the register and must have find the name because he be go to stay he be get to sleep in the laundry to-night but he be among those i have allot to you suite to-morrow when he hear a lady want to keep she room he be sure to wait for it i do not like to ask a favor of a stranger angelum hesitate american man do not call thing like that favor when there be a lady in the case reply the clerk it would not do for _ you _ to be in the laundry it be rather unthinkable so when the young man add that the newcomer might be in at any minute for luncheon angelum flit to she own quarter which look more than ever attractive now that they might be snap away from she she descend again soon hope to hear she fate and there by the desk stand mr nickson hilliard he brown face redden at sight of mr may but he do not show surprise see that she intend to recognize he he eye brighten and angelum feel that she too be blush a little she be vex with he still but it would have be stupid as well as ungrateful to show she annoyance except by be elaborately polite after all she owe he gratitude which she have wish for a chance to pay she put out she hand and he radiate joy as he take it happiness be become to nick a all too cordial grip he give then loosen he grasp in a fright i hope i have not hurt you he exclaim horrify angelum laugh only a tiny bit and that be better than a fishy handshake luckily i leave my sharpest ring in new york and oh the gold bag you save be go forever i have just have it steal that be too bad he remark but he do not look cast down i 'll rummage new orlean for it if you give I leave to have a try he volunteer thank you she say but i shall have to tell the police i suppose not that there be much hope you would not let I set the ball rolling would you he ask as if he be beg a favor instead of wish to do one i mean go to the police for you and all that how kind you be exclaim angelum but -- no indeed i will not spoil you visit to new orlean as i do you visit to new york nick look astounded what make you think you spoil my visit to new york here be angelum 's chance for a gentle reproach and she could not resist the temptation of administer it wrap in sugar i do not _ think _ i know and it distressed I very much she say sweetly i read in the papers that you have not be in new york since you be a boy that you be there to ` enjoy yourself ' and all you time be take up with the bother that ought to have be mine you be too busy even to let I hear what happen that night after -- suddenly she be sorry that she have begin it be silly and undignified to reproach he he face grow scarlet as if he be a scold schoolboy too busy he echo why you do not think _ that _ do you you could not what be i to think asked angelum lightly but really what i thought be not worth talk about it may not be to you but it be to I if you do not mind he persist i -- i make sure you would know why i do not -- send you any word or -- or anything but if you do not see it the right way i have get to tell you now it be because -- of course it be because -- i just do not dare butt in i be afraid you would feel if i have the cheek to write a note or follow up and speak to you in the hotel that i be -- kind of takin ' advantage of what be a accident -- my luck in gettin ' a chance to do a little thing for you a mighty small thing ` twould not have be visible except in a high-powered microscope and only then if you look hard for it so i say to myself 'twa enough luck to have have that chance ' i would be a yellow dog to presume on it instantly angelum realize that it be she vanity which have be hurt by he seeming negligence and that it be stroke the right way by this embarrassed explanation she be ashamed of herself for draw it out yet she be pleased because she have be really hurt now that she need not puzzle over the man 's motive she would perhaps cease to think of he but she must be kind just for a minute or two -- to make up for put he in the confessional and to prove the gratitude she wish to show you must be a very modest person if you do not understand that i long to hear -- _ lot _ of thing you would not let the newspaper get hold of she smile of course it be interesting to read about that wretched man -- dutchy or whatever they call he and as he seem to have steal from heap of people i suppose it be well for the world that he 'll be shut up in prison -- although i can not bear the thought of prison for any one it stifle I there ought to be some other kind of punishment but i _ do _ want to know what happen in you room after -- nothing much happen say nick the little beast be all in i would kind of get on he nerve and he know i would dig a hole in the ground with he if he so much as peeped i just round he up and then the police come and play out the rest of the hand as for you spoilin ' my visit to new york why ma'am you _ make _ it i have the time of my life angelum laugh because he call she ma'am -lrb- which be even funnier than lady from the hero who have save she life -rrb- and because all he expression strike she as extremely quaint it be a very short time of you life then i should have think you would want to stay week in new york as you have not be there for so long -- and you would travel so far you see i saw in the paper that you would come from californium and that interested I because my -- because dear friend of mine have tell I so much about californium she do not add that she be on she way there but of course he might suspect meet she in new orlean if he be curious concern she movement i do mean to stay some time when i go east he admit but -- well perhaps i be homesick anyhow i feel as if i would get a hurry call to go home what a odd coincidence we meeting here angela speak out she thought ye-e assent nick i reckon it do seem that way he be interested in the pattern of the carpet if you will not think it a liberty now i _ be _ here he begin again i 'll be mighty glad to try and find you bag if you 'll tell I just how and where you lose it -- angelum shake she head you be not to spend you time fuss with the police as you do in new york but i would like it better than anything he say i do not come to new orlean to see the sight anyhow i 'll feel down and out if you will not let I help ` twill seem as if i would manage wrong in new york oh if you be go to feel like _ that _ and forthwith angelum tell he the story of she loss all you money and a check-book full of blank check he echo yes i have wire already to have the check stop for the bank 's sake but it be a bear and i be fond of that bag besides i have about five hundred dollar in my purse now i shall have to wait here till i can get more you want to go he ask yes -- to-morrow however that do not matter it do if you want to but see here ma'am i have think of something my name be mr may say angelum smile i know -- i mean be you willing i should call you it just as if i be really acquaint with you of course why not well you see he explain what i do not know about society and the right way to act with lady could be put in a book bigger than the bible and i would not offend you for -- for a good deal i feel certain you would know the ` right way to act ' by instinct angelum assure he you be splendid to I that night in new york very few man would have know how to do what you do thank you a thousand time for say that though i do not deserve one word nick burst out flushing again and hope she do not see because he have a try task before he but my idea be this could not you let I lend the money you need and go on when you like instead of wait you could send it back any old way -- check or anything and i would not care a hang -- i would not care a red cent -- when oh i could not -- angelum begin but the look on he face stop she it be so strong a mixture of disappointment and chagrin as to make he instantly pathetic in she eye she have just say that he be a man whose instinct would always be right and she have mean it sincerely she know if she know anything about man that here be one of nature 's gentleman he have prove that already and -- it be a shame to hurt he feeling after all he have do for she i beg you pardon if i have say the wrong thing i mean no harm he apologize warmly but i get left-handed and tongue-tied i guess when it come to be civilized -- where there be a lady in the case it must have be i say it the wrong way for i _ do _ know the thing itself would be right you want to go you have lose you money and i expect you bank would not send it on a telegram they mostly will not that mean wait day perhaps so i think -- it would mean wait she break into he pause my bank be a long way off you be very kind and i _ will _ borrow the money if it will not inconvenience you on condition that -- you let I give you security that would hurt my feeling badly say he but i would rather you would do it than not take the money because you convenience be a heap more important than my feeling if i go i can get money in a few day and wire it back to you here angelum reflect aloud at a loss how to treat the situation when it become a question of hurt mr hilliard 's feeling nick 's face fall i -- unless you give I you order -- i do not want to stay here very long say he i do not care when i get the money back why you have only just arrive have not you ye-e but i feel my homesickness come on again i should not wonder if i 'll always be sort of restless now away from the west it be my country -- anyhow the country of my heart angelum come near say so it be mine but that might have necessitate explanation well you must take the security i be afraid she say or i can not take the loan as i tell you i leave most of my thing in new york to be send on when i settle down still there be _ one _ thing which i could not pawn or leave with hotel people but i would not mind give it to you it be a diamond frame for a miniature i always carry with I i could take the miniature out nick stare hard at the carpet again he be afraid to let she see the look on he face it be she dead husband 's picture he think she must have love he if she always carry he portrait around aloud he say very well if you will not do my way i 'll have to do yours i 'll give you the address of my bank and i must have you address angelum go on then if you should change you mind and stay here -- i be go to stay just long enough to get you bag he reply she laugh that may be forever i reckon it will be some hour at longest you must be a wonderful detective there be more of the bulldog than the detective in I but it will go hard if we do not find that bag thank you again we shall see she say anyway as you be to be my banker i can tell the hotel clerk i sha not need to keep people in bathroom wait for my suite after to-night oh be it you exclaim nick the fellow be tell I a lady want to stay -- then it be _ you _ they have stuff into a laundry i like it nick assure she it be a mighty clean place i wish you could see some of the hole i have sleep in -- that be i _ do not _ wish so but it be all right and now just say how much money you want anything up to three thousand dollar i can give you in a minute -- oh not nearly so much a few hundred but i be go to lunch now would you care to lunch at the same table and we can arrange about the loan also you can tell I more of dutchy i would like it better than anything say nick but first i have get to fix thing about you bag with the police i 'll be back and look you up by the time you be halfway to dessert i remember just what that bag be like because -- maybe you have forget -- i pick it up in the hotel hall when you drop it i can see it as plain as if it be here 'twa a kind of knit gold like chain armor for a doll and there be a rim all smother in diamond and blue stone sapphire say angelum that be right well i 'll be back in twenty minute it be useless to protest against he go for he have go before she could speak and instead of begin luncheon angelum go upstairs to take from its diamond frame she father 's miniature on the gold back of this frame there be a inscription : angelum on she eleventh birthday from she father the day before she sail and it be because of the inscription that she could not have offer the frame to a ordinary person as security no matter how desperately she have want a loan but mr nickson hilliard be not a ordinary person vii a police mystery it be a blow to nick to be tell that there be little hope of find the lose bag he have pledge himself to see the thing through but he have reason -- immensely important reason they seem to he -- for wish to leave new orlean next day so far as be know cohensohn be a honest man there be nothing against he and he shop could not be search by the police all they could do be to get a description of the people who have call between the time of mr may 's go out and come in but ten chance to one like most woman she have mislay she bag somewhere else or leave it at home nick do not like these insinuation against the sex to which a angel deign to belong but he take they quietly and instruct the police to offer five-hundred dollar reward for the bag alone or a thousand with the contents intact then he go back and have lunch with mr may which be without exception the most exquisite experience of he life yet he do not know what he eat or afterward whether he have eat anything at all -- unless it be some bread which with bitter disgust at he bad manners he vaguely remember crumble on the table he be cheer however by a plan he have and by the inscription on angelum 's miniature frame he would have hate the thing if it have be she husband 's evening come and there be no news of the miss bag there be not even any satisfactory clue when nick hear this he think very hard for a few minute and then inquire at what time the shop close he be tell and consult he watch realize that they would shut in less than a hour what be the name of the best jewellery store in this town he want to know there be several which rank about the same and scribble three or four name on he shirt-cuff he rush off to find the first get any gold handbag he ask in a low voice as if he have something to conceal kind make of chain with diamond and sapphire along the top he be show the stock see nothing apparently which strike he fancy and be off like a shot in search of the next name on he list at this place live a bag which so far as he could remember seem the duplicate of mr may 's except that the stone alternate with the diamond be emerald instead of sapphire just keep that thing for twenty minute say he i 'll come back to tell you whether i 'll take it or not and what i want do to it if i do another gentleman be in to-day look at that bag say the attendant if he come before you i must let he have it what price do you make for he ask nick seven hundred and seventy-five dollar be the reply well will you do a little gamble keep it till i come in and if i take it i 'll pay eight hundred if i do not you can have twenty-five dollar interest on you time the attendant laugh we do not do business that way but i guess i can promise to keep the bag till you come back if you hurry nick do hurry and visit three other shop within ten minute though they be at some distance from each other he find nothing to suit he i 'll take that bag if you can change the stone and put in sapphire instead of emerald he announce somewhat breathlessly wipe he forehead i know it will come dearer but i be willing to pay when would you want it ask the shopman to-morrow morning by ten o'clock at latest oh impossible i do not know much about that word say nick we have cut it out of the dictionary up my way offer you man what they want to do night work and i guess they 'll name a price after all even in a smart jewellery shop they do not sell a gold bag every day and a point be stretch to gratify the purchaser who have a way which make people glad to please he he go back to he hotel feeling guilty but happy she be go to have a gold bag anyhow he think i do not believe she 'll ever know the difference and nick begin to rejoice that the old bag would never be find it would be splendid to know that she be use a thing _ he _ have give she if the other bag do turn up the police would let he know that be arrange and he would manage somehow only to think he say to himself a year ago i might have be as wild to do this deal as i be now but i could not have run to it this be the first real fun i have get out of my money mighty good thing money be -- though i use not to know it matter dollar even if i would a million could never put I in the same class with a angel but they give I a chance to travel with she and that 'll be something to remember for nick have find the angel of he dream and have recognize she at first glance that day in the hall of the valmont he would have know the angel by she eye and hair if nothing else have answer the description but all the rest belong to the same picture -- the picture of he ideal the girl he have never expect to see in real life and it be all the more wonderful that she name should be angel or something near it he might not have learn that exquisite detail if she have not give he the diamond frame to hold as security and to be sure of he security he be keep it in a pocket over he heart he know that this be sentimental but he do not care a red cent indeed he glory in it soon all would be over for she be of a world different from he and presently she would vanish back to she own high place wherever that might be he could not have define the difference between they world if he have be call upon to do so but he feel it intensely still he mean to make the most of every minute and he intend to have as many minute as he could get each could be separately treasured as if it be a pearl he would make a jewel-case of he memory he tell himself for he be very sure that never would so good a thing come to he again when he reach the hotel it be dinner-time and hope that mr may might invite he to she table as she have before he dress carefully despite he inconvenient quarter when he be ready however he heart fail he it seem too good to be true that he luck should hold she would probably be dine in she own sitting-room or else she would have have enough of he company earlier in the day but no there she be in the restaurant at the same table where they have lunch together and after all everything arrange itself very simply he have to tell she the news of the gold bag -- he version of it and hear that it might be restore she exclaim you be wonderful i be sure it be all through you it will be nice to have my dear bag again when i go aboard the train it be a pleasant dinner for both and each seem to find out a good deal about the other 's liking and disliking though -- perhaps purposely perhaps by accident -- they say singularly little about they own affair they past life or future intention afterward in she own room angelum laugh as she think over the day and the queer thing she have somehow be lead into do it be too quaint that i should have borrow money of he she say to herself giggle under she breath like a schoolgirl of course on top of that it be nothing at all that i should invite he to lunch and dine and the funniest part be it never once seem queer at the time or as if i could do anything else at all event she have no regret the coincidence of mr nickson hilliard 's appearance in new orlean just as she hour of need be striking have give a bright side to what would otherwise have be a disagreeable and sordid adventure certainly there be something about he that inspire confidence she feel that through he she might retrieve she bag and if by chance the money be intact she could pay he what she owe he would then return the miniature frame and it would not be necessary to give she address or say where she be go not that he would misuse such information she be sure of this now and she could not help be please that he have come back into she life just for one day -- long enough to explain himself next morning at a quarter-past ten precisely a note be bring to she room it begin : dear madam -lrb- nick have not dared venture upon dear mr may it have not even occur to he that he might -rrb- and inform she primly that the bag have arrive also it inquire in stiff language whether the writer might be permit to place it in she hand angela laugh as she read partly with pleasure because she bag be find partly because the poor young man 's stiffness amuse she she know enough about he now to understand that it be shyness and ignorance of social custom but earlier she might have think she have offend he anyway he write a good hand she think full of character and strength and not a bit uneducated ask mr hilliard to come to my sitting-room she say to the bellboy a few minute later nick appear he manner strain in a painful endeavor to hide anxiety so you have get my bag how splendid angelum exclaim as they shake hand i be sure i have you effort to thank more than those of the police no indeed say nick valiantly the police of this town be a fine set of man how do they find it she ask eagerly nick look grave well it seem there be -- er -- a kind of secret concerned he explain the thing require be that we do not ask question and perhaps you 'll agree for what you want be the bag desperately obliterate all expression from he face and hope that he eye be not anxious nick take from he pocket a gold bag whose diamond alternate with sapphire sparkle as the sunshine strike they angelum accept it delightedly with but a superficial glance at the bag itself why there be something inside she exclaim only money he hurry to break the news not the purse nor the check-book i be mighty sorry but they be both go the police do they best may get they later angelum open the bag five hundred dollar she say count rapidly now be not that odd i do not think i have quite so much how queer the _ money _ should have come back without the purse it be in and especially the check-book one would think that would be of little value to a thief there be no accounting for a thief 's way say nick solemnly and i guess a lady can not always remember to a dollar or two what money she have no-o angelum admit but -- it look different somehow she glance again at the outside of the bag and nick 's heart jump the _ bag _ look different too she say newer and -- as a matter of fact i take the liberty of have it clean up before it come back to you hand but the stone -- the worst of it be they have to be put back in again say nick that give a different look the thief have take out the stone somebody have anyhow -- some of they and i be not to ask question it be the most mysterious thing i ever hear i expect it be one of those case where ` the least say soonest mend ' nick remark but do _ you _ know who take the bag and what happen no more than you do i -- just have to make the best of a bad business i hope you do not think i do wrong no indeed that would be ungrateful only -- it be very strange i suppose this _ must _ be my bag but -- you can take you oath of that anyhow and it be you money more than i think i have and the bag look prettier it be as if i would cast my bread on the water and it have return -- butter one good thing be i can pay you four hundred dollar i borrow here it be nick have not bargain for this transaction and it be the last thing he want but -- but -- you be not leave yourself enough he object oh yes i can pay for my ticket as far as my first stopping-place already i have write the bank to have money to meet I there and it will be in time for i shall stay in that town several day you must take it -- really he could not refuse although it mean that he would not have she address or a excuse for give he slowly he draw the miniature frame out from a inside pocket of he coat i keep it there so as to be sure it be safe he explain lest the lady should think he have take a liberty in wear she property close to he heart then with many more thanks from angelum and protestation on he part they say good-bye although the newspaper have tell she that mr hilliard live near bakersfield californium she have no association with that part of the state and it seem improbable to angelum that she should ever meet the handsome forest creature again as she have no home she could not even if it seem best invite he to call upon she at some future time but she feel a stir of regret that she travel adventure be over -- quite over -- now after that she have not much time to think because there be thing to do before she take the train and then she be in the express get settle in a stateroom which would be hers all the way to lo angele kate who be to have a berth in the same car arrange she mistress 's thing and beam with excitement and joy they be really go west now -- she and timmy the cat : and go west mean get nearer and nearer to oregon meanwhile the girl be happy for she adore angelum when kate have finish she work everything be delightfully compact in the pretty green room which be almost as big as mr may 's cabin on the ship a white silk dressing-gown hang from a hook the gold-backed brush and crystal bottle from she fitted bag be arrange conveniently there be lily of the valley in a vase where do those flower come from angelum ask i do not know ma'am i find they here say kate perhaps the railway people supply they to the state-rooms perhaps they do but angelum suspect something different she be touch and pleased _ he _ must have take some trouble in get the lily place in the right room and it be like he not to have come forward himself to bid she good-bye but -- suddenly the question spring into she head -- how have he find out that she be travel in this train all the afternoon she watch the louisiana plantation lake and bayous fly by in sunshine and shadow or she read a novel of the south as it have be in old day it be a interesting story and hold she attention so closely that she be late in go to dinner when at last she go there be only one chair leave at a table for two mr nickson hilliard sit in the other viii the gold bag comedy if ever there be a blush of guilt it be nick 's angelum lift she eyebrow though she smile it would have be ungracious not to smile and angelum hate to be ungracious all the youth in she be glad to see he again but all that be conventional all that respond to she early training disapprove of he presence this be very unexpected she exclaim wonder if he would say it be a surprise to he almost hope that he might say so because she could then seem to accept he word which would save bother nick hang he head he jump up when mr may be show to the table and do not sit down again until she be seat now he disappoint angelum by make no attempt to defend himself will you please forgive I he beg this forced angelum to be stern and she decide to spare he no pang forgive you for what she ask for come he answer to the first turn of the rack she be coldly puzzle but -- do you mean you be in this train surely that can have nothing to do with I nick be silent for a moment the dining-car be full and the waiter all busy no one have come to take mr may 's order gather he mental force he resolve upon honesty as the best and only policy ` twould be easy enough to say it have nothing to do with you that i would have be travel by this train to-day anyhow he begin bravely the fact be i come on board meanin ' to try and make you think so without exactly tellin ' lie but you have ask I a straight question and i have just get to answer it straight even if you refuse to speak to I ever again i be here because you be here mr may but i promise i will not trouble you and maybe you will not believe I after my tellin ' you this but it be true i do not intend ever to let you see I to-night and maybe not the whole journey i only want to be on the same train and then supposin ' you should happen to need help any way i would be ready but -- that be rather too much self-sacrifice say angelum look he full in the face with she dark-lashed slate-gray eye i be not alone i have my maid i sha not need help i guess you know i be not make a self-sacrifice nick say honestly i would be gladder than glad to do anything for the first angel i ever meet on earth but please do not be worry mr may this be not any hold-up i will not come near you unless you happen to need a man to look after you i 'll fade away this minute if -- certainly not cry angela it be you table before it be mine but -- i do not understand yet i think it would have be better if you would finish you visit to new orlean i be sure there for the same reason i be here nick blurt out i guess i have to tell you the whole thing now you mean -- you come to new orlean because i -- yes that be right he finish for she when she pause at a loss for word something make I do it something stronger than i be you be a kind of dissolve view and i could not let it get out of my sight for good when i hear you would go to new orlean by boat -- how do you find out angelum 's sweet voice have a sharp edge in the travel bureau of the valmont hotel ah be that quite -- considerate i know how it sound to you but it be not so bad as you think i inquire as if from a friend of yours a man i know out home -- how -- how _ horrid _ of you i would rather you do not explain any more angelum 's cheek be bright pink and she be more beautiful than nick have ever see she before except the night of the burglar when she have be drown in the gold wave of she hair the angel of he dream but you may go on about the rest she add hastily when he be strike into silence without be able to bring in the name of he one excuse mr henry morehouse i would better know the _ worst _ when you hear where i would go -- well i be too late for you ship because i have to hang on and see dutchy 's case through so i take the first train i could get when that business be wind up and in new orlean i find you i do not know for certain where you be go next but -- but what i be pretty sure you be bind for californium and anyhow wherever it be i make up my mind to go not to bother you -- no more than if i be you hire man just to see you through from a distance to know you be all right and -- and not to lose sight of you i -- of course you can not understand i reckon no woman could i do not wonder you be mad i be dead sure you would be yet i have to stand for it it be the most extraordinary thing i ever hear say angelum work herself up to be as angry as she ought to be that you should have leave new york after be there only a few day and -- oh it do not bear thinking of and i would rather not believe it again nick wish to wave the name of morehouse like a white flag of truce but the san franciscan lawyer lie far away in a new york hospital seem too weak to flutter in the breeze of mr may 's displeasure i would rather have jog along without tellin ' you this he say but as thing work out it seem as if i have to speak angelum be silent busily think for a moment would you leave the train at the next stop if i ask you she inquire no i would be real sorry but i would not do that even if you ask and here be he chance to use mr morehouse -- a chance which might never come again i be go to tell you i _ do _ know a man who be acquaint with you mr may we come east together he name 's morehouse and when he be take sick i go to see he and -- and have a little talk -- all the nurse would let I have i want he to write a note i could give you in new orlean but he be not strong enough he do say i could mention he name when i tell he i mean to go back west and look after you but somehow it never seem the right time in new orlean and now when i begin to explain how i inquire about you at the valmont as if it be from morehouse you do not -- i feel there could be no explanation i would care to hear angelum finish for he i beg you pardon still i do not see why you should take mr morehouse 's responsibility on you shoulder -- for my sake no you 'll never see that nick sigh only if you could just see you way to forgiving I i should be mighty thankful i promise to switch off till you send for I i be in the next car to yours if you should need to -- if there be anything i could do between here and lo angele -- how do you know my journey end there do mr morehouse tell you that too when he and i be travel east he say mr may have the notion to see californium and i think you would be sure to begin with lo angele you no doubt will go on to bakersfield remark angelum coldly make a statement rather than put a question i suppose so pretty soon nick assent too crush by the angel 's displeasure to be flatter because she remember where he live of course you will at once she announce relentlessly meanwhile i hold you to you word mr hilliard it be -- wrong of you to come and know mr henry morehouse -- of whom i never hear till after i land -- do not make it much more -- sensible i be sure you motive be -- most kind but -- you have make a mistake as you must realize now and the only way to atone be to -- to -- i know keep out of you way and i have promise but i _ do not _ realize that i have make a mistake mr may there be no use sayin ' i do for in spite of all if 'twa to do over again i would i would not change anything then you should not boast of it exclaim angelum confession may be good for the soul of the confessor but it can be embarrassing for the one confess to you ought not to have tell I why you come the only thing to save the situation would have be to let I think it be a accident you would not have think so long -- unless i lie ought i to have lie she be rather thankful that the waiter come just then with the menu and save she from answer she order she dinner and the smile negro turn to nick i do not think i want -- he begin but angelum sternly catch he eye mutely command he to eat when he have choose several dish at random and the waiter have go she reproach he again what would people think if you go away in the midst of dinner there be a man opposite stare at we now you be not as tactful as you be the night of the burglar then you do just the right thing cleverly and bravely for that i can forgive you a good deal -- but not everything now you make one blunder after another that night in new york you want I this time you do not i guess that be what make the difference in the quality of my gray matter say nick i feel riddled with bullet and they have hit I right where i live i -- i suppose you 'll never forgive I will you if you only half guess how little i mean to butt in or be rude or annoy you maybe you could though maybe i can -- by and by for the sake of you kindness in the past angelum relent but not even for that quite yet and not _ ever _ if you look so stricken that you make people stare i _ be _ stricken nick confess you deserve to be she crush he deeper into the mire whereupon the soup arrive and they begin to eat and talk politely nick have never know before that a man could be wildly happy and desperately miserable at the same time but now he know and he would not have change place with any other man in the world i be under a spell he say to himself and i would not get out of it if i could at the same moment angelum conjecture that there must be something strange about the air she be breathe in this new world it make one want to act queerly she think i be sure i should have act quite differently about this whole affair in europe it be so easy to feel conventional in place where you have always live and where you know everybody or be it only because this man 's so different from any one else i think i be begin to understand he nature but now i see i do not the thing be i be _ too _ nice to he i ought not to have ask he to lunch and dine in new orlean that begin the mischief and it be my fault more than he but then accord to the man 's own confession the mischief have begin in new york i wish i could make myself enjoy snub the extraordinary creature she go on as she eat she dinner throw a occasional sentence concern the scenery or as a last resort the weather to she chastened companion but it be difficult to snub a person who be save you life and lend you money and find you gold bag that be why he ought not to have put I in this position -- because i owe he gratitude it be really horrid and she begin to feel sincerely that the new type have conduct itself unworthily she give nick a cool bow when she be ready to go and leave he plunge in gloom but stubbornly unrepentant it be a tough proposition i be up against he think but a man 's as good as he nerve and i 'll fight till the next spring rain sooner than let she slip away out of my life it be deep blue dusk when angelum go back to she stateroom too dark to look out of the window yet she have lose interest in the book which she have find absorb earlier in the day it seem irrelevant somehow and though there be no reason why they should do so she own affair appear more insistently exciting than before it be the call of the west already she answer she own question i hear the voice of my father 's country and then she thought return to nick i wonder what _ he _ be do now -- whether i make he see the error of he way she ask herself stroke timmy lend by kate and she be not sorry for the forest creature : not sorry at all it be stupid even to think of he but in she lap a splendid plaything for the black cat be the gold bag it seem associate with mr hilliard now odd how different it look since she have get it back bigger somehow though of course it be the same there could not have be a mistake almost mechanically she begin to count the jewel set along the mouth of the bag fifteen sapphire -- fifteen diamond why there have be only twenty-eight altogether she be sure of that she have count they before in absent-minded moment what could this mean suddenly a explanation of what it might mean flash into she head the theory seem too elaborate -- yet it would account for the mystery hilliard have make of the whole matter and he anxiety that she should not interview the police or come into contact with they and the five hundred dollar -- more money than ought to have be in the bag she recall now have mention that sum in tell of she loss and the forest creature have say that he know exactly what she bag be like if he have find a duplicate and palm it off upon she the absence of the check-book and the presence of the money without the purse would be explain but could he have find a bag ready-made so like the lose one as to deceive she until now she must question he at once yet with she finger on the bell ready to summon the porter she pause only half a hour ago she have forbid mr hilliard to come near she now she be about to send for he this would appear to be a triumph for the enemy but i 'll soon show he it _ be not _ a triumph she think and push the electric button in the car between this and the dining-car there be a mr hilliard she announce when the porter arrive please ask he to come and speak to mr may yes miss i 'll tell the gen ` leman with pleasure reply the elderly negro trot off to cry aloud a name more or less resemble hilliard nick not daring to hope that luck might change so soon have drift into the observation car but a man answer to the call beckon the porter sure you understand the name right george he inquire my name 's millard what kind of a look lady be this mr may the black porter who be not george but who have answer to the name a thousand time smile a smile like a diamond tiara she sure be the prettiest young lady i evah see sah say he most ob dese wite lady look jest alike to I i cyant tell one ob dere face from de odders but dis one -- my i will not forget she in a month o ' sunday i know who you mean now and i guess it be millard she inquire for say the gentleman of that name you get it a little mixed so a minute or two later angelum have she second surprise of the evening expect nick and with she first shot prepared she see at she stateroom door a man as different as night from day -- the man who have stare in the dining-car he have a dye black moustache like the brand of cain and a air of think that woman and other animal of the chase be make for he to hunt mr may i believe he begin politely i be mr millard i think you send for I we have meet somewhere before and -- angelum explain matter coldly in three word though she fancy that no explanation be need mr millard show sign of seek a excuse to linger but none be grant even timmy be in a dangerous mood and as kate appear on she way back from dinner the gentleman from the next car retire in good order you see mr hilliard who bring my -- a gold bag to the sitting-room in new orlean angelum say to kate he be in the car between this and the dining-car please find he and let he know that i should like to see he here kate 's quest produce nick and mr may do not mention mr millard she fire she shot without warn this be not my gold bag nick 's jaw square itself it be you bag he insist mine have twenty-eight stone this have thirty how be that to be explain how should i tell he echo bold as brass it be a question for the police she have scold he for confess he would not court the lash again i wonder if you _ could not _ tell -- if you would i insist mr hilliard that you give I the whole truth if you know it and i think you must know i warn you there be a mystery he mumble you give I the impression that it be a police mystery now i believe it be of you make a little while ago you ask I to forgive you do not you see i _ never _ can unless you tell the truth about this wretched bag a little while ago you would not forgive I because i do tell the truth she answer like a woman that be _ entirely _ different and dimly nick realize that it would be worse than useless to ask why queer how a woman seem to want only the thing you be just out of you -- _ buy _ this bag she state oh well it be no use groan nick once i think 'twa a fake about little george washington but i see now it can be harder to tell lie than truth to some people i can not tell one to you the prisoner in the dock confess i do buy the bag but when yours be find they 'll send it on to I then we can change it will never be find oh how _ could _ you -- and the five hundred dollar -- you money how idiotic of I -- and how you must have laugh when i pay you back the four hundred i owe -- out of you own pocket i never feel less like laugh in my life than i do then unless it be now you can not feel as distressed as you have make I feel i still owe you the four hundred and another hundred besides that make up the five and the worst of all be i can not pay you till lo angele but here be the bag do you hate I so much you have get to give it back nick 's eye implore mercy from the court i be more vexed than i can tell this be beyond everything please take you bag at once i swear just now it be you bag and it be surely it be hardly necessary for I to tell you i can not keep it she hold the bag out to he and when he would have none of it force the soft gold mesh into he hand he let the thing drop and at the instant of its fall kate return hover uncertainly she suppose that mr may 's visitor have go by this time and have come to ask for a promise book kate there be be a mistake angelum say this gold bag be not mine after all though they look so much alike please pick it up from the floor and give it to mr hilliard these tactic overmaster nick he could not let a woman be she maid or mistress grovel on the carpet in he presence he dive for the bag and pale and troubled handed it to kate it seem this have get to be mine he stammer but i do not want it will you take the thing if you will not it go out of the window sure as fate oh ma'am what will i do cry kate why it be a rale fortune i -- _ must _ i let he throw it out the window what all they jewel and gold would mean to I and tim -- the difference in we life if i will not have the bag some wicked tramp may find and sell it for drink do as you choose it have cease to be my affair say angelum be you _ sure _ you would fling the bag away sir if i say no to it the irish girl implore dead sure then -- oh i _ must _ take it i can not give it up to a tramp when ` twould buy tim and I a home you must be a millionaire sir throw away good money like that i have get more than i know what to do with good or bad say nick drown in gloom thank you very much for take

in the first big city where we be stop ma'am she say with a happy sigh you _ tould _ I a black cat bring luck angelum neither sleep well nor lay awake well that night whenever she close she eye she seem to meet nick hilliard 's beseech look and next day angrily push he and he problem out of she mind she devote herself passionately to scenery he must have take he meal very early or very late or else have none at all for not once do she see he in the dining-car the follow day at luncheon however he be go out as she come in she bow to he coldly but she heart beat as if something exciting have happen that night she forget to set back she watch and so go to dinner earlier than usual not far ahead also bind for the dining-car be mr hilliard she dislike the large table lay for four and when he could she favorite waiter keep a place for mr may at a small table for two person often she get one to herself but this evening as she sit down mr millard appropriate the other chair have he not be rather stout he would have squeeze himself into place before she could protest but be a tight fit inadvertently he give she time to think this seat be engage she say raise she voice to reach the ear

and nick know that a man in disgrace should be see and not hear be silent when mr may have finish a light meal she unbent far enough to say : it be clever -- and kind of you to understand one thing more i must have you address at bakersfield to send the money then nick tell she that he live on a ranch a good many mile from bakersfield i call it the ` lucky star ranch ' he add i 'll write you from lo angele say she and become conscious that she last word have be overhear by mr millard he have seat himself at a table close by and now glance up with such a intelligent look that she be sure he have take in something of the situation when the journey through texa new mexico and arizona be over and the train slow into the station at lo angele she have cause to remember this incident for millard be on the car step just in front of she he catch up the large dressing-bag which the porter have carry out of she stateroom and look back say : it be my turn to help you a little now mr may since you friend 's go on farther you be english i guess and if you have not get anybody to show you around here you must let I make myself useful i would rather the porter take all my luggage please reply angelum glance about for she black friend but doubtless mr millard have claim authority and george be give he service to some one else porter be not here you would better let I look after you and get a carriage say millard whose legitimate business it be to travel for a manufacturing firm the train stop and he jump off with angelum 's dressing-bag but only in time to have it take in a business-like manner by nick who have swing down from he own car while the train be still in motion it just occur to I you might be give yourself a little unnecessary trouble say he i 'll see to this lady i think you be go on stammer the commercial traveller not just yet nick speak mildly but he eye look dangerous and mr millard think best to give up the point without further argument i always have to thank you for something it be too bad laugh angelum as nick put she and kate into a carriage which he have secure good-bye i suppose it be fate that i must forgive you as we sha not see each other again with this she put out she hand half friendly half reluctant and as nick shake it eagerly the train move away angela give a little cry now i have make you miss you train and you luggage i will not howl about that say he i 'll wire and i can get another train by and by -- when i want it he add under he breath then he let the carriage drive away ix the last act of the gold bag comedy may i go out ma'am and see what they 'll be givin ' I for the gold bag kate ask when the unpacking -- for a few day -- be do at a lo angele hotel this be a sore subject with angelum she believe that she dislike the bag but also she dislike have it go out of she life beyond recall think of the money he spend and the trouble he take something seem to moan in she mind but with a impersonal air she give kate permission dismiss the past as represent by the hilliard incident and plunge into the joy of arrange future motor-car and train -- a future which be to concern she and kate and kate 's cat alone not mr hilliard a singularly sympathetic and apparently intelligent hotel clerk not only advise a motor for sightseeing in the neighborhood but recommend one own and invent by a friend it be a clipper he say could do anything but climb tree or jump brook and might be hire by mr may at a reasonable price for a day a week a month a year angelum feel bind to say that she should like to see it and -- almost before the last word be out of she mouth -- the garage be ring up by telephone the car arrive with startling promptness and if angelum have be give time to think it might have occur to she that there be not perhaps as much competition for this new invention as the hotel clerk have imply the inventor who be driver and chauffeur as well bear a striking resemblance to a sulky codfish but he half-boiled eye light up and glitter -lrb- even as he car glitter with blue paint -rrb- at the prospect of business other vehicle be now be produce by a firm who have buy he patent say he but at present he own appropriately name the model be the only one run he lift the brilliant bonnet and reveal intricate thing all new and silvery and glisten like crystallize sugar angelum fall a easy victim she know nothing about the mechanical virtue and vice of car though she have two at home for she own use and the prince a dozen value only less than he aeroplane hers have be gray and dark green she have always want a blue car and this be a lovely color though she be no more vain than a pretty young woman ought to be she consent to a experimental run with a undertone of conviction that the car would become she as a background as she make she decision kate arrive breathless with the excitement of bargaining to find she mistress on the curbstone oh ma'am she pant i have _ do _ it i have get five hundred dollar in I pocket and they have get the bag angelum regretfully murmur yes ma'am they have unless they have sell it since such a fine jewellery shop the name a oirish one and i go there first for luck then i try another place but they offer less and i run back to barrymore 's they say 'twa a splendid bag and they would ' a give more but they have not the same call for the article as if 'twa pari or new york and they must make they profit no doubt they will make it angelum almost snap she feel as a certain type of woman feel on hearing that the first man who ever propose to she have marry some one else and when the codfish whose name be sealman ask she where she would go for a trial spin she say that he might take she to the shop of barrymore the jeweller but that be when kate have disappear into the hotel the automobile run quietly and the spring as the codfish say be grasshopper the motor make a pleasant purr not much louder than timmy 's when you scratch he head through the open roof of he basket it be a small car but as angelum want it only to run about the neighbouring country keep lo angele as a center she begin to think that she might as well engage it after the poor codfish have give she this run for nothing how could she disappoint he exactly what she mean to do when she stop before the shop of thoma barrymore & company she could not have explain even to herself perhaps she have the curiosity to see how the bag would look in the window in case the jeweller have place it there and sure enough he have display it anxious not to miss a sale there be other gold bag but this one -- of many adventure -- be by far the most beautiful and suddenly she know why she have come she be go to buy the thing for herself she could not bear to let any one else own that bag of course if she have be sensible and business-like she might have tell kate before sell to inquire at some shop what would be a fair price and then she might have offer the girl that amount now she must pay for she pride and have less than half the income of the princess di sereno mr may ought to have be think about the californium land she wish to purchase before commit useless extravagance which she could no longer afford besides if she buy back the bag she would always be ashamed to use it under the eye of kate she point it out to one of the barrymore assistant who say it have just arrive from pari and the price be seven hundred and fifty dollar for she life angelum could not have contradict he or haggle luckily or unluckily she money have come from san francisco it serve she right she think to pay two hundred and fifty dollar more than if she have deal with kate she should have be ashamed even to want mr hilliard 's bag still more to buy it and she take away she purchase in a beautiful box with all the joy of a normal female thing who have secure for she own something which she ought not to have when angelum di sereno have be able to afford everything she have long for nothing there be a new spice in life and the redemption of the bag be to be a dead secret back to the hotel please and i 'll engage you car for the next three or four day say mr may to sealman suddenly full of kindness for he and all the world nick sit in the window of a better hotel than angelum 's she have choose hers on the advice of a lady in the dining-car a lovely blonde _ née _ brunette who have once enjoy a honeymoon in lo angele and be now on she way nevadaward to get a divorce nick have be to lo angele before and know where to go without ask advice though the same lovely lady would have be enchant to give he some mr millard be also in he hotel and would not move to mr may 's -lrb- although it be cheaper -rrb- so long as nick remain on guard that be one of the reason why nick stay but there be other he luggage he have wire for and it would come back he sit by the window wonder whether mr may would be angry if he show himself or whether on the principle that a cat may look at a king she would consider that he have as much right to be in lo angele as she have then she flash by in the blue automobile which be as become as she have expect nevertheless nick jump up from the chair in which he have be lounge and frown great gun if there be not that bandy-legged crop-eared broken-nosed auto sealman come to offer mrs gaylor last winter and want to palm off on I he grumble to himself how in creation do that maverick get hold of mr may bet there have be bribe flyin ' around somewhere angelum be on the way back to she hotel from barrymore 's when nick catch sight of she have return by the time he stroll in to ask if mr sealman be stay there mr sealman be not but the clerk admit acquaintance with he i want to know if he car 's engage begin nick yes the clerk happen to know that it be engage for the next three day perhaps longer to a young lady in the hotel who intend to do some touring in the neighborhood contract all fix up ask nick everything be arrange have just be settle in fact mr sealman have go home nick stand still and think for a moment look as sad as if he have earnestly desire the model for himself which be of course the impression convey as he reflect -lrb- not so much wonder what he want to do next as whether the thing he want to do would work -rrb- kate come down with a letter in she hand ready to post to mr timothy moriarty white orchard oregon oh sir she exclaim flit up to nick p ` rap you do not remember I but i be maid to mr may and 'twa to I you give that beautiful bag you say you would

wurruld and kate trip away to post she letter ` my lady mr may ' echo nick beneath he breath she be _ my _ lady too -- my angel -- though she do not know it and nothing can change that till doomsday he have hate the gold bag when it be reject by angelum but now he feel differently he heart warm toward it have it not be hers if only for a little while it have hang on she wrist it have be in she hand it have hold she lace handkerchief which smell like some mysterious flower of fairyland now he know what he have come to learn there be nothing to keep he any longer and walk out of the hotel he ask the first intelligent-looking man he meet where to find barrymore 's a young lady in black in a blue auto sir buy the bag you must have see in the window he be presently inform by the youth who have serve angela a young lady with golden hair you might almost have meet she on the way i rather think i do meet she drawled nick and though the bag be go forever he be suddenly so happy that he could have sing for joy he hurry away to telegraph henry morehouse at doctor beal 's nursing home ask a favor which he be sure morehouse would grant because they have grow very friendly on the journey east next he call at the largest garage in lo angele and ask advice of the manager about buy a motor-car you write I in the winter say you have a fine one here to dispose of he say maybe you remember

between spin no harder work than a round-up all right then in four day like that you 'll be a dandy driver i promise you mr hilliard say the man of the garage fit to drive -- lady fit to drive a queen that be what i want to do mumble nick under he breath x when angelum go sightseeing the next five day angelum spend in see the country she father have help to create and in break down in the blue motor-car at brief and inconvenient interval at first they be unexpected interval but soon they be take for grant for the more she know of mr sealman 's invention the less be angela surprised at anything it choose to do the model be a model of all the vice it smoke like a chimney drink like a fish and develop one after another or all together every malady to which motor-metal be heir the stage of the way even to the mission of san gabriel in its sleepy old mexican village on the fringe of lo angele be punctuate with disaster a burst tire be a comma carburetor trouble a colon nervous prostration of the sparking-plug a period but mr sealman never lose confidence he explain everything justified himself and the car tell anecdote of he courage and let fall pathetic word concern a invalid mother dependent on he and he success i be a pioneer i tell you he say you and i be make history this minute angelum would gladly have turn from so lurid a occupation to any other pursuit but mr sealman look as if he health be more fragile than that of the car when he claw obscurely at the crystallize sugar ornament under the bright bonnet of the faint model he air look so dejected he eye so hollow and he smile so wan that angelum 's fury melt into pity passionate resolve to shed he and he blue abomination die within she as she watch he struggle he whole future depend he say on the model if mr may should throw he over and hire another car the news would fly like lightning from garage to garage of lo angele indeed from end to end of californium he would be ruin he mother who have be forbid excitement would without doubt die of heart failure the heart of angelum fail also again and yet again she begin to see that mr sealman have cast himself for the part of old man of the sea in a travel drama of which she be heroine she feel alone in the world it will probably end in my have to buy the little blue brute and burn it she think but even then the codfish will probably insist on be my butler these gloomy foreboding shadow she mind one morning when the model break down about half a mile from fantastic little venice the coney island of south california in a rage she get out and walk past a kaleidoscopic pattern of tiny bazaar shooting-gallery paper iceberg and cardboard mountain she thread she way through a good-natured crowd of tall tan young american pretty girl with wonderful erection of golden hair dark-faced mexican yellow-faced japanese a few hindu and negro then by the pier she see a old spanish galleon disguise as a restaurant and drift in to lunch on fried sand-dab attractively advertise in big black letter how old how spanish and how galleon the craft might really be none could tell -- or would but the sand-dab be delicious and from the queer window near she table -- a window cut in the ship 's side -- she could see the pacific blue in distance green where it toss white foam-blossom on a beach of gold breakdown would be fun if i would some one to laugh at they with I she think and she mind conjure up the image of nick hilliard seat he opposite she at the little table she have order he home and he have apparently obey which seem unkind and poor-spirited and altogether unlike he ever until now he have be at hand to save she from all that be disagreeable even at lo angele he have jump off the train to circumvent mr millard he way have be like the way of story-book hero who by some extraordinary coincidence invariably appear in time to rescue the heroine from a villain a mad bull a runaway horse or a burning house the only difference be that mr hilliard could not possibly be the hero of this story and he opportune arrival be on he own confession never a coincidence he come on purpose and that be bad taste but as he have do it so often why could not he have transgress just once again to rescue she from sealman she think of the tall forest creature with yearning which interfere with she appetite for sand-dab he might unobtrusively have stay she think and put himself at she service not the most clinging old man of the sea could continue to cling if that square-chinned bronze statue point out the wisdom of let go but no doubt _ he _ be at home near bakersfield before this -- angelum seldom name nick in she mind -- otherwise she must have run across he somewhere that first day at the city of the angel when she have spin gaily from park to park the model for once behave well almost she have expect to see he the next morning when the car refuse to move and she have take a trolley car halfway to san gabriel it would have seem appropriate somehow to meet he stroll in front of the mission he hand in he pocket gaze up at the beautiful half-ruined facade with its delicate chain-armour of gold lichen its tower and its flower like blossom barnacle angelum know now that she have feel certain of meeting hilliard accidentally in the mission church that while she walk beside the elderly spanish verger chatting of he native cordova listen to tale of father juniperra serra father somera and the legend of the indian with the miraculous portrait of the madonna she have start more than once at a footfall fancy it that of she lost hero of course if he have venture to show himself at any time she would have know that it be no coincidence and she would have lift she eyebrow in silent reproach talk more earnestly to the verger who have be happy because she know cordova and all he beloved spanish cathedral nevertheless the bronze statue would have fit well into the scene and something lack because it be absent i do think he might write from he ranch and acknowledge the money i send he she tell herself now neglect the sand-dab to stare through the galleon window at the float seaweed on the tide-dark gold-green kelp like lose laurel-wreath tear from the brow of drowned divinity i post the letter myself that first day he must have get it -- if he _ be _ at home just then a tall dark young man walk into the ship-restaurant take off a sombrero angelum gather herself together ready to administer a gentle snub but she might have save herself the trouble it be not nick she could have cry with disappointment snub of the past be come home to roost there be time to buy californium jewel in the bazaar -- tourmaline and pearl-blister -- before the car come up purr sweetly and look innocent as a cat gorge with canary bird mr sealman be so sure that nothing could or would go wrong ever again that angelum have no heart to receive he coldly they start off for a run through bungalow-land and the model conduct itself like a newly convert sinner i have be think out a dandy plan while i be tinker on the auto remark mr sealman in a engaging manner what do you say to do a tour of the mission you know i guess there be a chain of 'em and the fine thing it would be to see the lot by road i tell you this little auto 's go to be all right -- all right it would be the best kind of a stunt for a lady from europe and if the papers get hold of it i bet they would give we a bang-up notice -- a photo too maybe you could send you friend on the other side angelum shudder she could hardly bear even to hear this proposal from the codfish for a pilgrimage to the mission of californium have be a dream of franklin merriam 's he and she be to have follow the footstep of the franciscan father stage by stage and if a mission here or there be fall into ruin merriam have talk of offer to restore it at he own expense now the money have go to restore the palazzo di sereno and to buy motor and aeroplane and lady ' favor for the prince of that name yet some day angelum mean to make the pilgrimage when she have build she house and give herself a starting-point i have other thing to do she reply coldly i shall see only the mission i may happen to pass on this tour well some folk would ruther save this trip for a weddin ' journey sealman suggest i suppose widow have weddin ' trip do not they he gaze thoughtfully at the gray coat and gray-veiled motor hat which angelum wear to protect she from the dust she sit in front beside the chauffeur for the motion of the car be less there but she decide that if she be ever hypnotize into associate with the model again she would take the back seat the mission for mine he go on when he passenger make no reply there be some prefer the yosemite but there be no motorin ' there and if i be a girl i would not feel marry without a motor in the yosemite there be so much honeymoonin ' the minute you see a lady with a man you put 'em down for bride and groom angelum have cause to remember this remark later speakin ' of honeymoon look as if there would be some around here the codfish continue chattily they be run about through the suburb of lo angele and if sealman 's passenger have deign to answer she would have be compel to agree it be ideal honeymoon-land a move picture paint in color seemingly by rival artist of different nation for the mingling of effect be mysterious as the scenery of dream just as angelum tell herself that it be like holland in the jewel-box neatness of little street and little house -- behold the riviera with group of palm among tropical flower and feathery pepper-tree graceful and large as giant willow then when she have decide on italy or southern france as a simile far-off sharp mountain peak a dark grotesquely branch pine in filmy distance and a doll 's house with a red pointed roof suggest a sketch on a japanese fan this be a spick-and-span little world for a perpetual honeymoon and at the entrance of the street there should have be sign angela think say no one but bride and groom need apply it be all distractingly pretty and though angelum have already admire the big handsome house of lo angele and pasadena these rose-bowered bungalow catch she fancy more after all there be a sameness about millionaire ' mansion the whole world over but here be something new invent by californium cupid himself might have be the architect so daintily be each little dwelling plan for the happiness of two lover so of course all the woman who live in these house must be young and beautiful all the man must be handsome and husband and wife must adore each other no creature old or fat or inclined to be disagreeable would dare come house-hunting here or if they do come surely some wise suburban by-law would rule they out once in as resident the happy lover would remain forever young it be to be riverside to-morrow be not it sealman inquire when full two hour later than she have expect he bring she back to the door of she hotel angelum hesitate in californium at most time of year it be hopeless to use the weather as a handle to hang a excuse upon she look at the sky it be a vast inverted cup of turquoise be you sure the car be equal to so long a run she ask mildly the likeness between mr sealman and a codfish become so marked that angelum fear he be go to be ill you do not know what the car can do he answer reproachfully perhaps not she admit very well we 'll start at eight better make it earlier she make it earlier and be actually ready but at half-past eight sealman appear on foot of the car 's health he say nothing but of he mother 's health he say much she have suffer a relapse the doctor have be with she all night how sealman be go to pay the bill he do not know would mr may go to santa catalina island this morning and to riverside to-morrow there be time to catch the boat the doctor 's bill be a trump card angelum consent to wait for riverside and she take kate to that fair island loved by californian and by fisherman all over the world the name avalon alone would have lure she for who would not set sail for avalon at a moment 's notice santa catalina be corsica in miniature corsica without napoleon or vendetta but it have sea-gardens fathom deep under green water where flower bloom and fish glitter in a dazzle of jewelled armor beneath the glass floor of flat-bottomed boat the fisherman be catch yellow-tail that day too just as franklin merriam have catch they in he time and he daughter go back to lo angele full of thought of he to-morrow be to be hold sacred to she father 's memory for he old home vanish off the face of the earth now have be near riverside angelum want the day to be perfect unmarred by trouble or vexation and though she have she fear when morning come the model start off so well that hope begin to rise make a detour they spin past the old mission san gabriel where she have arrive ignominiously by trolley four day ago and turn for a look at the facade angelum see a yellow car draw up in the fleecy shadow of a pepper-tree a chauffeur sit next the driver 's empty seat apparently half asleep that be the motor i want to ask you about a day or two ago angelum say bend forward to speak to sealman -- for she have keep she resolution to sit behind he it be the handsomest i have see and we have meet it several time two man in it always in chauffeur 's cap and goggles oh _ that _ car remark the inventor with indifference that be what we call smith 's folly thad smith a fellow who make a pile of money have the thing build to order and it bring he bad luck -- lose every cent the day she be finish and he be be try to sell she ever since _ i _ would not take she for a present angelum lean back hide a smile behind she motor veil she do not believe that mr sealman would have the offer he little car look a badly make toy compare with that golden chariot she wonder if it have be sell or if it would be worth while to make inquiry somebody be perhaps try it she think for often it follow the road take by sealman or when they car break down as it usually do the yellow giant shot ahead disappear and occasionally appear again i should like to find out if it be still for sale she say to herself gaze back admiringly why should not i have a motor of my own as the model trundle she out of sight a man walk round the corner and spring into the yellow car take the driver 's seat xi the man at the wheel nick have not be visit the mission that day but he have be there before gabble fluent spanish with the verger this be more than angelum could do though she know the cathedral of spain in the morning nick have make a early start with he new car and after four long day of constant practice at last he experience the joy of confidence in himself at the wheel he be now license to drive and the yellow automobile be he body and soul the chauffeur a reedy and extremely young youth with a sharp nose and a keen sense of humor have scrape acquaintance with sealman without give away any information on he side he have always contrived to find out if not where the model be go at least where it be hope she might go it be to be riverside to-day and after a preliminary spin from six to eight nick have be linger near the mission pay a friendly visit to the owner of the big grapevine and the trained owl this man be the most taciturn of mortal but something behind the lock window of he soul recognize a congenial spirit in the open window of nick hilliard 's and the two have make friend year ago the morning 's call be a renewal of old acquaintance and the sea-green light under the grapevine be as clear as on another may day when nick be six year younger the alligator be larger but the white-faced owl be unchanged -- unless perhaps a little wiser a little more instruct in the oldest secret of a old secretive world see the way that white-veiled witch stare at I with she golden eye say nick wish i could flatter myself she remember I of course she remember say she master she be the same one tell you fortune when you be here before i ask she if i be go to amount to anything in the world and she nod she head three time i feel like send she a present when gaylor make I foreman and again when i get my ranch she ought to have have a diamond crown when the gusher come but like a ungrateful beast i forget all about she she know she business say the grapevine man three nod mean three big stroke of luck good king exclaim nick i hope that do not mean i be not go to have any more than three anything you want in particular well yes there _ be _ something i be sort of set on ask she if you get you wish nick fix he eye upon the owl do i get my wish she sit motionless on she perch for a moment consult she oracle then she suddenly lift she wing and flap violently be that the best answer you can give nick reproach she the owl repeat the gesture i guess you want something she do not approve of say the grapevine man she might give I a civil ` yes ' or ` no ' see here you witch of endor -- _ do _ i get my wish the owl close she eye then open they with a sudden flash of gold but would neither nod nor shake she head she know but she will not tell say she master maybe she do not want to upset you feeling she can not scare I with she mystery nick laugh i be go right ahead on the same line then he say good-bye to he friend and go out to he motor but there be enough of the boy in he to be disappointed because the white witch have refuse a answer the car have a proud way of dismiss the landscape impatiently if give she head but as she new owner be not out to show what he could do she be compel to crawl when she would have fly like pegasus harness to the plough to-day the task of subdue herself be not so painful as usual for the blue car go on mile after mile through the far-stretching orange grove without a stop and nick enjoy drive wish i could remember he think how i feel when i be a kid and walk alone across a room the first time without tumble on my nose i wonder if it be as good as this this be very good indeed and would have be good anywhere -- for nick be accord to he own way of put it a crank about do well whatever he undertake and he know now that he have conquer the machine -- but on such a road and in the light and shade of orange grove it be superlative the vast plain wall with mountain be a endless city of domed green temple richly decorate with the gold of the late orange crop beyond its boundary be vine cut close in spanish fashion which perhaps the father have teach in mission day and there be tall pink-trunked eucalyptus tree from whose wood beautiful furniture could be make then city of green and golden temple again in a desert-frame of tawny yellow everything that be not green be golden the sun pour gold orange blaze in golden splendor and californium poppy golden with orange heart sweep in a yellow flame over the landscape gold under the earth and gold over the earth think nick that be californium and he think too of the gold of angelum 's hair she have look mighty well in this yellow car float along among the white and gold of orange and orange-blossom all white and gold herself he say and she be _ go _ to look well in it that be what i get it for that be what i have be work for till this auto 's fit to eat out of my hand and gee but i have be go some he grin under he motor mask as he recall the strenuous hour he have enjoy they but he have hate the mask and so soon as the time come -- he think it must come soon -- when he could reap the reward of labor he mean to shed the abomination it have serve its purpose by let he come by accident once or twice within full sight of the model safe from recognition he have not wanted mr may to find out prematurely that he be dog she tire track in a car which might have shoot past she like a comet she have misunderstand he too often already and he wish she to think he safe at lucky star ranch until the moment when she would rejoice to see he at any price more than once during the last four day of practice and probation nick have be tempt to offer he service but common-sense have hold he back when the blue car be in trouble it have warn he that a little bitter experience might incline the lady to be lenient several minor breakdown disappointment and vexation be need before she would see matter eye to eye with he and nick think himself lucky that so far the model have not be permanently disabled now if anything happen he be ready \* \* \* \* \* sealman have the air of slow down after a unusually long nonstop run to show off he acquaintance with the country that great sandy stretch be the bed of the santa ana say he why there be so much sand and so little water mostly they have to sprinkle the bed to keep it from flyin ' about the landscape as if 'twa a pile o ' feather it be not like the oro where first they find gold and then when they think they would get the lot come across more in the cobble not only that but by some scientific process or other -- you would not understand if i tell you -- they wash the river-bed so the sand and stone riz ` stirrin ' up the alluvial deposit ' be what they call it till they could get hold of the cobble again to crush 'em for road-makin ' road be need bad they day and at last they haul out the mud from the bottom to plaster over the desert that be here so orange and olive and grape could take to growin ' sort of wonderful be not it angelum could have tell he a great deal more than he have tell she about these scientific process for she father have be one of the man most interested in they success but she keep she knowledge to herself yes it be wonderful she reply but -- do not you think we would better be go on we have a long way before we accord to the map yes we 'll go right on say sealman i just think i would stop she and point out the santa ana for fear you would miss it he be anxious to conceal the fact that it be the model who have just think but urge she to begin again where she have leave off the little brute refuse to budge be anything wrong ask angelum when sealman have work in worried silence for several minute can not see nothing say he increase in codfishiness she 'll be all right in a minute give she time to breathe angelum give she time to breathe but the minute pass and other minute limp after sealman sweat and grunt under the open lid of the bright bonnet angelum be sorry for he but she be more sorry for herself as she count the nearest row of orange-tree for the twenty-fifth time follow they with she eye as they run up the ankle and leg of the little yellow mountain it be luncheon-time and she be hungry she have be read about the mission inn at riverside and picture herself there in a cool large dining-room how far be we from a railway station she ask desperately when she watch say that they have sit by the santa ana 's bedside for thirty-five minute can not tell you that ma'am snap sealman but it be too far to walk unless you have get seven-league boot what be the matter have not you find out _ yet _ think it might be the pump but it do not seem to be i give it up and he wipe he forehead with a handkerchief that leave green streak of oil but you must not give it up we can not stop here all day sealman grin viciously perhaps he too hunger certainly he be hot and feel like a socialist what be this young woman that she should sit there comfortably and nag he while he be down in the dust i do not see any reason against we stayin ' all day say he and i guess the machine do not hateful little beast exclaim angelum who I or the model sealman want to know i mean the -- _ allege _ -- model she be a fraud -- a horror if only i get -- somewhere -- i do not care where -- i 'll never come out with you again never never you be engage to I till the end of the month say sealman as firmly as if he allude to a promise of marriage i have refuse two other gentleman if you do not use the machine you 'll pay anyhow angelum would have give much if she have bring kate to be alone with these two monster in a uninhabited world under a blaze sun passionately hungry and futilely angry be a dull adventure you know perfectly well i engage you only for three or four day she say that settle it you shall not cheat I and since you do not seem to know what be to become of you or you car for the rest of the day i shall decide on my own movement i be go to walk she spring out and nick await development at a safe distance of a hundred yard in the background see a slim gray figure separate itself from the motionless model now be my time i reckon he say to himself and start the car which could be do from the chauffeur 's seat he drive at low speed as if he be out to enjoy the scenery and slow down gently beside angelum who be walk in the direction of riverside at that rate she might have reach the nearest railway station in a hour and a half nick 's goggles and chauffeur 's hat be off why how do you do mr may he ask in he pleasant voice you machine 's break down for good this time i be afraid now do let I give you a lift mr hilliard cry angelum take completely by surprise as she look up from under she sunshade where be you go i have no particular choice say nick i be only in this part of the country because this part of the country happen to be here i would be just as pleased if 'twa anywhere else where be _ you _ go angelum begin to laugh and could not stop laugh nick see this and see that she look a schoolgirl of sixteen in she little motor-bonnet venture to laugh too i be take to the desert she say but i _ want _ to go to riverside be -- be this the same old story she could not put she meaning more plainly because of mr hilliard 's chauffeur but nick understand i have be learnin ' to drive the last few day he say and i have see you now and then runnin ' about in that little car it be a old acquaintance of mine sealman try to sell it to I last winter i be sort of sorry to see he would get hold of you nick be out in the road now stand beside she and the big yellow car be purr a invitation i be sorry for _ he _ say angelum but i be not now he be a cheat he pretend i have engage the car for a fortnight i guess he will not go on along that line now he be see who i be remark nick because if he do i 'll make he model a orphan he remember I from last winter i 'll deal with he for you if you please angelum laugh again thank you he do not seem likely to go on very soon along any line do he should not wonder if that car 's ball-bearing be not break say the sharp-nosed chauffeur that be a real favorite accident of sealman 's we have get to know it by heart in lo angele it generally happen with he -- across a trolley track take all day to dismount and fix up again we can not go away and leave he to he fate say angelum after all he be human nick could have shout hurrah that we of hers tell he that he have win shall we tow he to the next town he ask keep triumph out of he tone we 'll land he in a garage and then -- if instead of he car you 'll take mine to riverside why i 'll be mighty honor you expect I to come to grief she say well i know that model and you have be -- just practise with my new machine i think i might as well keep around in you neighborhood as anywhere i have see you car but you be so goggle -- i hate to have you misunderstand I again till i could explain i think maybe some day you would be a little glad to see I -- not for myself but for -- _ myself _ angelum finish yes i be selfish enough to be glad now -- _ very _ glad you be a friend in need then i be happy that be all i ask to be -- just a friend in need will you let I drive you to riverside i would let you drive I -- _ anywhere _ to lunch but you must not ask just now if i have forgive you it would be take a unfair advantage of a shipwrecked mariner i should not think of do such a low-down thing protest the forest creature xii the beautiful country of make-believe nick refrain from mention this to mr may but when he have last see the mission inn at riverside he have think that he would like to come there next time on he wedding trip there have be no bride in view then or since but now he remember that wish it be a good omen that fate should have make the one woman of all the world he companion to-day he have not expect such a wonderful stroke of luck the little blue auto might actually have go a whole day without mishap or might not have collapse until after mr may have lunch alone at the glenwood but here they be he and she in he yellow car sailing into riverside together he drive angelum by he side talk as kindly as if she have forgive he he sin without be ask if he have not think it be not play fair he would have make believe like a small boy building air-castle pretend that it really be a wedding trip and that he and he angel be about to have they first luncheon together but she would hate I even to make believe he say to himself no it would not be a fair dream to have behind she back yet it be difficult not to dream angelum be so delighted with the garden city watch by desert hill and she say so innocently what _ sweet _ house for bride and groom oh _ no _ one except people in love ought to live here that nick have to bang the door of he dream-house with violence and for the first time since he have fall in love with angelum he begin to say why not -- why should not i try to make she care there be folk who think you need only to want a thing enough to get it she appear to he radiant as a be from a higher planet never could she be content with he world he have tell himself dimly and wordlessly he have feel that here be a creature who have reach a orchidlike perfection through a long process of evolution and generation of luxury the earth be she playground man in greenland hunt seal and in russium beautiful animal die merely that she should have rich fur to fold round she shoulder in the south perfume be distil for she there be whole district engage in weave velvet and silk that she might have dress worthy of she loveliness and man spend they life toiling in mine to find jewel for she arm and finger or dive under deep water to bring up pearl for she pleasure it be right and just that it should be so for there be nothing under heaven fairer than she and since such thing must always have be part of she life because she be bear for they and would take they for grant be it reasonable to hope that she would waste two thought on a man like nick hilliard a fellow rear on hardship who have learn to read in night school and have consider it promotion to punch cattle all this be as true to-day in riverside as it have be in new york and new orlean angelum be prettier than ever in the simple dress she wear for motoring and the gray silk cap that frame she face make a halo of she pale gold hair she dainty and expensive clothes be a part of she individuality as its petal be of a rose and she appear to think of they no more than a nun think of she veil but nick feel this morning that angelum have come down from she shine height to be human with he she laugh like a schoolgirl in sheer pleasure of motion which the big car give after martyrdom with the model she have travel all over the old world yet she say there be nothing anywhere prettier than riverside no such petticoated palm as those that trail the gray fan of other year down to they foot like the feather of giant owl no such pepper-tree no such cypress even in italy as these stand black as burnt-out torch against the desert sky no such rose-covered bungalow and above all no hotel so quaint as the mission inn the hour for luncheon be past but nick order flower and a feast for a dream-bride then while it be prepare the two walk in the garden court and under pergola where bunch of wistarium light from above by the sun hang like thousand of amethyst lantern i shall build a house like this in miniature say angelum half to herself i can not have the shrine and the ` mission ' arch with the bell-window but i can have the court and the arcade and the pergola and a well and lot of fountain inside there shall be wall of natural wood and great beam across the ceiling and big brick chimney -- ` mission ' furniture too and indian rug and pottery i can hardly wait to begin that house where will it be nick ask afraid of the answer in californium somewhere she say you mean it oh yes i do not know where yet i be fall in love with the south now but i will not let myself fall too deep in till i have see the north if you be in love _ can _ you keep yourself from fall deeper in say nick i do not think i could i would sure have to let myself go it have be so good to see the forest creature at the moment when he be need most that angelum have melt toward he as snow melt in the spring sun she have not only forgive but forget -- for the moment -- that there have be thing to forgive so she answer this question of he humanly and simply i wonder she say if it be not a question of a country but a person i can not tell i have never fall deep in then she pull herself up abruptly luncheon must be ready she go on in a changed voice i be starve be not you starve nick answer mechanically but he be say in he heart she be never be in love hooray the thought shoot new color into existence i 'll pull the world up by the root to get she he think and she want to live in californium maybe if i try to make myself all over again a little worthier -- a little more like what she be use to at last she -- it seem sacrilege to finish the sentence it be for this end to make himself more like what she be use to that he have buy the new clothes in new york they have not be a success but luckily for he happiness to-day he do not know how angelum have laugh when she see the shiny shoe outside he door never be a luncheon like that which they eat together in the great cool dining-room whence everybody else have vanish long ago angela sit face one of the big window and a green light filter through rose-arbour give she skin the luminous pearly reflection that artist love to paint up in the minstrel ' gallery a harpist play softly old spanish air before you decide where to live will you come to my part of the country nick ask he eye drink in the picture there be a ranch you would admire i think not mine i would like you to see that too but the one i mean be a show place it belong to mr gaylor the widow of my old boss she be a mighty nice woman and handsome as a picture she be pretty lonely and like visitor if she invite you will you come perhaps some day say angelum in a mood to humor he because everything round she be so charming that to refuse a request would have sound a jarring note not that she have the slightest intention of visit mr gaylor the widow of mr hilliard 's old boss but i have map out a program for myself already she go on which may take a long time for if i like a place very much i sha not want to hurry away for instance maybe i shall have a whim to come back here and stay a week or a fortnight you see some one i love dearly long ago live in californium and there be part of the country i want to visit for he sake as well as my own this be a blow in spite of she late confession but in a moment he take courage if this girl -lrb- who look eighteen and could not be much over twenty -rrb- have love a man long ago that man must have be a father or a uncle and with a sense of relief he remember the miniature frame would you tell I what part you want to see most of all he ask with a air of humility which be engage in a man so big so strong and brown angelum 's eye smile mischief why do you want to know she catechize he i think you 'll admit that after -- after several thing which have happen i have a right to ask -- a question before i answer yours i know you be afraid i 'll want to be follow you again say nick but follow be not in my mind i want to _ take _ you in my new automobile she stare in amazement you extraordinary person as if i _ could _ do such a thing why not he ask it meekly look boyish ready to be rebuke and snub -- and yet to make he point i expect when you be at home -- wherever that be -- you be use to travel sometimes with you maid in a motor and nobody else except you chauffeur -lrb- nick pronounce this word rather originally but this be a detail -rrb- certainly that be entirely different now you have get a cat too angela break into laughter this man and this day be unique she be delighted with herself for forgive mr hilliard because of course she could unforgive he again at any minute if it seem really best when a woman laugh at you _ bon mot _ there be hope there be also happiness nick feel both they come in a gust like a spray of perfume in he face take he breath away i believe she 'll do it he say to that sympathetic chum -- himself who be take the kindliest interest in he love affair it be up to I now and in my car you would have two shuvver what with we both and you irish maid and you black cat would not we be enough to take care of you you be not a real chauffeur say angelum i have be qualify for the article and if i do say it myself i be as smart a driver this minute as you could find in californium angelum shake she head you amuse I because you be quite quite different from any man i ever see but -- i be afraid i can not engage you as my chauffeur not if i could give you a first-rate character ma'am do not call I ` ma'am ' angelum remind he it be too realistic mr would-be-chauffeur i call you ` angel ' behind you back you can not say you will not be a angel because ` twould be irreligious i use to play at be one when i be a wee thing say angela she eye far away bed be the sky the pillow and sheet be white cloud tumble all round I i could bury myself in they i make believe i be disguise as a child by day but the door of dream let I into heaven it mostly do nick mumble then he say aloud if you use to like make believe then would not you just try it for a little while now make believe i be go to take you round in my car and i 'll tell you some of the thing that will happen to we well -- it could not do any harm to make believe just for a few minute could it angela wonder if she be flirt with the forest creature but no certainly not she never flirt not even with the man of she own world as most of the young woman she know be in the habit of do this be not flirt it be only playing -- and let he play a little too -- at make believe what would happen to we she ask well shall we begin with to-day -- what be left of it -- or skip on to to-morrow i hate put off thing till to-morrow -- if they be pleasant so do i and this would be pleasant when you would see all you want of the mission inn i would drive you along magnolia avenue that be wall in with those owl-palm in gray petticoat as you go down it look like a high gray wall in a fort with bunch of green at the top and rose train over it we would run up mount rubidoux that have a grand curlycue sort of road to the top where there be one of the old mission bell and a cross and a plaque in memory of the best father of 'em all juniperra serra rubidoux 's one of those yellow desert mountain the biggest of the lot with a view of riverside and mile of orange grove like a big garden at its foot we would sit up there awhile and i would tell you a story of general fremont when he pass in the grand old day then we would spin on to redland and see the park and the millionaire ' house -- i like the lover ' bungalow best do you would you like one better for yourself a thousand time but she break that silken thread quickly go on what would we do next oh next a orange-packing factory you would enjoy see the orange run like mad down a sloping trough pretend they be all equal till the boy watch spy out the bruised one that be sneak along and pitch 'em away before they can say ` knife ' by and by the small no-account orange be send about they business which be to play second fiddle and the big noble-fellow who be worthy to succeed fall first into the hand of girl who wrap they up in square of white paper my faith but those girl ' hand go fast it make you feel like heat-lightning just to watch 'em fly anybody who want to can order a box of pick orange each wrap in paper with a lady 's name and a verse in she honor print on it lot of fellow do that when you would see the factory i would drive you back to lo angele and we would get there after dark but there be a searchlight on my car equal to a light on a battleship and she name alone be enough to illuminate the road i have christen she bright angel he pause for half a second but if the analogy mean anything to he companion she do not choose that he should know and then she say then -- if you would see enough of lo angele i would ask you to let you irish girl pack up and i would start off with you -- for good i mean you and the maid and the cat and billy billy 's the other shuvver besides I i would take you to santa barbara that be one of the place on my program and monterey another of my place but i want to go to the yosemite you could not motor I there i could guide you i have know horse longer than i have know motor and i know the yosemite once i get hurt in a kind of accident i be not good for much for a while afterward and as i could not do any work i go and loaf in the yosemite valley i would always want to go it be grand but it would be heaven to see it again with y -- with a angel angelum trace the steel embroidery on a gray _ suède _ bag which lay on the table she have get it the other day to serve as understudy for the gold bag which be taboo for public use at present she be glad that the forest creature do not know and never would know that she have secretly buy back he gold bag if he find out it might be he turn to misunderstand how be you hurt in a accident she ask for the sake of divert the talk from angel it be in a fire say nick oh on you ranch no in san francisco she interest grow in the great fire yes do you live in san francisco then no i just go there i think i guess you go on purpose to help i feel as if every man ought to do what he could i could not do much shall we go on make believe you do not like talking of you good deed oh good deed i do not like talking of myself when there be better thing to talk of i could make you out a tour in the yosemite mr may you should not travel by the ordinary stage i would get you something special for the drive part and you should have the finest trail pony in californium i would give ten year off my life to show you the big tree there be some mighty fine one in other place you know the santa cruz forest be splendid but it be the mariposa big tree in the yosemite i mean we would drive from wawona early in the morning one day and stay till the sunset you can not think what sunset 's like among the giant sequoia with the red light like a rain of ruby star fall through the branch and those tree be god 's own architecture i guess even you have never see a cathedral to touch it because there can not be one all day you should stay in the forest i would find you place for lunch and dinner and the squirrel would come and help you eat it do sound nice say angelum bewitch by the picture it would be -- the nicest thing that ever happen only ` nice ' be not a big enough word _ can not _ it come true think with you cat and you kate and you trail guide you call I a ` friend in need ' can not i be you guide in need you would have to get a guide for the valley why not I we have only known each other a few day any other guide would be a stranger and i guess mr may if that be all we know each other as well as a good many who call themselves friend get to know one another in year do you ever find out anything about people that you do not _ feel _ the first moment you set eye on they well -- you do save my life she concede i can not get away from that do you mind not get away from it no-o then will you take I for you shuvver and trial guide to those place i will not ask you any more now you can send I packing afterward if you do not think i live up to the character mr morehouse have give you of I mr morehouse i have not hear from he since my first day in new york i mean the other mr morehouse he brother -- you banker henry wire to he from new york and he be write you to say if you have not get anybody who know the rope to see you through you excursion you could not do better than let hilliard of lucky star be you pilot -- kind of courier you know both the morehouse vouch for I though it be henry who be my friend all stranger who come to have a look around californium take a californian to show they the sight if you have not get mr morehouse 's letter it must be wait for you i reckon it ought to have arrive last night or this morning and if you find he recommend I as a trustworthy man will you think the plan over before you say no you take my breath away but -- ye-es i 'll think it over i suppose one really _ can _ do thing in america one would not do _ anywhere _ else that be why there be so much emigration reply nick gravely and i should be study californium through you i suppose i begin to see that you be a typical californian no nick contradict she you must not get hold of that impression it would not be play the game for I to let you the typical californian 's a very different man : a grand chap and i reckon more like the sort you be use to angelum smile describe he well i be not much at description you 'll meet the kind i mean when you get to san francisco if you do not before the two morehouse be the right sort and lot of other john falconer 's one of the best have you ever hear of he yes say angelum i remember he name my -- friend of mine have speak of he though he be younger and make he fame later i should like you to come across he say nick full of enthusiasm for the man he admire and devoid of small jealousy falconer be one of the grandest lawyer california ever have and in a way he make himself though he come of the best blood we have get -lrb- nick would not have dream of mention that he own blood be as good he like most man of the west think more of he horse ' pedigree than he own and he would as readily have boast of he handsome look as of he father 's people -- the people who have disown that father and send he to starve but now he be boast of and for californium that be legitimate -rrb- falconer 's the wisest and most far-seeing politician we have he go on and deserve he luck -- the money 's he be make and the name he be win he be high up on one of we biggest railroad too since he give up law because he would no time to follow it and he be not much over forty now that be californium mr may that be typical falconer 's as different from a rough fellow like I as -- as i hope i be different from sealman you be a loyal friend angelum say admire the fire in he eye and the glow on he face as she would have admire a impressionist sketch for a portrait by sargent only this man ought to be a fresco she tell herself as she follow out the picture-simile he be too big and spirited and unconventional to be put into a frame oh i be not a personal friend of falconer 's nick hasten to explain wish i be i have meet he when he be be to the gaylor ranch -- the ranch i want you to visit but i expect he would hardly remember I and now you see that i be not typical maybe you 'll think there be no place for I on you map but i have my use i be warrant sure and sound and would not i just be ready to die tryin ' if you would let I to give you the time of you life in californium i have always hear that californian man be chivalrous and kind oh kind that be a funny word and these plan you draw for I be -- be the sort of thing to make a woman feel glad there be man in the world willing to take so much trouble -- they be the sort of thing to make a man glad there be woman -- or better still a woman -- to work for he amend so good to look at in he enthusiasm that angelum 's eye would not be banish to the _ suède _ bag or to the flower on the table -- nick 's flower but she go on but -- do not say that word to-day nick beg whatever you decide afterward let I take you up to rubidoux and on to redland make up you mind about the rest when you have see mr morehouse 's letter very well she say just for to-day the ` make-believe ' shall come true nick turn away he face lest it should betray he thank you he say quietly well then i reckon it be time i go to round up billy and we 'll hit the breeze for rubidoux and redland they see the park and the millionaire ' house and the orange-packing passing on the way picturesque little town with indian and mexican name which charm the eye and ear of angelum and always the air be sweet with scent of orange-blossom rose and alfalfa the life of the country once at redland nick excuse himself and jump out of the car at a shop he be go three or four minute but when he come back he say nothing of any purchase it be only when he be bid mr may good night at she hotel door that with a schoolboy air he pull a small package out of he pocket talking of typical californian thing he say try to seem careless here 's one i think as it be only a little bouquet in a bottle -- a few flower distil -- you might accept it but if you want to give it back i 'll take it like a lamb it be -- because you love californium -- i want you to have it do not open the paper till you get indoors and you 'll send I word whether you can go along farther in the country of make-believe of course i 'll telephone early enough for we to start if -- if the answer 's yes as soon as i wake up will that do that will do and let it depend on you dream i 'll trust my luck to they because dream be in the country of make-believe sometimes they be good -- so good they make you want to go on and on besides there 'll be the morehouse letter i bank on that but more on the dream the letter have come angelum find it when she get back to she hotel and mean to read it at once as a letter from so important a man deserve but nick 's package be in she hand and she be tempt to untie the gold string inside be a fancy bottle of perfume bind round with quantity of narrow rose-coloured ribbon parfait d'amour make of californium flower announce the blossomy label and angelum break into laughter repeat the name aloud parfait d'amour she have laugh very often that day he know i would not give it back to he she think that would be worse than keep it and say nothing she put the bottle down on she dressing-table and take up the letter from mr morehouse the banker it be a pleasant letter extremely satisfactory from hilliard 's point of view it be evident that in the two brother opinion there be no reason why she should not accept the service of mr nickson hilliard in see californium the banker who alone know -lrb- and would not tell -rrb- that mr may be the princess di sereno say hilliard who be to be introduce to you in new york if my brother have not be ill be a man you father would have approve you be not travel alone i understand but have you servant you can trust hilliard as a kind of glorified guide which he wish to be i understand partly out of friendship for my brother -lrb- who hope to show you about -rrb- partly because he -- in common with all of we californian -- be proud of we state and like nothing better than bring its beauty spot to the notice of sympathetic stranger that i be sure the daughter of my old friend merriam must be and i be look forward to she arrival in san francisco which place i be too busy to leave at present i hope we meeting may be soon and wish i be a married man that i might have the pleasure of entertaining ` mr may ' in my house when angelum have read the letter twice she let it fall and again take up the bottle of perfume untie the bow of pink ribbon she pull out the heart-shaped glass stopper and breathe the fragrance of parfait d'amour make from californium flower the name might be laughable but the fragrance be exquisite as the sweet air among the orange grove angelum sigh without know that she sigh as she put the bottle down and push it away she do not even look at it again until she be ready to switch off the electric light and try to sleep after kate have finish she ministration then once more mr may sniff daintily at the parfait d'amour as a bird hover near a tempting crumb throw by a hand it fear she wonder what flower make up this sweetness so different from any perfume she have know it be californium she say to herself essence of californium long after she have go to bed angelum lay awake not restless but vaguely excite as she listen to a mouse in the hinterland of the wall and think she own thought that float from subject to subject but always she could smell the perfume which -- or she imagine it -- fill the room with its sweetness it be a pity that the scent have be give such a silly name if the people of this country can be unconventional when they like why should not _ i _ be unconventional if i like she ask of the darkness it be so gay and amusing to make believe and so -- beautiful it occur to she that she have just begin to live now a door have open before she eye and she see a new world that be big and glorious ready to give she a welcome there be something in be a married woman and go about as i choose she think even if it be only in the country of make-believe why should not i do what he ask I to do i be only mr may whom nobody know and it would be _ fun _ i have not have any fun since i be a little little girl \* \* \* \* \* perhaps nick have be right to trust he luck to she dream or perhaps it be the influence of the letter in any case at eight o'clock next morning angelum with she hair hang over she shoulder and dream still in she eye be ring up mr hilliard by telephone at the alexandrium hotel it be only to say that you may take I -- and kate -- and the cat -- and some luggage -- to santa barbara this morning that be if you still want to oh thanks you be _ very _ kind it be settle _ only _ about to-day you know yes ten o'clock will suit I she hum a dance-tune while kate dress she and the room be still sweet with the fragrance of that strange perfume parfait d'amour make from californium flower she sit beside nick in the yellow car kate -lrb- and black timmy in a basket -rrb- behind with the sharp-nosed youth whom hilliard call he assistant there be also luggage -- enough to last for a few day the rest have be send on by train to san francisco nick enjoy hearing angelum exclaim this be like algecira that be like the italian riviera as the car run on it seem wonderful that she should have see all the most beautiful place in europe that she should hold they picture in she mind now compare they with these new one yet that she heart should be in the new world -- _ he _ world near santa barbara the mountain come crowd down to the sea as at mentone and on the horizon float island mysterious as the mirage of corsica see from the italian shore at sunrise over there nick tell she be a grotto paint in many lovely color and boat dive into it on the crest of a wave he have not hear of the blue grotto at caprus but she describe it and so they go on each with something to tell that the other do not know two new battleship be try they speed in the channel between santa barbara and the island and as the car turn into the park of the hotel the rival race into sight angelum 's eye be dazzle with the brilliant sunshine the blue of the sea and the flaming color of the geranium border that burn like run fire the length of the mile-long drive the veranda be crowd with people but think only of the great ship in the bay she be conscious of see no one until a voice exclaim why princess what a surprise to meet you here it be a voice she know and if she could have step back into the car pull she motor-veil over she eye and ask nick hilliard to drive away she would have be glad but one do not do these thing one face emergency and make the best of they angelum have be foolish she tell herself not to think of run across somebody she know if she wish to hide herself she must be more prudent but for this time it be too late there be theodora dene of all people wait to meet she at the top of the step oh bother angelum have just time to whisper before she find herself shake hand with a tall red-haired hatless girl in a white dress theo dene never wear a hat unless it be absolutely necessary for she hair be she great attraction it be splendid in the sun as she come out of the shade to stand in the blaze of light shake angelum 's hand and send a long-lashed glance to nick she never look at a woman if there be a man worth look at within eye-shot but she have no hypocrisy about this she do not pretend to be a friend of woman though she be nice to they if they do not interfere with she and there be nothing better to do she be twenty-eight and confess to twenty-four she dance as well as a professional sing french song in what she call a twilight voice dress better than most married woman do daring thing and have write two book which shock puritan some of she own experience have be work into she novel which make they read realistically and clergyman in england and america have preach against they so of course they be a great success and sell enormously miss dene herself be also a great success she go where she like alone if she like and during a visit to rome she have lure desirable man from lady who be engage in flirt with they angelum who be not flirt with any one have be amuse by the strange girl but now she would have prefer a chance encounter with almost anybody else please call I mr may she whisper as they shake hand i do not want to be know by the other name the tall young woman in white take in the situation or a view of it and the long green eye -lrb- which she love and copy for she heroine -rrb- smile in a way that fascinate some people and displeased other angelum think that with the strong sunlight bring out the value of red hair black brow white skin and white frock she be like a striking poster sketch in a few daring line with splash of unshaded color dash in between how do you do mr may the girl amend she greeting i think i must be dream you i be not sure that i be not dream myself say angelum i hope you have not come here for you health i want to see californium miss dene laugh that do not sound exciting but perhaps it be she glance again at hilliard to whom a porter have come for direction about luggage nick be tell he that only mr may 's and the maid 's luggage be to go in he intend to stop at another hotel oh _ do _ ask _ that _ to lunch with you and invite I and my friend to you table the girl suggest in a stage whisper i never see anything so beautiful i must know he i have be seek a hero for my new book which i be go to write about californium and i feel he be the one pity the sorrow of the poor author if you do not and she laugh to take away the sting i 'll tell every one who you be the reporter will get you -- as they have I but i like it and you would not angela wonder why she have ever admire red-haired woman and as for long narrow green eye she now think they hideous she be sure in spite of the laugh that miss dene be capable of keep she word i intend to ask he to lunch with I in any case she say calmly and this be true but it be to have be a repetition of yesterday quiet and peaceful and idyllic he be a mr hilliard who have -- be detail by a friend of my father 's to show I some place he know that be he car if you and you friend would care to join we i should be delighted of course then she turn away move back a step or two nearer the edge of the veranda and thus closer to nick i hope you mean to have lunch with I here mr hilliard she say he look up he eye ask if she really want he or if politeness dictate the invitation hers give no cue so he do the simplest and most direct thing which be to he the most natural thing i should like to very much he say but you have find friend i could come back afterward and take you around santa barbara unless -- one of the friend be glad when she hear you be invite theo dene break in and the other friend be so new mr may have not meet they yet you shall be introduce all together in a bunch of course at that nick come up the step and join angelum he have a curious feeling as if he ought to be defend she from something and at the same time a sensation of relief when he hear she once again call mr may princess be only a sort of pet name no doubt that be what he have hope when the word catch he startled attention he would not like to have she turn into a real princess a angel she be for he and might be without seem hopelessly remote somehow but the pedestal of a princess be cold as a block of marble the poster-simile do not occur to nick but he think that the red-haired girl with the self-conscious eye stand beside mr may be like a color lithograph in a magazine compare with a delicate painting in a picture gallery such as he love to go and see in san francisco miss dene 's peculiar attraction strong for many man leave he cold although he might have feel it if he have never see angelum i be travel with mr harland and she brother mr falconer in he private car theo explain she turn to they mr may will not mind my claim she as a friend i hope she be immensely nice to I in rome and we have meet in london too i do not know why i be surprise to see she every one come to this country and mr hilliard perhaps you both know we have meet say john falconer whom nick have praise yesterday as the typical man of californium he put out he hand and nick take it pleased and somewhat surprise by the recognition for he be in he own eye a insignificant person compare to john falconer who have do thing worth do in the world angelum remember nick 's eulogy of the man he be about forty as tall as hilliard though build more heavily nick be clean shaven and falconer wear a close-cut brown beard which give he somewhat the air of a naval officer though he face be not so deeply tan he feature be strong and behind he clear eye thought seem to pass as cloud move under the surface of a deep lake such a man be bear to be a leader no one could look at he and not see that mr harland he sister who -- as nick be aware -- keep house and entertain for falconer be as like he as a very feminine woman can be like a extremely masculine man and in fact they be twin ralph harland a englishman who have own a californium ranch be dead and when he widow be not in europe she stay with she brother they all talk together for a few minute or theo dene talk and let the other speak occasionally then nick say that he must take he car to the garage but would come back for luncheon and when he have flash away miss dene invite herself to mr may 's room do let I go with you she plead with a girlish air which she like to put on with married woman younger than herself she think that amusing it impressed upon they the fact that she be a girl -- free with life before she and indeed the free lance be a nickname of hers which she like rather than dislike of course angelum say do come she have find out that she be tire of miss dene still she be curious to hear what she would say kate have already open she mistress 's luggage and spread gold and crystal toilet thing about there be flower too on the sitting-room table and mantel californium poppy with flaming orange heart nick have telegraph for these but angelum suppose that they have be order by the management this impression be unlikely to be contradict because nick have want she to have the flower not to get the credit for give they but theodora dene who be experienced and shrewd in matter of the heart wonder about the poppy she make no mention of they however to angelum i want you to myself for a minute she explain to tell you i will not forget you be mr may -- _ toujor _ mr may and you need not tell I -- anything unless you like i have tell you why i come to californium say angelum i come to see it and i do think you be see it in the _ nicest _ way miss dene comment sweetly i come for something quite different i do not one bit mind confess to write a book about californium that be what i say to reporter and that i be go to visit mr harland she be quite a dear and i make she ask I last time she be in england because that be the first time i meet she brother i really come over with the idea of marry he he be splendid and have load of money -- which i badly need for i have spend every penny i have make from my book and i have only eight hundred a year of my own that will not buy my frock i take the greatest fancy to he but i see now it be no use rather a bear one hate to fail -- and i be not use to failure however there be a great romance -- which be one consolation i be think whether or not i shall use it for the book i would like to -- only mr falconer 's so well know perhaps i shall pick up another plot anyhow i be recover from the blow and begin to take notice -- as they say of baby and widow that brown man of yours be a dream of beauty do you mind if i smoke no and he _ be not _ mine say angelum take off she motor-veil in front of the mirror well then dear princess if he be not yours and you do not want he to play with do hand he over to I i will not grab he if you want he yourself you be too nice to I in rome you see in rome that i do not play angelum stab a hatpin viciously into she hat there be cat there here there be not -- at least not any who know the mouse angelum daintily cease to be a fellow-being in a disconcerting way she have when she choose and become a high personage she do this without a word without a gesture without even lift she eyebrow there be merely a change of atmosphere miss dene feel it but she do not care here as she would have care in rome there the young princess di sereno could have make or mar she socially in californium she be on the same ground as mr may besides she know a thing about mr may which for some reason or other mr may do not want other people to know so theo sit on a green sofa and smoke a cigarette hope that she look like a snake charmer with the sinuous serpentine smoke-loop weave and writhe round she head pray do not joke in that way before any one else say angela it be rather horrid do not you think no doubt mr hilliard will be delighted to have you ` play ' with he if you see enough of each other to make it worth while waste you energy as she speak she wrestle with a violent desire to show miss dene that nick be not to be detach from he present position of guide philosopher and friend i do not do that sort of thing with ` energy ' i do it with magnetism theo drawl she cigarette be smoke out and she get up well i must run down to mr harland i suppose we arrive only this morning early from monterey and to-morrow we be go on to paso roble that be where mr falconer 's romance come in do you ever hear of paso roble yes say angelum my father own land there with a warm sulphur lake there be a legend about it which he use to tell I the place be sell now but i be go to see it -- because of the legend i have photograph of the old mission -- and of the lake too well perhaps you know then there be a big hotel at paso roble and a ` cure ' i never hear of it before -- but apparently it be famous if you stop there try and find out about a mademoiselle dobieskus and see she if you can who be she angela ask the name sound dimly familiar as if she be a actress or a dancer or somebody one have hear of she _ be _ a singer she _ be _ mr falconer 's romance i would give a good deal to see she i suppose you will if she be a friend of he and you be go to paso roble in he private car no i will not be allow he be send mr harland and I straight on to del monte and then to san francisco he 'll follow and afterward he be go to take we to shasta and the mccloud river where they say he have the most fascinating country house in the world i shall probably have a relapse when i see it i remember now say angelum there be a polish girl who sing in concert and then make she _ début _ in opera in london i never see or hear she but people use to say she be divine then she go back to russia three or four year ago and seem to vanish into space she vanish into siberium reply miss dene meanwhile mr falconer have have time to fall in love with she in london just before she take she russian engagement it be he sister who tell I this -- perhaps to prove that there be no use my have design with a capital d he follow the girl to st petersburg she disappear he put the matter into the hand of a detective -- a american one bring over on purpose -- money no object then mr falconer could not stay any longer himself on account of important interest on this side -- but i believe he flash across once in a while during the last four year when he be suppose to be rest and see europe with he sister she be always in the secret well at last they worm out the truth : that the dobieskus would be arrest as a nihilist secretly and in spite of she popularity on the stage as a singer send to siberia with money or influence or both she be rescue from some dreadful hole and smuggle to england but she would have rheumatic fever and she beauty be go -- she be a cripple still the extraordinary man be faithful -- though he would never even have a chance to try and make she like he do you ever hear of such a lover out of a book no say angelum interested but something within she whisper there might be another such lover specialist -- mr falconer and he sister have the best -- say there be practically no hope that the girl would ever be herself again yet the man would not give up he think there be no place in the world like paso roble for perform miracle the doctor laugh -- because it be natural he should believe in he own country however the dobieskus consent to come mr harland bring she over now she be be here two month and be actually almost cure do try to get a glimpse of she i have a evil idea that my noble host be go to drop off at the spring after shed we encumbrance for the sole purpose of propose if i use this for my plot i shall give myself the satisfaction of make the story end badly i dare say you 'll enjoy do that angelum remark in she gentlest voice i really must go exclaimed theo and throw she cigarette end into angelum 's golden poppy but she do not tell when she go downstairs as angelum be half afraid she would that mr may be the princess di sereno she friend have not leave the veranda mr harland be talk to some people she know falconer walk up and down look at the ship that be still try they speed in sight of the hotel i do wonder _ if the darling angelum know about the prince _ theo ask herself and then join falconer in he walk not mention mr may so you have meet that handsome big boy before she begin hilliard say falconer oh yes i have meet he at mr gaylor 's who be mrs gaylor theo have the curiosity to ask falconer tell she and describe mr gaylor as be a beautiful as well as immensely rich young woman it must be over a year since she husband die he add ` old grizzly gaylor ' he be call a brute i be afraid he take off must have be a relief to she she be leave with a splendid property i have hear it say there may be a match between she and hilliard he use to be foreman of she husband 's ranch but now he be a landowner on he own account strike oil and make a pile of money sell a gusher -- the biggest and longest-lived we have have yet be they engage inquire theo i do not know it be not announce anyhow but it would not be a bad match even for a rich woman hilliard 's a fine fellow all the finer because he be a self-made man by the way the gaylor place be one of the show ranch of californium i think we ought to take you to see it do cry miss dene i could write about it could not i i would like to see mr gaylor another californium type for my book and again she ask herself i wonder if _ dear _ angelum know about the prince xiii for the sake of dramatic effect somehow miss dene get herself invite to spend the afternoon in see with mr may and hilliard all the thing which falconer and he sister have spend the whole morning in show she exactly how she do this she herself might have tell -- with she occasional startling frankness -- if she have choose but mr may could not perhaps angelum have invite she or say something which could be snap up as a invitation for nick would hardly have suggest a second guest unless he first guest expressly wish for one in any case the fact remain that theo dene be go in the yellow car for a spin round santa barbara to the country club the hope ranch and above all to the mission she stand talk on the veranda to falconer and mr harland as she wait for angelum to come down and for hilliard to bring round the car she host and hostess be laugh at she change of plan for she have announce early in the day that she mean to lie down all the afternoon and rest she feature who be the beautiful mr may ask falconer theo do not like this way of put the question because quite sincerely she herself admire no woman who be not of she own type she be tempt to take advantage of angelum 's desire not to be know and say : oh she be one of a thousand other pretty travel woman with intermittent husband this would have be epigrammatic and at the same time it might have quench dawn interest in the stranger neither the brother nor sister be of the sort who favor flit lady with vague male belongings keep in the background but suddenly a brilliant idea occur to miss dene who love dramatic effect mr may choose to be a ordinary tourist theo say with just the right air of mystery but if she like she could travel as a personage she have she own reason for come to america just as i have mine though hers be different do not you think she ought to see shasta and the mccloud river if she impression be to be complete would she care to go say mr harland john and i would be delighted to take she and put she up for a week-end -- would not we john of course say falconer from what i saw of she she would be a charming guest but poor hilliard -- oh do ask he too and give I a chance to flirt with he please i have have such poor success with you i be feel crushed do you think mr gaylor too formidable for I if i be a bet man i would bet on you falconer laugh but i do not know how far matter have go between mr gaylor and hilliard it may be gossip all the world love a lover you know and it be human nature to weave a romance around two interesting figure place toward each other as these be well i should like to try my hand if he be not pre-engage say miss dene and if it be he will not be waste on I for i can always use he up in a book what fun to have mr gaylor at the same time we should soon see if they be engage if we bring they together should not we if not i would be free to get in as much deadly work as possible be mr may 's husband living ask falconer with a twinkle of mischief in he usually grave eye i think i must not tell even you anything about she private affair miss dene answer virtuously but i have reason to know that for _ this _ race anyhow she be out of the run as mr may be tell you at luncheon mr hilliard be show she a few thing because the mutual friend who be to have do it could not he can not show she shasta and mccloud though as you can for a mere motor 's no attraction compare to a private car i be sure she be never be in one as gorgeous as the kind in america -- yours in particular well we must give she the chance to try it say falconer and you _ will _ think of invite mr gaylor at the same time theo turn she eye from she host to he sister beseechingly i do not know mr gaylor well mrs harland demur but if john want you to see she ranch and take we there i do not mind ask she to rush river camp for a day or two it be not very likely that she would refuse -- the lady smile -- as i be afraid that socially she be more or less neglect in spite of she beauty or because of it say falconer and here come mr may a moment later the car come too and angelum realize that already she have reach the stage when she would miss take she place beside hilliard she sit behind with miss dene and billy the assistant climb into the seat next the chauffeur 's theo avail herself of the opportunity to tell what she have hear about nick and mr gaylor with embroidery of she own the air be balm of a thousand flower but for angelum it be no longer parfait d'amour the two battleship have long ago finish they speed trial and trail of float kelp lay like golden sea-serpent asleep under the blue ripple of the sea everything be very beautiful but it be not yesterday in the town with the mission still distant she begin to feel the foreignness of santa barbara the street have spanish name and the tree seem musical as she have think that tree seem in the south of europe as if they have hear and see all the happiness of history and have set they to music with they branch pretty girl ride barehead with sunburned man in sombrero just outside the straggle town between hedge of rose that make boundary for bungalow the beauty of the world sing a song in angelum 's ear with the rush breeze the motor make the wind in the tree the flash light and shadow on the mountain clear-cut lovely peak spring toward a sky that be like fire opal with turquoise glowing blue behind it still this be not yesterday the song of the world 's beauty do not seem mean personally for she as it have then pile of grain in the field be like plumed golden helmet lay down in row to await the head of rest warrior the californium oak different from all other oak be classic in shape as greek temple sacred to forest deity stand against a background of indigo sea but miss dene would talk theodora in she book make a speciality of describe the emotional soul of woman she favorite female thermometer be usually at freezing or boiling point -- never temperate description of scenery she could not do and what she call landscape gaze bore she she be more interested in people and big town than in wide space where nature try to lecture she but because angelum admire the country she admire it too more audibly than angelum they save the mission for the last nick have set he heart on show it to mr may at sunset as for theo though she say so much he know by instinct that it be not she who care for the beauty of the magnolia hedge the hay-gilded meadow and the dark oak that blot the gold he feel that he ought to admire miss dene for she be handsome and put herself out to be kind to he but he wish the girl away and be glad that to-morrow she would be travel with she own friend when she look at he with she greenish eye she have the air of judge he point as if he be a portrait she think of add to she collection and of wish he to look at she nick be not to be fascinate in this way along the cliff drive they go to the hope ranch and angelum try to think of the brave old day of the roar forty of barbecue and wedding feast for spanish bride -- day when the business of life be to love and laugh and dance and spend the money yield by thousand of roll acre accord to the story all woman have be beautiful all man brave and ready to fight for the lady they love and though the world have change since then faster here than elsewhere it seem to she that at heart the man of america have keep to old tradition more closely than man in older country then she smile at herself for this impression for after all what do she know of american man when they turn at last come back toward the mission to which somehow all the rest have be lead up the setting sun be beat the dusk into spark of fire at first glimpse alighting before the step of the restore mission church angelum compare it unfavourably in she mind with the lovely shabbiness of san gabriel she have a feeling that santa barbara the pleasure-place live on santa barbara the mission with its history and romance but she have only to go inside to beg pardon of the church for she first impression it be easy to remember that there have never be the same stress of poverty here as among the missionary father of san gabriel in the city of angelum yet in this place too there be the same pathetic effect which have bring tear to angelum 's eye in the dim little church at san gabriel a effect that once feel and understand give the old spanish mission they great undying charm at santa barbara -- sweet name ring like the silver bell of the franciscan father -- as at san gabriel there have be the same strive to copy the noble design and proportion of the spanish cathedral vision in spirit by the homesick monk who know well they would never see they with bodily eye again with simple material and unskilled indian worker these exile man have strive to reproduce in the far lonely west the architecture of the east loved and lose by they forever the very simplicity of the church make its beauty -lrb- illustration : _ santa barbara mission with its history and romance _ -rrb- the scar of santa barbara mission have be patch up while at san gabriel the bandage be vine and flower but the sunset light lend to the cloister all the stateliness and glory of some old monastery in southern spain the octagonal fountain on the bare terrace drip silver and a embroidery of lichen have gilded the rose-coloured tile of the sloping roof with all shades and tint of gold the sun bidding good-bye to the day give back for a hour the splendor of the past the three go up into the bell tower and look down upon the old garden of the monk then away to the shelter hill with the far-off rampart of mountain it be beautiful there and the bell in they open window-like arch have the kindly beauty of age and experience angelum tap they with pink finger-nail and bring out a faint musical whisper which seem to breathe some secret if only she could understand but she could not she feel dull and unhappy she could not tell why certainly it could not be for such a stupid dog-in-the-manger reason as because nick hilliard be suppose to be engage to he boss 's widow -- a most suitable arrangement perhaps it be the dreamy sadness of this place which have take hold of she if there be a secret in the musical whisper of the bell it be a secret of the past and it be time to come which be cloud for angelum there seem to be nothing definite in it for she to touch she bodily eye look out over the bay of santa barbara grape-purple with the wine of sunset but she spirit see only the uncharted sea of the future across which strange sunrise glimmer and wind cry like harp or voice call to she in prophecy she could not hear happiness which she have never know seem to live beyond that sea in a island palace but the key of the palace lay fathom deep fall among rock under deep water when angelum have be on she way to californium she have say to herself : i shall be happy there live alone in some place which i shall find because i shall be at peace and disagreeable thing can never come to I but now suddenly she feel that more than peace be need she want to be happy with a happiness far remove from peace i think i 'll go to the north to live she decide in all this sunshine and color one need love -- or else one 's out of the picture at a little distance miss dene be tell nick hilliard that she be glad she have meet he because he be just what she want for she book about californium i be go to see you ranch she say and mr gaylor 's ranch i have hear about it -- and she she be very handsome be not she yes say nick and a great friend of yours -- you best friend a great friend he echo wish that angelum hold herself remote would let he draw she into the conversation it occur to miss dene see nick 's eye wander that perhaps there be something about she which california man be not train to appreciate for she be not have she usual success and she have scarcely make the sensation she have expect to make in san francisco although she have be interview and one reporter have say that she hair be dye nevertheless if she could not have the sort of fun she want she would at least have what fun she could she be sure that with mr gaylor and the princess di sereno and this big unsophisticated young man between they life would be interesting even for a onlooker i can see chapter first anyhow she laugh to herself and again she wonder if angelum know about the prince that night while everybody drink coffee and talk or play bridge in the hall it be suddenly flood with a tidal wave of woman they flow into the hotel in a compact stream of femininity billow of stout elderly lady and dancing ripple of slim young girl with here and there a side-eddy of thin middle-aged spinsterhood each female thing have a grip and of these possession they build the desk a mountain of volcanic formation which look alarmingly subject to eruption and upheaval then they all begin to talk at once to each other and to such hotel official as they could overwhelm and swamp good gracious what be it ask miss dene of falconer who be suppose to be a human encyclopedia of general information i do not suppose there be so many woman in the world they be native daughter out for a excursion and the time of they life say falconer why native angelum venture it sound like oyster and it mean californium they be all bear in this state and they will now proceed to see something of it in each other 's company to-morrow morning they 'll ` do ' the mission of santa barbara they 'll do _ for _ it if they all try to get in at once laugh miss dene the place will be simply crawl with daughter how lucky we have do we sightseeing to-day she do not take the trouble to moderate she voice and one of the new arrival who hover alone on the edge of the crowd like a bubble of foam fling out by the surge wave stand near enough to overhear she turn and throw a glance at the group in time to catch _ en route _ to the back of she dress a look send forth from the eye of miss dene it be that look which have no family resemblance to any other look yet be always the same in the eye of the best and the worst woman -- the look she give another woman 's dress the style and fit of which fill she with supreme disgust the victim do not take this well-known gaze with meekness she be a small person thin as a lath with no attempt at complexion and a way of do she hair which alone would have prove impeccable virtue in the face of incriminate circumstantial evidence she have neat little feature and a neat little figure though provincial be write over she in conspicuous letter and the gray eye which she fasten on miss dene look almost ill with gloomy intelligence she do not attempt to down the beautifully dress young woman with a retort though she expression betray a temptation to be fishwifish it be evident however that she be a little lady though she wear a badly make frock and she hat sit like a hard extraneous bath bun on the top of she neat head whether or no she be a native daughter native good breeding fight with and get the better of fatigue nervousness and irritation she merely gaze fixedly for a long second at miss dene as if to say i know my dress be amateurish and yours be perfectly lovely but i have a heart and would hate to hurt the feeling of anybody especially one who could not pay I back whereas _ you _ only use for a heart be to keep you blood in circulation angelum see this silent play of weapon and all she sympathy be with the stranger in dusty blue alpaca she busy herself mentally in rearrange the little woman 's hair dress she in such a way as to make she quite pretty and young-looking and have not finish the operation when a hotel clerk appear with a paper in he hand you name please he say to the small unaccompanied person my name be sara wilkin she reply in a clear precise voice which match she personality but i must tell you that i be _ not _ a native daughter and have not engage a room i arrive at the same time with the other and when they be settle i hope you 'll be able to find I something otherwise i hardly know what i shall do as it be late and i be travel alone i be afraid i can do nothing for you madam if you have not engage say the young man civilly these lady be expect and a great many will be sleep three and four in a room i be sorry but there be other hotel in the town i be sorry too say the lady in the dusty alpaca i have want for year to stay in this hotel if it be only for a few hour as i have read so much about it and i arrange to stop off at santa barbara on purpose though i really ought to have go on and i be _ so _ tired angelum could bear no more oh would you take my sitting-room she ask with the smile she have inherit with she heart and a few other thing from franklin merriam it would be such a shame to go away when you have want to stop here -- so late too and you might not get in anywhere else i shall be delighted -- really -- and i be sure they can make you up a comfortable bed for there be a big lounge in the room nick sit adoring she with he eye and miss dene believe that mr may have make the offer to please he and falconer man be very silly and sentimental about such thing but as she theo have no sitting-room of she own they could not blame she for selfishness miss wilkin look at angelum with she intelligent gray eye why that be very kind of you she say i do not like to take you room -- but you must like it or you 'll spoil my pleasure angelum break in look so charming in she wish to make the little dusty person happy that few woman and no man could have resist or help believe in she it be at this moment that falconer determine to tell mr may something about certain private interest of he at paso roble which he have not intend to mention well i _ will _ take the room then and i will like it too return miss wilkin i do not know how to thank you enough i be give up nothing that i shall mind do without say angelum and do not dream that she have stir the deep water under which a golden key lay hide the key of that island palace in the uncharted sea of the future xiv the mystery of san miguel do you think you will go to shasta in mr falconer 's private car nick ask wistfully they be fly along together on the wind of the bright angel angelum by nick 's side on the way to paso roble it be afternoon of the next day falconer and mr harland and theo dene have leave santa barbara in the morning and the sister and brother have be so press in they invitation that angelum have hardly know how to refuse though not quite willing to accept late that night mr harland and theo would arrive at del monte where falconer would join they and in a day or two they would go on to san francisco where miss dene have already be visit in mr harland 's maid kate have find a friend from she own part of the ould country who have come over three year ago and who have know tim this meeting be such a joy that angelum have fall in with mr harland 's suggestion that kate should go on to paso roble in mr falconer 's car mccloud the girl would thus enjoy she friend 's society for several hour and have arrange mr may 's thing in the room already engage at the hotel would await she mistress 's arrival that evening therefore angelum nick and the little chauffeur have the bright angel to themselves for a run of a few hour through beautiful country and a visit to the old mission of san miguel before arrive at paso roble do i think i shall go angelum echo the question lazily for she be happier this morning and bask dreamily in the change not trouble to wonder what have bring it about i hardly know they be very kind to ask I californian people seem so warm-hearted to stranger and so hospitable one can not help feel one 's know they for year instead of day _ you _ be like that too -- otherwise i should not be here and i have almost forget to be surprise at myself for -- anything i like mr falconer mr harland too but he be what you say -- splendid i understand why you call he typically californian i be glad say nick and he try to be glad but he have not be tell the romance of mademoiselle dobieskus falconer do not guess that angelum or theo dene know it though he propose introduce mr may to a polish lady stay at paso roble then of course you will go to shasta and they 'll take you to they place on the mccloud river they say falconer 's house be the prettiest place of the sort in californium mr gaylor 's never be but she read a lot about society folk and they doings in the papers you 'll sure have a good time why do you say ` you ' they invite you too yes and that be _ really _ kind nick say it be not ` kindness ' to ask you because ` twould be a honor to have you visit but they do not want I i be ask only because i happen to be with you and mr harland be afraid my feeling would be hurt if i be leave out i be sure you be mistaken angelum insist laugh within herself because he have not see theo 's maneuver of course they want you she could not add what be in she mind anyway miss dene do as for carman angelum have no idea that the invitation be to be extend to she and the figure of mr gaylor who accord to theo intend to marry hilliard loom less important than after listen to miss dene 's gossip of course it would be a good thing for he to care for mr gaylor and if she be really nice to marry she in the end only when a young woman be in a motor-car with a handsome forest creature who appear to live only for she pleasure she do not think much beyond the hour for that hour he may be hers and hers alone though to-morrow they part and she shut she eye to anything so far away so out of the picture as a end i be not mrs harland 's kind nick explain nor falconer 's though he be too big a man to care for what people call ` social distinction ' they would be kind to I if i go and would not let I feel any difference they could help but there would be a house-party maybe and i would not know any one i would be ` out of it ' i could not stand for that mr may you be sensitive angelum say in some way nick admit but he do not admit the truth that he could not and would not go to rush river camp because he be jealous of falconer to nick it seem impossible that any man free to love could be five minute in angelum 's society without fall in love with she he have have he moment of hope but with falconer for a rival the handicap be too great not that nick mean to give up the fight but if she go to shasta it would be a knockdown blow john falconer be high enough for a place in mr may 's own world nick despise jealousy as common and shameful and have always scorn man who yield to so mean a vice now however they have he pity he know what they suffer and he could not go with mr may in falconer 's car nevertheless he beat down the desire to dissuade she from the trip you ought not to miss mccloud river he force himself to say i 'll see say angela it be nice not to make up one 's mind but just to enjoy the minute be you enjoy the minute yes he be reward for this minute be he they be spin along the coast road between sea and meadow with the salt breeze in they face the red-gold earth rise and fall in gracious curve like the breast of a sleep indian girl and now and then a azure inlet of the sea light up a meadow as eye light a face in the distance mountain seem to float like spirit guardian of hill-child and desert dune billow through irrigated garden oasis like river of gold boil up from magic mine nick point out the two little mountain name after loui the bishop and tell angelum tale of the country of the people and of the little town with spanish name and face which give she always that haunt impression of the old world some of the story be she father 's story and she like hilliard the better for know they they have both forget miss sara wilkin who have stop off at santa barbara because all she life she have want to see the place but just at that moment on she way to bakersfield she happen to be think of they both at last the car plunge into a maze of folding hill like giant dune the motor road be weave in twisted strand while the railway overhead stride across the gap between height and height on a vast trestle that might have be build for a army of martian rock-crested hill rise gray in the sun above the soft night of oak forest and as the road ascend its ribbon be loop from mountain to mountain like the throw lasso of a cowboy paso roble mean ` pass of the oak ' say nick as they come into a stretch of billow country where immense tree shadow the summer gold of meadow shall we go first to the mission of san miguel nick ask or be you tired and shall i take you to the hotel now i be not tire say angelum she do not want this day to end yet we 'll hit the trail for the mission then say nick and see the sunset as we do from santa barbara can this be as beautiful angelum ask surely not you maybe will not think so but i know it will be more beautiful for I he answer that import young lady with all those elegant fixing sort of jar with the mission architecture to my mind angelum hope that she laugh be not cattish but i be import too she say shall i jar on you at san miguel you be _ not _ import nick dare to contradict she or if you be you be the kind there ought not to be any duty on a rain of sunset color pour over mountain hill and meadow as nick turn he car toward san miguel when they come in sight of the old mission -lrb- build far from the spring because of hostile indian -rrb- the change light be like a illuminate fountain at last when they begin to fade angelum say let we go if we stay longer we sha not remember this at its best she would have be surprise if she have know what happiness there be for nick in the word we speak as she often speak it now : we must do this we must not forget that but it be a blow when she ask billy the chauffeur if he would like to see the mission nothing can hurt the car she say and when we come back it will be too late nick be tempt to glare a warning and suppress the youth 's interest in object of historical value : but he refrain billy must not get it into he head that there be anything go on so the chauffeur be allow to follow nick and angelum as they wander so it seem to he sentimentally about the big mission enclosure between crumble adobe wall where the franciscan father have sheltered cattle in night of peace and indian in night of danger billy could not feel the pathos of the place -- desolate yet impressive in its simplicity but as he saunter about he hand in he pocket whistle beneath he breath i can not marry you he smart little modern mind begin to work the strategic value of the position appeal to he and he see why those old johnny as he irreverently style the padre have plant the mission here guess they know they business ` most as well as if they would be soldier he say to himself billy find pleasure in picture the massacre which must have take place imagine the great door of the enclosure open hastily to let in a escape band of friendly then the burst in of the enemy and the death of the father as they try to protect they indian child many have die by fire and tomahawk but always other have come to take they place and so the work have go on through time even as the bell-signal have go on sound from mission to mission along el camino reale the highway of the padre one father life here a dear old gentleman say nick i meet he once but he may not remember I i 'll knock at he door to ask for the key of the church somehow i think you be go to like it better than the church of santa barbara there be something special about this place i hardly know what but you 'll know and they have get some vestment they be proud of -- make by queen isabellum the catholic and she lady it rather surprise angelum to hear nick speak of isabellum the catholic for this way of name the queen show knowledge of history and angelum have not yet discover that history be nick 's favorite reading indeed she be only begin to learn a few thing about he at first she whole rather patronize idea of the young man have be that he be a interesting type a picturesque figure then when she hear he talk with falconer and falconer talk of he and of what he have do she see that hilliard be already a man of importance in he state : that the picturesque figure be merely the woman 's point of view she be cease to patronize he mentally now and almost every hour he give she some surprise at a closed door in the white desert cloister hilliard knock but there be no answer he face cloud for he have set he heart on show mr may this mission church this mean we can not get the key sigh angelum i be afraid so he agree but it be possible the padre 's show some one around or have a look at he beloved vestment they walk to the church door and find it shut but to they surprise the big old-fashioned key be in the lock nick push the door open and they both go in follow by billy the padre be not to be see so far as they could tell in the dimness the church be empty queer exclaim nick i wonder what can have become of the padre it be not like he to leave he church open at this time of the evening it be late and we 'll have to light up before we start on although we have only eight mile to go i be sorry he be not here angelum say i should have love to see queen isabellum 's vestment would you well you shall if i have to turn everything in the church upside down they must be somewhere the two wander on peer through the dusk at the primitive painting and decoration make by indian accord to design of spanish monk do you suppose the vestment may be keep up in that gallery angelum suggest it look a safe sort of place for treasure but if they be there i be afraid we shall find they in a lock box it be worth try and they climb the narrow stair that lead up to a gallery curtain with twilight there sure enough be a box and like the door it be open the key in the lock within free to every hand be the embroidery the great treasure of the church be not it mysterious she ask in a half-whisper for loud tone would make jarring note in this haunt of silence can anything have happen to the padre thing do not happen these day nick reassure she but he be not quite easy in he mind it be too dark for you to see the vestment well shall i carry they downstairs no say angelum i would rather look at they here it be like stare at flower in the night the color come up to you eye in the most wonderful way see that she mean to kneel by the open chest nick whip off he coat to lay under she knee and she laugh as she name he sir walter raleigh hilliard and billy stand behind she nick stoop sometimes to examine a steal or altar-cloth she wish to show he billy frankly bore until a faint sound somewhere make he prick up he ear maybe that be the padre now say he shall i go and look then he patter down the steep stairway without wait to be answer angelum and nick forget he for a moment until he nasal young voice call excitedly from below the gallery : say mr hilliard we be lock in what exclaim nick straighten himself up and drop the end of a embroidered steal some fellow 's be to the door and lock it on the outside xv the wise bird in the dark it be very dim in the mission church angelum have not realize how dim until she hear the news announce through billy 's nose they be lock in somebody have be to the door somebody have lock it on the outside and it be deep twilight almost night suddenly it seem completely night the color of the old vestment still glow in the dusk like smoulder coal in a die fire but that be because of the rich tint and because the eye gaze at they be accustom to darkness look up at nick to see what he silence mean and whether he be nonplussed or merely decide on a plan of action angelum could hardly make out he feature she could see clearly only he eye luminous and gray what shall we do she ask she voice sound appeal like that of a child do not worry mr may say nick with sudden cheerfulness we 'll get out all right i be just study what must have happen that be why i be so mum i reckon the padre must have be away -- though why he leave the key in the door beat I -- and come back he lock up for the night unless he go around in the direction of the auto he would not have see it if he look in here of course he would have think the church empty we be in the gallery and it be late in the day now so late he would not expect visitor it be so ` late in the day ' that it be night cry angelum another reason for he not see the motor not quite night yet and i be go down to make all the noise i can at the door assist by billy there 'll be such a din between the two of we you 'll want to stop you ear and as for the padre he 'll come trot as fast as he leg will carry he to stop the row nick laugh so jovially that angelum begin to be seriously concerned if it be necessary to assume such gaiety he must regard the situation as desperate she remember how far away be the sole occupied room among the many empty echo cell nick help she down the steep stairway and the touch of he hand upon she arm be comforting it be cold in the darkening church and she feel the chill more in imagination than in body yet she shiver what if we have to stay here all night she think but she keep the think to herself nick and billy take turn in pound on the door shout hi padre then do it together but the separate and combined noise ear-splitting inside the church produce no result the dreamy silence be shatter in vain and at last when the two refuse to be discourage by lack of success angelum stop they it be no use she say he be not go to hear and i shall have hysteric or something idiotic if you keep on for one more minute i be think of try another way say nick still painfully cheerful what other way -- since even samson could not batter down the door a lot simpler than batter climb out of a window too high say angelum no i can manage all right i 'll get out find the padre and -- and leave I here in the dark no but there 'll be billy let billy go angelum half whisper and you stay with I suppose you go and the padre be not there and -- and you be not able to get back oh i could not bear _ that _ never have nick know so exquisite a moment he be sorry this queer mysterious accident have happen because it seem to reflect somehow on he intelligence and foresight as a guide and he hate to have angelum distressed but -- after he striving with jealousy and he defeat -- it be balm that she should depend upon he and want he with she in this adventure i think if worst come to worst i might find a ladder outside he say fearful of betray he illicit happiness billy can find a ladder if there be one angelum persist there be the most weird rustling sound which come every once in a while and i can not possibly stand it with only billy nick could hardly speak for joy but he manage to reply all right billy shall be the man to go the go be easier to propose than to carry out : for in bygone day when the padre of old spain be build new spain mission church have to protect they flock against the devil incarnate as well as excarnate window be make few and high and now when the brave builder sleep it be nobody 's business to worry about the free passage of air such window as san miguel possess be hermetically close that night when angelum di sereno and nick hilliard be imprison and billy stand on nick 's shoulder have to work a few tedious moment before he could induce one of these window to open by the time the wiry slim figure be ready to straddle the window-sill slip out dangling and drop on the grass night have close in fragrant and purple in the open heavy and black in the church angelum come and stand close to nick she have never be a timid girl but since the night when she have lie watch a thief who slowly slowly raise she window twelve storey above the ground foolish and hitherto unknown terror creep through she vein if she happen to wake in the dark and now there certainly be a rustling which stir the silence then die as if it have never be do not go away from I she say it be so dark that if we be separate we may be age find each other this sound like a allegory no we must not be separate nick answer strike by she word as if by a prophecy then he too hear the rustling -- faint winged and mysterious they stand still and close together listen there be no sound from outside -- not a call for the padre not a reassuring shout that billy have succeed in find he angelum grope with she hand and by accident touch nick 's to save he soul he could not have resist press the small cold finger wonderful she do not snatch they away often they have shake hand or nick have take hers to help she in or out of the motor-car but there have be nothing like this he feel the thrill of the touch go through he as though electric wire flash a message to he heart he be afraid of himself -- afraid he should kiss she hand or stammer out i love you and that would be fatal for she would never trust herself to he again besides it would not be fair she be like a child ask he protection here in the dark and he must treat she as a man treat a child who have come to he because it be afraid but he could not think of she as a child he think of the night in new york when she have knock on he door and call to he a stranger for help he think how he have see she drown in the wave of she hair like the angel of he dream do you hear that she whisper let he keep she hand even clasp he with she finger there be something alive in this church something besides ourselves nick feel giddy it be all he could do to keep himself from catch she in he arm no matter what might be the consequence no matter how she might hate he a moment afterward but he resist and the strain of temptation pass a bird have get in perhaps he say you -- you -- do not think it could be the padre himself ill or -- or -- nick understand she hesitation and fear no he soothe she we would have see any but some small thing i have get two or three match in my box i guess we 'll have a look around this be supreme self-sacrifice on he part for to find match and look around mean let angelum 's hand go to let it go be tempting providence since almost certainly she would never of she own accord slip it into he again yes do let we she say and draw the hand away nick suppose she have hardly be conscious that he have hold she finger in he and even press they but this be not the fact true angelum have mechanically grope for a protect touch nevertheless she be aware of nick 's hand on hers and glad of it with a gladness make up of several conflict feeling : such as surprise some slight shame and defiance of that shame she be afraid of the rustling in the dark which might mean a lurk thief a man half murder or one of a dozen thing each more unpleasant than the other yet she half like be afraid in the dark with nick hilliard to reassure she though she would have hate it with billy no unknown horror she could conjure up would have make she want to touch billy she be almost sorry when nick find he match and together they begin move about the church she keep a little behind the last match but one light up something white that stir beside the altar and as the flame die down leave only a red glowing point a pair of eye like two point of fire stare up from the floor oh murmur angelum and clutch nick 's coat sleeve like a girl of early victorian day but after all woman have not change in essential they be much the same now in the dark when pale thing stir or shine unexpectedly and they be still glad to have with they at such time a man preferably a handsome man they happen to like better than any other great scot it be a owl say nick profit by the last match of all it be or appear to be a white owl and it seem to he for a second or two as if the witch-bird of the grapevine man at lo angele have come to give the advice it have refuse but this be a childish idea he know the owl be a plain ordinary owl which no doubt live in the neighborhood of san miguel and have flop in perhaps in search of the proverbial church mouse it be afraid of the other intruder and afraid of the match so afraid that it flap its wing and hoot dismally it hoot three time which if it have be the witch fortune-teller might really have mean something though there be no time just then to think what nick be somewhat alarmed lest in its anger and fear it should dash at angelum 's face but she would not let he strike the creature with he hat no poor thing it be worse off than we be because it be alone and we be together she say we 'll go and leave it in peace now we know what it be and she keep beside nick in the dark by hold daintily to he coat sleeve he find the step of the gallery and make she sit down on the lower one roll up for a cushion he coat on which she have kneel as she look at the vestment it begin to seem odd that billy have not come back but it be difficult for nick to regret the delay as much as he ought for angelum 's sake to have regret it when she shiver and confess that she be cold nick fetch she a priest 's coat from the gallery a rare piece of brocade embroidered perhaps by queen 's finger and smell of incense what can have happen to billy angelum wonder it be the strangest thing that he do not come back i begin to be frighten about he nick reassure she once more thing often seem queer that be simple when explain as doubtless this would be i suppose you would not like I to go -- he begin only to be cut short before he could finish he sentence no -- if you mean would i like you to go and look while you be here -- yes mr may why of course nothing matter so much and i wish you would not stand where i can not see you do sit down on this step by I so nick sit down on the step and she shoulder touch he arm they talk in low voice he tell she thing to keep she mind off the situation : thing about the mission and other mission then the conversation turn to nick 's ranch and the oil gusher which have give he fortune out of threaten ruin and he describe the queer little oil city which have grow up on he land i should like to see it angelum say when he have picture lucky star city and ranch in a simple way which be nevertheless curiously graphic he catch up she word eagerly would you let I take you there he beg mr gaylor would invite you to stay at she house you know i have tell you about that and how -- yes i know angelum could hardly have explain why but somehow she do not want to hear mr gaylor talk of just then she be no longer indifferent to the idea of see nick 's home and the woman who have help he to make it yet she be not sure that she wish to go there certainly she do not wish to visit mr gaylor but -- she would like to know whether the mistress of the gaylor ranch be really so very beautiful what we must think about now be how to get out of this church she go on laugh faintly in the dark it seem as if we might have to stay here all the rest of we life be you hungry nick inquire a little in he enraged disgust at not be able to procure a meal nick would gladly have kill and cook the owl be _ you _ angelum ask be i -- what hungry good heaven no time pass vaguely as time do pass in the dark when there be no means of count the minute they could hear they watch tick if they listen but they never listen long enough to know how the seconds go by and all the match be go it 's like be lose in a cave or a mine or the catacomb angelum reflect aloud with you only candle burn out you can not tell whether it be minute or hour it must be mighty tedious for you i be afraid though billy 's sure to come back soon say nick no somehow it be not tedious she answer as if puzzle i suppose i be rather excite and you -- well i suppose i be rather excite too say nick in he low quiet voice that do not betray what he feel angelum 's voice tell more of what go on in she soul it be as nick often think a voice of light and shadow at last -- what time it might be they could not tell -- there come a sound of a key turn in a lock the door open and a yellow ray from a lantern stream into the church make the owl in its corner flutter wildly billy 's face show in a frame of dull gold as he peer about blinking then for the first time angelum know that nick have be angry with the chauffeur there be something in he tone as he say well so you have come which suggest that if she have not be there the forest creature might have add some strong and primitive language could not help it mr hilliard i do the best i could billy explain hastily when i get out there i be up against a tough proposition and i guess it would have be tougher yet if i would stop to do much thinking i do not know what you proposition be but seem to I if it have be mine i would have find time to yell : ` all right -- come as soon as i can ' as i pass the open window nick remark dryly mr may 'll think we be a nice lot but billy break into a flood of explanation too proud to excuse himself to hilliard after be as he think unjustly reproach yet willing to justify himself in the eye of the lady he have drop from the window he say just in time to see a dim figure which look like that of a padre disappear in the distance he have start instantly in pursuit if he have wait to call out under the window the figure would have disappear and he might not have find it again as it be the old man have go so far and be go so fast that it have take some time to catch up he -- billy -- have yell the padre -- for the padre it be -- have eventually stop then have follow explanation why the key be in the church door and the door open why the door be afterward lock and why the padre be hurry away from the mission late in the evening with the key in he pocket and all these explanation be simple enough simpler than billy 's own in the first place a gentleman in the hotel at paso roble -- one who come often to the mission of san miguel and be a most important person -- have send a message ask that the church might be open for he in the afternoon he wish to drive out and bring a lady to see the mission the padre oblige to spend the afternoon at the bedside of a man die at a distant farmhouse stick the key in the church door with a note attach ask the lady and gentleman to lock the door when ready to go away and hide the key under a big stone which the letter indicate the vestment and altar cloth the great treasure of the church have be purposely leave in a open box that they might be inspect by the visitor and the padre have depart with a grow uneasiness in he mind lest the instruction should be neglect so strong be he presentiment though the gentleman be not one to forget that he feel compel to leave the sick man before nightfall and hurry off to the church to see if he fear be justified he promise however to return to the bedside immediately and luckily meet the gentleman hear a confession that indeed the key have be forget only a short time have pass since the church be leave empty therefore the padre have no further fear for the safety of the vestment he hurry on miss see the motor find the key in the church door as he expect give it a quick turn in the lock take it out put it in the pocket of he long gown and start back to the farm as fast as he leg would carry he well would not he give you the key nick ask when the story have reach this point yes he give it to I but it be pretty dark by that time and a good long way from the mission i lose myself and think i be never go to get here billy admit i guess i must have wander all round robin hood 's barn when just as i be ready to give up boat the star come out through a lot of cloud and show I the roof of the church i steer by that and here i be i think we must be grateful and not scold he say angelum i do my best anyhow billy persist and i bring this lantern out of the auto the worst be i do not know how she light 'll work for thinkin ' to be at the hotel before dark i do not bring no water nick stifle a word or two he would have like to say reflect that perhaps he be as much as to blame as billy he ought to have leave nothing to chance where angelum 's comfort and safety be concern they get water though find it mean further delay and after all the acetylene lamp obstinately refuse to shine it be the first time they have be use since nick buy the car and he abuse himself roundly for not have test they temper something be wrong something which neither he knowledge nor billy 's could set right and after tinker for half a hour they start with no other light than that of the lantern which billy propose to hold while hilliard drive by this time angelum be thankful for the cloak she have leave in the car it be nearly twelve and the eight mile which the bright angel would gaily have gobble up in the same number of minute have she be able to use she eye take a hour to negotiate like a wounded lioness the car crawl along the dark road illumine only by a fitful spot of yellow light and a deep-toned clock somewhere be striking one as she draw up before the door of the hotel most of the window have go to sleep but a few near the front entrance be twinkling wakefully and the door fly open in response to the call of the motor a servant of the hotel come out but behind the liveried man appear the tall figure of john falconer with a woman at he side we have be anxious about you falconer say come forward that we be suggestive and angelum 's fancy spring to a happy end for the mar romance as she enter the hall dazzle by the light she first glance be for the woman who stand beside falconer smile though a little shy it do not need falconer 's introduction to tell that this be mademoiselle dobieskus and if the singer have lose she youth in siberium paso roble or the magic medicine of love have give it back she pale face light by immense dark eye be radiant and though she lean lightly on a stick it seem that this be a mere concession to a doctor 's order or a habit not quite forget this be the lady i tell you of falconer say to angela when he have hear the story of the adventure i tell she about you too and she would sit up to see you so would you maid of course who have be in a great state of anxiety -- and even the cat be depressed mademoiselle dobieskus have be try to console you poor irish girl i could not bear she to be unhappy say the singer in a voice of a curiously thrilling quality i be so happy myself this be the best day of my life i do not want it to end the doctor have tell she she will be cure falconer explain you can guess whether it have be a happy day for I and she have promise to be my wife it be in the mission church of san miguel bless he then it be you who forget the key in the church door exclaim angelum i feel it be somehow and no wonder you forget she throw a smile glance at nick nick say nothing but he too bless san miguel he know nothing about the bodily ailment which bring people to sulphur spring but he think that no torture of the body could be worse than jealousy and of that pain san miguel have in a moment cure he he bless also the owl which have rustle and make angelum want he near she i believe i 'll catch it and have it tame at my place he say to himself i 'll give it a good time all the rest of its life and next morning early while angelum sleep he motor out again to the mission find the padre catch the owl which be young and dazed bring it to the hotel and hire a boy to take it by train to bakersfield xvi angelum at she worst but something have happen to angela next day that be clear from she manner what have change she from a clinging sweetly mid-victorian girl into a reserved coldly polite woman nick could not imagine she cool good morning give the first sign of a fall temperature he way of begin the day be suit to the ending of yesterday : hers deny all that make yesterday memorable could it be that in recall the scene in the mission church mr may disapprove of something he have say or some blunder act and wish to put he in he place or -- still more terrible -- be she unhappy about falconer nick be confuse miserable and because he do not know how to take she or consequently how to bear himself he become self-conscious and awkward angelum do not refuse to go to santa ysabel and the mysterious warm lake but she say that she would sit behind as she head ache a little and she would feel the wind less than on the front seat nick know somehow that she do not wish to talk to he yet there be nothing definite in she manner of which he could take hold and say have i offended you perhaps it be only that she be tired and do not sleep well nick try to persuade himself because in reason he do not see what else it could be as like as not she 'll be different to-morrow but there be to be no to-morrow the blow do not fall until he have bring she back to the hotel then before nick could propose a new plan she say quickly in the presence of falconer who have stroll out to meet the bright angel oh mr hilliard i think you 'll be glad to hear you be go to be relieve of all this bother i have be make you i be engage to play chaperon for a few day if _ i _ will go to monterey mademoiselle dobieskus will go and of course that will be a great great pleasure to mr falconer you know do not you that _ we _ plan be never make for a day ahead she and i will travel in the wonderful private car and meet mr harland at the other end of the journey i know mr falconer mean to ask you too so we sha not be say good-bye or even _ au revoir _ if you accept he idea be for you to let you chauffeur drive the bright angel and meet you where you like but he 'll tell you all about that of course we arrange this at breakfast which mademoiselle dobieski have with I in my sitting-room with this she walk away leave the man to settle the question between themselves nick think then that he understand she mention the promise invitation rather than break away from he too abruptly but certainly she could not wish he to accept if she have not want to escape from he society she would not have fall in with falconer 's suggestion perhaps she have even ask falconer to help she out of a situation which for some dreadful reason she suddenly find impossible this be very likely falconer 's way of come to the rescue the excuse seem a fairly good one and the invitation be calculate to save sensitive feeling but it be not quite good enough -- or the feeling be too sensitive nick thank falconer and say that he be sorry to miss such a pleasure but could not trust billy to drive the bright angel : he must stick to the helm when angelum come back in a few minute with sonium dobieskus falconer be still try to persuade hilliard to change he mind propose that if billy could not drive the bright angel should be put upon a train for a instant nick 's eye seek angelum 's but she be tuck a rose into she belt and do not look up she lowered eyelid and long lash give she a look of deliberate remoteness nick again express he gratitude but be afraid he could not manage although he would like it mighty well this time he make no excuse for he refusal and falconer let the subject drop he see that something be wrong and fear that he have be selfish in suggest a idea which would give he sonia for a guest certainly mr may have accept readily but now there be a jarring note he be sorry but could do nothing more except to express regret that hilliard would not be of the party on board the mccloud mademoiselle dobieskus follow suit and in common civility angelum have to say what they say whether she mean it or not she have to look up too when she speak and nick 's eye meet hers she blush like a schoolgirl and glance away add quickly that she would have like he advice as well as falconer 's at monterey you know mr falconer think i shall want to buy land along the seventeen-mile drive and build my house there she say i wonder since santa barbara i have be think i might prefer the north but i can not tell one bit there be something about the climate of californium -- i suppose it must be the climate -- which make I in two mind about the same thing every day nick be not sure whether to take this as a excuse or a stab he be sure of but one thing something hideous have come between he and he angel while he sleep and dream of she and nothing would ever be the same again of course it must be he fault and if he be use to woman he would perhaps see what he have do that a woman would disapprove or perhaps even so he would be in the dark for there be all the other woman in the world and there be angelum may she be a law unto herself it look just now as if she be a hard and cruel law but she must not be blame she have a right to break with he she have promise nothing i think say nick when he have learn that the mccloud be to be hitch to a train in the afternoon i would better be get on i might as well say good-bye to you all now when he shake hand with mr may falconer and sonium dobieskus turn aside a little speaking to each other i hope you understand mr hilliard and do not think i be be rude after all you kindness angelum say melting a little i could hardly refuse they when it be a question of chaperon a newly engage couple and i think you would join we of course this concession give nick a unexpected chance he dare to hope that it be a olive branch hold out do you really think that he ask quickly in a low voice certainly why not oh i do not know that be the trouble but -- if you do think it maybe you 'll let I see you again -- maybe this will not be good-bye for always dear I i hope not indeed she answer in a light frivolous tone again we be sure to meet you come to san francisco sometimes i have hear you say i shall be there -- oh age you 'll let I call nick be faintly -- very faintly -- encourage not to hope for much but for a very little for a chance to retrieve some of the ground he have lose in a night to begin low down and work up i shall be glad to see you at the fairmont hotel when i get there she be almost too frankly cordial suddenly the tone would have be perfect if the word have be speak in new orlean before a thousand thing have happen but they have pass that stage now -- for good or ill then they finish shake hand and a few minute later nick leave she with falconer and sonium dobieski the instant he have go angelum would have give a good deal to call he back although she be sure she have do only she duty to herself and he she reason for the great change be not mysterious at all they be very clear and seem to she very virtuous very praiseworthy -- up to the last minute then she think that she be a prig and a wretch and several other thing which she would have be furious to be think by anybody else she have want nick to realize -- that be she have feel it she duty to make he realize -- that thing could not go on as they be after last night she have be incredibly silly in the mission church all night long she have scold herself for the way she have behave and let the forest creature behave -- hold she hand and sit as close to she on the gallery stair as if they be engage in a desperate ballroom flirtation she must show he that she be not really a stupid sentimental person she make up she mind that they must begin all over again the very first thing in the morning and true to she resolution she have indeed begin all over again she have tear a hole in the net which be bind they together -- all through she own silly fault in she heart she have want he to accept falconer 's invitation but she have not want he to know that she have want he the thing be to give the impression that she would be please if he go and not miserable if he refuse if they all go to monterey together on mr falconer 's private car they would not be lose each other -- as friend they would merely be adjust they relation which own to san miguel have suddenly get dangerously out of hand it be only when nick 's back be turn and he be go that she see thing from he point of view why have she not be clever enough to keep to the happy medium and not make he think that he have do something dreadfully wrong -- that on second thought she be blame he for last night and punish he surely she might have manage better -- she a woman of the world and he a mere forest creature but it be too late the thing be do and badly do angelum see herself a worm and nick noble as a tall pine-tree of the mountain still it be best that the break should have come one way or another why on earth should i care she ask herself angrily ` we could never go on have a real friendship all we life -- i and a man like that he be a splendid fellow -- of course above I in lot of way but we be of different world i do not see how anything could change that what a pity it all be -- not for my sake but for he and she think how awkward he fit of shy self-consciousness have make he appear in contrast with a culture man a cosmopolitan like falconer it be she who have make he self-conscious she know that but there be the fact falconer be a man of she world nick hilliard be not it be sad that nick with he good look and intelligence and fine quality could not have have advantage when a boy -- could not have go to a university or at least associate with gentlefolk as they equal -- which he be in heart but now he have get those slipshod way of speak he could never change and there be a thousand other thing which put he outside the pale of the man she know she would not listen when a sarcastic voice within defend nick sneer oh yes prince paolo di sereno and some of he friend be _ far _ superior to mr hilliard be not they irritated because the forest creature have become of paramount importance in she life when he should remain the merest episode she be surprised and even horrify to find herself despair because he have do what she force he to do she could have cry for what he must be think of she she want to go on see he fault but in she change mood she could see only she own he be one of the noblest gentleman in the world something inside she say you be not worthy to black he boot then the picture of herself black they -- the shiny one that be too tight -- rise before she eye and she be afraid that she be go to laugh -- or else to sob anyhow he be go and there be a end of it all but when afternoon come thing be different again in falconer 's private car where she princess di sereno be the chaperon and sonium dobieskus be queen angelum be so desperately homesick for nick hilliard that she do not see how she could get on without he -- friendship after all she remind herself excuse she inconsistency _ i _ do not send he away he go of he own accord he might be here now he refuse to come with we it be only that we ought not to be rush about together any more in that absurd way it will not do thing keep happen -- unexpected thing -- like last night still if he come to san francisco -- if he ask again to ` show I the sight ' i do not see why i should not say yes -- just to so small a favor -- and to make up -- in case he feeling be hurt in she heart she know that he feeling be hurt but have she not hurt she own there be a piano in the drawing-room part of the car sonium be sing to falconer they have forget mr may without whose martyred presence they could not have have this happiness the soul of the russian girl seem to pour out with she voice as upon a tide the sorrow and pain of she past exile be in it at first : then it rise to the joy of new life in a new world the sweetness of the voice and all that it mean of love after anguish stab angelum as she listen in the distance like a knife dip in honey xvii seventeen-mile drive thing be better at del monte mrs harland be there and make a delightful hostess it rather amuse angelum to watch theo dene with sonium dobieskus and to see how delightful falconer 's sister be to both but somehow she contrived that miss dene should not be of the motor party for the seventeen-mile drive a young officer from the presidio be produce to compensate as far as could be for she frankly lament failure and theo resign herself to a second-best flirtation it be console to think that falconer have be in love with the dobieskus long before he see she : and theo could almost forgive the russian whom she consider plain and gawky compare to herself she could not however forgive mr may for have come into the party and for be like by the host better than she be like judge another woman by herself she think that out of revenge for one or two little thing -lrb- such as the talk about mr gaylor and nick hilliard -rrb- angelum be try to take away she californium friend if theo have consider it worth while she would have break she word and tell who mr may really be but that would be worse than useless as it would only make angelum seem of more importance than at present however on hearing that mr may might decide to run up to shasta and the mccloud river she promise herself a certain amount of fun she have remind mr harland so often about write to mr gaylor that at last the letter have be send the lady who be suppose to have a claim upon nick hilliard be ask to visit rush river camp as falconer 's place be call and a telegram have be dispatch by falconer himself to hilliard at the st franci hotel in san francisco whither he be bind if they all come -- yes theo would have she fun she think of this as she flirt with the officer from the presidio and promise to make he the hero of she next book but the party in falconer 's motor thought of she not at all angelum be enchant with the peninsula of monterey in the dark arbor of the cedar forest falconer keep order the chauffeur of a hire car to slow down or stop the practically mind young man believe that this great gentleman and the three lady must be slightly mad it be so queer to stop a car when she be go well just to stare around and talk poetry about a lot of tree one of the lady the prettiest and youngest with yellow hair under she gray motor-bonnet say they be not tree but people -- either nymph or witch -- and the rest of the party humor she talking nonsense about greece and goddess he think the pleasure of a motor trip be go some but he passenger seem to have other idea they be idiot of course but they seem mighty happy angelum however be less happy than the other less happy than she try to seem she have a dim idea that if she have come with nick she would have think this the most beautiful place on earth and that she have find the ideal spot for a home as it be in spite of all the loveliness she be not sure of herself or what she want this make she ashamed she be as self-conscious as nick have be yesterday and in sheer panic fear lest they should think she be pine for hilliard or grieving over some stupid quarrel she say that she would certainly buy land in the forest she must not lose such a chance if for any reason she should change she mind she could always sell could not she on this point falconer reassure she you can sell to I he laugh in the light-hearted way that surprise the chauffeur you build a house and furnish it and take all the trouble and i 'll buy it from you -- to live in myself when i want to imagine i be in greece or sicily as i do sometimes when i be too busy to go there and he look at sonium though he laugh he be in earnest and angelum begin to feel that she might want to keep she house -- if she build it she see herself walk under the strange dark tree to the gray rock to look at the seal nick be with she she hurry to think of something else nick would not be here they would have forget each other by the time she house be build perhaps he would be marry to he mr gaylor -lrb- illustration : angelum be enchant with the peninsula of monterey -rrb- after all it do not seem so romantic to have a place where she could go and look at some seal alone stupid because she have come to californium on purpose to have a place where she could be alone how absurd woman be she think irritably as soon as we can have what we want we do not want it i suppose it must be that now i long for all kind of new thing i can not possibly have which would be very bad for I if i could after lunch at the wonderful club house build of log they go back by way of monterey and in the sleepy old town which hold more california history than any other they wander about see the sight one after another they pay they respects to the monument of father juniperra serra who land at monterey with he soldier a hundred and forty year ago -- a long time in america where life move quickly then next in interest come the verandaed custom house build under spanish rule and look just the place to spend a lazy afternoon in gossip about lovely lady and pretend to do important business for the crown there be the oldest court-house in californium too and the oldest brick house and the oldest frame building -- bring round the horn the oldest theater glorified by jenny lind 's singing and indeed all the oldest old thing to be find anywhere in history or romance but though angelum dare not say so she wonder what have become of the really old thing new in the beginning of the seventeenth century when don sebastian viscanio land to name the town -- in honor of philip the third -- monterey or king of the mountain that night they all walk together under the great tree of the park at del monte a lake -lrb- where black swan thread they way like dark spirit among white water-lily -rrb- drink the last light of day and little wave the swan make be ruffle with dim silver above the sky be another deep blue lake lily with star and as darkness fall hot and sweet-scented as the veil of a eastern woman slowly the boundary be lose between forest and garden outline fade and blended into one another the fuchsia big as baby ' fist the poppy like doll ' crêpe sunbonnet the rose large enough for nightingale ' nest lose they color and seem to go out in the dark like brilliant bubble that break into nothingness here and there yellow light flash near the ground far from the walker as if a faint firefly be astray in a tangle of flower chinese gardener deft and mysterious as brownie be work at night to change the arrangement of flower-bed so that the dweller in the hotel should have a surprise by day theo dene talk of carman gaylor tell story she have hear of the rich widow from people whose acquaintance she have first make at del monte i be longing to meet the woman she say i think she must be a interesting character typically spanish or mexican -- or anyhow not american -- from what they all say a beauty -- vain and jealous and a fearful temper i should not like to interfere with a woman of that sort in what she think she ` rights ' should you -lrb- illustration : _ they be not tree but people either nymph or witch _ -rrb- one can not interfere with a person one have never meet can one angelum remark pretend not to understand maybe not in real life theo agree i be always lose myself in my book and forget that the world outside be not like _ my _ world make of romance but you can understand can not you here where it be so beautiful that even a _ marry woman _ -- who have of course leave love far behind she in europe -- must feel some faint yearning to be the heroine of a romance princess di sereno wonder why she have ever be nice to theo in rome xviii la donna è mobile angelum stand at she hotel window look down over the gilded hill and purple valley of the most romantic city in america -- san francisco the port of adventure away to the golden gate where the sea pour in a flood of gold under a sea of rosy fog -- a foam rush sea of sunset cloud beneath a high dome of fire away to the fortify island and to mount tamalpai she have arrive only a few hour ago after two day spend at del monte and be wait for nick there have be a note send up the day before and she have not be in the hotel twenty minute when he have telephone it have be good to hear he voice so good that angelum have feel oblige to stiffen she resolution would she let he call he ask and she say : yes come before dinner she impulse be to say dine with I but she would not instead she add i dine at eight it be now after seven and she have dress to be ready for nick he might arrive at any minute angelum 's heart be beat quickly -- but perhaps it be the glory of the sunset that make she blood run fast she be listen for the bell of the telephone yet when the sharp sound come it go through she nerve with the thrill of the unexpected a gentleman mr hilliard have call announce the small impersonal voice at the other end of the wire ask he to come up angelum answer feeling virtuously firm in she resolve that really have not weaken once in the last five day the pretty white room be full of rose-coloured twilight so pink it seem that if you close you hand tightly you might find a little ball of crushed rose-petal there when you open it it would be a pity to shut out so much loveliness by switch on the electricity so when nick come he find angelum a tall slim black figure with a faint gold nimbus round its head silhouette against a background of flame sky standing as she do with she back to the window he could hardly see she face but the sunset stream full into he as he cross the room hold out he hand he dark face and deep-lighted eye look almost unearthly to angelum see in this wonderful light no man could really be as handsome as he seem she must remember that he have never be so before never would be again it be only a effect it be like meet he transform in another world be the thought that flash through she head and the immense height of this great house on a hill the apparent distance from the veil city beneath with its starlike light begin to glitter through cloud of shadow all intensify the fancy for a instant it be as if they two meet alone together on a mountain-top immeasurably high above the tired struggle crowd of human thing where once they place have be strange what fantastic idea jump into you mind angelum be ashamed and she embarrassment mingle with admiration of nick which must be hide chill she greet into commonplace yet she could hardly take she eye from he good look nick have dress himself for evening in some of those clothes buy in haste ready-made to please a woman who have laugh at they and at he during he abbreviated visit in new york the woman do not laugh now she forget that she have ever laugh and the thought be in she mind that the large white oval of evening shirt set off he head like a marble pedestal how do you do she say give he she hand and hold it rather high in the english way which seem excessively formal to nick i be glad to see you again nick 's heart go down she voice do not sound glad this be just what he have expect though not what he have hope she have change toward he the day they part and though she have fling he a word of encouragement evidently she have go on change more and more there seem little good in ask what he have come to ask but he have to get through with it now i guess i do not need to tell you i be glad to see you he say he look at that nimbus round she head as she stand with she back to the window he could say no more though he have mean to add something what be you think about she question he almost sharply nick laugh embarrassed i be think some word that sound like poetry -- or no they be think themselves night in she eye morning in she hair because stand like you do mr may a kind of gold powder wreath seem to be float around you head she laugh too you must have be read poetry since i leave you no that come out of my head but i have be think a whole lot about a good many thing -- only most of they be about you or come back to you if they do not begin there do not you know how one idea can sort of run through all you thought i know say angelum just so have the idea of he be run through all she thought these last few day but she add with a effort why should you have be think of I we be such -- _ new _ friend yes nick admit but you can not always account for you thought of course not and i be grateful for a few of yours have you be enjoy san francisco do sit down and would you mind put on the electricity must i it be beautiful like this very well leave it so she sit on a sofa still with she back to the window and nick take a chair face the light i have have a feeling on I of wait say nick just that i have not go around much though this be the first time i have be in san francisco except for a day since the city 's grow up after the fire i be wait to see if you would let I show you thing as you -- as i -- what angelum ask when he pause i be go to say as you partly promise but that would not be fair because you do not really promise anything if he have claim a right it would have be easy to say that it do not exist but he make thing harder by claim nothing still she go on : no of course i could not promise as i be situate now it be difficult to make plan however if you have really wait for I it be kind and there be no reason why i should not ask you to show I san francisco already even though i have not go about at all except just ` taxi ' up to the hotel i can see it be wonderful from this window it be like look out on rome with all its hill -- rome transplant to the sea and i know you and do not know mr morehouse who be my only other resource here besides he be a busy man and if you be busy you pretend not to be i be have a vacation nick explain all the nicer of you spend some of it on I but i must not let you spend too much besides i have as little time as you have for run about the country everything have change with I since i see you last i be afraid so nick exclaim before he could stop to think only because i have buy land angelum say hastily some of californium -- five acre on the peninsula of monterey -- be mine i must decide on a architect be not that exciting then while he be work out we joint idea perhaps i 'll make a visit to mr harland i be rather tired and i believe it will do I good i expect it will say nick bravely think of the journey i have have from europe and not a day 's rest since go on angelum with the air of excuse herself it must have be mighty hard on you nick agree he flush faintly as if he deserve reproach for inconsiderateness not that i feel the need of rest till -- till now she hurry on it be delicious sailing along with you bright angel when i be at rush river camp i shall think of she again wonder who be spin about with you in my place for you 'll often take you friend out when you be at home it be on the tip of nick 's tongue to answer bright angel be buy for you name after you and i can never bear to take anybody else now you have finish with she -- and I but that like claim a promise half make would not have be fair if he hint that the car have be get for she sake she would be distressed some man in he place would have say -- whether mean it or not -- no other woman shall ever go with I in that auto and the wish to say this be in nick 's mind but he know that it would be in bad taste besides there be a woman who would want to try he car and it would be unfriendly to deny she so he say there _ be _ one friend i must take : mr gaylor i have talk to you about she she 'll be interested in bright angel when i get home yes of course reply angela it be extraordinary how much she dislike the picture of nick and a beautiful dark woman together in the car where _ she _ place have be by he side could it be that theo dene be right be nick 's interest in she -- angelum -- less than and different from he interest in mr gaylor she have no right to know no right to want to know still less to try to find out yet she feel that not to know very soon would make she lose sleep and appetite and interest in daily life silence fall between they for a moment the rose of sunset burn to ashes-of-rise a small clock on the mantelpiece mention in a discreet voice that it be a quarter to eight nick get up rather heavily for a man so lithe as he well i must go he say thank you for let I take you around san francisco may i come to-morrow morning oh do about half-past nine she get up also feel miserable though as she point out to herself for no real reason i 'll be prompt he put out he hand and she lay hers in it look up to he face with a smile which would not for the world have be wistful suddenly he finger grip hers convulsively so it be all over he whisper no no not all over she contradict he there be to-morrow yes there be to-morrow he echo i tell you at first and she try to laugh that ` sufficient for the day be the trip thereof ' nothing be to be plan ahead it be all right mr may nick answer i want to be glad you be go to have that mccloud river visit and of course you have get you new place to think of no wonder you be sick of travel and want to settle down it be all right and there be to-morrow as you say he shake she hand move it up and down mechanically then drop it and turn to go another second and the door be open then it be shut behind he he have go and though he be come to-morrow for a little while nothing would ever be as it have be between they it be now not to-morrow that she be send he definitely out of she life and he understand never have angelum think so quickly she tremble as she stand stare at the shut door she cheek burn and a pulse beat in she throat under the string of pearl she clasp and unclasp she hand and they be very cold he _ sha not _ go to that woman and take she out in my place in the bright angel she say out aloud and fly to the door mr hilliard -- mr hilliard she call everything seem to depend -- though this be nonsense -- on he not have get to the elevator she stand in the doorway wait to see what would happen she blood pound as if she have take a really important step which of course be not the case he have turn a corner of the corridor and be out of sight but she voice reach he and he come back be there something you forget to tell I he ask perhaps she be go to say that after all she would not go out to-morrow no not that i forget -- something i _ want _ to say come in again she whisk the tail of she black chiffon dress back into the room he follow she wonder and silently anxious i have change my mind she say in a low voice -lrb- there he have know it she be not go -rrb- _ would _ you still care to be my ` trail guide ' in the yosemite valley would i care echo nick then we 'll go i 'll give up the mccloud river i 'll telephone mrs harland -- she be in san francisco till day after to-morrow i 'll find a excuse -- i have not have time to think it out yet but i do not care _ what _ happen i will not change again i be go to the yosemite if you 'll take I he look at she searchingly because you be kind-hearted and afraid you have hurt I -- no -- no _ because i want to go _ woman be strange and hard to understand when they be worth take the trouble to understand and even then they can not understand themselves xix the city of romance angelum be ridiculously happy next morning she have no regret nick have stay to dinner after all and they have make plan there be nothing in this really she remind herself laugh five time a hour nothing at all but it be about as wild and exciting as if -- as if it be a elopement : to have give up everything she have almost decide upon and to be go to the yosemite valley -- with nick whom she have intend gently to put in he place -- at a distance from hers there will never never be anything in my life again like this she say i have never live i have never do the thing i want to do there be always some one or something to keep I back now for a week or a fortnight i shall live -- live nothing and no one shall keep I back she know how absolutely contradictory this be after take so much pain to let the ` forest creature ' down gently and begin all over again but she do not care nothing matter except that she could not send he to mr gaylor as gaily as she have embark upon the little adventure at lo angele do she now face the great one nick too be violently happy happier than he have ever be or suppose it possible to be at lo angele he have hardly dare to hope for anything beyond the pleasure of have this woman by he side for a few hour since then he feeling have as he express it to himself be run up and down like a thermometer in changeable weather but they have be mostly down and during the last few day have mount little above freezing-point now the sudden bind bewildered he he do not know why angelum have change again at the very moment when she have seem most cold but she _ have _ change and almost fiercely he determine now to fight for she he love she and she must know what be in he heart she could not do what she have just agree to do unless she like and trust he : and he would make the most of all the day to come he would keep she forever if he could she sudden throw over of she own plan for he sake seem too good to be true especially after she strange conduct at paso roble but like a boy who dream he have all the christmas present he ever covet in vain and wake to find they he he remind himself that it be true -- true -- true angelum do not tell nick the excuse she offer mr harland for give up she visit it be enough for he that it be give up he would have be even more proud and pleased however if he have know how frankly she confess she real intention to do that seem to angela the only way to have fib a little or even to have prevaricate whitely would have spoil everything i find dear mrs harland she say in she letter that i can not tear myself from san francisco if i go with you to shasta and the mccloud river and come back in a week or a fortnight to do my sightseeing nothing will be the same i believe you will understand how i feel my impression will be break besides mr hilliard be here now and willing to show I what i ought to see i be afraid i seem to repay he kindness by be rude to he at paso roble after san francisco he volunteer to be my ` trail guide ' through the yosemite valley and if i put off that trip too long i may not get so good a guide mr morehouse have advise I to take he and say these thing be do in this western world where gossip be blow away like mist by the wind that sweep through the golden gate besides why should any one gossip there be no cause and i be nobody and know to few i be not worth gossip about but i wonder if you 'll ever again invite I to rush river camp i hardly dare expect it yet i hope already mr gaylor have be invite and have accept but angelum be not thinking of mr gaylor at the moment and she be do she best to keep nick 's thought from he boss 's widow he and mr may go about san francisco together like two child on a holiday the place be a surprise to angela she father 's story have picture for she a strange wild city of many wooden house a tangle of steep street run up hill and down dale a few great mansion a thousand or more acre of park in the making but the san francisco which he have know as a boy have greatly change even before the fire angelum be aware of this though she have not be able to realize the vastness of the change and though she know that the city be reborn since the epic tragedy which lay it low she have expect to find it in a confused turmoil of grow the work do in six or seven year by man who love the city of the golden gate -- man who give blood and fortune for she as man will for a adore woman -- be almost incredible rome be not build in a day she have often hear but this great town of many hill so like a rome of a new world seem to have rise from its ash by magic the place begin to take on in she eye a curious startling individuality she begin to think of the city not as a town but as a person a woman young lovely and beloved who have go gaily to bed one night to dream of she lover she jewel and she triumph while she lay smile in she beauty sleep this woman have be rudely arouse by a cry of fire and shout that warn she to fly dazed she dress in wildest haste put on all the gorgeous jewel she could find for fear of lose they forever and wrap herself in exquisite lace but in she hurry she have be oblige to fling on some very queer garment rather than not be clothe at all and lose she head have contrived to save a few worthless thing all this the woman have do laugh through she fear of death because nothing could conquer she brave spirit and because she know that scared and destitute near to death she would be rescue at last loved better than ever for she suffering and by and by would be more regal than before now here be this vital creature reward for she faith by the worship and the prowess of she lover what matter if she still wear some of the odd thing she have pick up in a hurry gown better than she have ever boast be be fashion for she and the contrast between a tiara show under a sunbonnet a scarf of rose-point cover a cotton belt and diamond-buckled shoe slip on to tear stocking make she beauty more piquant as she sit watch the work of she lover on she throne by the sea no wonder that the man who adore such a woman be brave as she generous and reckless as she and on fire with energy and courage but the beautiful woman work too to help she lover nick answer angelum 's little allegory when she be wound she say ` just give I a hand up and i will not die you shall have a big reward for all you do --

cooking upstairs the wall be adorn with golden flower panel painting by artist of china and strange dragon and buddha that nod on shelf there be open-work screen and table and chair of black carve teakwood angelum would have be aghast have she dream that the queer dinner which she like and laugh at cost nick more than a hundred dollar but luckily she be not initiate in the rarity of bird 's - nest soup or other chinese delicacy it be half-past eight when they finish dine the hour when chinatown begin to be most lively most ready to amuse itself and incidentally stranger therein lay the kernel of the nut the blossom of the clove : that this bit of the old old east inlaid in the heart of the new west be not a exhibition like japan in london but a large busy town living for itself alone the big poster in chinese character paste on the wall be for chinese eye not mean to amuse foreigner the two or three daily papers print in chinese and fill with advertisement be for the chinese the bazaar cram with strange eastern thing be mean to attract woman of the orient little flitting creature in embroidered silk jacket and long tight trousers who pass and gaze with dark eye aslant let european woman come or stay away as they please there be plenty of chinese husband whose purse be full enough to keep the merchant of chinatown contented the tiny dressed-up oriental doll -- boy and girl -- who stroll about with pink balloon or butterfly kite in the short interval between mellican school and chinese school be not baby-actors playing part on the stage but real flesh and blood child who have no idea that they be odd to look at in they gay-coloured gown and tiny cap they do not even know that the street through which they toddle be any more strange than the mellican street outside chinatown which they doubtless consider extremely dull make up of huge gray and white building like mountain or prison whereas the tortuous way and blind alley of they home-town be full of color balconied house front high and low huddle together paint red or blue and decorate with flower or shape like chinese junk or toy castle and temple it be all new of course this town of theirs since the fire at least what be above-ground and know to foreigner be new but it have be build in imitation of past glory the alley be as blind there be as many mysterious hide little court and packing-case house and bazaar as ever so that the child see no difference and already a curious look of age a drugged weariness have fall upon the seven-year-old chinatown angelum walk beside nick through the light street enchant with the flowerlike lantern that bloom in front of balconied restaurant or place of entertainment and with the crowd figure that shuffle silently by in felt-soled slipper or high rocker shoe tiny elaborate woman young and old slim youth with greeny-yellow face like full summer moon little old man with hand hide in flow sleeve and dull eye stare straight ahead be to she ghost of the far east or creature of a fantastic dream from which she would soon awake when they have do the principal thoroughfare and angelum have buy ivory box jade bracelet and a silver bell collar for timmy the cat nick say that the time have come to join they guide he have engage a man suppose to know chinatown inside and out and the rendezvous be at 9:30 in portsmouth square the lung of chinatown -- close to the memorial statue of robert loui stevenson it be quiet there and pleasant in the starlight faintly gilded by the street lamp the young moon of the sixth month which have sink with the sun when angelum be in monterey have not yet drop beyond distant house roof its pearly profile look down surround by a clear-cut ring like the face of a pale saint see through the rose-window of a cathedral soon the guide come a little dark man with a jewish face a german name a american accent and the polite manner of a oriental what would you like the lady to see he ask everything you advise say nick we have dine in a chinese restaurant and see the thing everybody see now we 'll do a few barber shop and drug store and anything else queer you can think of there be a

so i suppose i shall have to give my will up to yours to she surprise nick do not yield we would better begin with the singing child he say to schermerhorn and then we will not feel we be keep they up late the guide lead they through dupont street the street of the bazaar and another smaller less noisy street where fat long-gowned man and woman with gold clasp in they glittering edifice of ebony hair chaffer for dry abalone green sugarcane and chinese nut in basement they could see through half-open door at the bottom of ladderlike step earnest-faced man with long well-tended queue of hair busily tonsure sleepy client stoop merchant with wrinkled brown mask like the soft shell of those nut which other sell could be discern in dim tiny office pore through huge round spectacles as they write with paint brush in volume apparently make of brown paper here and there in a badly light shop with a greenish glass window a old chemist with the air of a wizard be measure out for a blue-coated customer a ounce of dry lizard flesh some powdered shark 's egg or sliver horn of mountain deer these thing would cure chill and fever many other disease too and best of all win love deny or frighten away bad spirit by and by they turn out of the street into a dim passage this lead into another and so on until angelum lose count but at last when she begin to think they must be thread a maze they plunge into a little square court where a lantern over one dark doorway show faintly the black of irregularly build house several small window which look upon the court be bar and there be a door with a grate peephole where angelum fancy that she catch the glint of eye as the lantern swing in a light breeze but there be no such _ grille _ in the low-browed door which the guide approach it stand ajar and he push it open without knock follow please he say it be better for I to go first and angelum follow with nick close behind she down a narrow flight of step more a ladder than a stairway which descend abruptly from the threshold one two three flight there be so steep that you have to go slowly or tumble on you nose and then down at the bottom of the third run a long passage where a greenish yellow dusk from some unseen lamp prevail the wall be of unpainted wood make of slip as thin as lath and several door be roughly cut in it at the end one of these door gape open music of a peculiar shrillness float out also a smell as of musk and sandalwood drift through the crack with small fitful trail of smoke or curl mist on the other side they be burn incense inside a chinese man and a woman two tiny child like gilded idol and three or four european the latter be evidently tourist with a guide they sit on a rough bench they back to the door and the chinaman be perch on a smaller higher seat in front of a rack hang with several odd brightly paint chinese musical instrument he be play solemnly and delicately on a object like a guitar go mad -- so think angelum -- bring forth a singing sound small and crystalline but glance over he shoulder as the newcomer appear at once he snatch up another curious object smile at angelum as much as to say the change be a compliment to she the instrument be of the mandolin type cover with evil-looking snake-skin and have only a few string which the player 's finger touch lightly each give out a separate vibration though all blended together with a strange alluring sweetness and underneath angelum think that she could hear faintly a wicked impish voice hiss and chuckle as if something alive and vilely clever be curl up inside the instrument -- perhaps the spirit of the snake whose skin have be steal the fat man nod to the child who stand opposite on a piece of mat they silk-clad back against the wooden wall which be panel with painting very cheap and not beautiful like those of the restaurant but the color be harmonious and on a low table stand a blue dragon vase hold in its mouth a single mariposa lily such as angelum have never see before nick standing beside she whisper the name of the white-and-crimson-spotted butterfly flower and she smile she thanks as the chinese woman give the boy 's cap a pat and tweak the american ribbon bow which tie the queue of the little girl both child begin to sing keep time with the snake-skinned imp the boy who look about two foot in height -- no more -- sing stolidly with a unchanging countenance and no expression in the black bead which be he eye he have on a primrose-coloured silk jacket fasten across he miniature chest with a loop he blue pantaloons be bind round he ankle and he queue mostly artificial be braid with scarlet the girl however -- still smaller than she brother or perhaps she _ fiancé _ -- lift she voice emotionally sing very high with the note of a musical insect or thin silver string stretch tight she eye roll she appear self-conscious though tired and tinkle she silver bracelet and anklet she see angelum enter and admire the newcomer 's pearly skin and gold hair which seem to attract all the light in the mean room the child stare at she intently take in every detail of the black hat and simple though perfect dress but the singing insect be not alone in she admiration suddenly angela feel a touch on she arm she turn and see a chinese girl who might have be sixteen or seventeen smile up at she angelum smile too and the girl kiss she own finger dimple with pleasure she eye sparkling then with a nod of she head and a gesture of the hand she invitingly indicate the half-open door angelum glance at nick he be intent on the child and have not see the girl again the pretty creature nod and beckon and angelum 's curiosity be fire apparently there be something which she alone be privileged to see she be amuse and childishly flatter it would be fun she think to steal away and give mr hilliard a surprise when he turn round to find she go then just when he be begin to be frightened she would come back and tell he she small adventure -- whatever it might prove to be cautiously she move to the door which the girl as cautiously open wider then in a second she be out in the dusky passageway beside she smile guide xx the door with the red label mellican gell see ole chineseman smokee opum pipe the girl ask why you speak english exclaimed angelum forget in she surprise that here be only a very little of china set in the midst of a great deal of america i go school one time say the girl dis time i fo ` get someting you come chinese gell you velly pletty angelum laugh and go guilty but excited this be too good a adventure to miss schermerhorn must know the inhabitant and habit of this place and he would guess what have become of she when they find she go so be you very pretty she smile yes reply the girl in she little metallic voice i like you you like I you give one dollah i take you see chinese man smoke mo ' 'n all oddeh men he velly old -- know ebelyting oh i be to pay you a dollar so it be not all for love of my _ beau yeux _ murmur angelum but she give the sum glad that she have spend most of she money in buy jade and ivory which now encumber nick 's pocket the girl take first she dollar and next she gloved hand then open one of the unpainted door in the long dusky passage she lead she companion into a dark cellar where be you take I angelum inquire think with sudden longing of the light room of the musician where nick be perhaps begin to look for she next-do ' h house reply the girl calmly and angelum would have be ashamed to draw back even have curiosity and a faint excitement not compel she to go on at one end of the cellar be a wooden stairway very steep go both up and down she and she conductor go down one flight then along a short passage then up some step then down a few more angelum be enjoy the experience but she joy be spice with fear the two girl be in a very strange house much stranger angelum think than the one they have leave it be a rabbit-warren of tiny boxlike room thread with narrow labyrinthine passage just wide enough for two slim person to pass side by side the rough wooden wall be neither paint nor stain and the knot-hole be stuff with rag here and there a rude door be open hanging crookedly on its hinge while the occupant talk with a friend outside or prepare for a expedition laden with kitchen utensil coal and food to the common cooking-place of the rabbit colony -- a queer and dismal set of iron shelf long and narrow stick out from a wall and call itself a oven each door of each tiny room which house a individual or a whole family have the name of the owner upon it in chinese character black and sprawl on a red label and at one whose paper name-plate be peel off angelum 's companion stop li hang sun we makee visit she announce and open the door without knock angelum have see furniture packing case as big as that room and extremely like it on one of the wooden wall above a bunk which take up nearly half the space be a rough shelf and a few cheap chinese panel picture and poster beside the bunk and exactly the same height from the floor with its ragged strip of old matting be a box in use as a table cover with black oilcloth on this be group some toy chair and chest make of tiny seashell paste on cardboard a vase with one flower in it a miniature mirror and some fetish charm and photograph evidently for sale but on the bunk itself lay a thing which make angelum forget all the surroundings a thin stab pain shot through she heart as if it have be prick with a needle she be face to face with tragedy in a form hardly human and though she plump little guide be smile angelum wish that she have listen to nick 's advice for here be something never to be forget something which would haunt she through year of dark hour dream or wake she know that the thought of this box of a room and what she now see in it would come suddenly to darken bright moment as the sun be all at once overcast by a black thundercloud and that in the midst of some pleasure she would find herself wonder if the idol-like figure still live and suffer a little bag of bone and yellow skin that once have be a man lay on the wooden bunk whose hard surface be soften only by a piece of mat from the shrivel face a pair of eye look up deep-set utterly tragic utterly resign the face might have be on earth for sixty or seventy year perhaps but the eye be as old as the world neither bright nor dull yet wise with a terrible wisdom far remove from joy or sorrow the shrivel shell of a body be a mere prison for a soul to which torture and existence have become inseparable and almost equally unimportant oh we ought not to come in angelum exclaim involuntarily on the threshold of this secret the weary face faintly smile with a smile like a dim gleam of light flicker over the feature of a mummy come in many people come see I say a voice as old as the eye and sad with the fatal sadness that have forget hope it be a very small weak voice almost like a voice hear at the other end of a long-distance telephone and it speak excellent english silently angelum obey and see a broken cane-seated chair which she have not notice before drop into it as the low voice ask she to sit down she be not afraid now but sadness grip she you wish see I smoke opium lady the old man ask he tone monotonous devoid of interest he face a mask the light of a tallow candle flare into he eye and waver over he egg-shaped head which be entirely bald save for its queue oh no angelum answer horrify i beg you will not smoke for I not for you he say i smoke all time i must now if not i suffer too much it be the smoking keep I alive i can not eat or only a little my throat shut up but when i smoke for a few minute after i be happy then i wait a while and bimeby i smoke again surely -- surely -- you can not smoke opium all day and all night angelum murmur she lip dry she seem to know what he feel and to feel it with he it be a dreadful sensation that physical knowledge rack she nerve like a phase of nightmare nearly all day and all night for i do not sleep much perhaps two hour in twenty-four once a long time ago the opium make I sleep i have nice dream now it make I wide awake but i do not suffer only for a few minute when it get too bad i begin again what be it like -- the suffer angelum half whisper cramp and ache in my bone maybe you never have a toothache -- you be too young but it be like that all over my body i wish to die then and i will before long the death will not hurt much if i keep on smoking my heart will stop that be all it will give I a chance to begin again in another world -- yes say angelum but -- could not you stop smoke take medicine of some sort -- have treatment from a doctor -- too late long time ago he answer with a calm fatal smile but he eye light with a faint spark of anticipation and he cheek work with a slight twitching of the nerve for as he talk in short sentence he be quietly rolling and cooking he dose of opium into a large pipe which look to angela like a queer enormous flute with a metal spout halfway down its length he push a pill he have roll ram it in with a long pin and cooking it in the flame of a small spirit lamp he do not speak again until he have pull strenuously at the pipe a few time then he go on talk he face unchanged unless it appear rather fuller less seam with the wrinkle of intense nerve strain you see he say that be all i do i be in a good deal of pain but i be use to it now i be contented for a few minute while i have this happiness i feel willing to pay the price but it be a big price i warn the young man who come to see I not to begin opium smoking it be so easy you think you will try to find out what it be like and then you will stop but you do not stop four week -- six week -- and it be finish for you you be on the road where i be that be the way with I it be the way with every one who start on that road and go not back before the turn better not start for the dream be too good at first he resignation to the chain forge by himself seem to angela the saddest part of all he be beyond help and know it do not even think of it she have a strange burning behind she eye as she listen though she be not incline to cry it be awful she whisper such day -- such night -- such year but -- you do not lie here always most of the time he answer the little spark of physical contentment begin to dim in he eye already i be very weak i do not walk except when i go down the passage to cook a little coffee once a day or sometimes i crawl out in the sun but soon i come back i can stand only a few minute i be too light in the head when i get on my foot when i be young i be tall and large but a man shrink small after the opium get he how you must regret angelum sigh i do not know why regret when it be too late i regret that it be hard to find opium it be forbid now and very dear i sell the cleaning of my pipe -- the yenshee we call it -- so i keep go how can you bear to sell to other what have ruin you life angelum could not help ask i would do anything now to have opium he say calmly but it be the old smoker who smoke the yenshee not the young one so i do no harm angelum spring up shuddering be there nothing i can do to help you she plead she eye turn from he as he begin to cook another pill you can buy something i sell that will help do you like this and he point to a little painted china group of three monkey one of which cover its ear another its eye and the third its mouth you know what it mean ` see no evil hear no evil speak no evil ' it be the motto of we people yes -- i 'll buy that it be a good motto angelum stammer take up the little figure she lay a five-dollar gold piece on the box table know only too well what it would buy you wish to see I smoke this other pipe and he put it to he toothless mouth no -- i can not bear it she push past the chinese girl hardly know what she do she feel faint and sick as if she must have fresh air as she hand fumble for the latch the door be push violently open and hilliard come in with schermerhorn at he back thank heaven nick stammer he be very pale you give we a pretty bad scare miss add the man who have be inform that nick be not she husband lucky i thought of this house and this old chap but -- there be no danger angelum defend herself nothing could have happen most anything can happen -- in chinatown mumble schermerhorn do you ever read a story by norri call _ the third circle _ not yet say angelum i buy the book but -- well read that story when you get home to-night miss and maybe you 'll know what you young gentleman here go through she young gentleman but angelum do not smile a thing would have have to be very funny to strike she as laughable just then no do not read it to-night say nick wait till another time will you forgive I she ask look at he i be sorry i do not suppose you would mind much i be in -- hade for a few minute say nick hastily qualify the remark he have be about to make xxi who be mrs may only one letter have nick write to carmen gaylor -- the one he have promise to write tell she of he arrival in new york that he be pretty lonely and do not know how long he could stand for see no home sight it never occur to he to write again and carman be not surprise at he remissness she know that nick be not the sort of man who like to write letter or can put he feeling upon paper but when she receive she invitation to visit rush river camp she could have sing for joy we be hope that a old friend of yours mr nickson hilliard may be with we when you come as well as miss dene the authoress mr harland say in she note and carman believe that she have hilliard to thank for the compliment pay she by falconer and he sister she know that he have meet falconer and admire he and put two and two together she fancy that already nick must have come west mean to surprise she by he sudden appearance that he have fall in with mr harland and falconer on the journey perhaps be invite by they and suggest or at least hint that she should be ask to join the house-party at the same time otherwise i do not believe they would ever have think of I she tell herself with a humility which would have have a element of sulkiness if she have not be half out of she wit with happiness over the idea that nick be near and want she if he have not want she he would not have scheme to have she with he at rush river camp all the anxiety and suspicion of the past week be forget she telegraph she acceptance and begin think what to wear during the visit she admit in she mind that mr harland be a bigger swell than she and know more of the world and society but she determine that the hostess should not outdo she guest in the way of smart dress hat and jewellery carman break she journey at san francisco stay there two day at the palace hotel on the first of these day as it happen nick and angelum motor to mount hamilton and stay late at the lick observatory on the second day they go to mount tamalpai lunch at the delightful tavern on the mountain-top and rush madly down the wondrous steep at sunset in the little gravity car guide by the landlord so it be that carman get no chance glimpse of the two together and have no suspicion that in the hotel register of the st franci be inscribe the name of nickson hilliard she shop contentedly and enjoy look at the prettily dress woman because she see none whom she think as good-looking as herself then on the second evening just as angelum and nick be tear down the rocky height know familiarly to san francisco as the mountain carman leave for shasta spring it be early next morning after the long journey north that the white pinnacle of mount shasta appear float in the sky above dark pine and the rush stream of the sacramento feed by eternal snow but carman hardly glance out of she stateroom window at the hover white glory though she maid mention that shasta be in sight mr harland and falconer be both come to meet she at the spring station and would motor she to rush river camp by the fifty-mile road over the mountain carmen hope that nick might be with they though nothing have be say about he in the telegram they have send in any case she one care be to be beautiful after the night journey she take no interest in mountain and river she whole soul be concentrate upon the freshness of she complexion and the angle of the mauve hat on she dark wave hair never a good sleeper she have be too feverish at the prospect of see nick to do more than doze off for a few minute in she berth consequently there be annoying brown shadow under she eye and she cheek look a little sallow but mariette be a accomplished maid who have be with carman ever since the old theatrical day and when mr gaylor be ready to leave she stateroom at shasta spring station she look as bright-eyed and rosy as if she have sleep without dream this effect be partly due to liquid rouge and bismuth but largely to happy excitement -- a woman 's greatest beautifier she heart be beat fast under embroidered dove-coloured chiffon and pale gray shantung a dress too elaborate for a railway journey and she have no eye for the fairylike greenness of the place the mountain-side shadow by tall tree or rock clothe in delicate fern and spout forth white cascade the full rich summer she have leave at home in the south be early spring in the cool north the earth be like a bride display she trousseau of lace fall after fall of it on green velvet cushion and the gold of she dowry the splendor of she wedding gift in a riot of flower no money coin in mint could buy diamond such as this bride have be give by she mother -- nature diamond flash in river and cascade upon cascade but carman gaylor have no eye for they she have merely a pleasant impression that shasta spring seem to be a pretty place and no wonder it be popular with millionaire who build themselves house up there on the height in the forest but it be only a pass thought as he alight from the train in the welcome music of many water which she hardly hear she attention be centre on pick out mr harland and falconer among the people who be wait to meet friend and on see whether nick hilliard be with they there be a crowd on the platform pretty summer girl with bare head over which they hold parasol of bright green or rose-red that throw charming light and shadow on they tan face : brown young man in khaki knickerbockers shake hand with paler man just come from town and little child in white laughing at sight of arrive daddy soon falconer towering over most other appear with he sister by he side and carman be please to see that mr harland 's clothes could not compare with hers have no idea of suit she costume to the country she think herself infinitely preferable in she pari gown to mr harland in a cotton frock and shady straw hat but no nick be visible and carman 's pleasure be dash the brother and sister meet she cordially take she to look at the bubble spring in its kiosk and then up the height on the scenic railway presently they land on the level of the parklike plateau where a big hotel and its attendant cottage be visible with many golden dolomitic peak and great white shasta itself peep through the tree still nothing have be say about nick and carman dare not ask she fear some disappointment and shrink from the blow mariette have bring coffee to she mistress 's stateroom very early but carman be not averse to the suggestion of breakfast at the hotel before motor over the mountain as they eat they talk of impersonal thing : the colony under the tree the making of the mountain road and falconer tell how mount shasta -- long ago name by indian iska the white -- be the abode of the great spirit and how in old old time before the indian the sole inhabitant of the country be grizzly bear carmen listen to the unfold of the tale into a fantastic love-story say oh or how interesting at polite interval always she ask herself where 's nick have not he come yet be it possible he be be prevent from come at all she try to brace herself against disappointment and not show that she care but she turn red and white when mr harland say at last we be so sorry mr hilliard could not be with we we both like he so much and it would have be very nice to have he too while you be at rush river camp oh he could not come carman echo dully no be not it too bad we think you would know -- that he might have write -- perhaps he have and i have miss the letter carman break in hate to let these stranger think she slight by hilliard i have be in san francisco two day but -- where be he on he way home i do not quite know reply mr harland rather evasively it seem and then she change the subject carman have never see anything like that wind road over the mountain with the white phantom glimpse of shasta at every forest turn falconer 's big automobile which he keep at the camp run up the steep gradient without appear to know that they exist and carmen strove to be cheerful to look as if she be enjoy the drive but she heart be a lump of ice though she talk and laugh a great deal tell mr harland about the rich or important people she know instead of drinking in the sweet air and give she eye to the wild loveliness it be bad enough that nick be not come but the air of reserve or uneasiness with which mr harland have say i do not quite know touch the situation with mystery she realize that if there be anything to hide she would not find it out from she host or hostess but when on the veranda of the glorified log-house overhang the river she see theo dene carman instantly say to herself with conviction if _ she _ know i 'll get it out of she and see miss dene at rush river camp she be almost incline to be glad that nick be not there she admire theo 's splendid red hair and dazzling skin she see that though the young woman 's clothes be simple they simplicity be parisian and expensive and she see also that theo be a flirt -- a man-eater as she put it to herself she dark eye meet the green eye in a first understanding glance miss dene be far from unwilling to be pump in fact she mean to be pump and that afternoon while mr harland be write letter and falconer be with he secretary whom he could not escape even in the country she invite mr gaylor to sit with she on the broad veranda beneath which the river run singing a never-ending song the two pretty woman the one dark the other fair make a charming picture and neither be oblivious of the fact but it would not have occur to carmen that she self-appreciation might be put into word however she laugh when theo say : what a shame there be not any man to admire we we be both look too adorable be not we i should love to snapshot you in that indian hammock though the picture would lose a lot without color and it be very unkind of you if you would not like to have a picture of I in my green rocking-chair on the scarlet rug this give carman a chance to touch upon the subject in she heart without as she think arouse any suspicion you look awfully pretty she say and this balcony be lovely hanging over the river it be quite different from my home though mine 's nice too and we have get one man -- mr falconer he be engage say theo oh be he i do not know that well and mr hilliard will come perhaps have you meet he yes reply theo promptly at santa barbara he be motor with mr may i think he one of the handsomest man i ever see but i be afraid he be not come she be not either -- of course carman 's face crimson then she color die away and leave she sickly white all but the little pink spot of rouge she have put on in the morning motor with mr may she repeat harshly then control she voice by a violent effort be mr may expect here be expect theo echo with emphasis she be enjoy herself thoroughly literally enjoy herself this be almost as good as if hilliard have not refuse the invitation and angelum have not basely slip out of the engagement after practically accept she will not come i suppose she think she be have more fun where she be though if mr hilliard have come i have not the ghost of a doubt that she would do you know mr hilliard well this in a tone as innocent as that of a little child talking of its doll pretty well answer carman moisten she lip who be mrs may i hear of she once she be a friend of the morehouse she be a new importation reply theo lightly so far as i can make out she and mr hilliard meet in new york be she -- pretty yes very fair hair and gray eye that look dark mourning be become to she be she a widow she -- give that impression miss dene smile this carman gaylor be like a beautiful fiery thundercloud tease she be delightful theo feel as if she be in a play it be a dreadful waste of good material not to have a audience but she would use the scene afterward she remember hear a great actress tell how she visit hospital for consumptive and even run up to davo one winter when she be prepare to play _ la dame aux camélias _ theo would have do all that if she have be a actress she be fond of realism in every form and do not stick at gruesomeness a grass widow exclaim carman eagerly theo shrug she shoulder really i can not tell you carmen suppose that she know little of mr may and have meet she for the first time at santa barbara with nick with nick -- motor the thought give carman a strange sensation as if she blood have turn to little cold sharp crystal freezing in she vein not very young i suppose she hazard she lip so dry that she have to touch they with she tongue but that be dry too oh about twenty-three or four and look nineteen there be no hope then nick

decision for another all in a moment but now she be in travel dress and a week have pass since that other night it have be perhaps the happiest week of she life but the week to which she be look forward would be happier still afterward of course there would be a end for the end must come she be clear-sighted enough to realize that as she think these thing -- and quickly put away the thought since nothing must spoil this hour -- there be a rap at the door and she go to throw it open confident that she would see nick smile at she say in he nice voice well be you ready but it be not nick a bellboy of the hotel have bring up a large cardboard box which have arrive by post the address be print : mr may fairmont hotel san francisco and there be several stamp upon it but angelum could not

gold and crimson though spring have hardly turn to summer she plunge she hand into the box lift out the gorgeous mass look for a card or note but find none it be a pity that this mysterious gift have arrive just as she be go away however she be keep on she room and would leave instruction with the chambermaid to take great care of the beauty some one else be tap at the door now and this time it be nick angelum 's hand overflow with they brilliant burden as she call aloud come in and he come with the very word she have expect : well be you ready but they die on he lip and it seem to she in the wane light that he face grow pale drop that stuff quick mr may he fling the word at she and angelum bewildered and amaze throw down the color leaf as if a tarantula hide among they have you get any

as she pour ammonia into the marble basin feel a little faint she could hear nick 's voice at the telephone : send to the nearest drug store for some gamgee tissue a bundle of lint and a pint bottle of lime-water this be a hurry call angelum 's heart be thump it be horrible that there should be some one in the world -- a lurk mysterious some one -- who plan in secret to do she dreadful harm the incident seem unreal whom do she know on this side of the world who could hate she so bitterly she be afraid as of eye that she could not see stare through the dark nick call from the sitting-room : how do you feel be you all right and when she answer yes try to reassure she it begin to look as if there be much to fear luckily he have come in time be she sure she have not hold the leaf near she face no then she might hope that there would be no trouble now already he have bundle the bunch of fire into a newspaper and it have be take out of the room to be destroy like a wicked witch luckily there be people who could touch poison-oak and suffer no harm nick tell angelum he feel in he bone that no evil thing could have power over she soon almost before she could have believe it possible the messenger arrive with a strange assortment of packet from the chemist nick shout that all be ready and she go back to the sitting-room she hand drip ammonia kate have be summon and have just appear be about to empty a large flower bowl which nick have order she to wash the irish girl be pale and look daze she know nothing yet of what have happen but guess at some mysterious accident to she mistress a great bouquet of rose which nick have send that morning now lay on a side table and into the flower bowl they have adorn he pour the lime-water in this he soak the gamgee tissue -lrb- angelum have never hear of the stuff before -rrb- and bid she hold out both hand then he bind they quickly and skilfully intent on what he be do though he head be bent closer to angelum 's than it have ever be before and the fragrance of she hair be sweet as in he dream of angel as for she she feel a childlike confidence in he ability to cure she to save she from harm over the tissue wet with lime-water nick wrap bandage of lint and the operation finish angelum be as helpless as if she have pull on a pair of tight thick glove whose finger would not bend do this mean that we be not to go to-night she ask mournfully i hope it do not mean that but we can not be dead certain yet answer nick he look at she searchingly he face draw and anxious but it relax as if he be suddenly relieve from some great strain as he eye travel over the smooth pure feature and meet she question gaze at last with assurance if we be not certain soon it will be too late to start and i can not bear to put off go i be look forward to the trip so much she say shall we dine here you 'll have to feed I i be afraid she laugh but a slow flush creep up to nick 's forehead would you let I yes why not if you do not mind anything rather than miss we train -- unless some horrid symptom be come on that you have not the courage to tell I about ring for dinner kate and you can go and have yours we 'll do everything exactly as if we expect to start sure ma'am do not make I leave the room till i have hear what mr hilliard have to say i be that worried till i know the worst kate plead angelum smile i be just begin to learn she say that it be a mistake to think of the _ worst _ i use to make a point of do it and it generally happen now -- i expect the best she speak to kate and look at nick but tell I what poison-oak can do nick shiver for a instant a picture of that adore young face hideously disfigured turn he sick and even she little white hand -- no it do not bear thinking of but he control himself and try to speak coolly why it affect some people so they face and hand swell up and -- and get red and spotted of course that do not last many day : but -- it be not nice while it do last and i -- could not bear the thought of its happen to you i just could not bear it it be not go to happen though he add hastily see the color leave she lip by this time you would have begin to feel mighty bad if you be in for trouble you can not be easy to affect for if you be the poison might have go to you face without you even touch the leaf you hand do not burn do they only a little -- from the ammonia that save they if you feel all right in a hour more you can have the bandage off and the danger 'll be over for good then we can start unless the shock 's be too much for you i be too bewildered to be shock say angelum who could have play such a horrid practical joke on I it be a little bit like -- in a ridiculous way -- the play of _ adrienne lecouvreur _ where a woman be poison by a bouquet of flower send by a jealous rival only i have not a jealous rival nick 's face harden i be go to find out who do send the stuff while you be in the other room i be look at the wrapper of the box i can not make out the postmark but i reckon there be those who can and i will not rest till i know what can you do to find out ask angela i can put the best detective in san francisco on to the job he shall follow up the clue like a bloodhound and hang on to they when he be get 'em like a bulldog oh but do not let 's put off we journey angelum exclaim i feel if we do that we 'll never go it have always -- she half-whisper seem too good to come true i would rather do ` most anything than put off the trip say nick but there be time for everything we do not leave the hotel till after nine dinner will not be ready for a bit and if you 'll let I i 'll go out now and see a man i have hear of -- a very smart detective but angelum beg he to wait she hate the thought of be leave alone till she be sure that no ill effect need be fear from the poison so nick stay not unwillingly and a simple dinner be order in haste kate be sure that after what have happen she would have no appetite for dinner but like a true irish girl she be romantic to the core of she heart and because she be deeply in love with she tim she have the see eye which show she clearly what be in nick hilliard 's heart for angelum of course he be not good enough for she lady no man could be but kate have a sneak kindness for nick the splendid giver of the golden bag and would not by offer she service as cutter-up-of-food for the queen rob he of the privilege so kate slip out unobtrusively and the privilege in question become nick 's it be a joy even a delirious joy but it be also a ordeal for as he feed she angelum smile at he each time that he proffer a spoonful of soup or a morsel of chicken she meet he gaze with laugh eye roguish under dark lash as the eye of a child the difficulty when this happen as it do constantly be to keep hand steady and mind calm as if for the performance of a delicate surgical operation because to drop a thing or aim it wrongly would have be black disgrace and to ensure perfection of aim attention must be concentrate upon the lady 's lip as she open they to receive supplies it be to watch the unfold of a rosebud into a rose while forbid to touch the rose and even monk of the severest brotherhood may pluck the flower that grow beside they cloister nick do not leave angelum until kate have come back then he and the irish girl together unwind the bandage there be a moment of suspense but the hand be satin-smooth it seem to be write that you shall save I always from horror -- ever since the night of the burglar angelum say when kate have go to the next room to dispose of the lint i shall be like a child learn to walk alone when my journeying with you come to a end there be he chance to say _ must _ they come to a end but kate be near and besides a snub from angelum might stop the journeying then and there so he answer with a mere compliment as any man may mean nothing at all or a great deal to save she from danger it be worth while to have be bear he say and he remember as he have remember many time how clear have be the call he have hear to go east a call like a voice in he ear cry nick i want you come he be tempt to be superstitious and to believe that unconsciously in some mysterious way angelum have summon he to be she knight to be even more perhaps in the end who could tell -- yet it be a good sign at all event that she be reluctant to give up the trip and nick decide not to risk confide in the police put the affair of the poison-oak into they hand and they would lasso every one concern with yard of red tape in that case he and mr may might be detain in san francisco no a private detective would do the trick and nick have the name of one pigeon-hole in he brain : max wisler a shrewd fellow once employ with success by old grizzly gaylor when there have be a leakage of money and vanish of cattle on the ranch nick go in search of max wisler now in a taxi and find he at the old address a queer little frame house in a part of san francisco which have be leave untouched by the great fire wisler be at home and remember hilliard he be fair and fat with a manner somewhat cold unlit by enthusiasm yet as he listen a gleam flash out from he carefully control gray eye which hint at hidden fire he hear nick to the end of the story in silence playing always with the leaf of a book which he have be read -- a volume of fenimore cooper 's still he go on finger the page for a minute when hilliard pause expect question then he look up suddenly seem literally to catch nick 's eye and hold it by force what woman be jealous of this lady -- mr may he ask i do not think she know any woman in californium except mr falconer 's sister -- and a miss dene from england a authoress who be travel about with mr harland in falconer 's car ah mr harland 's out of the running and that miss dene 's go east i happen to see she start yesterday she have a collection of people give she a send-off of course she could have employ some one else to do the job and keep out of the way herself but -- i guess we must look further now see here mr hilliard a patient have get to be frank with he doctor if the doctor 's to do any good be you engage to marry mrs gaylor the widow of my old client good lord no exclaimed nick scarlet to he forehead such a idea never enter my head humph rumor 's wrong then but that be not to say it never enter she head do she know mr may no say nick surely you be not hint -- i be not hint anything i be feel my way in the dark it be not quite dark you have get the paper that be round the box i see you look at it through a magnifying glass just now that postmark mean the longest way round that we can take do you think any one with a ounce of brain would send poison from a place where she -- or he if you like -- be know no she -- or he -- would go a long way and a roundabout way or send a trust messenger tell I straight mr hilliard have mr gaylor get in she employ a confidential maid or man nick distressed and embarrassed angry with the detective yet unwilling to offend and put he off he work know not what to answer there be simeon harp of course who would do anything for carman but nick could not would not play into wisler 's hand by mention the name of harp or tell of the old man 's doglike devotion to he mistress it be a detestable and vulgar suggestion which connected mr gaylor with this affair -- detestable for every one concern for carman for nick above all for angelum mr gaylor have not a servant who be not loyal he return at last evade wisler 's eye but you would better get this notion out of you mind to start with or you 'll find yourself on the wrong track mr gaylor and i be good friend no more she do not know anything about mr may and if she do there be nothing to make she jealous even if -- if we be warmer friend than we be sure she never hear of the lady nick hesitate i do not see how she can have hear i have not write to she since i -- meet mr may ah you have not write to she since then h be do mrs gaylor know mr falconer and he sister and they authoress friend miss dene not miss dene come to think of it i hear miss dene say she would like to meet mr gaylor she ask question about she but that be nothing perhaps they have be visit back and forth since then if they have it have not come to my knowledge woman do a lot of thing that do not come to man 's knowledge that be one reason detective exist well you do not seem much inclined to help I mr hilliard though you say you be anxious to get to the bottom of this little mystery as soon as possible i be anxious and if i do not help you it be because i can not i do not want you to lose yourself in the wood and have to find you way back to begin all over again no i do not want that either say wisler smile he slow smile it be a long time since i get lose in the wood and i 'll do my best not to lose my reckoning this time i must worry along without you i see but i be not discourage when you have finish up this trip that you seem to think so important i may have news for you of one kind or another nick look at he watch it be time to go back to the fairmount if he mean to take angelum away that night xxiii the happy valley in thinking of the yosemite angelum have half-unconsciously picture herself and nick hilliard alone in the valley together separate from mere tourist by a kind of magic wall but down it tumble with she first moment at el portal and behold on the other side of the wall be hundred of eager young man and woman who no doubt resent she existence as much as she resent theirs the huge veranda of the log-built hotel on the hill above the railway swarm with bride and bridegroom it be extremely early in the morning and everybody be sleepy even those who have pass they night in the hotel not in the train nevertheless though good-natured one and all wear a air of square-chinned indomitable determination which puzzle angelum something be evidently about to happen something of immense importance for which each man with all he feminine belongings intend to be ready if possible before any one else angelum watch the silent preparation with impersonal interest while she wait for hilliard to come from the office and tell she about the special carriage for which he have telegraph by this time a hasty breakfast have be snatch and in a crowded dining-room full of laughter and chatter she have resign herself to the fall of the magic wall other people have a right to enjoy the yosemite and she must not grudge they they place i suppose she say to kate who stand beside she on the veranda that all these nice girl and man be go off for different excursion they seem a good deal excite i wonder why just then a stage draw by four splendid horse drive up the veranda step something be shout angelum could not catch the announcement for she have all she could do not to be carry off she foot in the general rush a dozen of the firm-faced man and resolute girl make a dash for the box seat with no malice in they eye they fight and wrestle with each other and it be a case of the best man win those worst in the struggle with the utmost good-nature contented themselves with the next best place and so on to the back seat into which the weakest fall almost before the driver have bring he horse to a full stop away tear the stage with its laughing load and another vehicle whirl up to the hotel step to be fill in a breathless instant as angelum stand watch fascinate yet appal nick come out to she with the air of a general who have lose a battle how glad i be she whisper that we have not get to fight for we life like that i simply could not do it mr may we _ have _ get to he groan i have fail after all my boasting of what i could do for you in the yosemite a private carriage can not be have and they have make a rule that no one 's allow to book a seat in advance when the stage for the sentinel hotel come along i shall swing you on to the box seat if i kill ten man angelum rebel she pity herself so intensely that she have no compassion leave for nick what -- dash people away and push ahead of they i would rather -- yes i would rather turn back to san francisco i do not see myself let you turn back say nick and say it so firmly that angelum never oppose by he before look up in surprise he be not smile evidently he be in earnest deadly earnest she know that what he tell she she would have to do and oddly enough she grow quite calm when we stage come along he say in a low voice i shall get in before any one else and keep a place for you do not hesitate a second but be ready for a jump i 'll have you up by my side before you know what be happen kate must be close behind and i 'll try to swing she up to the next seat why should not _ we _ have the back place since somebody must angela question meekly because i want you to have the best there be and i be go to get it for you that be the only reason nick explain leave no room for further argument it be the least i owe you after fail to keep my other promise she say no more and round she the fight for place go on desperate yet extraordinarily good-natured people try with all they might to grab what they covet but if somebody else snatch it from under they nose why blame kismet the rule of the game be to make no moan always as a new relay surge forward nick by some insidious maneuver edge angelum and kate nearer to the front at last he get they wedge behind the foremost row of traveller who be wait to spring upon and overwhelm a approach stage those who have win the way to the front and achieve safety unless defeat by a unexpected rear attack wear a appearance of deceitful calm two extremely big young man who have the air of footballer in training do what they could to form a hollow square round a couple of fragile but determined girl the party while in reality bent upon secure the two best seat at any cost to life or limb pretend to be look at a illustrated newspaper this feint be intend to put other off they guard and the four conceal they emotion by discuss the picture on the uppermost page a name speak by one of the girl be a electric shock for angelum in a instant the veranda the crowd on it and the stage whose turn would come next vanish from before she eye like a dissolve view prince di sereno what a romantic name and say _ be not _ he handsome i wonder if he be as good-looking as that really she be handsome too the other girl add i do hope they will not be kill come along kid -- look sharp say the two young man and before other who hope to annex the box seat could breathe after a interlude of footbal the conquer four secure what they want those less fortunate be tumble up as best they could and angelum have scarcely time to realize that she have not dream the incident when the stageload have bounce away she be leave daze and blush deeply so deeply that nick quick to notice light and shadow on she face wonder what match have light that rosy fire angelum 's first thought be that somehow she have be find out then she remember that the girl have see the name in a newspaper also they have be look at paolo 's picture and he _ could _ be handsome -- in a picture but of whom have they say she be handsome too could it be that she own photograph have be publish with paolo 's if so who have dare to reproduce it and why what if nick should come across the picture and recognize the face as hers she do not want he to know that she be the princess di sereno until for she own reason and in she own time she should choose to tell he the story of she life once she have think there be no reason why he need ever know that they would part and she would remain in he memory as angelum may now however she begin to see that the moment must come when she would not only need but wish to tell he all so that he might know why but she never quite finish this explanation in she mind it be too fond of try to finish itself without wait to be put into word she be a little frightened now lest by chance there should be a premature revelation for in the rush to get away the girl drop the paper they have be read it lay on the veranda step and though the cover be turn back and only a advertisement page could be see angelum discover that it be the _ illustrate london news _ perhaps the page which lay face down be the page of the photograph she half long half dread that a flutter of wind or a pass foot might turn the paper over what could the girl have mean by say i hope they will not be kill could angela have read theo dene 's mind the day at santa barbara this picture and paragraph would have be less mysterious to she i wonder if mr may _ know about the prince _ theo have ask herself there be a english paper on the step say nick follow the direction of she eye do it make you homesick if it do i 'll put in a claim to it there may be time for you to glance it over before the right stage turn up no no say angelum hastily i do not want the paper and oh look it say ` sentinel ' on this stage that be come the next thing she know she be sway between earth and heaven over head that surge beneath she somehow nick have get that place on the box seat and he be beside she resolutely help kate on to the high step suddenly however timmy 's cover basket fly open kate have be play with the cat and have forget to fasten tim in resent the confusion timmy make a leap kate scream and jump down from the stage carry not only the cat 's basket but a small dressing-bag of angelum 's -- all she have bring except a suit-case contain a dress or two for the journey some one else have of course scramble into the coveted seat so miraculously vacate and the stage with its full complement of passenger go swing down the road with kate and timmy and the dressing-bag leave behind shall we try to stop nick begin but angelum cut he short she face now as determine as those of the square-chinned girl who have pass triumphantly on they way no she say i can not go through that again kate will have to come on later there 'll be another ` sentinel ' stage in about a hour i guess announce the good-natured driver she 'll be all right she know where we be go say angelum she be a quick-witted girl and i sha not worry i mean to be happy in spite of everything -- and _ because _ of everything so the stage roll on into the gate of the yosemite and kate remain on the veranda of the hotel at el portal console herself when she have retrieve timmy by look at the picture in the _ illustrate london news _ a old number of a fortnight or three week ago she find it so interesting and absorb one page in particular that when the next coach bind for the sentinel hotel come along she forget to fight for a place until it be too late to fight there be not another stage bind for that destination until to-morrow and to-morrow mr may and hilliard be go on somewhere else kate could not remember where see she dismay the manager of the hotel take pity on the pretty irish girl never mind say he you can ` phone from here to the sentinel when you lady arrive there this afternoon she 'll find you message and know what be happen then she can ` phone back what she want you to do but i will not get to she to-night will i wail kate no you will not get to she to-night he echo but i guess she be not so helpless she can not do up she back hair without you be she she blouse button up behind kate murmur as one murmur in a painful dream and oh by the power if i have not get she nightgown in this dressing-bag naturally the manager be not deeply interested in mr may 's nightgown as for mr may herself she be not yet conscious of the loss of it she be think at first about the picture which she have not see in the _ illustrate london news _ and the girl 's exclamation : i hope they will not be kill then later of the valley through whose door she have just enter with nick hilliard the hidden valley which indian know and love long before a few cattle-seeking american soldier ferret out the secret the voice of the merce drown the dull voice of the past which have suddenly call to she it be a gay laughing voice that sing among the tumbled rock send down to the river for plaything by she tall brother the mountain and the voice of pine and cedar answer all sing the same high song in the same language -- the language of nature only they sing in different tone and different key -- soprano and contralto tenor and bass the song be so sweet that no one could think of anything else unless it might be of love for the song tell of love because nature be love as the sun rise higher and warm the air the valley be like a great box full of spice such as the three wise man of the east carry for a offering when they follow they star a secret golden box be the valley high-sided with a lid of turquoise and sapphire which be the sky itself the deep still trout-pool of the merce -- bravest and strongest river of the valley -- be color like bed of purple pansy or they be vivid green glint with spark of gold like the wing of a brazilian beetle far down in the clear depths angelum catch glimpse of dart fish swift as silver arrow shoot from a unseen bow and close to the sky high on the rocky side of the yosemite treasure-chest be curiously trace bas-relief which might have be carve by a dead race of giant : head of elephant profile of indian and titanic tortoise most of they appropriately and whimsically name by ancient pioneer the yosemite angelum say over and over to herself i be in the yosemite valley once in the heart of a forest a deer spring out on to the road and stand alert quiver as the stage lumber heavily toward it through sparkling red dust like powdered ruby then suddenly when the horse be almost upon it the delicate creature bound away vanish among the shadow which seem to have give it birth as a diving fish be swallow up by water and lose to sight this vision linger in angelum 's memory as one of the loveliest of the day but the great cataract do they startling best later to paint out the earlier picture even the first slender forerunner of the mighty torrent be unforgettable and individual long ethereal float white feather droop from the head of tremendous boulder that be gray with the glossy grayness of old silver cascade be everywhere and the weave of many diamond-skein of water behind a dark foreground of motionless tree be like the ceaseless play of human thought behind inscrutable face whose expression never change yet these silver tapestry pearl-embroidered be but the binding for the book of the valley the great poem of the waterfall and as the stage bring they near the home of the mighty cataract nick and angelum notice that the atmosphere become mysteriously different the sky roll down a blue curtain to trail on the floor of the valley like a veil suspend before a altar-piece through this curtain of exquisite texture -- bright as spin glass transparent as star-sapphire and faintly shimmering -- they gaze travel toward soar peak and boulder which seem to rise behind the sky instead of against it then suddenly out gleam the dome of the bridal veil bright and high in the heaven as a comet sweep a glittering tail earthward later as the stage wound along the road and bring they under the wall of the cataract the rainbow diadem that pin the topmost fold of the veil glitter against the noonday sun and in the lacy woof of move water lovely kaleidoscopic pattern play with constant interchange of flowery design invisible finger weave the bridal lace bead with diamond the foliage of its design or so angela think when first she see the fall but presently she make a discovery -- one which nick have make year ago and keep the secret that angelum might have the joy of find it for herself why it be not a veil after all she exclaim i know say nick that effect 's only for the first few minute like a stage curtain hide the real thing and the real thing be only for the elect like we say angelum conceitedly outsider can not get behind the curtain let I tell you what i see and if we see the same thing why it would be a sign that we would be -- friend in a former incarnation would not it but this be a question to leave unanswered and she go on quickly to describe what she see behind the stage curtain of the bridal veil a white witch fall -- yes from the saddle of a black horse -- a winged horse like those the valkyry ride oh now the witch have turn she face to I as she fall she be put I under a spell i feel i shall never escape i hope you never will say nick so we _ do _ see the same thing in the cascade i find the fall witch when i be here before but i come under the spell with you he watch she face fearfully as he venture this never have dare as much before and see that she turn away he draw she attention to el capitan grandest of the near mountain nick have be read _ the cid _ try to worry through it in the old spanish he explain and the idea have come into he head that the mountain might have be name by some spaniard for el gran capitan you see it be too big and important for a everyday captain but it be just right for el gran capitan : do not you think so angelum do think so as he suggest it though she remember next to nothing about _ the cid _ but nick 's knowledge of history which have amaze she once pleased without surprising she now she begin to take he knowledge of most thing for grant here in the yosemite valley he could teach and show she much that she might have miss but for he and he simile show habit of think with which a few week ago she would not have credit the ex-cowboy he make the mountain take shape for she as god and hero of indian legend he tell she of the three grace and the three brother grim as gray monk who throw glance over they round shoulder at the grace and there be no drama or tragedy of the valley that he do not know from its first act to the last in the afternoon the stage rush they past a charming camp in the wood to the sentinel hotel at the foot of the yosemite fall angelum be give a room opening on to a veranda and wait for nick to bring she some word from kate by telephone she stand look up at the immeasurable height of the cataract which loom white across a brown sweep of trout-haunted river it be like a perpendicular road of marble go up to heaven she think and as she gaze down that precipice of snow come tumble a white shape as of a giant bear strive desperately to save itself hang for a instant on the brink of the vast gulf then let go hopelessly and plunge over angelum step out on the veranda to talk with hilliard when he come and though shock to hear that kate could not arrive that night be glad to know she safe nick have arrange that kate should meet she mistress at glacier point next day and so he say there be nothing to bother about if you can do without she for this one night i hope you do not mind much for i feel it be my fault i ought to have manage better i do not mind in the least angelum be begin to console he when suddenly she break off with a oh of dismay clasp she hand together what be the matter nick question anxiously nothing nothing at all but there be something mr may you must tell I and i 'll try to make it right what shop be there here she ask by way of answer oh you can buy photograph and souvenir and candy and drug i expect angelum shake she head i do not want to buy they do you think -- i could find -- a -- a -- nighty a ` nighty ' a nightgown you see i have just remember -- the cascade and mountain make I forget -- my dressing-bag be leave behind with kate i have a frock or two and the new khaki thing for to-morrow in my suit-case but -- nothing else brush and comb and so on i can get here i be sure but -- would the shop -- if any -- run to nightie no say nick gloomily i be afraid they would not anyhow not the sort that deserve a nice pet name like that but -- _ i 'll _ get you one you can not say angelum you can not create a ` nighty ' or call it from the vasty deep that be what i mean to do : call one from the vasty deep hook it up like a rare fish she laugh what bait will you use i do not know yet but i be go to find out and you shall have the ` nighty ' as you call it by the time you want it you would better not pledge yourself i do i have fail you often enough since we start i will not fail this time you 'll see the thing you want must exist somewhere within a radius of ten mile and i be go to lasso it but you do not engage as a lassoer of nightie you engage as trail guide if anything be want along the trail why then it be the business of the trail guide to get it do not you worry about you arrangement mr may i do not meanwhile i may find some kind of a garment lurk on a forget shelf of the candy-drugs-grocery shop if you do it would not be worthy of you but you can try say nick dubiously and after a late luncheon she do try in vain other necessaries be forthcoming but nightie be thing that you have to bring into the yosemite valley it would seem or do without angelum say nothing of she failure she suppose that nick would forget she plight if she make little of it but she do not know he thoroughly yet they take a walk and the momentous subject be not mention : nevertheless it press upon nick 's thought as he talk the nighty that be not and must be weigh upon he mind as heavily as though it be a coat of mail instead of the gossamer creation he imagine now i have get to concentrate and figure out what be trump he say to himself when angelum have go to rest before dinner i have deal myself a mighty queer card but there be no good bluffing in this game the desire garment declare itself even to the untrained masculine intelligence as a dainty and dreamlike thing which to deserve its name and be worthy of a fastidious wearer must be delicate as the outer petal of a white rise how then to obtain for this despoil goddess such a marvel in a remote village lose among yosemite forest there be the rub a vaguely grope rub with no aladdin 's lamp to match nick 's thought ramp in the cage of he mind like a menagerie of hungry animal await food where be that food -- in other word a inspiration -- to be get then of a sudden it drop at he foot he have be pacing uneasily up and down he room but now with all he customary decision he touch the electric bell a trim chambermaid of superior and intelligent appearance answer the call be you a californian be the first question fling at the neat head in place of a expect demand for hot water she have bring the water and be equally prepare for a want unforeseen yes sir she say i be a native daughter hurrah say nick then i know you will not fail I she be too well train a girl to stare be you a native son she venture see that a lead would be useful no but i ought to have be my parent be californian and my heart be and always will be i have to ask help from a californian now for the honor of californium usually when gentleman clamour for help from this young person it be to find a collar stud but not even the most cherish collar stud could concern the honor of the state she wait look sympathetic for nick 's eye would have draw sympathy from a stone and jessy jone have not even a pebble in she composition as a californian i be show californium to a lady he explain she be from europe and i do not want she to think the old civilization can produce anything better than ours i should think not retort the native daughter what be she look for that _ we _ can not produce i would like to know a nightgown confess nick boldly you see he hurry on she be lose the bag she have it in oh if that be all i -- have you see the lady over in the annex in number twenty-three yes say jessy one of the girl tell I there be a regular beauty there english or something so i make a errand that way so _ she be _ the lady well that make it harder ` tis not everything would do for _ she _ i guess she be rather special i guess so too that be what worry I because it be for the honor of californium that a foreigner should be supply even at a moment 's notice with something as good as she could get at home if not better jessy correct he if not better of course if a american lady lose she baggage she would make allowance be at home and if she could not get what she want she would be good-natured and want what she could get well this lady 's good-natured too but it be no compliment to the yosemite for she to expect little and have what she expect no we must surprise she exactly for the honor of californium let 's mingle we brain say nick i guess they 'll be more useful keep separate sir each along its own line do yours keep a line of the right thing it begin to see its way there we have a lady staying in the hotel mr everett from san francisco who be get what we want mr everett 's a native daughter too oh yes she 'll spare one -- she prettiest do not you worry and do not you say a word to you friend i and mrs everett will do the rest when that lady from europe open she door to-night she 'll see lie on she bed something that 'll keep she from know the difference between the yosemite valley and pari trust two native daughter i will say nick devoutly and he shake hand with jessy jone he know better than to offer money at this stage of the game for he too be a californian and honor be concern that night she spirit illumine by the unearthly glory of a lunar rainbow angelum go to she room with a faint sense of anticlimax in the discomfort she expect then make a light she see foam over the coverlet a froth of lace and film of cambric almost it might have be weave from the moon-rainbow but pin on to a sleeve-knot of pale pink ribbon be a slip of paper and on the slip of paper be a few word in a woman 's handwriting : compliment of californium to mr may xxiv the best thing in she life a faint fragrance of rose haunt the mysterious nighty fill the room and mingle with angelum 's dream all night long she walk in a garden of sleep flower sweet shut mouth of rosebud and close white lid of lily and it seem but a short night for in she dream she have half the garden still to explore -- in search for nick it seem -- when a rap sharp as the breaking of a tree branch make she start up in bed a dim impression be in she mind that a voice have accompany the rap and have make a unsympathetic announcement which mean the need to get up but the only really important thing be to run back into the garden and find nick hilliard as otherwise she might miss he forever so angela shut she eye and hurry down dim labyrinth where she have be wander before and call to nick : i be here again where be you the rosebud and lily be still there fast asleep yet somehow the garden be different and not so beautiful a handsome woman with black hair be gather the flower pretend not to see angelum and nick have go a girl 's voice somewhere be say prince di sereno what a romantic name it only seem a minute since the first knock but now there come another and this time the announcement be even more disturbing : breakfast 's ready immediately after as if to show that no argue would avail step go clank along the veranda heavy at first fainter with distance and at last a convulsive banging on the door of some other unfortunate now angelum wish no longer to return to the garden of sleep she be glad to get up bathe in haste and dress breathlessly for she have ask to be call at five in order to breakfast before six in a strenuous quarter of a hour she have arrive at the blouse-fastening stage of she toilet and as luck would have it the blouse concern be one which do not approve of hurry and tolerate no liberty it be of fine cambric hand-embroidered fastening at the back where on one side live a quantity of tiny pearl button make to mate with a equal number of loop on the other side very little loop of linen thread as work of art these be admirable but they like to be wait upon respectfully by a experienced lady 's maid miss such attention not one would consent to yoke itself with its appoint button angelum grow warm and flurry she ring but no one answer the bell for it be not yet six o'clock and only a few of the hotel servant have come on duty what should she do last night she have look forward with interest to dress this morning for nick have get for she a costume suitable for ride a trail pony and fortunately she have it in she suit-case it be of khaki with a divide skirt and a peculiarly fetch jacket but the jacket must be worn over a thin blouse and she could not go out to breakfast with that blouse unbuttoned from neck to waist no doubt by this time nick be wait a large party would start from the hotel to drive to mirror lake and they two be to be in the crowd -- though not of it -- find they trail pony later she might of course keep she forest creature wait indefinitely he be inure to that treatment and would not complain but the other be you ready mr may nick 's voice inquire apologetically outside the door i hope you will not mind my bother you but i think perhaps you call have be forget so -- _ can _ you do my blouse for I because i can not and if you can not i shall cry moaned angelum in a voice of despair she dash the door open and stand on the threshold in the sweet dawn the river laughing at she plight nick do not laugh there be he angel in she short khaki skirt and the thin cambric blouse that would not button she face be flush she eye sparkling with that dress-rage than which no emotion know to woman be more fiercely primitive she be in a early morning i do not care _ what _ happen now mood but nick care in the first place as he eye take in the situation he be overwhelm with a sense of vast responsibility if he could not do the blouse mr may have threaten to cry and she look as if she would keep she word so do the blouse he must if the sky fall and if he could not it have better fall angelum stand with she back to she victim and the rosy light of sunrise turn a small visible slip of white skin to pearl a ring or two of bright hair moist from she bath curl out from the turned-up mass of gold and hover like little glittering bee just over the top button of mr may 's collar which nick must now attack what if some of that shiny hair be twist around the button good heaven on closer inspection it be the man 's heart which be beat fast seem suddenly to turn to water -- wild rush water like that of the river below the fall can you do it ask angela anxiously i sure will answer nick with a hundred per cent more confidence than he feel a confidence somewhat increase however by last evening 's success do i begin at the neck or the waist he inquire in he most matter-of-fact voice as if he be about to cord a box or nail up a crate of orange at the neck angelum instruct he the stricken young man have a curious sensation as if he hand be swell to a immense size he seem to have as much control of he finger as though he wear a pair of boxing glove he take hold gingerly of the delicately embroidered collar a thumb and finger on either side i guess it will not meet he venture tentatively oh yes it will just pull it together firmly nick pull with resolution ugh you be choke I she gurgle all that water which once have be he heart trickle vaguely and icily through the wrong vein upset he whole system forgive I this time he implore it be go to be right just as soon as -- as -- i find the buttonhole there be not any they be loop oh those tiny little stick-up thing like loosen thread yes you 'll see it be _ quite _ easy after the first oh be it indeed nick suppress a groan not at he task but at he own oxlike awkwardness -lrb- so he anathematize it -rrb- that make a torture of a delicious privilege evidently it be a much harder thing to lasso one of these little pearl atrocity with its alleged loop than to rope a vicious steer and there be those tangling thread of gold if he should hurt she the ex-cowboy almost pray as with the caution of a man tread upon knife-blade on the edge of a precipice he unwind the two little curl from the top button of the collar and perhaps he unconscious appeal for mercy have its effect for the tendril yield graciously to coax he would have give a year of he life to kiss one of those curl a comparatively worthless year it would be since in all probability it would be empty of angelum may yet no -- now that he have touch she like this now that he have come so near to she he feel with all he soul that he could never let she go he would have to keep she somehow she may think there be a dead line between we he tell himself but before we leave the yosemite valley together i be go to do my best to cross that line if i get shoot for my cheek it be better to dare the dash and die than not to dare and lose she never perhaps be so desperate a resolve cement while fasten a woman 's blouse but there be a hint of triumph in nick 's voice as he announce i have do it he signal success in two operation of extreme difficulty seem to he like two separate good omen angela lightly thank she knight for he service and bid he wait on the veranda while she put on she jacket and hat a minute later she come out again ready for breakfast and now have a mind release from button she see that nick be good to look upon in he khaki riding-clothes be i all right she inquire modestly better than all right he allow himself to answer i do think this hat of hawaiian straw be a success and you -- well i be rather proud of my trail guide use you to dress like that in you cowboy day nick laugh great scot no i would have be in rag in no time do not you ever see a cowpuncher 's ` shap ' no i do not even know what they be have you keep you cowboy thing oh yes they be knock around somewhere i have to put they on once in a while if i accept you invitation to come and see you place will you ` dress up ' in they of course if it would please you but i would feel a fool rig myself out just to show off like a actor yet that be the bribe you 'll have to offer if you want I to pay you a visit it be settle then i hope the moth have not get my ` shap ' since i have 'em on last they both laugh and go to breakfast what a good world it be angela tell nick the tale of the mysterious apparition of a beauteous nighty and wonder how she could ever have feel unhappy or depressingly grow up the other who be go to mirror lake be almost ready to start and the buckboard which be to take nick and angelum have come to the hotel door but these two at all time small eater be exhilarate by the wine of life and a little milk and bread suffice they they do not keep the party wait and so they be regard with favor -- the handsome young man and the lovely girl about whose relation to each other people be quite good-naturedly speculate angelum see that she be regard with interest and that eye turn from she to nick but she be only mr may whom nobody know after the drive on the buckboard she and nick would be separate from the rest that night at glacier point she would find kate already arrive from el portal and then she would never see any of these pleasant questioning-eyed young people again the most reckless part of the adventure would be over with this day -- and she be rather sorry after all she do not much regret the wave of fate which have sweep she and she maid-chaperon temporarily apart there be a certain piquancy in travel alone with this knight-errant mirror lake -- well-named -- be asleep still and dream of the mountain which imprison it as dragon use to imprison princess in glass retort there be the dream lie deep down and visible under the clear surface and when every one else have go off to the trail pony nick and angelum stay to watch the water 's wake it be a dart fish which with a splash and a ripple shatter the picture but the ripple die and the lake sleep again take up its dream where it have be break off as angelum have try to do she have fail for she picture have change for the worse when she find it again but the second dream of mirror lake be fairer than the first into it there steal a joyous luminance which make saint ' halo for the reflect head of mountain the sun rise and step slowly into the water 's dream it fling the lake a golden loving cup thrilling it to the heart with that bright gift a little farther on by the happy isle -- small lovely island of rock in the river 's whirl -- nick and angelum find they trail pony wait in charge of a boy but nick know the trail well and be to be the sole guide as they have always plan he put angelum up on a intelligent brown bronco which have to be ridden mexican fashion and they set off together the boy look after they as if he too would have like to follow the trail far ahead they could see the procession of they lose companion just round a sharp corner they be a admirable cavalcade in khaki the man wear sombrero the girl with brilliant blue or green veil tie over big hat and scarlet silk handkerchief knot at they neck the gaily color figure on horse or mule back fit the picture as appropriately as if they have be indian and angelum gaze at they with pleasure but she feel no wish to join the band nick lead she ride close behind sometimes mount sometimes descend the narrow trail toward glacier point by and by hall dome one of the great granite mountain begin to dominate the world but though the cascade be in he kingdom they could not be govern by he because spirit be not rule by earthly king there be vernal fall gentle in majesty and nevada a wild and untame water spirit and retrospect glimpse of the yosemite fall close to nevada they reach a famous viewpoint and nick take angelum off she pony that she might stand near the edge and see the white torrent plunge over a unthinkable abyss always she have hate to look down from height because they make she long to jump and end everything but to-day she be in love with life and the leap of the water quicken she heart with a sense of power on the pony again as they go up and up or down steep rocky way on the verge of sheer abyss she have no fear she seem to be learn a lesson of peace a lesson such as only unspoiled nature can teach -lrb- illustration : _ the world be a sea billow with mountain _ -rrb- from the high level they have reach they look down on cloud that glitter silver-white as snow-capped mountain-head among the rock where the pony ' hoof pick they way wild flower spring strange and lovely blossom such as angelum have never see but nick know most of they by name bird note drop like honey from fragrant shrub and tree that hide the singer squirrel with plumed tail and chipmunk strip white gray and brown race across the trail or peer with the bright bead they have for eye from pile of dead wood that lay gray as skeleton among the living green of the mountain forest far below silver apron fall splash into the emerald pool and turn its green jewel to diamond the near forest and faraway water sing in the different voice the same song other water and forest have sing yesterday but this song of the high sierra have wilder note above and beyond all knowledge of fleeting episode such as human life and civilization for the song have not change since the world be young the air be not mere air but seemingly a conscious mingling of divine ether with the atmosphere though they ascend always it be as if they ride through the depths of a crystal sea unstirred by they presence a sea as deep and as high as heaven a blue that take the solidity of turquoise between tree-trunk and pale to opaline fire across the canon angelum know that never again after these spacious day could she go back to she old self she feel that she have mount one step higher on the stage of development and gain a ampler view it be easier now than it have be to see how nick hilliard have become what he be nature on the grandest scale and with the grand manner she think have give he he education have be for he at once schoolmistress guide and companion and no college build by man could give for money such knowledge as sky and wide space have give nick for love early in the afternoon the pony bring they to the high plateau of glacier point where look down the world be a sea billow with mountain foam with cataract angelum be deliciously tired and the long low hotel build of log with a huge veranda seem to promise the welcome she want : a cool clean room a warm bath and afterward luncheon also she expect to find kate nick have wire or telephone she be uncertain which and though no answer have be receive kate 's silence might no doubt be easily explain later angela feel confident that she would have precisely the room she picture she rather hope it would be white and green the manager meet they on the veranda but it be not the manager nick have know my name 's hilliard nick begin oh yes i ` phone a answer to you at the sentinel hotel this morning something wrong with the wire between we yesterday we must have start before you ` phone well i be sorry you want two room but the best we can do for you and mr hilliard be one great scot you do not know what you be talk about gasp nick this be mr may beg you pardon mr may i think you say you name be hilliard it be but hers be not we -- i -- i be only she guide stammer nick so deeply embarrassed for angelum 's sake that for the moment he lose he presence of mind it be the last straw he think she 'll never forgive I and he dare not look to see how she have take the blow until she surprise he by laugh she be blush a little too do you remember the laundry in new orlean she ask i be afraid it will have to be the laundry for you again or else a refrigerator nick be of opinion that the refrigerator would better suit the state of he complexion which need cooling but he relief at see angelum amuse not offend be too great for word he mumble something vague about any cupboard or cellar be good enough and begin to recover himself but he confusion have be contagious the hotel manager catch the disease and hope mr willard would excuse he -- no he mean mr day -- no really he begin to be afraid that he do not remember rightly _ what _ he mean he would get mr milliard and mr hay mix up and would they sort themselves please once he have they straighten out in he mind he would try to keep they straight have my maid come on from el portal angela think this a propitious moment for a question on some other subject you maid no mr hill she have not and no message how strange nothing that i have hear of but i 'll let you know if mr mayard -- mr mill will come with I to the ` phone when you be in he room -- i mean when you be in yours -- we may get on to el portal angelum be still laugh to herself when word be bring by a chambermaid that kate have telephone from el portal she have hurt she ankle in get into the stage -lrb- angelum could quite imagine that -rrb- and have not be able to proceed it be not however a regular sprain she be in bandage but better and it be now settle that without fail she be to meet mr may at wawona to-morrow and you husband want to know add the chambermaid what time you would like to have you lunch he be not my husband say angela the young woman freeze we be friend the scandalize muscle relax there be a high nobility in friendship the chambermaid herself have a friend who talk a great deal about plato in the cheap edition and will you please say i shall be ready in twenty minute stand on the hotel veranda together after luncheon mr mill and mr hayward -- he restore to calmness -- could look thousand of foot down to the floor of the valley exactly how many thousand of foot there be angelum refuse to be tell for the distance seem illimitable and cold fact might dwarf imagination they see the yosemite fall a quiver white vein on a dark wall a million mile away mirror lake be a splinter of glass on a pavement of green tile nevada and vernal fall be pale yet bright as streak of stardrift in the blue haze of distance if it have not be for the episode of mr hilliard and mr may nick might have feel tempt to try he fate and dare the dash across the dead line that evening of moonlight on the mountain-top but it might he think seem like presume on what have happen and have come more or less safely round a awkward turn he be thankful to find himself on a narrow ledge of security the moonshine that turn mountain to marble and sky to pearl be cold as it be pure and in its bleaching radiance angelum seem less woman than spirit he dare not let that angel know how hot be he heart i 'll wait till we be among the big tree he say to himself they be great as great as the mountain in they way but they be friendly and kind as if they might help that be where i 'll risk it all : in the mariposa forest the place i like better than any other in the world so whatever happen we shall have see the best there be together and all that will be mine to remember if i lose everything else the next day be a day of forest and flower they be not travel this time in a ordinary stage for nick have secure a buckboard for themselves alone with a driver who know the country with its beauty and legend as well as he know he big muscular gray horse those never-ending cathedral-forest of america 's national park be wilder than any that angelum have imagine she hardly believe that the great redwood which she be to see to-morrow could be grander than these immense fluted column of cedar and pine in the arm of the biggest and most virile tree many slender saple shape storm-broken or tired of face life alone lay helplessly but the driver 's heart be proof against a romantic view of this situation as sketch by angelum it ought not to be allow he say sternly think of the danger in fire that be what be call by the forester ` extra hazard ' as i guess mr hilliard know oh yes nick know but see with angelum 's eye he envy the lover-tree they peril he a lonely tree have already take fire but he would gladly risk the extra hazard what if -- and he thought run ahead to the day in the redwood that day set apart by he mind as the _ clou _ of the excursion -- what if the thing she eye seem to say to he should be true what if she could love he and give up she world that world which he see vaguely as a dazzling vision what if to-morrow she too should know the thrill of extra hazard no wonder then as he dream that the glacier meadow encircle by green wall of forest primeval should seem like fairy ring visible to mortal eye only as a special privilege in the sunlight-gold the sheet of azalea cyclamen and violet be embroidered tapestry of pink and purple the bright rivulet of melting snow that bath the wild flower ' root become a network of diamond here and there under the huge coniferous tree lay patch of snow still unmelted though the month be June indian fire glow red on the white expanse blood on marble and scarlet snow-plant send up lurid spout like flame fountain the tree-shadow be paint pool of lupin azure lake or they be purple sea of larkspur mountain-rose and wild lilac tangle in a maze of pink and white and gold bear-clover crown the bald gray head of rock or shine out like star-white strawberry blossom from under a thicket of deer-bush wild aster burn rosily like small catherine wheel half extinguish small mottled tiger lily blaze among the pale young frond of grow bracken : the air be scented with wild rose and the spicy fragrance of manzanita tree -- the breath of californium but loveliest and strangest of all thing be the garden choose for they own by the mariposa lily the tremble winged flower hover airily just above the earth like a flock of alight butterfly and overhead poise real butterfly of the self-same delicate tint hardly strong enough to be name as color silvery white faint lilac and a sunrise-hint of rise ground butterfly and air butterfly seem kin to one another those root to the ground longing for wing those to whom earth offer no permanent foothold envy they half-sister 's rest and peace here in the mountain it be spring though down below in the valley full summer have come and toward evening angelum and nick descend once again to the summer world the valley of wawona be lay out on the plan of those fairy ring _ alias _ glacier meadow which they have see in higher place only this be a fairy ring on a grander scale it seem so hide by a belt of mountain that its green lawn its garden its fountain and flower might have be originally discover only by some happy accident but the discoverer being of a practical turn of mind he or he descendant have build a delightful though unobtrusive hotel on a spot which might still have be warm from the fairy on the veranda of the hotel be kate beam with smile of welcome as the buckboard come down from glacier point bring she mistress in sight oh it be a lovely place say kate and sure how happy she and timmy be to be there at last she have arrive hour ago and be nicely rest yes thank you ma'am there be saucer of white violet and vase of iris and washington lily in mr may 's bedroom here be no embarrassing complication connect with mr may and mr hilliard all be peace and as the dust which have turn angelum 's golden hair to silver be be brush away by kate the tale of the maid 's adventure be unfold yet angela smile gently as she inhale the sweetness of violet hardly listen she be glad that kate be almost well and that timmy be restore to the bosom of he family but it seem to she that no one except herself have have any adventure worth the name no one else could ever have adventure half as good even she -- no not for she could they like come again she begin to grudge the passing of the hour wish that she have the power to stop all the clock of the world xxv the broken melody i want to write thing in my diary say angelum now lest i forget or they change color i want to write here so that afterward when i read the page i may see the picture they be in the palace of the giant redwood she and nick and several robin and chipmunk they have be there all day and soon it would be sunset then the moon would come to light they home they would leave the palace and the best day would end they have lunch and dine with a huge fall log for a table and squirrel for they honor guest now they have come back -lrb- carry out a plan make in the morning -rrb- to sit under the grizzly giant king of the great sequoia and there watch the sun set the giant seem to know all they be do and say not only that but what they be think too he have great deep-set black eye which some foolish people might mistake for knot-hole and with these he look down gravely perhaps benevolently on the dark head and the golden one that be he human aspect but he have other and it be about one of they that angelum wish to write -- just a few word which she might like to read again some day in the gray _ suède _ receptacle which have temporarily and publicly supersede the gold bag she carry a small book it be one of three volume two have be fill since she arrival in america but this be just begin there be not much in it yet it begin with el portal where would it stop already she be wonder maybe she would never write any more after to-day or the story might go on for a little and end when this trip with she trail guide end or it might continue more perfunctorily just long enough to lay the foundation of she new house the plan of which be now materialize in a architect 's brain she interest in those plan have fall asleep everything outside this vast cathedral of a thousand fluted red column seem far away and unreal the heart of the world be throb here like the music of a muffle organ with only nick hilliard and herself for audience i do not know you keep a diary say nick somehow you do not seem the sort who would i do not ` keep ' one angelum explain when i be a little girl and go abroad with my mother i use to write thing about the day to please my father at home i love he very much but -- he never see the book after he die i write no more until -- i come to californium now -lrb- she speak hastily -rrb- i write about thing not people i make picture for myself to look at afterward for i can not bear to think that my impression may grow dim even when i be old i suppose i must not ask to see what you write to-day nick venture by and by he mean to ask a thing so much bolder and bigger that he wish to try he foot on the difficult path i must read it myself before i can judge angelum smile surprised at the suggestion from one who never put himself forward who have never beg for concession or favor since offer himself as trail guide now do not speak to I for a while i want to call the whole day back but though he lip be close he eye be not and they seldom wander from the bent head -- gold against a dark tree-trunk and the cameo profile -- ivory-white upon a red-brown background angelum be sit under the generous shade of the grizzly giant nick lay rest on he elbow just near enough to touch with he shoulder the sole of she small dusty shoe cross one over the other after all it be not as easy to write as angelum have expect with nick lie silent and so close to she that it seem if she should listen she might hear he thought like the ticking of a watch under a pillow she begin by note down commonplace thing as though by way of sort out she impression we leave kate this morning at wawona what dear people keep that hotel in europe one never think about hotel-keeper if everything be right one simply take they for grant as one breathe good air it be different here in the west of america they -- these charming kind people -- lend we they own ` buckboard ' -- a glorified one and they two horse cash and credit who be famous darling animal they be and understand every word that be say to they when they die generation of californium horse ought to be name cash and credit to preserve they memory we start early just after the morning have be bear so as to miss nothing and first of all we have a quick rush through the flowery valley of wawona -- a kind of prelude to the music of the great redwood and i think it help I to appreciate and understand they we see stellar lake name by inspiration for it look a blue sky half full of star and i have my first sight of a fish hatchery i would no notion it could be so exciting to watch the career of trout from the egg stage up to rainbow maturity never shall i forget grab a handful of tiny wriggle fish out of the trough of water where they live and hold they in the hollow of my palm for a instant they look like big silver comma and interrogation point oh but punctuation of all kind and they feel like iced popcorn i do not think i shall ever eat trout again it would be so treacherous now that i seem to have know the creature from the cradle to the grave but about the big tree which at this present moment be to I the most important thing on earth i have see a good deal of the earth but nothing so good nothing so glorious no wonder mr hilliard say ` why need people build church in this part of the world when they have the redwood cathedral build by god full of the sound of he organ music ' all through the yosemite there be music you hear the forest talking and think it be the river you hear the river and think it be the wind give a signal to the tree that they may begin speak for tree and river and wind have live so long together -- like people marry happily since early youth -- that thought and word and tone have come to be the same but among the redwood be the noblest music of all different from that of any other tree and only think yesterday i hardly believe they could be taller and grander than some of the other i have see all those great conifer that would have be god in greece even this morning drive through forest that line the way to the sequoia i still believe that -- poor I the big sugar-pine and the yellow-pine loom so huge towering above delicate birch and a hundred other lovely creature which they guard as eastern man guard the beauty of they harem but the moment i see the two first giant -- the ` sentinel ' -- stand on the threshold of they palace or cathedral whichever it be -lrb- but it be both and more -rrb- i know how mistaken i would be about the other these be super-tree we drive on slowly along a wide aisle pave with gold and sprinkle with gold-dust the pillar hold up the sky-roof be fluted deeply and regularly and they be rose-red these tree column seem to glow with inward fire -- the never-dying fire of life which keep they heart alive when common tree perish theirs be no ruin cathedral or palace all be perfect now as in its beginning wall and dome of blue which can never crumble and the door be never shut though jealousy guard by the sentinel in some of the tree be shrine at first glance they appear to be empty shrine but they be not empty really what one find there depend upon one 's self i wish i could live in this palace for week i should make wonderful discovery in old house whose roof be support by great beam of oak i know they call the stoutest and most important the ` king beam ' for without he the roof would fall just so the grizzly giant be the king tree of the mariposa forest there be other tree more beautiful and graceful yet he be indisputably undisputedly king among lesser royalty and royal highness all be crown these sequoia be not clothe with green like other tree but crown with it have also here and there upon they breast green decoration and medal they bark fold and drape they in mantle of royal purple and they high crown mingle gold with green the grizzly giant 's crown be of a strange shape and very wonderful he be alive and look at you but he do not wish you to know that so if you be too curious he often pretend to be a castle ornament with quantity of fantastic gargoyle the castle have a theater into which you can see and it be fit up with extraordinary scenery there be a museum of strange statue too headless torso and arm thicker through than a man be long the prince and princess who be the grizzly giant 's family and help he reign over he subject have to go and stand at a good distance or they would lose they majesty in comparison with he when we have leave the horse -lrb- near a fascinating log-cabin in the wood -rrb- and mr hilliard have arrange for they comfort we walk about pick out the prince and princess and know quite well from the look of they which be which some of the tree be commandingly masculine other though as immense graciously feminine it sound rather confuse to call the tree sometimes column of a cathedral or palace sometimes royal people but any one who have come to visit they even once would understand if i be to be here longer i should see they in a great many other different phase i be sure and i may perhaps see they again but nothing will ever be the same i have have such thought to-day i want to put each idea small and big on paper to remember but i find that they will not let themselves be write down they be as intangible as the incense in this cathedral as impossible to put in black and white as it would be to jot down in note the music that pour out from the pipe of the unseen organ or to paint the light that stream through the cathedral window and what a magical light it be there be other tree in this forest besides the sequoia but it be on the redwood alone that the light concentrate just as limelight be turn upon the lead character of a stage drama they burn with they own ruddy fire while they neighbor tree -lrb- overgrown with golden-green moss that make sleeve for outstretched arm and gold embroidery for dark drapery -rrb- gleam out among the redwood ' flaming pillar like light candelabrum i shall see those light behind my eyelid to-night as i see the sunset light on stonehenge the moon touch the giralda of seville and my first alpenglow but what stonehenge be to england the giralda to spain and the alp to switzerland that i think be the mariposa forest of giant sequoia to californium if i have be a atheist i believe i should suddenly have be teach the lesson of god among the great redwood and nobody could be heavy-hearted here or frivolous i feel that the same light which burn like fire in these tree burn in my vein a vast wave of life vitalize all creation and make it kin i be a poor relation of these wonderful giant also i be a cousin of the robin and chipmunk that share we picnic luncheon and the dinner we finish a little while ago i be nearer than i be yesterday to all humanity and to -- angelum 's pencil stop its weave back and forth across the small white page pause as if of its own accord she look at the last word she have write and shut the book yes she be near to all humanity but nearer than any to _ one _ who be all the world to she suddenly she feel with poignant intensity the nearness not only of he body to hers but the nearness of they soul she spirit and he touch in the silence of the forest she do not look at he yet but she know that he be look at she and that he heart be in the look call to hers and she could not shut she ear to the call so she sit for a long moment she eye cling for safety to the little volume in she hand she finger press it tightly almost spasmodically and upon they she seem to feel even to see nick hilliard 's hand brown and strong it be only she fancy but it be not fancy that they burn to clasp hers she feel that longing of he so vital so passionate create the picture it desire always before when the thought have flash into she mind he be begin to love I she have thrust it away shut she mind against it but that be before she spirit be key to the high music of river and forest in the yosemite valley since then she have pass from the twilight of little society sham and convenient conventional self-deceiving into the glory where only truth be visible or audible at last she be force to lift she eye compel by he she try to look past he straight into the sunset a furnace that burn up human misgiving but she gaze be stop on the way by hilliard 's may i read what you have write he ask yes she say and give he the book while he read she draw in deep breath gather strength against a emergency if a emergency be to come but she hope it would not she want oh so much to keep he for a comrade -- for the comrade who have make this day the best day of she life she do not want to stop play because if it have come to earnest deep reality as she be afraid it must come now there would be no place for nick hilliard in she future -- the future of paolo di sereno 's disillusioned wife still here under these tree i could tell he everything better than i could tell it anywhere else and make he understand and even forgive she think without fear i could let he know that i care for he and that he have be the only man except father who have mean anything great to the _ real _ I almost i wish he would speak -- if he _ do _ love I and _ i _ know he do but he lay read the fancy she have write about the forest and she could not guess how he be summon he courage as a general surprised summons he force to battle she do not know how deep be he humility in thought of she any more than she realize how utterly she first point of view have change toward he the forest creature the interesting picturesque figure so entirely be he a man and the one man that she have forget she old impersonal frame of mind he come to the last sentence in the book broken short where she pencil have stop of itself thank you he say i be glad you feel those thing about the forest it be always be like that to I -- sacred if anything great and wonderful be to happen i would rather have it happen here than anywhere else would you _ yes it be come _ suddenly she half want it to come -- this crisis in they life yet something make she push it away just for a little while not to have the end quite so soon no matter how beautiful a end oh wait she exclaim do not let 's talk of ourselves yet -- not for a few minute wait with I and neither of we will say one word till the sun have set and the light have change till the light have change nick echo a shadow fall over he face he raise himself higher on he elbow he shoulder still touch she foot and they look toward the west the forest seem to have be light up for some great religious festival each tower tree be a titanic candle with a flame at the top against the far-off sky the deep-red fluted trunk gleam with a pale luminous rose and long straight avenue of fire-dust stretch away to the end of the world a flood of golden flame pour through the forest like a tidal wave out of the sun then come a ebb a pause the wave recede a faint purple haze like smoke from burn heliotrope creep along the ground the torch of sunset break into a million star blaze golden spider swing from glitter web among the treetop the melting crown of the redwood drip ruby red meteor fall and burst and the wild glory fade suddenly into a subdue reminiscent glow it be as if a cupful of ruddy wine have be drunk at a gulp leave but a few drop to stain the crystal the rosy radiance run along the horizon and all that live of the sunset cling to the far edge of the world or catch the gold horn of the grizzly giant 's crown which like a high mountain summit could hold the light of day while night purple the plain below all day a concert of bird have fill the upper chamber of the tree with silver piping but now not a bird voice speak there be silence except for a faint mysterious stir as of dryad begin to wake and dress for they night-flitting when a moonbeam should tap on they shut door the lilac haze float up from the ground and slowly very slowly turn to silver touch with rose like a veil it spread among the tree tangle among they sharp branch its lacy mesh tear to leave dark jagged hole but unseen hand mend the rent and weave the veil into a curtain that screen the distance and be pin up with star the whole forest rustle with mystery in the strange pulsing luminance that be neither sunset nor moonrise but the memory of one and a hope of the other -- the kind of light that a blind man might see in dream now -- angelum nick half whisper in awe at the name on he lip the name of a goddess utter by a mortal -lrb- extra hazard -- extra hazard -rrb- at last he lay he hand on hers warm and close and she lip open to break the spell when a voice call to nick in the distance : nick nick hilliard where be you angela draw away quickly the spell broken indeed he spring to he foot he face that have be pale flush it be mr gaylor 's voice he say astonished and incredulous as if at the call of a ghost xxvi a invitation from carman carman have be follow from san francisco a day late because once in lose the trail she have lose twenty-four hour to-day she have arrive at wawona in the afternoon and learn that mr nickson hilliard have go to the mariposa grove she ask for a carriage to take she there too you 'll reach the wood just about the time he be come away she be advise he ought to be back by ten o'clock at latest maybe earlier but carman insist she could not wait business make it necessary for she to see mr hilliard as soon as possible without waste a moment she look sallow and hollow-eyed for she have be travel hard long ago now she have put away she widow 's weed yet in the warm June sunlight she have the aspect of a mourner it be as if she have drunk the blackness of night and it run in she vein in full sunshine she seem to bleed shadow the name of gaylor be well know in californium and here at wawona -- far from the gaylor ranch as it be -- those with whom she speak be aware of she importance carman have no fear that she would be gossip about and misunderstand she be mrs eldridge gaylor the rich widow of old grizzly gaylor everyone know that nick hilliard of lucky star gusher fame have be she husband 's foreman and that the land which have make he fortune have be sell to he by she no one would doubt she or laugh behind she back when she state that the need of a business discussion with hilliard be press people would think that perhaps another gusher have start into be or that some question of investment must be decide but even if she come make talk carman be in no mood to care in she mind a searchlight shone fiercely upon three figure : she own nick hilliard 's angelum may 's other be as shadow a buckboard and horse with a good driver be find for mr gaylor after a slight delay but she have be wander on foot among the great redwood for half a hour when nick hear she voice call he name mr may have not be mention at the hotel carman have be inform simply that mr hilliard be show a friend through the forest and that they have go out in the morning with the intention of stay to see the sunset but carman have find in the visitor 's book the name of mr may and maid she have be certain of find they there for she know only too well that all three with a black cat for luck have leave san francisco together every day since theo dene have tell she of angelum may 's existence she have cut the card and have invariably come upon a fair woman close to the king of heart madame vestris also have see the fair woman in the crystal and have describe she she be beautiful and young and stand in the sunshine say the seeress in whose vision carmen have implicit faith but suddenly she be blot out of my sight as if by a dark cloud that swallow she up do she come back into the crystal carman have ask eagerly no i can see you now but she do not come back and nick do you find he madame vestris know very well who nick be during the last three or four year she have reply to a great many question about nick hilliard and she answer have bring she a goodly number of ten-dollar bill for crystal-gazing she charge be ten dollar : with a trance in addition twenty-five i see a man standing beside you but he be in deep shadow i can not make out who it be carmen revive it must be nick there be no other man i can think of i would let come near I when she call to hilliard in the mariposa grove and he answering call tell she where to look carman be even more anxious to see what mr may be like than to meet nick himself though it seem year since the night when she bid he good-bye full of hope believe he would come back to she the two be stand under the grizzly giant when she come up to they nick a few step in advance because he have start to meet he old friend and a sickly pang shoot through carman 's heart as she see angelum tall and white in the rose-and-silver twilight she have to admit the enemy 's beauty and with a sharp stab of pain she remember nick 's description of the angel of he dream yes this white slender creature be like a man 's idea of a angel here be nick 's ideal make human carman wish that the grizzly giant might fall on the angel and crush she to death a linger death of agony because nothing less could satisfy a woman 's longing for revenge nor be death enough to atone carman would have choose to see angelum die disfigure so that nick should remember she hideous through the year to come desire this eagerly and all other evil mr gaylor be nevertheless polite and pleasant to mr may she come out from the tragic shadow which have envelop she like a mourning mantle and wonder at herself hear the sweet tone of she own voice she begin by explain to nick that she have not be well that she doctor have recommend she to try a change of air and that she have think of the yosemite i have always want to see the valley ever since you come back and talk so much about it she go on then when i get to wawona i hear you be there i be surprise do you realize you only write to I once and never tell I any of you plan i should have think you be in new york to this day if i have not run up to the falconer ' place on the mccloud river not very long ago and find out that you would be in santa barbara i suppose this lady be mr may a friend of that fascinating miss dene she or some of the people up there tell I that you would promise to show she round californium as carman wait to be introduce she glance sharply from one to the other to see if they look self-conscious but they wear a air of innocence that make carman long to strike nick and trample on the woman how dare they act as if she have no right to resent they be here together yet she do not want they to know just now that she do resent it angelum be almost as keenly interested in carman as carman be in she and though mr gaylor be not at she best she be excite she eye shine and dusk soften she hard look of fatigue angelum think nick 's old friend one of the handsomest woman she have ever see also she be jealous more sharply and consciously jealous than when theo dene have gossip about mr gaylor and nick hilliard on the way back from santa barbara mission angelum have never before know the sting of jealousy have never think till that day that she could feel so mean a passion yet now she suffer as nick once have suffer and be ashamed to suffer a few minute ago she have be sure that hilliard love she and she have key herself to tell he nobly why he must forget she why she must forget he but have see carman she begin to wonder if nick do care and whether after all he have mean to speak of he love here in the forest perhaps she have be conceit and mistake about he feeling maybe nick have merely be chivalrous and kind like all california man and want nothing of she except friendship maybe if he have mean to tell she anything it have be about this beautiful mr gaylor nick introduce they to each other rather shyly and formally and they be both extremely polite even complimentary carman say that she hope mr may would not think it very queer of she hurry out to meet mr hilliard the moment she hear he be near of course she might have wait for he to come back to wawona they say he would be back by ten but she be so impulsive and she have wish to see the redwood by sunset and moonrise she know mr hilliard would not want to bother about bring she here next day after he have just see the tree himself and for the second time too this have be too good a chance to lose the tree be wonderful be not they would mr may and nick mind stop a little longer now that she have come and let she see the moon rise there be a sort of quiver over the sky as if it would appear soon all three sit down but not in the place where nick and angelum have sit together he could not have endure that while carman talk and the other answer -- when they must -- the moon-dawn come and never would the princess di sereno forget the drift of star behind the tree and the fleecy moon-surf that beat on the high branch yet the music of the forest be silent for she and the charm be break what be you go to do to-morrow carman ask and angelum answer before nick could speak : oh my trip be over there be nothing more to do but to go back -- by a different way of course i have still to see inspiration point of which i have hear so much i be look forward to that when you say ` go back ' do you mean san francisco or the east carman try to make she voice sound indifferent though polite to san francisco for a while i be not go east i hope i have buy land near monterey i mean to build and make a home for myself in californium carman 's one linger hope die she have think it just possible that this affair have be a travel flirtation that nick though infatuate would return to he old allegiance when this witch-light this will-o ' - the-wisp this love pirate have go but the love pirate intend to drop anchor in californium water it seem luckily for carman that the daylight have fade change on a woman 's face if bent a little could not be see in the dusk i wish you would give I a chance to prove that californium woman be just as glad as californium man to be nice to stranger she go on you home be not ready yet so you have nothing to tie you down will not you come and see _ my _ home it be very pretty if i do say so myself and it might give you one or two idea try and help I persuade she nick you see mr may i feel almost as if i know you they could talk of nobody else at rush river camp and meeting you in this wonderful forest make I sure we ought to be friend as if it be _ mean _ you know you be very kind say angelum feeling distinctly guilty because she do not like carman and admire she only because she could not help it i tell you mr gaylor would want you to come to she house exclaim nick try to be cordial and forget he bitter disappointment he too be feel guilty he have be even more sorry than surprised to see carman and wish she a hundred mile away something tell he that if she have not interrupted he just at the critical moment when hour and place and mood have seem propitious angelum would have be kind such a moment as carman gaylor have spoil might never come again but he feel that he be cruel and ungrateful to he loyal friend he benefactress it be not she fault he remind himself that she have appear at the wrong time she could not have guess that he love mr may he ought to be flatter because poor carman have start out to meet he in the forest instead of wait at wawona the sound of she voice with its deep contralto remind he how much he owe to mr gaylor she friendship and generosity have make he rich if it have not be for she he would never have own or be able to sell the lucky star gusher and after all there would be other moment because mr gaylor have inadvertently rob he of this chance with angelum there be no reason to feel so gloomily sure that he would never have another he would make one for himself and now here be he kind friend invite mr may to visit she mostly to please he of course how like she if only he angel would accept he might be able to cross the dead line by and by in he own country and that would be the next best after the mariposa forest carman bite she lip so they have talk she over together these two and nick have tell this woman that she would be invite to visit the gaylor ranch well she would let they believe that she be good-naturedly play into they hand she want yet hate to have they think that why of course nick know how delighted i be to get pleasant visitor she force herself to say i have not many -- and i get few other pleasure i be awfully lonesome on my big ranch come for as long as you can -- but even a few day will be better than nothing if you can not spare more nick can show you he gusher -- or rather the gusher that be he and lucky star city which you 'll think queer and interesting i expect just as nick do -- though it seem vulgar and hideous to I by the way nick there be a new school-teacher at lucky star oh there be _ lot _ of news since you go away i shall have heap to tell you will not you come and visit I and be show around by nick mr may angela be tear between several emotion none of which she be able clearly to define if she refuse it might seem ungracious because already half in earnest half in play she have partly promise nick to go some time and have a glimpse of lucky star ranch and city yet less than ever do she wish to be indebted for hospitality to mr gaylor could i go for a day she inquire you could for two day and a night say carman if you could not give we more time you see you would have to travel all night from san francisco to bakersfield or rather to kern -- which be the same thing and my place be a good long drive from there even in a motor which i could easily hire you need not do that i have buy one nick cut in eagerly she be in san francisco i be look forward to show she to you but now i can do better if mr may consent i 'll ship the auto by train in advance and send the shuvver -- my assistant i mean -- on ahead so as to look the car over and see that she be ready to run we all out to you ranch after we arrive at bakersfield in the morning now be not you surprise at my news mr gaylor -- that i have get a automobile of my own or do they tell you that among other thing at river camp yes they tell I answer carman with the same praiseworthy calmness which she have be admire in herself and wonder at as if it be a marvellous performance on the stage by a actress anyhow i expect my yellow car will excite more interest at lucky star than a new schoolmistress say nick laughing almost light-hearted again but he do not give more than a think to the schoolmistress of what possible importance could she be to he will you run over from kern to the gaylor ranch in he yellow car ask carman softly and kindly see that the enemy hesitate yes -- thank you both i will go angelum say then i be reward for my long drive this afternoon and indeed carmen feel reward she think of the crystal and how madame vestris have see the fair woman blot out of the sunshine by a dark cloud and after that she have not come into the crystal again carmen have be there with a man standing by she side but what should i have do if the hateful creature have refuse to visit I carmen think everything depend on that next day they take the long drive together mr gaylor angelum and nick and angelum 's maid -- for carman have not bring mariette to the yosemite mariette be too talkative and have be send home from san francisco carman do not wish nick to find out how hurry this journey of hers have be lest he should suspect that it be make in quest of he she want he to believe that she have be travel leisurely for the benefit of she health as she have take pain to explain nothing could spoil the azure mystery of inspiration point : nothing could dim the brightness of the bridal veil see from a new point of view so near that a strong wind might have drive the spray into they face they see the white fold of the waterfall embroider with rainbow and the dark rock behind its rush flood stain deep red and gold and blue as if generation of rainbow have dry there nothing could stifle the thrill of that wild drive down steep road that tie themselves ribbonlike round the mountain-side and seem to flutter as ribbon might flutter over precipice yet the magic of four day ago be dead carman sit between nick and angelum have kill it neither river nor tree sing they old song and the white witch of the bridal veil have turn she face away xxvii simeon harp nick 's detective in san francisco have no news at all event no news with which he could be induce to part wait a few day longer he say that be the only favor i ask maybe by that time we shall both know where the poison-oak come from who post the box who send it and why and all the rest there be to know have not you any suspicion yet nick ask impatiently i do not go so far as to say that what -- that you have or you have not that i have not you mean you do suspect some one well my mind 's begin to hover tell I where no i will not tell you that mr hilliard you will not -- not while i be hover not till there be something to light on i may be do a innocent person a big injustice and nick could squeeze no more hint from max wisler herein lay one secret of the man 's success he have he own method and no one could persuade or bribe he to depart from they this cause he to be respect and nick have to leave san francisco with mr gaylor and angelum tingle with unsatisfied curiosity mr may have forbid he to speak to carman of the mysterious box have grow sensitive on the subject more than once she have ask herself if it be possible that some one very very far away -- some one whose photograph be in the _ illustrate london news _ -- hate she enough to do she a injury : some one she have believe to be completely indifferent in these day the thing savor of the latin mind she could not help think rather than the anglo-saxon perhaps princess di sereno be not quite forget in italy after all and mr may could imagine a motive for in san francisco she have be able to find a duplicate of that illustrated paper there be three photograph in it : one rather bad one of herself take year ago in rome one of paolo dress as a aeronaut and one of a certain handsome young woman very becomingly dress to accompany the prince for a flight in he new aeroplane angelum be not happy in this expedition to the gaylor ranch though she reassure herself from time to time by say that it be better to accept than refuse the invitation and she be to be mr gaylor 's guest only for a day part of another and one night still she be vaguely trouble the warm consciousness of be surround by kindness which have make the californium sunshine doubly bright be chill this visit would be like other visit which she have make in the past before she be mr may whom nobody know in rome in paris in london princess di sereno have be oblige sometimes to go to house of woman whom she dislike or distrust and to have they in hers such obligation have be part of the inevitable disagreeableness of daily existence for the wife of paolo di sereno but go to mr gaylor be the first false note in the music of this free new world angelum console herself by think of lucky star ranch she would like to see nick hilliard 's home \* \* \* \* \* simeon she be here say carman in a low voice to the old squirrel poisoner they stand together in the grove of bamboo where they have talk about nick and about old grizzly gaylor on the may night when nick be leave for new york counting by time that be not long ago but carman 's whole outlook on life be change she feel and look year older that be all right then my lady simeon harp answer the whole thing 's all right do not you worry oh i do worry every minute i be in hell she groan oh simeon what will become of I you 'll be happy and marry the man you love my lady the old man soothe she the red-rimmed eye which have once be handsome send out a faint gleam of the one emotion that still burn in the ash of he wreck soul : devotion to the woman who have save he life who have give he a roof and food and -- above all -- drink i can never be happy again whatever happen carman say with anguish he love some one else he do not care for I he 'll learn to care this slip of a thing that be come between you and ` im my lady will fly away out of he mind like a bit of thistledown when i be do with she -- she be get rid of for good oh but the horror of it -- the get rid of she it do not weaken one bit simeon i have bring she here for that _ just that _ and it shall be do in some mood for a minute or two i rejoice in the thought of it i want it i would even like to be there and see madame vestris say that in my last incarnation i be a roman empress -- that i use to go to the gladiator show and turn my thumb down as a sign that the wounded one who fail in the fight be to be kill by they conqueror in the arena and that once when i hate a christian girl i go to see she kill by lion she -- madame vestris -- watch the whole scene in she crystal very likely it be true what she say i believe in she she be wonderful but i be softer in this incarnation than in the last i guess it frighten I and turn I sick when i think how i shall dream and wake up night afterward -- even if i be marry to nick oh it be awful but it be the only way he be mean for I he be mine she 'll have to go and i do not care how much i suffer if only i have he for my husband in the end you 'll have he say simeon harp it be go to be and there be not no need for you to dream bad dream _ you _ be not do the thing it be I it be I think of it it be I who 'll carry it out suppose you fail she whisper i will not if you 'll do you part just the little part my lady we can not get on without you doin ' you send she there to the right place that be all for the rest you can count on I oh carmen shudder and put she hand before she face to think it be for to-day -- _ to-day _ if only the _ other thing _ have go through all right and she would be make so hideous that he could not look at she this horror might have be save i would have want no more once he would see she face that he think so angelic red and swollen and hardly human he could never have feel the same toward she again and it would not have hurt she much in the end but evidently she be not the kind that be affect by that stuff i know there be some who be not those two have not speak about the box to I simeon i be afraid at first nick might suspect and be watch but that be nonsense of course and she would not be here now if the idea have cross he mind nobody 'll ever know say simeon i go such a long way i change train three time and walk mile in between besides when i post the box i be wearin ' something different from what i ever wear here i be another man to look at oh yes i be sure you do you part well carman say quickly it be fate interfere i feel it would all the card near I be black just then i do not know what i should do without you simeon -- good old watch-dog you shall be rich the rest of you life if you win I happiness i have get all i want the squirrel poisoner answer it be a pleasure to I to serve you you do not need to offer no reward except to keep I near you my lady and give I my bite and sup you ought to know that by this time -- _ anyhow since a year ago _ i know and you be clever as well as faithful i should never have think of as good a way as -- as this no one could possibly prove it be anything but a accident do you -- see she simeon yes i be not far off when nick 's big yeller automobile spill you both out at the door to my idea she be not nothing to you i be never one for blonde if you could see nick 's eye when he look at she those be the time when i feel like the roman empress i be glad he would not stay to lunch though i ask i do not think i could have stand have he i would have do something desperate maybe and spoil everything she be lie down now i make she promise she would till half a hour before lunch nick 's come for we with he auto at five he want it to be earlier but i tell he she be tired and it would be too hot for she to walk around lucky star in the glare where there be not any tree it be all get to happen and be over with before five simeon she 'll never see nick 's ranch she talk so much of again carmen shiver and she eye be wide and stare curiously glaze she know that she be look almost plain to-day and have be actually terrify by she own face in the glass before she come out to keep the appointment with simeon harp but it do not matter what she look like before simeon when nick come and see she again next time there would be reason why he would have no eye for she and later when all this be over she would come back into she beauty again she must what time be you have lunch my lady simeon inquire in a matter-of-fact tone he harsh voice sound just as usual at one and you 'll send she out at half-past two right my lady that 'll bring she to the place i want about three or a little after yes you be sure nothing can go wrong sure as ever i be about a squirrel oh carmen shiver and turn away from he without another word she go back to the house no one have see they talk together and even if they have be see it would not have matter mr gaylor often chat with the old squirrel poisoner who be know to be devote to she a harmless creature who hurt nobody -- except himself and the squirrel xxviii the dark cloud in the crystal when the musical gong sound for luncheon and carman come down from she room at one o'clock she find she guest already in the garden as lovely a garden as angelum have see in she sleep for a minute carman stand on a step of the brick terrace look at the slender figure in white angelum do not hear the faint rustling of muslin she back be half turn to the house and she be watch the aerial architecture of the fountain delicate dome and pinnacle build of crystal carman think reluctantly that mr may look very young in she white frock not more than eighteen or nineteen she wonder if the love pirate enjoy life very much and whether she really care for nick and want to marry he or whether she be only flirt then the profile at which carman have be gloomily gaze turn into a full face angelum smile at mr gaylor you must have hypnotize I she say suddenly i feel i be be look at by some one have you be take a nap too no say she hostess i know i could not go to sleep i be glad if you rest you look very fresh angelum could not conscientiously return the compliment mr gaylor might have be travel for a week instead of one night luncheon be in the pergola where carman and nick have dine together the night he go away the night -- as she express it to herself of late -- when she have lose he angelum have never see a more beautiful place and say so try to make conversation for now that nick be not with they she feel ill at ease with mr gaylor what a garden she exclaim the other night in the yosemite i dream of just such a garden -- and i think at the end of the dream there be a woman in it -- rather like you you must be very happy here yes i be happy enough say carman oh i must not forget to tell you -- nick come back do you hear he automobile no i must have be asleep i think you be besides you room 's on the other side of the house it be beautifully quiet and cool do mr hilliard come to change the plan for this afternoon yes he turn round before get home because he would remember something he have to do at six something important business with the man who have buy he gusher they be to look at another one -- smaller but pretty good -- and see if they want to buy it too a new gusher that be burst out on the land nick keep for he own so he think perhaps we would not mind go over to look at the place a good deal earlier after all in spite of the heat he will not let you be expose to the sun more than he can help i do not mind the heat if you do not say angelum oh as for I i be half spanish you know i be like a salamander nick 'll come back between half-past two and three -- soon after he lunch he might almost as well have stay with we but of course as he be be away from home so long he want to have a look around and be sure that everything 's all right for a stranger to see i do not wonder i tell he we would meet he at the east gate it be a short cut and though it be not much of a walk for we and be in shade over half the way it cut off more than two mile of bad road for he -- road that be just be make i think you would rather like a stroll through the bamboo grove which everybody admire so much the only part of the walk that will be hot be go across a bit of disused pasture land but we 'll take green-lined parasol i have a lot of they about the house for visitor we ought to start by two-thirty and by three-fifteen with the motor we can be come in sight of the lucky star gusher like a huge black geyser you know nick 's land be once part of mine so he place be no distance really i hope you do not dislike walk no indeed i be very fond of it i can easily do ten mile well you will have only a short mile to meet nick and he motor this afternoon i dare say i shall pick up a little by half-past two i think maybe lunch would make I feel better but it do not just the other way i can not eat i have get one of the horrid headache that turn I almost into a lunatic once in a blue moon i be so sorry say angelum have not you better send mr hilliard word that we can not come to-day you know there be most of to-morrow -- oh no carman break in hastily i would not disappoint he for anything in the world a cup of black coffee will do I good but apparently it have no such effect and at two o'clock mr gaylor say that she fear she must not venture out after all in the hot sun if she try she might faint and that would be silly i be so sorry but you 'll have to go alone she finish and when i have have a little rest i 'll come after you in a carriage in time to bring you home that will save nick motoring here and back and give he a chance to keep he engagement at six with those man and no danger of a breakdown with he car he might burst a tire on that stony road you see and be delay those man be important to he angelum be genuinely sympathetic and strove to regret that mr gaylor could not be with she but she could not feel as sorry as she wish to feel there be a spice of danger in be alone with nick danger that he might take up the thread drop in the mariposa forest -- if indeed he really care to take it up that be the question perhaps even if he love she he would not think it best to tell she so under he own roof where she would have to run away from he to escape if she do not choose to listen whether he love she or not it must come to the same in the end but she could not help longing to know the truth the one thing she do already know be that she be deliciously frightened yet glad that she be to see nick 's ranch without mr gaylor at half-past two she start out carman give she explicit direction which she could not mistake because after pass through the bamboo the way be straight as far as that stretch of disused pasture land of which mention have be make you 'll be in shade of the orange-tree till you come to a big gate in a fence carman explain shut it after you please because dog might stray into the garden if you leave it open no cattle graze on that part of the ranch any more they be go to irrigate there and to plant alfalfa the soil 's likely to be so good but i have be weak enough to let gipsy camp on the place once or twice and there might be some there now with they dog and horse for all i know as you go out of the gate you 'll see a kind of track worn in the grass and all you have get to do be to follow it for about three quarter of a mile till you come to a new road that be just be finish when the rest of it be make right motor will not have any trouble between nick 's ranch and mine angelum say that she understand she instruction perfectly and take the green-lined parasol which she hostess have find for she its outer covering be scarlet and it be rather big and heavy angelum make up she mind that she would not use it except for the hottest part of the walk go across the disused pasture land you 'll really be able to come on about five she ask oh yes i shall be a different woman by that time the contralto voice drop oddly and suddenly with these word : a effect of the headache of course and the pallor of the dark face be almost ghastly angelum think that she hostess look very ill you may expect I carmen finish i know mr hilliard would be disappoint if you do not come good-bye till five then good-bye angelum turn away and mrs gaylor who have bring she guest as far as the beginning of the bamboo grove stand watch the white figure flit farther and farther away among the intricate green pillar of the temple then when the elusive form become ghostlike in the distance carman go back to the house she walk slowly and with dignified composure while it be possible that she might be see by some servant but once in she room with the door lock she totter to the bedside and fling herself down on she knee o god -- o god she gasp she face hidden then lift she eye with a look of horror she whisper no not god -- _ devil _ he be the only one i can ever pray to now she eye glaze and stare saw again the white figure pass from sunshine into shadow so it have be in madame vestris 's crystal how soon would the dark cloud blot it out of sight now -- and forever angelum have some difficulty in open the gate that lead from a orange plantation into the disused pasture for the fence be high and strong and the gate apparently not often use as for the pasture it go billow away mile after mile seemingly though at a distance she could see a wire fence a long vanish line and beyond that -- safety shut away by the wire she be glad to think -- a large number of cattle grazing they be so far off that they form be all mass together and they seem very quiet nevertheless she be glad that a wire fence separate they from she for though she be not a coward and would not have stop now if there have be no fence there be something rather terrifying about a great drive of cattle in a lonely place they be much too far off to see my red-covered sunshade she think but even if they do see it and do not like it they would not jump over a fence to get at I i suppose she walk on along the track worn by the passing of foot which have thin and flatten the grass she could not see the new road of which carman have speak but she must reach it sooner or later go this way for the present several low hill like grass-sown wave billow between she and it but by and by perhaps she would hear the teuf-teuf of nick 's motor come along the new road to fetch she and carman would he be glad or sorry when he find that she be alone she hope that he would be glad but mr gaylor be so beautiful that it be hard to be sure suddenly just as she reach the top of one of the billow hill and catch sight of a rough road about half a mile away she start at a sharp sound like a shot it seem to come from the direction of the cattle and she turn to look toward they vaguely disturb as she look she unformed fear turn to keen and definite terror the shot whether or no it have strike one of they number have in a instant stir the drive in panic they comfortable peace be break horn toss dark form rear and hoof descend on shine back a bull bellow wildly other follow suit there be a dreadful roaring and a rush of hoof that sound in angelum 's horrified ear like the beginning of a earthquake the whole troop hundred of horned head and humpy back mass and seethe together it be as if a irresistible force from behind impel they all forward in a pack she stand still and watch the black wave of cattle fascinate appal she heart beat thickly no they could not stop now nothing could stop they except some great obstacle which they could not pass and when they come to that obstacle many would be kill by other ' trample hoof they would fall and die and they brother would beat they down not know blind and mad and merciless it be a stampede she have read of such thing happen among wild cattle in the west poor creature poor stupid brute how sorry how sickeningly sorry she be for they who could have fire the shot and why man on horse be in sight now -- two she think -- no three gallop fast but far behind the drive they could do no good only the fence would stop the rush she tell herself through the pounding of she heart then -- then -- it be as if a loud voice cry the question in she ear -- _ would the fence stop it _ if not -- may god help I she hear herself say for a instant she stare at the oncoming black wave which sweep on faster and faster toward she so incredibly terribly fast now that in another second she know they would break down the line of wire fence the cattle those that be not trample to death would soon pour through the gap would sweep on and on overwhelming this hill where she stand strange some line of a poem be say themselves in angelum 's head she have read they lately since she come to america the story of a stampede and a girl laska -- yes that be the name -- love a man and save he from the rush of wild cattle by cover he body with hers protect it with she bleeding flesh from the blow of the iron hoof nick have give she the book she have be in a train when she read the story of laska she see herself sit safely and cosily in a stateroom all panelled satinwood and green velvet now -- blindly she start to run it be useless she know for the fence be certain to go and she could no more outrun that black billow of death than she could outrace one of paolo di sereno 's aeroplane yet instinct make she run toward the far-off road away from the plunge bellow cattle she think of hilliard and how he would hate to hear of the death she have die he would give he life for hers as laska have give she life for she lover xxix the parting of the way just as nick be finish a somewhat hurry and sketchy luncheon a telegram be hand to he it be from max wisler the san francisco detective and it say laconically do not let a m visit c g as nick read the blood rush to he forehead and he spring to he foot knock over the chair in which he have be sit max wisler have not be tell by he that mr may be to visit mr gaylor but that must be what he mean it have not occur to nick that it could be necessary to mention angelum 's brief stay in tell wisler that he himself be run up to lucky star the detective must have find out in some ferret way of he own and he have telegraph do not let a m visit c g what could be he reason then suddenly a dreadful explanation flash into nick 's head flash there and stay as if print in letter of blood on he brain wisler have be right after all he have find out who send the box of poison oak those hateful question of he so much resent have be justified there could be no other explanation nothing else could excuse this warn it seem too hideous to be true that wisler have telegraph because there be danger for angelum and yet -- nick do not wait to finish out the sentence in he mind the japanese servant who be cook and valet and chamberman have bring the telegram and the last luncheon dish at the same time now he be provide billy the chauffeur with something to eat but nick do not wait or even think about billy the engagement with mr gaylor and angelum be for five o'clock but that make no difference to nick with the telegram in he hand know what he know -- for he do know now as if he have see all wisler 's proof -- he would not trust angelum alone with carman for a single hour he be go this instant to snatch she away with no matter what excuse he would think of something to satisfy angelum for she must not find out the truth if he could help it -- anyhow not while she be under carman 's roof it would shock and distress she too much the principal thing be to get she out of the place quickly and quietly as for carman -- he could not decide yet how he should deal with carman loyal as he be by nature and as he have show himself to wisler modest as to he own desert and slow to fancy himself value by any woman he could not now help see as wisler have see the one motive which could have tempt carman gaylor to send angelum may a box of poison-oak many little thing come back in a flood of disturbing memory thing to which nick have attach no importance at the time or have misunderstand owe to he humility where woman be concerned and he chivalrous almost exaggerated respect for he employer 's wife and widow -- the generous disinterested friend that he have think she what a fool -- what a double-dyed fool he anathematize himself as he get the motor ready to start while billy still eat apple-pie and cream on the kitchen veranda in spite of wisler 's catechism he have let angelum accept carman 's invitation have even urge she to accept if anything hideous happen it would be he fault but no surely nothing would happen it be too bad to be true if carman have commit the crime of send the poison-oak it must have be in a fit of madness after hear thing -- stupid thing -- from miss dene by this time she must have repent she could not be a woman and harm a guest -- such a guest as angelum may and in she own house and yet it be odd -- he have dimly think it odd even in he ignorance -- that carman should have follow they out to the big tree from wawona there to make a dead set at mr may she have say that she choice of the yosemite for rest and change of air be a coincidence that she have not know he be in the neighborhood until she hear the news at wawona but suddenly nick cease to believe that story she have go because he be there -- with angelum may as he think these thing he be start the car get into the car drive the car away from the house to the gaylor ranch there be no bad patch of road that be a invention of carman 's for the plausibility of the plan she have sketch out to angela the road have be finish month ago and nick fly along it in the bright angel at a pace which might have get he into trouble with the police if there have be any police to spy upon he the way run through disused pasture land which be to be irrigated enriched and grow with alfalfa and at a turn in the road he come upon a sight which flash to he eye like a spurt of vitriol he see the wild cattle break through the fence -- the new bunch which carman have just get from arizona he see they struggle and trample each other down and sweep through the gap like a wave through a broken dyke he see a figure in white run toward he and know it be angelum may -- know that she must die unless he could be in time to save she nick turn the car and send it leap off the road to bind over the rough hummock billow under the heat-baked grass he look like a dead man with only he eye and hand -- he strong firm hand -- alive the motor rock on the green wave as if in a stormy sea and groan like a wounded bull -- one of those who have die there at the broken fence with they heart ' blood in they mouth it be almost on she now -- the wild black wave -- with death in its wake and death in its gift but he reach she first and lean out while the car swerve -- as many a time he have lean from he gallop bronco in cowboy day to pick up a hat or a handkerchief -- he catch angelum up beside he then with a twist of the steering-wheel he give the bright angel a half-turn that send she fly along in front of the cattle almost underneath the toss horn and plunge hoof thus he shoot past the surge line of they since he could not turn round sharply to run before the wave without risk of upset as the automobile dash past the cattle surge on irresistibly but nick and angelum in the car be beyond the reach of hoof and horn three mount cowboy see the race win and yell a wild yell of triumph but they duty be to the cattle they go about they business know that the car be safe and nick neither see the man nor consciously hear they shout angelum be half faint hold she up he steer as he could slow down now lest the jump spring of the car should break he drive away from not toward mr gaylor 's house he would not take angelum back to carmen even for a moment yet as she be alone and swoon she could not go to he house he catch at the idea of a quick run into bakersfield in search of a doctor but when he see at last that angelum be slowly come to herself draw deep sob breath she eyelash tremble on wet cheek he ease the car down on a quiet stretch of road under the shade of young walnut-tree and oak there he stop for a while in the cool tree shadow you be safe precious one safe he whisper as he might have soothe a child there be nothing to be afraid of now angelum open she eye and look at he through she lash as she have never look before i -- thought of you then she murmur i thought of you -- i want you just when i expect to die she eye she voice she word break down the last barrier that hold he back and he would have be more or less than man if he have not pour out in a torrent all he love and worship in a flood of word darling -- heart 's dearest -- do you think i would have let you die so i must have feel -- i must have hear you call I it have to be i would feel a thought of yours across the world he stammer if i be in my grave and you want I my spirit would come back into my body to serve you how i love you love you dear it can not be that such love can leave you cold i be not of you world but come down to mine or help I to come into yours give I a little love just a little love and i 'll give you my soul do not -- oh do not falter angelum she raise she head from he arm and sit up lean away from he i know i be a wretch he say i ought to be shoot for speaking of myself when you be all break to piece the word come i have be keep they back day by day but that be no excuse forgive I no -- you must not use the word forgive -- when you have just save my life it be only this -- i can not let you go on not now i know but some time -- no not ever do not think i could not care for you it be not that i could i -- but i _ must not _ care it be all impossible i ought to have tell you long ago the only thing be to forget -- for we both oh if i could have keep you for my friend but i feel now that be impossible too after this we can not be friend can we no we can not be friend he echo very pale suddenly weary and almost break by the strain he have endure but be you sure -- sure the more i care the more sure oh nick my dear my dear i wish you have let I die he look at she strangely and very sadly after he first start and stiffening of the muscle would that have be better than care for I he ask in a voice so low that she could just catch the word yes it would have be much better she answer cover she face with she hand to hide the tear that burn she eye she be too weak for the explanation she would have give at sunset among the redwood this be no time and she be in no state for explanation she could only feel and hide from he what she feel or part of it for if he but half guess how she love he and want he love she would be in he arm he lip on hers there be no thought in she mind how terribly he might be misunderstand he lip be white very well he say it be better for I that you have be frank all the same and all the more i want you to forgive I for speak at a time like this i will not offend you again only i do not take back anything so now you know do not try to talk and i will not talk much to you i do not think i could if i would i be go to drive you to bakersfield but shall i take you to a kind old doctor i know who can give you something to pick you up or would you rather i would drop you at a hotel for -- i can not explain so please do not ask -- but i must not let you go to mr gaylor 's again there be a good reason why maybe you 'll know some time but i do not believe it can ever be from I i 'll fetch you maid and you baggage when you be settle somewhere and if you be strong enough the best thing will be to start for san francisco to-night when you be there see mr morehouse and let he take good care of you for it be true as you say you and i can not go on be friend angelum open she lip to answer he but could not he start the car once more and drive on faster i 'll go to a hotel thank you not to a doctor she say when she could speak \* \* \* \* \* soon the news of the stampede among the new bunch of steer from arizona find its way to the house and carman be tell what have happen the rush of the cattle have be stop by the time she hear of it but only at the brink of the big irrigation canal two fence have be break down and a good many animal kill other have have to be shoot anybody hurt carman ask in a queer dry voice she seem to take little interest in the fate of the new cattle though they have be a costly purchase so far as be know nobody have be hurt but it be too soon to be sure yet and there be no one who could tell up to that moment how the stampede have be start but some of the boy talk about a gun go off mysteriously and a lady have be see in the disused pasture the boy have see she running and afterward be catch up by a man in a big yellow motor what man they be not sure -- they would be go too fast and be too far off -- but he be like nick hilliard and it be then that simeon harp come on to the terrace where carman be stand to hear the story see he face she know that thing have go utterly wrong and that all hope be lose nick will know what i do she tell herself as the death-stab of failure strike she in the heart maybe he know already if that woman have tell he how i send she out alone and how i lie about he plan be change and the man he have to meet then he must guess they be sure to compare note and he 'll suspect about the poison-oak the ice of despair be a frozen dagger in she breast even before the chance come for a talk with simeon harp she make up she mind what to do it would be a cruel wrench but there be nothing else she could not face nick 's look of loathing even though gratitude for the past should close he lip upon he knowledge and upon he secret thought of she to go away far away this very hour before he could come would be a confession of guilt and of utter defeat but to carmen crushed and hopeless and ashamed it be the only thing to do she would go and never come back she would live in the east or better still in europe and sell the hateful ranch she have receive many tempting offer since she husband 's death and through she lawyer she would accept one that be still open life here would be too hateful with nick for a silent enemy nick marry by and by perhaps to the other woman the excitement of she decision keep carman from a physical collapse quickly if a little confusedly she think out a plan there would of course be a question of insurance for the dead and injured cattle she say to the elderly foreman who have take nick 's place on the ranch she would go to san francisco at once no use to point out that it be unnecessary she wish to go that be enough and she give direction to every one what be to be do in she absence for she might be away some day she would not take she maid she prefer to travel alone and when some question be ask later by one of the house servant about the guest mr may carmen answer : she have be suddenly call away from here by telegram i do not think she 'll be come back to the house there 'll be a message for that irish girl of hers by and by i expect anyhow i can not trouble about they now they affair must take care of themselves mariette carman 's french maid hurriedly and sulkily pack enough thing to last she mistress for a week and by the time the trunk and bag be ready the carriage be wait to take mr gaylor into bakersfield everybody know that no train would leave kern for san francisco until night but the imperious lady be in no mood to receive extraneous information she have say something about see a lawyer in bakersfield if she choose to waste hour there it be she business not that of the household but drive to the town carman decide not to go to san francisco by that night 's train she have have time to reflect a little not only upon what have happen but upon what be likely to happen if angelum may suspect the truth -- and carman 's conscience tell she that this be more than probable -- she would not go back to the ranch nick would not let she go there even if she wish it he would send for or fetch the irish maid and the luggage while mr may -- already engage to marry he perhaps -- wait at he place or at a bakersfield hotel in any case it be almost certain that the woman -lrb- as carman call angelum always in she mind -rrb- would travel to san francisco that night and it seem likely to mr gaylor that nick would go with she and the maid carman could not risk a encounter in the train arrive at bakersfield fortunately without meeting nick in he motor she hire a large automobile and at the hour when hilliard be be inform that mr gaylor have go away for a few day on business which have come up suddenly she be travel swiftly by road to san francisco the car she have engage be a powerful tour automobile with side-curtain of canvas and these she order to be keep down for she have some wild fear that nick might discover she plan try to follow and find she during she journey necessarily much longer by motor than by train always by daylight she be peep out nervously from under she thick veil but the bright angel never flash into sight she know at last that it would not come that nick do not mean to follow that she would not see he again this side the grave for she do not intend ever to return to the gaylor ranch where she would live she do not know yet though she think vaguely of some great city in europe -- pari perhaps where there would be plenty of excitement which might help she to forget meanwhile the thing be to get away -- away not only from californium but even from america -- as quickly as possible it hardly matter how for luckily -- the one piece of luck she have leave -- there be plenty of money and the ranch could take care of itself the day carman reach san francisco a ship happen to be sail for japan she be able to engage a cabin and go on board almost at the last moment among other who arrive very late be a bent old man with a worn face which have once be handsome carman do not see he till the third day out then from the deck sacred to second-class passenger a pair of dark blue red-rimmed eye look up at she as she lean listlessly on the rail gaze down madame vestris have see in the crystal a man standing beside she a man in shadow after all it be not nick hilliard but simeon harp xxx the making of a gentleman one evening when July be begin nick hilliard sit on the veranda of he plain little house which he have grow to love swing back and forth in a big rocking-chair he smoke a pipe and think very hard as he think and smoke he look dreamily at a young owl in a big cage the owl he have send home from paso robles if he have be think about it he could have see dark against the pale fire of the desert sky the source of he fortune the great gusher throw up its black spout of oil like ton upon ton of coal for the famous lucky star oil supply show no sign yet of give out though it have be play like a huge geyser for many month and already since its mysterious birth many younger brother have be bear small and insignificant comparatively but money-maker if nick 's thought have not draw down a curtain in front of he eye he must have see across a blue lake and a black desert create by a rain of oil a forest of derrick like a scattered group of burnt fir-tree with low-hung bare branch but instead of these he mind 's eye see a new road shaded by walnut and oak that march in long straight line between rough pasture and irrigated land he see in the tree-shadow a yellow motor-car draw up by the side of the road and in it a beautiful pale girl hatless with disorder golden hair and a tear white dress he see a man with the girl and hear she say that it would have be better to die than let herself care for he yet she _ do _ care for I nick tell himself obstinately there be no get over that she say ` you must not think i do not care ' and even if she have not say it there be that look in she eye could he ever forget the look or cease to thrill at the memory no he know that he could not till the hour of he death it be because i be not of she world that she could not bear to let herself go and love I as she be begin to love I i know he think as he have think countless time before in the week since he have quietly let she go out of he life i be not what she be be bring up to call a gentleman he mind go on drearily preach to he i suppose i can not realize the bigness and deepness of the gulf between we as she see it i have only my own standard to judge by hers be mighty different i know there _ be _ a gulf but i hope love would bridge it she think no bridge could be strong enough for she to walk on to I i wonder if she think the same yet or if the feeling i have sometimes that she be call to I from far off mean anything i tell she that day i would feel she thinking of I across the world well -- what if she be thinking of I now nick have often debate this subject and look at it from every point of view for after the first blow over the heart a dim scarcely perceptible light of hope have come creep back to he know from she word and better still from she eye that angelum have care a little at least enough to suffer nick have wonder whether he might not make himself more acceptable to she than he have be he do not disparage himself with undue humility in ask this question he know that he be a man and that honor and strength and cleanness of live count for something in this world but if he could become more like the man she know -- in other word a gentleman fit to mate with a great lady -- what then for nick be aware that he manners be not polish in what mr may would call society no doubt he would be guilty of a thousand mistake a thousand awkwardness if he do anything rightly it would be by instinct -- instinct implant by generation of he father 's well-born well-bred ancestor -- rather than from knowledge of what be conventionally the proper thing if angelum have let love win perhaps she might often have be humiliate by he ignorance and stupidity nick remind himself and for he that would have be worse than death even as for she accord to she admission it would have be worse than death to go on care for he perhaps she have be wise maybe he be impossible but if ever she suffer a moment 's regret now that they be part and if he could yet find a way of happiness for both better than cold wisdom be there no hope it be of a way to reach she that he be think to-night and abruptly the big chair cease to swing and creak i 'll go and see that chap they call the dook nick mumble on a sudden resolution and knock out the ash from he pipe a minute later he be stroll through the hot purple twilight toward lucky star city one of the queerest little town on earth it have not however the remotest conception that it be queer on the contrary it think itself a gay and pleasant place singularly up-to-date and lack nothing except water which be now worth a good deal more than the fortune-giving oil of which it have too much the rough mostly unpainted wooden house shop and hotel compose lucky star city be so near the great oil gusher which account for the town 's existence that the front rank of frame building be pepper all over with a jetty spray this disfigurement have come when the gusher be at its highest and its black blowing spume have be bear by the wind for long distance the earth seem to have go into mourning and to be spread with a pall almost as far as the boundary of the ranch which nick have retain for himself yet there be a strong dividing-line he have keep some pasture land for he love cattle but he great pleasure have be in irrigation and literally he have make the desert blossom as a rose even the smell be different when he turn he back upon he own fragrant alfalfa field and draw in breath laden with the fume of crude petroleum but he be use to the scent of oil and hardly notice it he skirt round the desert lake and steer clear of another lesser lake form entirely of petroleum from the great gusher by day its greasy blackness glare in hideous contrast to the blue though brackish water but now night lend its ugliness a strange disguise all the faint twilight that remain glimmer on the gloss of its surface like phosphorus in the palm of a negro 's hand and as nick pass on toward the town star shine out in its dark mirror he could hear the thick splash of the gusher that rise and fall like the beating of a giant 's heart and from the brightly light town sound of laughter and fiddling come to he lucky star city have no suburb the whole place have grow up in less than a year and in fact such building as have exist for six month be know as old there be but one street though a few ambitious landowner have run up house in garden at a short but haughty distance from the business part and at night the town be see at its best the three two-storeyed verandaed hotel -- one paint white another green the third and noisiest not paint at all -- blaze with light the drug store the jewellery store -lrb- for there be a jewellery store and a prosperous one -rrb- the grocery store -- combine a large trade in candy -- the post office and the dry-goods store -- where two extreme be make to meet with a display of hat and shoe in the same window -- be every one open and crowded man in shirt-sleeve and man in khaki man of almost all condition and nation sit or lounge on the hotel veranda make music or listen to it swap story and yell with laughter away in the distance at one end of the long street -- which have no pavement but yellow sand -- there be a shooting gallery and every second or two be mark off with a shot or a shout of applause or derision at the other end equally far away from the populous center of shop be a variety theater a mere shanty run up in a day and as nick take he way toward the green-painted hotel he could hear the shrill squalling of a woman 's untrained voice shriek out the latest comic song hello nick how go thing high-pockets friendly voice salute hilliard as he march through the cigarette-strewn sand and he have a laughing word for each one everybody who be anybody have a nickname at lucky star city and hilliard be rather please with high-pocket -- bestow upon he because of he height and he long straight leg the dook be the sobriquet of the person he have come to see and it be by this name that nick inquire for he

line into my pocket that be to say if you give he a job he can stick to he bunk and he grub in my hotel mr green be just about to round off he ultimatum with a spurt of tobacco-juice aim at a pass cat when he check himself hastily at sight of a woman what become of the tobacco-juice be a mystery or a conjure trick but the cat 's somewhat blunt sensibility and the lady 's -- not yet blunt -- be spare who be that nick inquire in a low respectful voice when green have touch the place where he hat would have be if he have have it on and the young woman bow with stiff politeness have go by what do not you know the landlord of the eureka hotel reply with a question but i forget you be not show up around here much since you blow would hack from the east the feller say noo york 's kinder get

the golden west right you be say nick all the same i do not know who the lady be and i be sure i never see she here though i have a sort of feelin ' i remember she face meet in another world mebbe green chuckle she be not no great looker though more 's the pity for we young spark that could do with a noo beauty at lucky star she be no chicken either and she face be the kind of face that to see once be to forget twice accordin ' to you friend the dook who be great on what he call epergram when he be feelin ' well oh be he nick 's hopeful expression lose some of its glow for this trait of the dook 's do not strike he as attractive he be not my friend yet but you have not tell I who the lady be maybe she name will shake up my recollection box for i have see she somewhere sure she be miss sara wilkin the new school-teacher green reply glad to impart information she be import from the fur east while you be away call on in a hurry to take the place of mr pear who die on we right in the midst of the last term poor critter she have no way with youngster mr pear have not though she come recommend as a treasure : so p ` rap it be just as well for we we treasure 's lay up in heaven we have get a surprisin ' lot of child in this city for such a young one but we man be doin ' that well they feel justified in sendin ' fur they family we be gettin ' a mighty nice society : some o ' we lady from the east as far off as omaha and 'twa the minister 's wife stand out for this miss wilkin a old school-fellow o ' hern pity she be not handsome as we can not boast but two other unmarried gal in we set nick reflect where have he see that small-featured conscientious little face he seem to associate it with some agreeable and not very distant episode yet its intelligent insignificance be so overshadow by the pleasantness of the episode itself that he now try in vain to identify it with a searchlight of recognition i give up he say to himself discontentedly maybe it 'll come to I later and then suddenly it do the new school-teacher at lucky star city be the little woman who have arrive with the native daughter at the santa barbara hotel and would have be swamp by they have not angela take pity on she no wonder it have be a effort to label he impression for no woman have a face worth the name of face for nick when angelum 's be to be see but perhaps miss wilkin have not have the same difficulty in disentangle he from among she impression of the past for she have flash upon he a glance bright with interest before cast down she eye decorously and pass on here come the dook now remark the landlord of the eureka by the look of he i guess he country-man would not part with anything ` cept a drink if he keep clear of the liquor belt as a general thing it be only because he fee-nan-shel situation do not run to it i 'll introduce you a man approach wear a shambling air of discouragement until he see that he be under observation whereupon he muscle tighten and he pull himself together straighten he narrow shoulder and throw back he small head mr nickson hilliard this be mr montagu jerrold _ alias _ the dook a blarsted britisher announce green affably dook this be mr nickson hilliard who want to meet you the lord know why late owner of lucky star gusher and the whitest man and the biggest man we have get in this section he other name be high-pockets as i guess you hev hear and it might be full-pockets too wuthout steerin ' wide o ' the mark nick put out he hand to the newcomer who have a haughty beak of a nose little forehead and less chin wretched bit of flotsam and jetsam on the sand of life one keen look into he self-satisfied light eye be enough to learn the secret of he failure failure which go where he would seek as he might could never be turn into success nick 's heart pity the man while it shut involuntarily against he montagu jerrold crooked he elbow and lift the brown strong hand of high-pocket to a level with he own weak chin before he deign to shake it he do so then with a air and a drawl how d' y ' do which be the most english thing that nick have ever meet with off the stage little brute i would like to kick he if he be not such a duffer be nick 's reluctant thought for he have want to be favourably impress by the dook if this be really anything like a english duke give _ he _ a crossing-sweeper but he must not be too hasty in he generalization he be unhappily sure that mr may 's position in she far-off world -lrb- world for which he be deem unworthy -rrb- associate she with duke earl baron count and all sort of title anachronism of every nation repulsive as this draggled specimen appear it might know something worth he nick hilliard 's while to learn and he be not go to give up because of first impression he have not meet montagu jerrold before but have hear of he often during the last three or four month since the englishman blow into lucky star city he be a boaster as well as a waster no doubt for accord to himself he know everybody at home from the king down the whole gamut of the british peerage also he claim to be a oxford man and it be that which in this emergency have focus nick 's attention upon he the landlord aware that nick have a proposition to make excuse himself when he have bring off the introduction and the two man be leave more or less alone at they end of the hotel veranda nevertheless so complicated be the nature of nick 's business that he wish for greater privacy and he suggest a stroll in the direction of the gusher you be a oxford graduate be not you he begin ya-as i go up to oxford from eton drawl jerrold with a accent which nick dislike but be ready to believe in as well-bred because few englishman to the manner bear have happen to come he way all the elder son of my family since the day of charle the second do not you know have go in for the army and that be what i should have like but my eldest brother have the money as well as the title d'you see and i be only third son i -- yes say nick curtly but you must not worry to tell I all you private affair unless you really want to because what i be most interested in be the oxford part i never go to college nor to any school for the matter of that except a night one but i have try to make up a bit with read all i could i suppose i do not know much about book compare with you -- oh i be never much of a grind the other cut in hastily i go in for other thing i be cox -- it be etiquette i be think of nick confess humbly you would be bear knowin ' a lot about that i dare say in you family and then be at oxford too i always notice college man have a different way from those who have not be to any university it be hard to explain the difference but it be there oh rather agree the englishman you know we king himself will send all he son to oxford and cambridge nothin ' like it my dear fellow what we family -- could you give lesson sort of object-lesson in what to do and what not do in society inquire nick eager yet shy not ashamed of he motive in ask but fearful by instinct that he be not get hold of the right man nothing easier return montagu jerrold the prominent gooseberry which be he eye look somewhat less thoroughly boil i be thinkin ' of leavin ' this beastly hole do not you know nothin ' in it for a gentleman what but if you have somethin' to offer worth takin ' why i might stick it out for a bit i dessay nick long to box the ' creature 's ear but they be well-shaped and might be the ear of a man bear with etiquette flow with he blue blood through azure vein the shape of he nose be not bad but those eye and that chin they be as nick grimly express it to himself the _ limit _ nevertheless he would persevere and try a course of lesson from the dook they begin to discuss term and nick do not bargain mr jerrold be to have a advance payment of twenty-five dollar on account of fifty for ten lesson and he be to come to nick 's house every evening to supper at half-past seven remain until half-past nine hilliard be to be watch through the meal and correct if he do anything wrong with he knife and fork or he bread and they be to have conversation and discussion cover various imagine emergency detail be arrange much to the satisfaction of montagu jerrold whose real name be herbert higgin and who have be a house decorator employ -- and discharge -- by a small london firm never have he be inside a oxford college : never have he see the king -- except on a post card he return joyously to he hotel where as mr green be lie in wait he have to part with most of he advance and nick tramp home tear in mind fear instinctively that he be about to jump from the frying-pan of ignorance into a fire of vulgarity at which angelum would shudder every night for a week the dook appear promptly in time for nick 's substantial supper which by the way he advise he host to transform into dinner you simply can not have ` supper ' at half-past seven my deah fellow it be not _ do _ dinner should be at eight at earliest we royalty prefer it at nine if you have supper it be after the theater or opera do not you know but when nick stolidly refuse to be such a affected donkey as to call he evening meal by another name to make it sweeter mr jerrold do not scorn the meal because it lack refinement on the seventh night however hilliard give he noble instructor notice i be real sorry he remark pleasantly but i can not help it i would rather go on as i be and pin myself to a prickly pear than shine in society by do any of these monkey trick you have be tryin ' to put I on to you say they be ` the thing ' and the newest dope and all that and maybe they be real nice for you sort but i tell you they be not for mine it seem to I you know a wonderful lot of fool thing that be not so and i can not yoke up with 'em what be more i do not mean to and now i see they be the only card you have get in you hand i do not want any more deal out to I -- hook up my little finger when i come to grip with a coffee-cup no thank you i _ see _ myself doin ' it or any other of the pussy-catism you have be tryin ' to unload on I and you drop you ` g 's ' just as bad as i do no you 'll have to switch off doc and after to-night you can go you way and i 'll go mine for there be nothin ' doin ' here for you except this little roll of bill good night bud that be all the trump in the game but the bill -- which be the trump for jerrold -- amount to fifty dollar more than he have be promise for the whole course of lesson so he have not do badly after all and leave lucky star city which have no oil nor milk of human kindness for he he drift on somewhere else as he will continue to drift until he stumble into a ignominious grave but nick be angry and thwart -- angry with himself because he have be a fool and thwart because he remain as before handicap by he own ignorance in spite of jerrold 's boast nick 's instinct have tell he after the first word exchange that the man be not only a cad but a rank pretender still in he desire for social knowledge he have refuse at first to listen to the voice of instinct and have be punish for obtuseness the very think of the little drawling outsider who have delight in he sobriquet of the dook make hilliard feel sick and he open wide all the window and door when the contemptible creature go out of the house want to turn I into a dry-goods clerk do he nick grumble and the episode be close one afternoon not many day after the expulsion of montagu jerrold nick keep a long-made promise by go to call on the wife of the presbyterian minister the only professional purveyor of religion who have yet settle in lucky star city mr kenealy be out but be come back soon and nick be urge by she small daughter to wait this he consent to do and find the school-teacher also wait in the pleasant little living-room the young man and woman be introduce by the child who then relieve of responsibility leave they to each other 's mercy and fly to a friend with whom she have be play doll on the back porch i do not suppose you remember I say miss sara wilkin rather wistfully but i remember you very well so do i you nick be glad to reply with truth and he heart warm to the wisp of a woman to whom miss dene have be catty and mr may kind it be at santa barbara why you _ do _ remember she exclaim delightedly i never think you would i always think there be nothing about I that any one _ could _ recollect oh would you mind tell I how that lovely lady be who be so good to I i often think about she she be the most beautiful thing i ever see in my life nick could have kiss she hand -- little thin hand -- kiss they even in they gray lisle-thread glove needless to say however he do nothing of the sort he answer quietly that it be now some time since he have see mr may but he suppose she be well and still in californium probably in san francisco she be plan to build a house near monterey though he voice and manner be particularly calm he eye be as wistful perhaps as the school-teacher 's smile have be and just because sara wilkin know well what it be to be wistful and try to hide it perhaps she see more clearly than a more attractive woman would something have happen she say to herself that splendid young couple about whom she have build up such a gorgeous romance have be part and this handsome fellow with the kind smile and heroic shoulder be unhappy far unhappier than sara wilkin have ever be strange as that might seem -- he who have look so fortunate sara wonder if the lovely lady be unhappy too or if she have be cruel and because miss wilkin adore romance -lrb- have nothing more personally she own to adore -rrb- not because she be naturally curious the little woman positively ache to know the story they have nearly half a hour together she and nick before mr kenealy return and in that time they have come close to the beginning of a friendship each be secretly in need of sympathy and dimly detect the need in the other they liking for one another enchanted mr kenealy who be a bear matchmaker to be sure miss sara wilkin be not pretty and would never see twenty-nine again but she be a good girl clever and affectionate and would make nick hilliard the best of wife if only he could be bring to see it she sit between they chattily tell each one nice thing about the other and soon she suggest bring miss wilkin to visit nick 's ranch school be off now and the poor dear have nothing to do but read and write letter home whither it cost far too much to return for only a few week nick say that he would be delighted and offer to send miss wilkin as many book as she like to she board house book be great friend of he he admit somewhat shyly she be welcome to borrow any she care to have they see a good deal of each other during the next fortnight too much for the school-teacher 's peace of mind for the oftener they meet the more be she convince that nick be in love perhaps hopelessly in love with another woman as different from herself as a lily from a dusty sprig of lavender then one day when nick have start to carry she some book and they have meet on the way the two sit down and talk by the side of the blue brackish lake shelter from the sun behind a bank of yellow sand that be like the high back of a queerly shaped throne at a distance pass green the landlord of the eureka out walk with he little daughter and in speaking of he and the odd folk who stop at the green hotel the dook be mention he have disappear from lucky star city some time before but miss wilkin have meet and dislike he horrid little pretentious toad she exclaim sharply he be always talk to every one he could get hold of about he family and he swell friend and oxford but i do not believe any of he story he be just worse than nobody at all and east i have meet real nice englishman who have a _ lovely _ accent and would not be find dead drawl like he do nick laugh you be jolly right he say and then be in a humorous as well as confidential mood he tell the story of himself and montagu jerrold be not i a johnny he ask at the end serve I right for try to make a silk purse of myself can not be do i guess but you be a silk purse sara protest indignantly how can you talk about yourself the way you do i be a little down on my luck these day he answer do you ever read about the moth who love a star i guess when that moth get to thinking of himself and he chance he see himself pretty well as he really be poor old chap fusty brown wing too many leg antennae the wrong shape and a clumsy way of usin ' 'em i have go and make a moth of myself miss wilkin maybe the star do not think you a moth or anyhow not a common moth the little school-teacher try to comfort he loyally though she heart ache as a lonely woman 's heart must ache when the man she could have love if she have dare confide in she about the other she have know quite well that there be another but to have the confession come out in word seem to make she feel the grayness of life rather more intensely than she have feel it before yet she rally she force and long to fight nick hilliard 's battle and wave he banner in the face of the enemy -- if enemy there be that be just what the star do think laugh nick she think i be common miss wilkin stiffen with indignation i do not believe it -- if she be a _ real _ star and you would not mistake a imitation one for real would you she be the brightest star in the heaven as good as a whole constellation then she can not think you common well put in another way she think I ` impossible ' -- impossible for she that be she tell I so but i might have know it without tell i guess she think i would know i have the cheek to hope though that i might polish myself up enough to pass muster in a crowd even a crowd of _ she _ sort of people and that she might change she mind about I as if that disgust little montagu jerrold could teach you anything i find he could not not anything she have like I better for know if she do not find you good enough as you be she be not worth loving insist the school-teacher oh i know i be not the same kind of woman she be i be only a little ` provincial ' as i expect she would call I in she own mind but -- but i can tell a _ man _ when i see he thank you a whole lot for stick up for I say nick boyishly but how do you know what kind of a woman my star be miss wilkin blush and be silent she do not look pretty when she blush like angelum but nick think she have one of the nicest little face in the world i expect i have go and give myself away he say well i do not care for you be so good and sympathetic you have see my star and you can judge just what kind of a blame fool i be to hope she could ever really care for a rough fellow like I -- care enough to be yoke up with I for life be you sure she do not care ask the school-teacher if he have give himself away he do not intend to give away angelum i tell you she say i be impossible he answer discreetly well thank you again for listenin ' to my whining it be do I a lot of good now i have talk enough and too much about myself let 's talk about you there be nothing interesting to say about I miss wilkin defend herself with the faintest sigh that only a man who love she would have hear we will not talk about you any more though if you do not want to that book of mr muir 's you send I be beautiful i have be wish to read it for year so they fall to discuss _ the national park of america _ but sara 's heart be not in the discussion much as she admire the book she be think about nick and angelum it do not seem she tell herself that a woman who could be so kind to another woman as she be to I when she do not even know I could be cruel to a man she _ do _ know and like even if she do not love he and could a woman he love not love he back again miss wilkin have resign herself long ago or think she have to go through life without any intimate personal interest of she own and when she heart ache hardest that night in she mean little boarding-house bedroom it be go out most warmly toward nick and yearning for the happiness of make he happy if i could only do something she say to she mossy-smelling pillow and i owe _ she _ a good turn too although maybe she do not deserve it i wonder what i _ could _ do xxxi the breaking of the spell the spell be break for angelum she know now if she have not know before that it be nick hilliard who light the world for she with the light never see on land or sea where love be not some quality be go from the sunshine and the glory of the golden poppy have wither back in san francisco living in the room which he have help to make beautiful with daily gift of flower she realize how completely nick have mean for she the spirit of the west it be because he have be with she that from morning till night she have thrill with the joy of life and excited anticipation of each new day which have never fail or let she tire every moment she miss he and want he and would have give anything to call he back to she but she have no right to call for what have she to give worth he pain in come angelum be a anxiety to kate and a responsibility to mr morehouse the banker would have like to send he friend to call upon mr may but she be in no mood to meet people then he suggest that she should go to del monte for the summer and watch the beginning of the new home but she dismiss this idea say that as the architect have not yet even finish he plan it would be a long time before the house could reach a interesting stage we all go somewhere in summer mr morehouse urge whereupon angelum merely shrug she shoulder you who live here may want a change she say i have have plenty of change i be very happy where i be thanks but she do not look happy and kate who love she realize the alteration far more keenly than mr morehouse though even he feel vaguely that something have go wrong with the princess di sereno kate who know well what a difference happiness could make in a woman 's health and look guess that the loss of she mistress 's color and spirit be connect with the disappearance of hilliard a paragraph she have read in that exciting number of the _ illustrate london news _ have together with some vague hint unconsciously drop by angelum and a few word of the banker 's overheard set kate 's wit to work and thus she arrive through sympathy at something like the truth but mr morehouse 's diagnosis of the case have in it no such romantic ingredient as hopeless love he alone in america -lrb- since theo dene be go and kate merely suspect -rrb- know that mr may be the princess di sereno who have never be a wife to paolo di sereno except in name he know that the princess have grievance and that she have leave she identity in the old world in the wish to forget the past completely know this when a certain piece of news come he way he feel it he disagreeable duty to pass it on to mr may and it be the very piece of news which have set theo dene wonder whether angelum know about the prince most california journal be apt to give local matter of interest precedence over affair at a distance and so it be that -lrb- though angelum usually glance through a newspaper every day or two during she travels -rrb- she have never come upon paolo di sereno 's name except in that old copy of the _ illustrate london news _ there she learn how well he be amusing himself while mr may see californium under nick hilliard 's guidance but after that come a blank she know only that he and a somewhat notorious woman be make ascent together in a aeroplane but it remain for mr morehouse to tell she of the sensation the pair be create in europe there be a woman -- indeed there be invariably a woman though not always the same -- whose flaunt friendship with the prince have fix angelum 's resolve to turn she back on the old life the woman have begin a career on the very humblest plane have become a artist 's model then have learn to sing and dance and at length she reputation as a beauty have make she name famous a marquis have marry she and when he heart be break and he money spend have obligingly kill himself in a inconspicuous and gentlemanly manner after that he widow have achieve a even greater popular success and have attract the attention of paolo di sereno it be about this time that angelum leave rome and what theo dene wonder if mr may know about the prince be he hope to break the record for distance in a new aeroplane mr morehouse who take one or two french and english illustrated weekly as well as new york daily papers see these thing as soon as theo dene see they and when angelum return to san francisco from bakersfield he tell she of the prince 's project i reason he say that it would be better for you to hear what be go on from I rather than be expose to a surprise and shock from some london or pari paper lie on a hotel table angelum interrupt he to reply that nothing the prince di sereno could do have power to shock she for they have never be really in each other 's life and have now pass out of one another 's orbit forever in spite of this assurance however when mr morehouse see the princess look pale and listless take little interest in the plan for she new house he attribute the change to humiliation or possibly even to fear for the prince 's safety for woman be strange luckily she could not be annoy in this new country where she would make she home for nobody know who she be or could associate she with the prince 's eccentricity nevertheless mr morehouse think it natural that she health and spirit should suffer and because of he old and close friendship with franklin merriam he long to find some wholesome distraction for angelum but after all it be kate not he who succeed in supply it poor kate so near to yet so far from oregon dare in she insignificance to follow she mistress 's example though she would have have a hand cut off rather than give notice to she beloved lady as a matter of fact she be pine tim be grow impatient he affair be march well something have be save out of the disaster cause by he dishonest partner he have get in with a good man and they believe that together they would some day beat the world with they apple already they have obtain a london market there be not much ready money to spare yet but tim could manage to pay kate 's way from san francisco to portland and on to he place if she would come besides there be she nest egg she dowry from the sale of the gold bag of course kate be die to go but would not even tell she sad-eyed pale-cheeked mistress that tim be want she it be only when one day angelum notice how miserable poor kate be look that little by little she draw out the whole truth then she be rouse to interest and forgetfulness of herself i 'll tell you what i will do kate she say with more animation than she have show for week i 'll take mr morehouse 's very latest advice and run up north to lake tahoe to stay till my new house be bear then instead of you go to you tim he must come to you and i 'll give you a wedding -- oh a beautiful wedding with a white silk dress and a veil and orange blossom and a cake big enough to last you the rest of you life you be not to make any objection because i should not be happy to have you stay with I now that tim 's ready and you know the idea always be for you to go when i would reach my farthest point north and nearest to oregon besides it will do I good to plan for a wedding and i mean to give you you trousseau you shall get the thing here in san francisco before we start for tahoe so that be why one evening nick read in a san francisco paper that mr may who have be stay at the fairmont hotel for several week leave last night for lake tahoe where she have engage room at the famous tahoe tavern and may remain for some time afterward when he send the paper on to sara wilkin as he do send papers now with parcel of book and magazine she too notice the paragraph he star 's go as far north and as far from he as she can possibly go and be in californium think the school-teacher and because nick be right and she good little face hide a heart that be still better she be not glad but very very sorry when kate be marry to she good-looking irishman and the little excitement of the wedding be over angelum begin to feel rather desolate there be a great many pleasant people at the tavern who would have be kind to the stranger if she have let they be kind but they be all so merry and have so many intimate interest of they own that they goodness to she seem only to emphasize she loneliness kate have insist on lend she timmy in fact the bride and bridegroom both insist for there be no doubt in they mind that the black cat have bring they good fortune now they have all the fortune they want to go on with and as poor pretty mr may seem a bit down on she luck they would leave she timmy to bring it back again and really the topaz-eyed creature in its become jade collar -- a gift from nick hilliard -- be often a comfort to angelum curl up in she lap and purr cosily under she book as she read it seem curiously fond of she even fonder than of kate and have take to she from the first angelum have travel through a region of snowshed to reach the lake in the heart of the sierra nevada and the scenery be as different from any she have meet in californium as be she mood from the mood of the south at tahoe she be a mile above sea-level and ringed in by higher mountain which have not lose they dazzling crown of snow on the shore of the long blue lake that mirror eternally a clear cool sky and immense dark tree -- pine and cedar -- angelum feel that a line have be draw between she and she californium past with its flame of golden poppy and flower of the forest here she have reach a high note of beauty which ring crystalline as a silver rod striking upon ice the place give angelum a sense of purity and remoteness which she have feel by no lake-shore of europe the charm of other lake have be they villa-sprinkled shore they historical association the charm of tahoe be loneliness she like to row out on the water alone and rest on she oar to look down down through mile -lrb- it seem -rrb- of liquid sapphire and emerald blending together tahoe be not remote really since luxurious train have bring it into close touch with san francisco and with the east but angelum like to cultivate the impression of remoteness as if she be a nun in retreat and the beauty be of a kind that call to she spirit make renunciation easier than in the luscious south scented with lily and rose tahoe have its rose too but its chief perfume be of pine and the pure freshness of breeze that blow over water and snow mountain the journey too have prepare she for the isolation that she crave the glimpse of tragic donner lake where the pioneer starve and agonize in 1848 the wild truckee river sweep its flood past thicket of pale sagebrush and forest of black pine the tang of cold and the smell of snow in the air the lonely farmhouse fold among green hill and the primitive look of truckee town with its little frame building call by pretentious foreign name firenze saloon roma hotel nobody else however seem to have the half-sad half-delicious sense of remoteness from the world at tahoe which angelum have that month be very gay and the immense veranda of the tavern be flower-garden of pretty girl -- those american summer girl of whom angelum have often hear they swim and boat and fish and above all flirt for there be always plenty of man and in the evening they dance in the ballroom of the casino build on the edge of the water angelum never tire of go from end to end of the lake in the steamboat that set out from the tavern jetty in the morning and return in the afternoon the captain a great character let she sit in a room behind the pilot-box where she luncheon be bring by a eager-eyed youth work he way through college by serve as steward in the holiday he be in love with a girl at he university equally poor and equally plucky but because she be earn dollar as a waitress at the tavern the boy think tahoe a place where you could not help be happy angelum think it a place where more than most other it might be possible to find peace though happiness be go she no longer open she diary never again she tell herself would she keep a record of she day but some time -- year from now maybe -- when she could read what she have write without a heartache she would open the unfinished volume where she have break off a sentence in the great redwood forest she might be able to think of nick hilliard then without longing for he but that time seem far very far away \* \* \* \* \* one August evening angelum come back from a excursion to the top of mount tallac she be tired and have make up she mind to dine in she own sitting-room then to go immediately to bed but ask for she key she be tell that a lady be wait to see she have be wait nearly all day a lady she echo could it be mr gaylor angelum hope not for though she have not hear from nick those thing which carmen have fear and expect she to hear she guess something of carman 's hate the fact that she have not be allow to go back that kate have arrive in bakersfield with a story of mr gaylor 's be call suddenly away from home that carman have never answer a short letter she write all these thing rouse she suspicion indeed she have even go so far as to associate the box of poison-oak leave with mr gaylor and now the thought that the spanish woman might have follow she to tahoe send a shiver through she vein who could the lady be if not carmen gaylor who but carman would wait patiently for she come through a whole day for a instant angelum be tempt to answer : i be too tired to see any one this evening but that would be cowardly besides she be curious to see she visitor whoever it might be the lady 's wait in the veranda now say a hotel clerk she be be here ever since morning but she go away at lunch time and come back afterward i do not know what she mean to do to-night for the train for truckee will be leave in a few minute and she have not engage a room angelum go out on the veranda feeling ' a little tense and excited but when a small blue-frocked gray-hatted figure dejectedly lose in a big rocking-chair be point out to she excitement die while bewilderment grow she first thought be that she have never see this countrified-looking person before but as she guest turn raise to hers a pair of singularly intelligent rather frightened eye she know that she have meet the same glance from the same eye somewhere before the little woman 's face be so pale so tired she whole personality so pathetic yet indomitable that angelum 's heart soften how do you do she ask kindly i hear you have come to see I so we must know each other i be sure -- the visitor be on she foot the chair from which she have spring with a nervous jerk rock frantically as if a nervous ghost be sit in it we do not know each other exactly miss wilkin hasten to explain as though eager not to begin with false pretence the only time you ever see I be at santa barbara last may but you be very good to I and -- and i find out you name -- of course i remember quite well mr may smile reassuringly for the poor little thing be certainly terrify and ill at ease as well as tired angelum spring to the conclusion that the young woman be in money difficulty and have remember the loan of the sitting-room at santa barbara have somehow find she way to tahoe in the hope of get help well she should have it angelum be only too glad to be able to do something for any one in trouble i be glad to see you again she say as if it be quite a commonplace thing for a stranger to have drop apparently from the cloud in search of she but i be so sorry you have have to wait perhaps you write and i have not get the letter yet no i do not write i could not have explain in a letter say the weary-faced visitor and maybe you would not have want I to come if you would know before-hand i think if i would travel all this way though just to speak to you you would not refuse i have be two night on the way oh how dreadful exclaimed angelum you must let I get you a room at once some people be leave to-night they surely can put you up in the hotel thank you very much return the young woman but i could not impose on you as you guest you 'll see that when i have tell you why i come i can not get away to truckee i know for the train go too soon but i 'll take a room at some simpler place where it be cheaper than this we 'll talk of that later say angelum soothingly now i hope you 'll come to my room and rest and tell I about yourself when we be both wash and refresh we 'll dine together in my sitting-room quietly but it be not about myself i want to talk protest the stranger i must tell you my name mr may of course you have forget it it be miss wilkin -- sara wilkin she do not want to talk about herself that be puzzling and do not fit in with angelum 's deduction however she make no comment and talking of she day on mount tallac escort miss wilkin to a pretty sitting-room which in she absence have be supply with fresh flower shall we talk first angelum ask or would you like to rest and bathe -- if you be not too tired yourself to listen to I i would rather talk now sara answer with a kind of suppress desperation but you do look tired you be thinner and paler than at santa barbara yet i have be screw my courage up to this for so long i can hardly bear to wait if i be tired i have forget it now say angelum and i be as eager to begin as you can be but you must not feel that it need courage to speak out whatever you have to say and if there be any way for I to make it easier for you i should be so glad if you could give I just the slightest hint shall we both sit down on this sofa together you sit there reply sara i do not _ want _ to be comfortable i could not lean back i be all on edge oh but you must not be ` on edge ' i do not tell you that to get sympathy mr may say the school-teacher but only because i would like you to understand before i begin that i have not come just to be ` cheeky ' and bold i come because i feel i must -- on somebody 's account if not yours for myself i do not want to force myself on you i do not want it one bit and now i be here if i could do what i feel most like do i would run away as fast as ever i could go without say one more word you almost frighten I say angelum she eye dark and serious have i do something dreadful that -- that i ought to be warn not to do again and you have come to tell I because you think i be once a little kind to you not that i be really kind -- for it be nothing at all that i do miss wilkin sit stiff and upright on the smallest straightest least luxurious chair in the pretty room be silent for a instant as if collect all she force no she answer at last it would not be fair to say exactly that and yet you _ have _ do something dreadful oh my goodness this be even harder to get out than -- than i suppose it would be for of course you 'll think it be not my business anyhow and be not or would not be if -- if -- if -- what angelum prompt she gently sara wilkin swallow a lump in she throat and press she lip together they be dry and pale well she break out i 'll have to tell you the truth and not care for my own feeling they do not matter really it would not be my business if i do not love he myself dearly -- oh but not selfishly and he do not dream of it he never will and he never think about I except to pity I a little and do kind thing because i be alone in the world and that be all i want of he it be truly though i can not explain very well i just want he to be happy and to have make he so because _ somebody _ have to act if anything be to be do and there be nobody but I he angela repeat in a whisper yet the name be in she mind now as always it be in she heart mr hilliard of course you see -- desperately -- i be school-teacher at lucky star city close to he place all the land there and the big gusher be he when he come back in June i be at lucky star and we be introduce he remember my face dimly more i guess because he could not forget even the least thing associate with you than for any other reason since then we have get to be friend angelum do not speak even when sara wilkin make a slight hesitating pause she heart be beat too fast and thickly for word to come and besides there seem to be nothing to say yet until she have hear more do not think sara go on gathering courage that he confide in I in any ordinary way i just could not bear you should do he that injustice if you do i should have do harm instead of good by come all this way to see you but the very first day i meet he at lucky star i ask about you and i -- _ see _ though he only say he believe you be in san francisco -- that he be heart-broken about you even at santa barbara i could not help make up a romance round you both -- you so beautiful and somehow like a great lady though you do not put on any air at all he so handsome and splendid like a hero in some book of the west it be week before we mention you again -- he and i -- though i see a lot of he at lucky star he be kind and it be holiday so i have not much to do except read book he lend I still angelum say nothing though it be evident that miss wilkin would have be thankful at this stage for some lead question which might help she over a difficult place angelum could not now give the help she have once offer rather be she in need of it herself she sit wait she eye disconcertingly fix upon the other woman 's flush face but that be because she could not bring herself to look away from it before we speak of you again what do you think he would be do the school-teacher go on almost fiercely oh i can hardly tell you it be so sad if you be the sweet woman that in spite of everything i think you _ be _ you 'll be sorry all the way through to you heart he -- he hire a wretched humbug of a man who pretend to be a english swell to teach he _ manners _ so that he could be a little worthier of you he _ nick hilliard _ the noblest gentleman that ever draw breath to stoop to learn from a little thing who call itself montagu jerrold he do it because of what _ you _ say to he oh cry angelum she cheek scarlet i say nothing -- nothing which could make he feel that i do not think he a gentleman i -- that be what i tell he sara break in i know he reason for employ jerrold because he make up a sort of allegory about a moth love a star and try to fly up to heaven and be near she or something like that i say that a _ real _ star could not be stupid enough to think he a moth or anyway not a common one and he say ` that be just what she do think I _ common _ ' i know he mean you though he do not speak you name then and i think to myself ` she do not look like a silly doll stuff with sawdust ' i do you the justice to believe that a great lady experience in the world would know and appreciate a _ man _ i be just nobody at all mr may but even i be clever enough for that i be sure as fate if i be acquaint with all the best king and prince there be in the world i could not find a better gentleman than nick hilliard yet accord to he you do not have the eye to see what he be worth you not only turn he down but turn he down say he be too common for you angela could stand no more it be as if the fierce little woman in dusty blue serge have strike she in the face she spring up very white she eye blaze it be not true she say in a low voice he could not have tell you i say that he tell I you say just the same thing : that he be ` impossible ' that be the word -- a cruel cruel word she be up too the fiery little school-teacher and they face each other -- the tall girl white as lily grow in a king 's garden and the little snub-nosed freckled country schoolma'am do you mean when i use the word ` impossible ' ask angela that he think i mean it in _ such _ a way -- mean to tell he that he be a impossible person yes i do mean just that you be _ sure _ of what you say dreadfully sure when i would get that much out of he -- somehow i hardly know how -- i feel wound and sore as i know he be feel and would feel all the rest of he life oh i would have give mine for he i would then and i would now to make he happy that be why i come up here -- to find out whether after all there could be any misunderstanding between you that could be right he do not know i have come he think i be stay with a friend in san francisco i do not want he to know ever i should die of shame i wish i could talk in some wise clever way to you and get you to see what a mistake you have make he love you so mr may then a thing happen which be the last that sara wilkin have expect with a stifled cry angelum turn away and cover she face with both hand sob as if she heart would break the little school-teacher tremble all over she have come here -- give she time and money -- far more than she could afford -- and she nerve-tissue in nick hilliard 's cause and all in the hope of make he star see the error of she way but when the cruel star break down and cry uncontrollably in anguish of soul the hardness and anger which nick 's champion have cherish melt into pity i do hope you 'll forgive I she stammer i -- i do not mean to make you suffer like this i be so afraid i have do everything all wrong but i let my feeling carry I away i think if you love he a little after all maybe -- love he i love he so much that it be kill I angelum break out through she tear i can not sleep at night for thinking of he longing for he and tell myself it be all over -- all the joy of wake up to a new day and know i shall see he ah night be terrible i pray for peace and just as i begin to hope -- to be a little calmer at least by day out in the sunshine look at the white mountain you a stranger come and tell I that i _ do not love he _ i would not have dare if i do not love he myself sara retorted choke on the word you see -- i _ know _ but if you care for he like this if you be so unhappy without he why do you send he away broken-hearted angelum fling she hand up then drop they hopelessly with no attempt to hide she tear-blurred face she answer : i send he away because i be married i say ` it be impossible ' not -- what he seem to think i say oh how sad the little school-teacher be confront real tragedy for the first time in she gray conscientious existence how sorry i be forgive I but -- you know it be not i who matter no angelum echo it be not you you do not tell he you give he no idea i have not a chance there would be a evening a little while before when i would mean to tell if -- if anything happen but -- we be interrupted he think you be a young widow yes it be only in the sight of the world that i have a husband -- that i _ ever _ have one when i come to america i leave the man for good and take another name ` mr may ' be not you real name no i 'll tell you if you like -- you need not but you ought to tell _ he _ that and everything i do not mean _ confess _ or anything like that probably you think till you fall in love with he that there be no reason why you should give he you secret what i mean be -- oh the difference it would make to mr hilliard know that you send he away not because you look down on he as common and impossible but because you have no _ right _ to care angelum stare at the earnest little face as if she be daze bewildered in a dark place and grope for light i have no idea he misunderstand I so she say slowly if i would guess at the time i could not have resist tell he how much i love he i could not have let he go so wounded but now since no happiness can ever come for we together and perhaps by this time he be get over he first suffering would not it be better just to leave the veil of silence down between we i do not want to hurt he all he life long it must make it easier for he to forget if he believe I a ` doll stuff with sawdust ' or a snob he can not go on for long love a poor thing like that and so he will be cure oh though i long to send he a message -- i must not i must not be tempt let he think badly of I it be the best and kindest thing no say sara wilkin that be not the right way not for _ he _ it might be with a vain man but he do not get over it he do not stop love you only the pain be worse because he think you scorn he mr may i implore you to write he a letter i can not take a message because he must not know i come to see you it would spoil it all for he i think write as if it be of you own accord do not _ explain _ in the letter letter be such hard unsatisfactory thing the best one you could write would not make up to he a bit for what he be suffer and what he must go on suffer for you could not help study you word and they would be stiff and disappointing no matter how hard you try to say the thing just right ask he to come here and let you explain in you own word why you seem so harsh only warn he that it be not to change you mind about -- about say _ yes _ it would be awful to rush up here happy and hopeful only to find out -- what he 'll have to find out you do not understand say angelum i care too much to dare see he again i could not trust myself i -- ah but you could trust _ he _ he be strong and high in he nature -- like the great redwood yes like the great redwood angelum echo in a whisper he would be a rock too -- a rock to rely upon sara go on do this mr may do it for my sake i know it be the right thing it will give he back he self-respect that be even more important than happiness especially to he i have do all i could for you -- not much but my best do this for I will you yes i will angela answer suddenly and impulsively she put out she hand to the little school-teacher and draw she close they kiss each other the two woman who love nick hilliard xxxii a end -- and a begin come to I if you can i can give you no hope of happiness but there be something i should like to explain angelum say in she letter she expect a answer though she ask for none but no word come on the morning when she have think that she might hear other people have they letter and be read they on the veranda but there be nothing for she she sit there for a while cold with disappointment listen to the tear open of envelope and the pleasant crackle of thick letter-paper then when timmy the black cat suddenly leap off she lap as if in a mad rush after something he fondly hope be a mouse angelum be glad of a excuse to follow but timmy who be of a independent character evidently believe that he be in for a good thing he dart across the grass and with a whisk of eager tail disappear behind a clump of tree a dragon-fly angelum say to herself for timmy could not resist the fascination of dragon-fly -- a bright and beautiful kind that spend the summer at lake tahoe she follow round the clump of tree and there be nick hilliard come toward she with timmy in he arm oh she cry i -- i think -- i be afraid you would think it be too early say nick as quietly as possible though he voice shake i get in on the train and after my bath i be take a walk around till a decent time to call then timmy come run to welcome I -- i believe he must really have see you cry angelum grateful to timmy who be save they both the first awkwardness of the situation he be the most extraordinary cat -- quite a super-cat and you remember he use always to know what time you be come to call when we be in san francisco owe to timmy they be spare a meeting on the veranda and angelum do not offer to take she visitor into the house yet there be some quiet place in the garden in the deep shadow of tree where she could say what she have to say better than between four wall they stroll on nick hold timmy who purr loudly as if glad to welcome the giver of he jade collar i get you letter just in time to catch the train for san francisco and then to get on here hilliard explain of course you know i would come at once no -- i be not sure i think -- i might hear from you this morning -- a telegram or letter angelum stammer but -- i be glad very glad it be good of you to come and so soon good i want so much to talk to you i have be want it for a long time ever since -- we part but it be only the other night i make up my mind that i have any right to send for you what do i say to you that last day about come from the end of the world it be only a step from lucky star here i know what you say there be not one word i have forget shall we sit under that arbor it be my favorite seat and no one ever disturb I they sit down on a rustic bench curtain with trail of virginium creeper red as the blood of the die summer nick keep timmy on he knee stroke the glossy back he hand look very strong and brown and angelum long to snatch it up and lay it against she cheek how she love he how much more even than she have know when she could not see he face he eye and the light there be in he eye for she it have not change that wonderful light though he face be sadder and she think thinner be you glad to see I again -- nick she could not resist ask he smile at she wistfully just about as glad as a man would be to see god 's sunlight if he would be in prison or starve in a mine that have fall in on he only perhaps a little gladder than that she answer he with a look and then as involuntarily she put out she hand to stroke timmy they finger meet he catch hers hold they for a instant and let they go nick that day when you save my life and tell I you love I do i make you realize that i love you too she ask no i could not think you mean that i think you try to save my feeling by say you care that you be sorry for I and -- i be sorry for myself because you see you would begin to be the one person in the whole world who matter oh wait do not speak yet i have to make you understand that we could not be anything to each other and it be so hard for I that often i have wonder if inadvertently i say thing to hurt you more than you need have be hurt tell I truly and frankly what do you believe i mean by that word i use -- ' _ impossible _ ' he hesitate then answer slowly : i feel that i ought to have know without you tell I i be not the sort of man for you you do think that oh nick then i be glad i send for you -- i can not help be glad if you love I and i be free nothing in the world could come between we and i should be the happiest creature on earth if you be free he hand lay heavily on timmy 's back and the cat resent it by jump down but both have forget timmy 's existence and they late gratitude to he if i be free you think i be -- you see I in mourning i never mean to make you or any one believe a lie all i thought of at first be get away from the old life but oh nick though i be not a widow i be never any man 's wife except in name i be franklin merriam 's daughter -- you must have hear of he and when i be seventeen i marry prince paolo di sereno that very day i find out there be -- some one who have more right to he that i have she come and threaten to kill herself you see it be not I it be

to look at last and see he bow head -- the dear black head that she love oh she murmur i ought never to have go with you to the yosemite if i have not you would have forget I by this time -- perhaps

angelum guess what he have want to say and love he better for not say it i use to think she go on hastily that i know the worst of be marry to a man without love but now i see i do not know half a woman can not know till she love another man oh nick i can not get on without you -- not _ quite _ without you i have be try -- and every day it grow harder instead of easier nothing _ matter _ -- but

have stay if she have bid he stay and fight for he manhood against odds be i to go -- now he ask yes -- oh please yes she beg he hold out she hand i be key up to bear it now it might be different later but -- let we write to each other nick i 'll write little thing every day -- that i think and feel then if they be worthy i 'll send they to you -- once a month or so will you do the same yes and you 'll take care of yourself -- for I -- will not you he could not answer in word he crush she hand against he lip and then turn from she abruptly walk away without look back \* \* \* \* \* it grow cold at lake tahoe when week have pass there be no excuse to stay : the plan of the architect be finish and the new house begin angelum go to del monte and motor nearly every day to the forest on the peninsula to see how she home grow she have not the old interest in thinking of it but she be no longer unhappy for she have not lose nick hilliard out of she life she could almost feel the thrill of he thought and at del monte she be much nearer lucky star city than she have be at tahoe sometimes she wonder if it would be very wrong and unwise to have he come to look at the house when it be finish if afterward she could have the memory of he in the room walk through they with she -- just that no more and then go away -- it would make all the difference between a live home and a dead house or a house that never have really come alive but generally when she have dream this dream she say to herself better not or it would never do one morning in October just six month to the day after she come to californium she read in a san francisco paper -- a mere tucked-away paragraph to fill up a corner -- that the italian amateur aeronaut prince di sereno have arrange a sensational flight from naple to algier in he new aeroplane a improvement on a celebrated older make the machine have just be name the _ vittorium _ in honor of the brave and beautiful lady whom he call he mascot and who have make so many daring journey through the air with he the project dash would be the most ambitious so far attempt and it be exciting considerable interest it be say that prince di sereno in gratitude to he mascot have lately make a will in she favor leave all he personal property to she in event of death he great estate would go to a nephew as he be without a direct heir angelum wonder how much of she money be leave for he to bequeath to the celebrated vittorium di cancellini she do not grudge it either to the prince or he mascot she take no interest in the great flight from naple to algier but she feel certain that paolo would succeed in accomplish it he have always succeed in everything he have ever want to do except perhaps in win she love but then he have not really want that the day come for the flight but she have forget it she go in the morning to the new house picnic there and return to del monte only at dusk she be think on the way back of several thing she would put in the diary she keep for nick send it off to he in a fat envelope the first of each month one bit of news she want to tell he be that he favorite flower -- pansy -- be to be plant in a great bed under the window of she own room then whenever i look out i shall think of you not that i should not do that anyway she wonder if she have better add that last sentence or if it would be better to leave it out there be a telegram for you mr may just this minute come say the hotel clerk angelum take it she heart beat fast for whenever a telegram arrive -- which happen seldom -- she always wonder if it would tell she that for some good reason or other nick be come but he never have come and have never telegraph she open the envelope and glance first at the signature : jame morehouse why should he have wire then she read : in flight to-day aeroplane fall into sea off sardinia aeronaut kill companion injured forgive abruptness wish get ahead of newspaper for a moment she feel absolutely unconcerned as if reading of the death of some stranger aeronaut of japan or south america then : i hope you have not get bad news mr may a concerned voice be say she be vaguely conscious that the hotel clerk who have give she the telegram be hover distressfully before she she have be stand up when she begin to read the message now she be sit down but she voice sound quite calm and natural in she own ear as she answer no thank you very much a surprise -- that be all a great surprise you be all right oh quite -- quite nothing i can do for you nothing thanks i will go up to my room \* \* \* \* \* she first thought when she could think connectedly be to send she unfinished letter to nick with a few hastily scribble word at the end -- not about the pansy and perhaps to enclose the telegram but she do neither two day pass before she send the long diary letter and when she do send it nothing more have be write she wait she do not know what would happen she do not even read the newspaper though she know there must be paragraph not tuck into corner for this be in a way world 's news there have be considerable interest on the third day she be give another telegram this time the name at the bottom be the only name that could make she heart beat : i have see what have happen when will you let I come he do not say will you let I come but when she think if she do not answer soon he would come all the same it seem wonderful unbelievable that now there be no wrong no cruelty no terrible unwisdom in have he near she but there be none even she could see none so she telegraph not the immediate summons he hope for and she be tempt to send he but the message of she second thought come not yet but on the day i have a home of my own to welcome you in till then let I be alone with my thought of you \* \* \* \* \* the architect think mr may 's impatience to get into she new house and to have even the garden finish a charming whim as she seem not to care how much money be spend relay of man many man be put on to work night as well as day angelum choose furniture in san francisco all make of beautiful californium wood we shall have two home she think it be heavenly to say we
