on the island of nantucket mass aug 1 1818 she be the third child of william and lydium -lrb- coleman -rrb- mitchell she ancestor on both side be quaker for many generation and it be in consequence of the intolerance of the early puritan that these ancestor have be oblige to flee from the state of massachusett and to settle upon this island which at that time belong to the state of new york for many year the quaker or friend as they call themselves form much the larger part of the inhabitant of nantucket and thus be enable to crystallize as it be they own idea of what family and social life should be and although in course of time many world 's people swoop down and help to swell the number of islander they still continue to hold they own method and to bring up they child in accordance with they own conception of divine light mr and mr mitchell be marry during the war of 1812 the former lack one week of be twenty-one year old and the latter be a few month over twenty the people of nantucket by they situation endure many hardship during this period they ship be upon the sea a prey to privateer and communication with the mainland be expose to the same danger so that it be difficult to obtain such necessaries of life as the island could not furnish there be still to be see a few year ago the mark leave on the moor where field of corn and potato have be plant in that try time so the young couple begin they housekeeping in a very simple way mr mitchell use to describe it as be very delightful it be notice that mr mitchell never express herself on the subject -- it be she probably who have the planning to do to make a little money go a great way and to have everything smooth and serene when she husband come home mr mitchell be a woman of strong character very dignified honest almost to a extreme and perfectly self-controlled where control be necessary she possess very strong affection but she self-control be such that she be undemonstrative she keep a close watch over she child be clearhead know they every fault and every merit and be a indefatigable worker it be she who look out for the education of the child and see what they capacity be mr mitchell be a man of great suavity and gentleness if leave to himself he would never have deny a single request make to he by one of he child he first impulse be to gratify every desire of they heart and if it have not be for the clear head of the mother who take care that the household should be manage wisely and economically the result might have be disastrous the father have wisdom enough to perceive this and when a child come to he and in a very pathetic and winning way proffer some request for a unusual indulgence he generally reply yes if mother think best mr mitchell be very fond of bright color as they be exclude from the dress of friend he indulge himself wherever it be possible if he be buy book and there be a variety of binding he always choose the copy with red cover even the wooden framework of the reflect telescope which he use be paint a brilliant red he like a gay carpet on the floor and the wall of the family sitting-room in the house on vestal street be cover with paper resplendent with bunch of pink rose suspend by a cord from the ceiling in the center of this room be a glass ball fill with water use by mr mitchell in he experiment on polarization of light flash its dancing rainbow about the room at the back of this house be a little garden full of gay flower : so that if the garb of the young mitchell be rather sombre the setting be bright and cheerful and the life in the home be healthy and wide-awake when the hilarity become excessive the mother would put in she little check from time to time and the father would try to look as he ought to but he evidently enjoy the whole as mr mitchell be kind and indulgent to he child so he be the sympathetic friend and counsellor of many in trouble who come to he for help or advice as he take he daily walk to the little farm about a mile out of town where for a hour or two he enjoy be a farmer the people would come to they door to speak to he as he pass and the little child would run up to he to be pat on the head he treat animal in the same way he generally keep a horse he child complain that although the horse be good when it be buy yet as mr mitchell never allow it to be strike with a whip nor urge to go at other than a very gentle trot the horse become thoroughly demoralize and be no more fit to drive than a old cow there be everything in the home which could amuse and instruct child the eldest daughter be very handy at all sort of entertaining occupation she have a delicate sense of the artistic and be quite skilful with she pencil the present kindergarten system in its practice be almost identical with the home as it appear in the first half of this century among enlighten people there be hardly any kind of handiwork do in the kindergarten that be not do in the mitchell family and in other family of they acquaintance the girl learn to sew and cook just as they learn to read -- as a matter of habit rather than of instruction they learn how to make they own clothes by make they doll ' clothes -- and the doll themselves be frequently home-make the eldest sister painting the face much more prettily than those obtain at the shop and there be a great delight in gratify the fancy by dress the doll not in quaker garb but in all of the most brilliant color and stylish shape worn by the ultra-fashionable there be always plenty of book and besides those in the house there be the atheneum library which although not a free library be very inexpensive to the shareholder there be another very striking difference between that epoch and the present the child of that day be teach to value a book and to take excellent care of it as a instance it may be mention that one copy of colburn 's algebra be use by eight child in the mitchell family one after the other the eldest daughter 's name be write on the inside of the cover seven more name follow in the order of they age as the book descend with regard to they read the mother examine every book that come into the house of course there be not so many book publish then as now and the same book be read over and over miss edgeworth 's story become part of they very live and young 's night thought and the poem of cowper and bloomfield be conspicuous object on the bookshelf of most house in those day mr mitchell be very apt while observe the heaven in the evening to quote from one or the other of these poet or from the bible a undevout astronomer be mad be one of he favorite quotation among the poem which maria learn in she childhood and which be repeatedly upon she lip all through she life be the spacious firmament on high in she latter year if she have a sudden fright which threaten to take away she sens she would test she mental condition by repeat that poem it be needless to say that she always remember it and she nerve instantly relapse into they natural condition the life of marium mitchell and she numerous brother and sister be pass in simplicity and with a entire absence of anything exciting or abnormal the education of they child be enjoin upon the parent by the discipline and in those day at least the parent do not give up all the responsibility in that line to the teacher in marium mitchell 's childhood the child of a family sit around the table in the evening and study they lesson for the next day -- the parent or the older child assist the younger if the lesson be too difficult the child attend school five day in the week -- six hour in the day -- and they only vacation be four week in the summer generally in August the idea that child over-studied and injure they health be never promulgate in that family nor indeed in that community it seem to be a notion of the present half-century marium 's first teacher be a lady for whom she always feel the warmest affection and in she diary write in she later year occur this allusion to she : i count in my life outside of family relative three aid give I on my journey they be prominent to I : the woman who first make the study-book charming the man who send I the first hundred dollar i ever see to buy book with and another noble woman through whose effort i become the owner of a telescope and of these the first be the greatest as a little girl marium be not a brilliant scholar she be shy and slow but later under she father 's tuition she develop very rapidly after the close of the war of 1812 when business be resume and the town restore to its normal prosperity mr mitchell teach school -- at first as master of a public school and afterwards in a private school of he own marium attend both of these school mr mitchell 's pupil speak of he as a most inspiring teacher and he always speak of he experience in that capacity as very happy when she father give up teaching marium be put under the instruction of mr cyrus peirce afterwards principal of the first normal school start in the united state mr peirce take a great interest in marium especially in develop she taste for mathematical study for which she early show a remarkable talent the book which she study at the age of seventeen as we know by the date of the note be bridge 's conic section hutton 's mathematics and bowditch 's navigator at that time prof benjamin peirce have not publish he explanation of the navigator and almanac so that marium be oblige to consult many scientific book and report before she could herself construct the astronomical table mr mitchell on relinquish school-teaching be appoint cashier of the pacific bank but although he give up teaching he by no means give up study he favorite science astronomy and marium be he willing helper at all time mr mitchell from he early youth be a enthusiastic student of astronomy at a time too when very little attention be give to that study in this country he evening when pleasant be spend in observe the heaven and to the child accustom to see such observation go on the important study in the world seem to be astronomy one by one as they become old enough they be draft into the service of count seconds by the chronometer during the observation some of they take a interest in the thing itself and other consider it rather stupid work but they all drink in so much of this atmosphere that if any one have ask a little child in this family who be the greatest man that ever live the answer would have come promptly herschel marium very early learn the use of the sextant the chronometer of all the whale ship be bring to mr mitchell on they return from a voyage to be rate as it be call for this purpose he use the sextant and the observation be make in the little back yard of the vestal-street home there be also a clumsy reflect telescope make on the herschelian plan but of very great simplicity which be put up on fine night in the same back yard when the neighbor use to flock in to look at the moon afterwards mr mitchell buy a small dolland telescope which thereafter as long as she live he daughter use for sweeping purpose after they removal to the bank building there be add to these a altitude and azimuth circle loan to mr mitchell by west point academy and two transit instrument a little observatory for the use of the first be place on the roof of the bank building and two small building be erect in the yard for the transit there be also a much larger and finer telescope loan by the coast survey for which service mr mitchell make observation at the time when marium mitchell show a decide taste for the study of astronomy there be no school in the world where she could be teach higher mathematics and astronomy harvard college at that time have no telescope better than the one which she father be use and no observatory except the little octagonal projection to the old mansion in cambridge occupy by the late dr ap peabody however every one will admit that no school nor institution be better for a child than the home with a enthusiastic parent for a teacher at the time of the annular eclipse of the sun in 1831 the totality be central at nantucket the window be take out of the parlor on vestal street the telescope the little dolland mount in front of it and with marium by he side count the seconds the father observe the eclipse marium be then twelve year old at sixteen miss mitchell leave mr peirce 's school as a pupil but be retain as assistant teacher she soon relinquish that position and open a private school on trader ' lane this school too she give up for the position of librarian of the nantucket atheneum which office she hold for nearly twenty year this library be open only in the afternoon and on Saturday evening the visitor be comparatively few in the afternoon so that miss mitchell have ample leisure for study -- a opportunity of which she make the most she visitor in the afternoon be elderly man of leisure who enjoy talk with so bright a girl on they favorite hobby when they talk miss mitchell close she book and take up she knitting for she be never idle with some of these visitor the friendship be keep up for year it be in this library that she find la place 's mécanique céleste translate by she father 's friend dr bowditch she also read the theorium motus of gauss in its original latin form in she capacity as librarian miss mitchell to a large extent control the reading of the young people in the town many of they on arrive at mature year have express they gratitude for the direction in which they reading be turn by she advice miss mitchell always have a special friendship for young girl and boy many of these intimacy grow out of the acquaintance make at the library -- the young girl make she they confidante and go to she for sympathy and advice the boy as they grow up and go away to sea perhaps always remember she and make a point when they return in they vacation of come to tell they experience to such a sympathetic listener April 18 1855 a young sailor boy come to see I to-day it please I to have these lad seek I on they return from they first voyage and tell I how much they have learn about navigation they always say with pride ' i can take a lunar miss mitchell and work it up ' this boy i have know only as a boy but he have suddenly become a man and seem to be full of intelligence he will go once more as a sailor he say and then try for the position of second mate he look as if he have be a good boy and would make a good man he say that he have be ill so much that he have be keep out of temptation but that the forecastle of a ship be no place for improvement of mind or moral he say the captain with whom he come home ask he if he know I because he have hear of I i be glad to find that the captain be a man of intelligence and have be kind to the boy miss mitchell be a inveterate reader she devour book on all subject if she see that boy be eagerly read a certain book she immediately read it if it be harmless she encourage they to read it if otherwise she have a convenient way of _ lose _ the book in November when the trustee make they annual examination the book appear upon the shelf but the next day after it be again lose at this time nantucket be a thriving busy town the whale-fishery be a very profitable business and the town be one of the wealthiest in the state there be a good deal of social and literary life in a friend 's family neither music nor dancing be allow mr and mr mitchell be by no means narrow sectarian but they believe it to be best to conform to the rule of friend as lay down in the discipline george fox himself the founder of the society have blow a blast against music and especially instrumental music in church it will be remember that the methodist have but recently yield to the popular demand in this respect and have especially favor congregational singing it be most likely that george fox have no ear for music himself and thus entail upon he follower a obligation from which they be but now free themselves there be plenty of singing in the mitchell family and the parent like it especially the father who when he sit down in the evening with the child would say now sing something but there could be no instruction in sing the child sing the song that they pick up from they playmate however one of the daughter buy a piano and marium 's purse open to help that cause along it would not have be proper for mr mitchell to help pay for it but he take a great interest in it nevertheless so indeed do the mother but she take care not to express herself outwardly the piano be keep in a neighbor building not too far off to be hear from the house marium have no ear for music herself but she be always to be depend upon to take the lead in a emergency so the sister put they head together and decide that the piano must be bring into the house when they have make all the preparation the father and mother be invite to take tea with they married daughter who live in another part of the town and have be let into the secret the piano be duly remove and place in a upper room call the hall where mr mitchell keep the chronometer where the family sewing be do and where the larger part of the book be keep -- a beautiful room overlook the square and a great gathering-place for all they young friend when the piano be put in place the sister await the come of the parent marium station herself at the foot of the stair ready to meet they as they enter the front door another half-way between be to give the signal to a third who be seat at the piano the footstep be hear at the door the signal be give a lively tune be start and marium confront the parent as they enter what be that be the exclamation well say marium soothingly we have have the piano bring over why of all thing exclaim the mother the father lay down he hat walk immediately upstairs enter the hall and say come daughter play something lively so that be all but that be not all for mr mitchell he have break the rule accept by the friend and it be necessary for some notice to be take of it so a dear old friend and neighbor come to deal with he now to be under dealings as it be call be a very serious matter -- to be speak of only under the breath in a half whisper i hear that thee have a piano in thy house say the old friend yes my daughter have be the reply but it be in thy house pursue the friend yes but my home be my child 's home as well as mine say mr mitchell and i propose that they shall not be oblige to go away from home for they pleasure i do not play on the piano it so happen that mr mitchell hold the property of the monthly meeting in he hand at the time and it be a very improper thing for the accredited agent of the society to be under dealings as mr mitchell gently suggest this the friend have not think of and so he say well william perhaps we would better say no more about it when the father come home after this interview he could not keep it to himself if it have be the mother who be interview she would have keep it a profound secret -- because she would not have like to have she child get any fun out of the proceedings of the old friend but mr mitchell tell the story in he quiet way the daughter enjoy it and declare that the piano be place upon a firm foothold by this proceed the news spread abroad and several other young quaker girl eagerly seize the occasion to gratify they musical longing in the same direction -lrb- footnote : it be pleasant to note that this objection to music among friend be a thing of the past and that the friend ' school at providence rus which be under the control of the new england yearly meeting of friend have music in its regular curriculum -rrb- few woman with scientific taste have the advantage which surround miss mitchell in she own home she father be acquaint with the most prominent scientific man in the country and in he hospitable home at nantucket she meet many person of distinction in literature and science she care but little for general society and have always to be coax to go into company later in life however she be much more socially inclined and take pleasure in make and receive visit she could neither dance nor sing but in all amusement which require quickness and a ready wit she be very happy she be very fond of child and know how to amuse they and to take care of they as she have half a dozen younger brother and sister she have ample opportunity to make herself useful she be a capital story-teller and always have a story on hand to divert a wayward child or to soothe the little sister who be lie awake and afraid of the dark she write a great many little story print they with a pen and bind they in pretty cover most of they be destroy long ago marium take she part in all the household work she know how to do everything that have to be do in a large family where but one servant be keep and she do everything thoroughly if she sweep a room it become clean she might not rearrange the different article of furniture in the most artistic manner but everything would be clean and there would be nothing left crooked if a chair be to be place it would be parallel to something she be exceedingly sensitive to a line out of the perpendicular and could detect the slightest deviation from that rule she have also a sensitive eye in the matter of color and feel any lack of harmony in the color worn by those about she marium be always ready to bear the brunt and could at any time be coax by the younger child to do the thing which they find difficult or disagreeable the two youngest child in the family be delicate and the special care of the youngest sister devolve upon marium who know how to be a good nurse as well as a good playfellow she be especially careful of a timid child she herself be timid and throughout she life could never witness a thunder-storm with any calmness on one of those occasion so common in a american household when the one servant suddenly take she leave or be summarily dismiss miss mitchell describe she part of the family duty : oct 21 1854 this morning i arise at six have be half asleep only for some hour fear that i might not be up in time to get breakfast a task which i have volunteer to do the precede evening it be but half light and i make a hasty toilet i make a fire very quickly prepare the coffee baked the graham bread toast white bread trim the solar lamp and make another fire in the dining-room before seven o'clock i always think that servant-girl have a easy time of it and i still think so i really find a hour too long for all this and when i ring the bell at seven for breakfast i have be wait fifteen minute for the clock to strike i go to the atheneum at 930 and have decide that i would take the newark and cambridge place of the comet and work they up i do so get to the three equation before i go home to dinner at 1230 i omit the correction of parallax and aberration not intend to get more than a rough approximation i find to my sorrow that they do not agree with those from my own observation i shall look over they again next week at noon i run around and do up several errand dine and be back again at my post by 130 then i look over my morning 's work -- i can find no mistake i have worn myself thin try to find out about this comet and i know very little now in the matter i saw in look over cooper element of a comet of 1825 which resemble what i get out for this from my own observation but i can not rely upon my own i saw also to-day in the ` monthly notice ' a plan for measure the light of star by degree of illumination -- a idea which have occur to I long ago but which i have not practice October 23 yesterday i be again remind of the remark which mr stowe make about the variety of occupation which a american woman pursue she say it be this add to the care and anxiety which keep they so much behind the daughter of england in personal beauty and to-day i be amuse at read that one of she party object to the introduction of wax floor into american housekeeping because she could seem to see herself down on she knee do the waxing but of yesterday i be up before six make the fire in the kitchen and make coffee then i set the table in the dining-room and make the fire there toast bread and trim lamp ring the breakfast bell at seven after breakfast make my bed and ` put up ' the room then i come down to the atheneum and look over my comet computation till noon before dinner i do some tatting and make seven button-hole for k i dress and then dine come back again to the atheneum at 130 and look over another set of computation which take I until four o'clock i be pretty tired by that time and rest by read ` cosmos ' lizzie e come in and i gossip for half a hour i go home to tea and that over i make a loaf of bread then i go up to my room and read through -lrb- partly write -rrb- two exercise in german which take I thirty-five minute it be stormy and i have no observe to do so i sit down to my tatting lizzie e come in and i take a new lesson in tat so as to make the pearl-edged i make about half a yard during the evening at a little after nine i go home with lizzie and carry a letter to the post-office i have keep steadily at work for sixteen hour when i go to bed chapter ii 1847-1854 miss mitchell 's comet -- extract from diary -- the comet miss mitchell spend every clear evening on the house-top sweep the heaven no matter how many guest there might be in the parlor miss mitchell would slip out don she regimental as she call they and lantern in hand mount to the roof on the evening of oct 1 1847 there be a party of invite guest at the mitchell home as usual marium slip out run up to the telescope and soon return to the parlor and tell she father that she think she see a comet mr mitchell hurry upstairs station himself at the telescope and as soon as he look at the object point out by he daughter declare it to be a comet miss mitchell with she usual caution advise he to say nothing about it until they have observe it long enough to be tolerably sure but mr mitchell immediately write to professor bond at cambridge announce the discovery on account of stormy weather the mail do not leave nantucket until October 3 frederick vi king of denmark have offer dec 17 1831 a gold medal of the value of twenty ducat to the first discoverer of a telescopic comet the regulation as revise and amend be republish in April 1840 in the astronomische nachrichten when this comet be discover the king who have offer the medal be dead the son frederick vii who have succeed he have not the interest in science which belong to he father but he be prevail upon to carry out he father 's design in this particular case the same comet have be see by father de vico at rome on October 3 at 730 pm and this fact be immediately communicate by he to professor schumacher at altona on the 7th of October at 920 pm the comet be observe by mr wr dawe at kent england and on the 11th it be see by madame rümker the wife of the director of the observatory at hamburg the follow letter from the younger bond will show the cordial relation exist between the observatory at cambridge and the smaller station at nantucket : cambridge oct 20 1847 dear marium : there i think that be a very amiable beginning consider the way in which i have be treat by you if you be go to find any more comet can you not wait till they be announce by the proper authority at least do not kidnap another such as this last be if my object be to make you fear and tremble i should tell you that on the evening of the 30th i be sweeping within a few degree of you prize i merely throw out the hint for what it be worth it have be very interesting to watch the motion of this comet among the star with the great refractor we could almost see it move a account of its passage over the star mention by you father when he be here would make a interesting notice for one of the foreign journal which we would readily forward -lrb- here follow mr bond 's observation -rrb- respectfully you obedient servant g p bond hon edward everett who at that time be president of harvard college take a great interest in the matter and immediately open a correspondence with the proper authority and send a notice of the discovery to the astronomische nachrichten the priority of miss mitchell 's discovery be immediately admit throughout europe the king of denmark very promptly refer the matter to professor schumacher who report in favor of grant the medal to miss mitchell and the medal be duly strike off and forward to mr everett among european astronomer who urge miss mitchell 's claim be admiral smyth whom she know through he celestial cycle and who later on she visit to england become a warm personal friend madame rümker also send congratulation mr everett announce the receipt of the medal to miss mitchell in the follow letter : cambridge march 29 1849 my dear miss mitchell : i have the pleasure to inform you that you medal arrive by the last steamer it reach I by mail yesterday afternoon i go to boston this morning hope to find you at the adam house to put it into you own hand as you return to nantucket prevent this i of course retain it subject to you order not like to take the risk again of its transmission by mail have it in this way in my hand i have take the liberty to show it to some friend such as wc bond professor peirce the editor of the transcript and the member of my family -- which i hope you will pardon i remain my dear miss mitchell with great regard very faithfully yours edward everett -lrb- footnote : see appendix -rrb- in 1848 miss mitchell be elect to membership by the american academy of art and science unanimously she be the first and only woman ever admit in the diploma the print word fellow be erase and the word honorary member insert by dr asa gray who sign the document as secretary some year later however she name be find in the list of fellow of this academy also of the american institute and of the american association for the advancement of science for many year she attend the annual convention of this last-mentioned association in which she take great interest the extract below refer to one of these meeting probably that of 1855 : August 23 it be really amusing to find one 's self lionize in a city where one have visit quietly for year to see the door of fashionable mansion open wide to receive you which never open before i suspect that the whole corps of science laugh in its sleeve at the farce the leader make it pay pretty well my friend professor bache make the occasion the opportunity for work sundry little wheel pulley and lever the result of all which be that he get he enormous appropriation of $ 400000 out of congress every winter for the maintenance of the united state coast survey for a few day science reign supreme -- we be fêted and compliment to the top of we bent and although complimenter and compliment must feel that it be only a sort of theatrical performance for a few day and over one do enjoy act the part of greatness for a while i be tire after three day of it and glad to take the car and run away the descent into a commoner be rather sudden i go alone to boston and when i reach out my free pass the conductor read it through and hand it back say in a gruff voice ` it be worth nothing a dollar and a quarter to boston ' think what a downfall the night before and ` one blast upon my bugle horn be worth a hundred man ' now one man alone be my dependence and that man look very much inclined to put I out of the car for attempt to pass a ticket that in he eye be valueless of course i take it quietly and pay the money merely remark ` you will pass a hundred person on this road in a few day on these same ticket ' when i look back on the paper read at this meeting by mr j -- in he uncouth manner i think when a man be thoroughly in earnest how careless he be of mere _ word _ in 1849 miss mitchell be ask by the late admiral davi who have just take charge of the american nautical almanac to act as computer for that work -- a proposition to which she gladly assent and for nineteen year she hold that position in addition to she other duty this of course make a very desirable increase to she income but not necessarily to she expense the table of the planet venus be assign to she in this year too she be employ by professor bache of the united state coast survey in the work of a astronomical party at mount independence maine 1853 i be tell that miss dix wish to see I and i call upon she it be dusk and i do not at once see she she voice be low not particularly sweet but very gentle she tell I that she have hear professor henry speak of I and that professor henry be one of she best friend the truest man she know when the light be bring in i look at she she must be past fifty she be rather small dress indifferently have good feature in general but indifferent eye she do not brighten up in countenance in converse she be so successful that i suppose there must be a hidden fire somewhere for heat be a motive power and she cold manners could never move legislature i see some outburst of fire when mr hale 's book be speak of it seem mr hale write to she for permission to publish a notice of she and be decidedly refuse another letter meet with the same answer yet she write a ` life ' which miss dix say be utterly false in she general sympathy for suffer humanity miss dix seem neglectful of the individual interest she have no family connection but a brother have never have sister and she seem to take little interest in the person whom she meet i be surprise at she feeling any desire to see I she be not strikingly interesting in conversation because she be so grave so cold and so quiet i ask she if she do not become at time weary and discourage and she say wearied but not discourage for she have meet with nothing but success there be evidently a strong will which carry all before it not like the sweep of the hurricane but like the slow steady and powerful march of the molten lava it be sad to see a woman sacrifice the tie of the affection even to do good i have no doubt miss dix do much good but a woman need a home and the love of other woman at least if she live without that of man the follow entry be make many year after : -- August 1871 i have just see miss dix again have meet she only once for a few minute in all the eighteen year she listen to a story of mine about some girl in need and then astonish I by a offer she make I feb 15 1853 i think dr hall -lrb- in he ` life of mary ware ' -rrb- do wrong when he attempt to encourage the use of the _ needle _ it seem to I that the needle be the chain of woman and have fetter she more than the law of the country once emancipate she from the ` stitch stitch stitch the industry of which would be commendable if it serve any purpose except the gratification of she vanity and she would have time for study which would engross as the needle never can i would as soon put a girl alone into a closet to meditate as give she only the society of she needle the art of sew so far as man learn it be well enough that be to enable a person to _ take the stitch _ and if necessary to make she own garment in a strong manner but the dressmaker should no more be a universal character than the carpenter suppose every man should feel it be he duty to do he own mechanical work of _ all _ kind would society be benefit would the work be well do yet a woman be expect to know how to do all kind of sew all kind of cooking all kind of any _ woman 's _ work and the consequence be that life be pass in learn these only while the universe of truth beyond remain unentered may 11 1853 i could not help thinking of esther -lrb- a much-loved cousin who have recently die -rrb- a few evening since when i be observe a meteor flash upon I suddenly very bright very short-lived it seem to I that it be send for I especially for it greet I almost the first instant i look up and be go in a second -- it be as fleeting and as beautiful as the smile upon esther 's face the last time i see she i think when i talk with she about death that though she could not come to I visibly she might be able to influence my feeling but it can not be for my faith have be weaker than ever since she die and my fear have be greater a few page farther on in the diary appear this poem : esther live the heart of all around seek hers as slave a throne die the reason first we find -- the fulness of she own she give unconsciously the while a wealth we all might share -- to I the memory of the smile that last i see she wear earth lose from out its meager store a bright and precious stone heaven could not be so rich before but it have richer grown sept 19 1853 i be surprise to find the verse which i pick up somewhere and have always admire -- ` oh reader have you in you mind such store as silent thought can bring oh gentle reader you would find a tale in everything ' -- belong to wordsworth and to one of wordsworth 's simple i be almost ready to say _ silly _ poem i be in doubt what to think of wordsworth i should be ashamed of some of he poem if i have write they myself and yet there be point of great beauty and line which once in the mind will not leave it oct 31 1853 people have to learn sometimes not only how much the heart but how much the head can bear my letter come from cambridge -lrb- the harvard observatory -rrb- and i have some work to do over it be a wearyful job but by dint of shut myself up all day i do manage to get through with it the good of my travel show itself then when i be too tired to read to listen or to talk for the beautiful scenery of the west be with I in the evening instead of the tedious column of logarithm it be a bless thing that these picture keep in the mind and come out at the needful hour i do not call they but they seem to come forth as a regulator for my tired brain as if they have be set sentinel-like to watch a proper time to appear November 1853 there be say to be no up or down in creation but i think the _ world _ must be _ low _ for people who keep themselves constantly before it do a great deal of stoop dec 8 1853 last night we have the first meeting of the class in elocution it be very pleasant but my deficiency of ear be never more apparent to myself we have exercise in the ascend scale and i practice after i come home with the family as audience h say my ear be competent only to vulgar hearing and i can not appreciate nice distinction i be sure that i shall never say that if i have be properly educate i should have make a singer a dancer or a painter -- i should have fail less perhaps in the last coloring i might have be good in for i do think my eye be better than those of any one i know feb 18 1854 if i should make out a calendar by my feeling of fatigue i should say there be six saturday in the week and one Sunday mr -- somewhat ridicule my plan of read milton with a view to he astronomy but i have find it very pleasant and have certainly a juster idea of milton 's variety of greatness than i have before i have fill several sheet with my annotation on the ` paradise lose ' which i may find useful if i should ever be oblige to teach either as a schoolma'am or a lecturer -lrb- footnote : this paper have be print since miss mitchell 's death in poet-lore june-july 1894 -rrb- march 2 1854 i ` sweep ' last night two hour by three period it be a grand night -- not a breath of air not a fringe of a cloud all clear all beautiful i really enjoy that kind of work but my back soon become tired long before the cold chill I i see two nebula in leo with which i be not familiar and that repay I for the time i be always the better for open-air breathing and be certainly mean for the wander life of the indian sept 12 1854 i be just through with a summer and a summer be to I always a try ordeal i have determine not to spend so much time at the atheneum another season but to put some one in my place who shall see the strange face and hear the strange talk how much talk there be about religion gile -lrb- footnote : rev henry gile -rrb- i like the best for he seem like myself to have no settled view and to be religious only in feeling he say he have no piety but a great sense of infinity yesterday i have a shaker visitor and to-day a catholic and the more i see and hear the less do i care about church doctrine the catholic a priest i have know as a atheneum visitor for some time he talk to-day on my ask he some question and talk better than i expect he be plainly full of intelligence full of enthusiasm for he religion and i suspect full of bigotry i do not believe he will die a catholic priest a young man of he temperament must find it hard to live without family tie and i shall expect to hear if i ever hear of he again that some good little irish girl have make he forget he vow my visitor in other respects have be of the average sort four woman have be delighted to make my acquaintance -- three man have think themselves in the presence of a superior be one offer I twenty-five cent because i reach he the key of the museum one woman have open a correspondence with I and several have tell I that they know friend of mine two have speak of I in small letter to small newspaper one say he do not see I and one say he do i have become harden to all neither compliment nor quarter-dollar rous any emotion my fit of humility which have trouble I all summer be shake however by the first cool breeze of autumn and the first walk take without perspiration sept 22 1854 on the evening of the 18th while ` sweeping ' there come into the field the two nebula in ursa major which i have know for many a year but which to my surprise now appear to be three the upper one as see from a invert telescope appear double-headed like one near the dolphin but much more decide than that the space between the two head be very plainly discernible and subtend a decide angle the bright part of this object be clearly the old nebula -- but what be the appendage have the nebula suddenly change be it a comet or be it merely a very fine night father decide at once for the comet i hesitate with my usual cowardice and forbid he give it a notice in the newspaper i watch it from 830 to 1130 almost without cessation and be quite sure at 1130 that its position have change with regard to the neighbor star i count its distance from the known nebula several time but the whole affair be difficult for there be fly cloud and sometimes the nebula and comet be too indistinct to be definitely see the 19th be cloudy and the 20th the same with the variety of occasional break through which i see the nebula but not the comet on the 21st come a circular and behold mr van arsdale have see it on the 13th but have not be sure of it until the 15th on account of the cloud i be too well pleased with have really make the discovery to care because i be not first let the dutchman have the reward of he sturdier frame and steadier nerve especially could i be a christian because the 13th be cloudy and more especially because i dread the responsibility of make the computation _ nolen volen _ which i must have do to be able to call it mine i make observation for three hour last night and be almost ill to-day from fatigue still i have work all day try to reduce the place and mean to work hard again to-night sept 25 1854 i begin to recompute for the comet with observation of cambridge and washington to-day i have have a fit of despondency in consequence of be oblige to renounce my own observation as too rough for use the best that can be say of my life so far be that it have be industrious and the best that can be say of I be that i have not pretend to what i be not October 10 as soon as i have run through the computation roughly for the comet so as to make up my mind that by my own observation -lrb- which be very wrong -rrb- the perihelion be pass and nothing more to be hope for from observation i seize upon a pleasant day and go to the cape for a excursion we go to yarmouth sandwich and plymouth enjoy the novelty of the new car-route it really seem like railway travel on we own island so much sand and so flat a country the little town too seem quaint and odd and the old gray cottage look as if they belong to the last century and be wake from a long nap by the railway whistle i think sandwich a beautiful and plymouth a interesting town i would fain have go off into some poetical quotation such as ` the break wave dash high ' or ` the pilgrim father where be they ' but k who have be there before desire I not to be absurd but to step quietly on to the half-buried rock and quietly off younger sister know a deal so i do as i be bid to do and it be just as well not to make myself hoarse without a appreciative audience i like the picture by sargent in pilgrim hall but see plymouth on a mild sunny day with everything look bright and pleasant it be difficult to conceive of the landing of the pilgrim as a event or that the settling of such a charming spot require any heroism the picture of course represent the dreariness of winter and my feeling be move by the chill appearance of the little child and the pathetic countenance of little peregrine white who consider that he be bear in the harbor be wonderfully grow up before they be welcome by samoset accord to history little peregrine be bear about December 6 and samoset meet they about march 16 so he be three month old but he be plainly a forward child for he look up very knowingly such a child have immortality thrust upon he from he birth it must have have a deadening influence upon he to know that he be a marked man whether he do anything worthy of mark or not he do not seem to have make any figure after he entrance into the world though he must have create a great sensation when he come October 17 i have just go over my comet computation again and it be humiliating to perceive how very little more i know than i do seven year ago when i first do this kind of work to be sure i have only once in the time compute a parabolic orbit but it seem to I that i know no more in general i think i be a little better thinker that i take thing less upon trust but at the same time i trust myself much less the world of learning be so broad and the human soul be so limited in power we reach forth and strain every nerve but we seize only a bit of the curtain that hide the infinite from we will it really unroll to we at some future time aside from the gratification of the affection in another world that of the intellect must be great if it be enlarged and its desire be the same nov 24 1854 yesterday jame freeman clarke the biographer of margaret fuller come into the atheneum it be plain that he come to see I and not the institution he rush into talk at once mostly on people and ask I about my astronomical labor as it be a kind of flattery i repay it in kind by ask he about margaret fuller he say she do not strike any one as a person of intellect or as a student for all she faculty be keep so much abreast that none have prominence i want to ask if she be a lovable person but i do not think he would be a unbiassed judge she be so much attach to he dec 5 1854 the love of one 's own sex be precious for it be neither provoke by vanity nor retain by flattery it be genuine and sincere i be grateful that i have have much of this in my life the comet look in upon we on the 29th it make a twilight call look sunny and bright as if it have just warm itself in the equinoctial ray a boy on the street call my attention to it but i find on hurry home that father have already see it and have range it behind building so as to get a rough position it be pipe cold but we go to work in good earnest that night and the next night on which we could see it which be not until April i be dreadfully busy and a host of little annoyance crowd upon I i have a good star near it in the field of my comet-seeker but _ what _ star on that rest everything and i could not be sure even from the catalogue for the comet and the star be so much in the twilight that i could get no good neighbor star we call it ariete or 707 then come a wax moon and we wax weary in try to trace the fainter and fainter comet in the mist of twilight and the glare of moonlight next i break a screw of my instrument and find that no screw of that description could be buy in the town i start off to find a man who could make one and engage he to do so the next day the next day be fast day all the world fast at least from labor however the screw be make and it fit nicely the cloud clear and we be likely to have a good night i put up my instrument but scarcely have the screw-driver touch the new screw than out it fly from its socket roll along the floor of the ` walk ' drop quietly through a crack into the gutter of the house-roof i hear it click and feel very much like use language unbecome to a woman 's mouth i put my eye down to the crack but could not see it there be but one thing to be do -- the floor-board must come up i get a hatchet but could do nothing i call father he bring a crowbar and pry up the board then crawl under it and find the screw i take good care not to lose it a second time the instrument be fairly mount when the cloud mount to keep it company and the comet and i again part in all observation the blow out of a light by a gust of wind be a very common and very annoying accident but i once meet with a much worse one for i drop a chronometer and it roll out of its box on to the ground we pick it up in a great panic but it have not even alter its rate as we find by later observation the glaring eye of the cat who nightly visit I be at one time very annoying and a man who climb up a fence and speak to I in the stillness of the small hour fairly shake not only my equanimity but the pencil which i hold in my hand he be quite innocent of any intention to do I harm but he give I a great fright the spider and bug which swarm in my observing-house i have rather a attachment for but they must not crawl over my recording-paper rat be my abhorrence and i learn with pleasure that some poison have be place under the transit-house one get attach -lrb- if the term may be use -rrb- to certain midnight apparition the aurora boreali be always a pleasant companion a meteor seem to come like a messenger from depart spirit and the blossoming of tree in the moonlight become a sight look for with pleasure aside from the study of astronomy there be the same enjoyment in a night upon the housetop with the star as in the midst of other grand scenery there be the same subdue quiet and grateful seriousness a calm to the troubled spirit and a hope to the despond even astronomer who be as well care for as be those of cambridge have they annoyance and even man as skilled as they be make blunder i have know one of the bond -lrb- footnote : of the harvard college observatory -rrb- with great effort turn that huge telescope down to the horizon to make a observation upon a blaze comet see there and when he have find it in he glass find also that it be not a comet but the nebula of andromeda a cluster of star on which he have spend much time and which he have make a special object of study dec 26 1854 they be wonderful man the early astronomer that be a great conception which now seem to we so simple that the earth turn upon its axis and a still greater one that it revolve about the sun -lrb- to show this last be worth a man 's lifetime and it really almost cost the life of galileo -rrb- somehow we be ready to think that they have a wider field than we for speculation that truth be all unknown it be easier to take the first step in its path but be the region of truth limited be it not infinite we know a few thing which be once hide and be know they seem easy but there be the flashing of the northern light -- ` across the lift they start and shift ' there be the conical zodiacal beam see so beautifully in the early evening of spring and the early morning of autumn there be the startling comet whose use be all unknown there be the brighten and flicker variable star whose cause be all unknown and the meteoric shower -- and for all of these the reason be as clear as for the succession of day and night they lie just beyond the daily mist of we mind but we eye have not yet pierce through it chapter iii 1855-1857 extract from diary -- rachel -- emerson -- a hard winter jan 1 1855 i put some wire into my little transit this morning i dread it so much when i find yesterday that it must be do that it disturb my sleep it be much easier than i expect i take out the little collimate screw first then i draw out the tube and in that i find a brass plate screw on the diaphragm which contain the line i be at first a little puzzle to know which screw hold this diaphragm in its place and as i be very anxious not to unscrew the wrong one i take time to consider and find i need turn only two then out slip the little plate with its three wire where five should have be two have be break as i do not know how to manage a spider 's web i take the hair from my own head take care to pick out white one because i have no black one to spare i put in the two after first stretch they over pasteboard by stick they with sealing-wax dissolve in alcohol into the little grooved line which i find when i have with great labor adjust these as i think firmly i perceive that some of the wax be on the hair and would make they yet coarser and they be already too coarse so i wash my little camel 's - hair brush which i have be use and begin to wash they with clear alcohol almost at once i wash out another wire and soon another and another i go to work patiently and put in the five perpendicular one besides the horizontal one which like the other have frizzle up and appear to melt away with another hour 's labor i get in the five when a rude motion raise they all again and i begin over just at one o'clock i have get they all in again i attempt then to put the diaphragm back into its place the sealing-wax be not dry and with a little jar i send the wire all agog this time they do not come out of the little grooved line into which they be put and i hasten to take out the brass plate and set they in parallel line i give up then for the day but as they look well and be certainly in firmly i do not consider that i have make a entire failure i think it nice ladylike work to manage such slight thread and turn such delicate screw but fine as be the hair of one 's head i shall seek something finer for i can see how clumsy they will appear when i get on the eyepiece and magnify they imperfection they look parallel now to the eye but with a magnifying power a very little crook will seem a billowy wave and a faint star will hide itself in one of the yawning abyss January 15 find the hair which i have put into my instrument not only too coarse but variable and disposed to curl themselves up at a change of weather i write to george bond to ask he how i should procure spider line he reply that the web from cocoon should be use and that i should find it difficult at this time of year to get at they i remember at once that i have see two in the library room of the atheneum which i have carefully refrain from disturbing i find they perfect and unrolled they fear that i might not succeed in manage they i procure some hair from c 's head c be not quite a year old he hair be remarkably fine and sufficiently long i make the perpendicular wire of the spider 's web break they and do the work over again a great many time i at length get all in cross the five perpendicular one with a horizontal one from c 's spinning-wheel after twenty-four hour ' exposure to the weather i look at they the spider-web have not change they be plainly use to a chill and make to endure change of temperature but c 's hair which have never feel a cold greater than that of the nursery nor a change more decide than from he mother 's arm to he father 's have knot up into a decide curl -- nb c may expect ringlet January 22 horace greeley in a article in a recent number of the ` tribune ' say that the fund leave by smithson be spend by the regent of that institution in publishing book which no publisher would undertake and which do no good to anybody now in we little town of nantucket with we little atheneum these volume be in constant demand i do not suppose that such work as those issue by the smithsonian regent be appreciate by all who turn they over but the ignorant learn that such thing exist they perceive that a higher cultivation than theirs be in the world and they be stimulate to strive after greater excellence so i steadily advocate in purchase book for the atheneum the lifting of the people ` let we buy not such book as the people want but book just above they want and they will reach up to take what be put out for they ' sept 10 1855 to know what one ought to do be certainly the hardest thing in life ` do ' be comparatively easy but there be no law for you individual case -- yours be one of a myriad there be law of right and wrong in general but they do not seem to bear upon any particular case in chess-playing you can refer to rule of movement for the chess-man be few and the position in which they may be place numerous as they be have a limit but be there any limit to the different position of human being around you be there any limit to the peculiarity of circumstance here a man however much of a copyist he may be by nature come down to simple originality unless he blindly follow the advice of some friend for there be no precedent in anything exactly like he case he must decide for himself and must take the step alone and fearfully cautiously and distrustingly must we all take many of we step for we see but a little way at best and we can foresee nothing at all September 13 i read this morning a article in ` putnam 's magazine ' on rachel i have be much interested in this woman as a genius though i be pained by the account of she career in point of moral and i be wearied with the glitter of she jewelry night put on a jewelled robe which few admire compare with the admiration for marketable jewelry the new york ` tribune ' descend to the rating of the value of those worn by she and it be the prominent point or rather it make the multitude of prominent point when she be speak of the writer in ` putnam ' do not go into these small matter but he attempt a criticism on act to which i be not entirely a convert he maintain that if a actor should really show a character in such light that we could not tell the impersonation from the reality the stage would lose its interest i do not think so we should draw back of course from physical suffering but yet we should be charm to suppose anything real which we have desire to see if we feel that we really meet cardinal wolsey or henry viii in he day of glory would it not be a lifelong memory to we very different from the effect of the stage and if for a few moment we really _ feel _ that we have meet they would it not lift we into a new kind of be what would we not give to see julius caesar and the soothsayer just as they stand in rome as shakspere represent they why we travel hundred of mile to see the place note for the doings of these old roman and if we could be make to believe that we meet one of the smaller man even of that day we ecstasy would be unbounded ' a tin pan so paint as to deceive be atrocious ' say this writer of course for we be not interested in a tin pan but give we a portrait of shakspere or milton so that we shall feel that we have meet they and i see no atrocity in the matter we honor the home of these man and we joy in the hope of see they what would be beyond see they in life October 31 i see rachel in ` phèdre ' and in ` adrienne ' i have previously ask a friend if i in my ignorance of act and in my inability to tell good from poor should really perceive a marked difference between rachel and she aid she think i should i do indeed in ` phèdre ' which i first saw she be not aid at all by she troupe they be evidently ill at ease in the greek dress and in greek manners while she have assimilate herself to the whole it be found on the play of euripide and even to rachel the passion which she represent as phèdre must have be too strange to be natural hippolytus refuse the love which phèdre offer after a long struggle with herself and this give cause for the violent burst in which rachel show she power it be a outburst of passion of which i have no conception and i feel as if i see a new order of be not a woman but a personified passion the vehemence and strength be wonderful it be in part very touching there be as fine a opportunity for aricium to show some power as for phèdre but the automaton who represent aricium have no power to show oenon whom i take to be the sister sarah be something of a actress but she part be so hateful that no one could applaud she i feel in read ` phèdre ' and in hear it that it be a play of high order and that i learn some little philosophy from some of its sentiment but for ` adrienne ' i have a contempt the play be write by scribe specially for rachel and the french acting be better do by the other performer than the greek i have always dislike to see death represent on the stage rachel 's representation be awful i could not take my eye from the scene and i hold my breath in horror the death be so much to the life it be say that she change color i do not know that she do but it look like a ghastly hue that come over she pale face i be displeased at the constant standing neither as greek nor as frenchman do they sit at all only when die do rachel need a chair they make love standing they tell long story stand they take snuff in that position hat in hand and rachel faint upon the breast of some friend from the same fatiguing attitude the audience to hear ` adrienne ' be very fine the unitarian clergyman and the divinity student seem to have turn out most of the two thousand listener follow with the book and when the last word be utter on the french page over turn the two thousand leave sound like a shower of rain the applause be never very great it be say that rachel feel this as a boston peculiarity but she ought also to feel the compliment of so large a audience in a city where foreigner be so few and the population so small compare to that of new york nov 14 1855 last night i hear emerson give a lecture i pity the reporter who attempt to give it to the world i begin to listen with a determination to remember it in order but it be without method or order or system it be like a beam of light move in the undulatory wave meet with occasional meteor in its path it be exceedingly captivating it surprise I that there be not only no commonplace thought but there be no commonplace expression if he quote he quote from what we have not read if he tell a anecdote it be one that have not reach we at the outset he be very severe upon the science of the age he say that inventor and discoverer help themselves very much but they do not help the rest of the world that a great man be feel to the center of the copernican system that a botanist dry he plant but the plant have they revenge and dry the botanist that a naturalist bottle up reptile but in return the man be bottle up there be a pitiful truth in all this but there be glorious exception professor peirce be anything but a formulum though he deal in formula the lecture turn at length upon beauty and it be evident that personal beauty have make emerson its slave many a time and i suppose every heart in the house admit the truth of he word it be evident that mr emerson be not at ease for he declare that good manners be more than beauty of face and good expression better than good feature he mention that sir philip sydney be not handsome though the boast of english society and he speak of the astonishing beauty of the duchess of hamilton to see whom hundred collect when she take a ride i think in these case there be something besides beauty there be rank in that of the duchess in the case of sydney there be no need of beauty at all dec 16 1855 all along this year i have feel that it be a hard year -- the hardest of my life and i have keep enumerate to myself my many trial to-day it suddenly occur to I that my blessing be much more numerous if mother 's illness be a sore affliction she recovery be a great blessing and even the illness itself have its bright side for we have joy in show she how much we prize she continued life if i have lose some friend by death i have not lose all if i have work harder than i feel that i could bear how much better be that than not to have as much work as i want to do i have earn more money than in any preceding year i have study less but have observe more than i do last year i have save more money than ever before hope for europe in 1856 miss mitchell from she earliest childhood have have a great desire to travel in europe she receive a very small salary for she service in the atheneum but small as it be she lay by a little every year she dress very simply and spend as little as possible on herself -- which be also true of she later year she take a little journey every year and could always have little present ready for the birthday and christmas day and for the necessary book which could not be find in the atheneum library and which she feel that she ought to own herself -- all this on a salary which a ordinary school-girl in these day would think too meager to supply she with dress alone in this family the child be not ashamed to say i can not afford it and be teach that nothing be cheap that they could not pay for -- a lesson that have be valuable to they all they life 1855 deacon greeley of boston urge my go to boston and give some lecture to get money i tell he i could not think of it just now as i want to go to europe ` on what money ' say he ` what i have earn ' i reply ` bless I ' say he ` be i talk to a capitalist what a mistake i have make ' during the time of the prosperity of the town the winter be very sociable and lively but when the inhabitant begin to leave for more favorable opportunity for get a livelihood the change be feel very seriously especially in the case of a exceptionally stormy winter here be a extract show how miss mitchell and she family live during one of these winter : jan 22 1857 hard winter be become the order of thing winter before last be hard last winter be harder and this surpass all winter know before we have be freeze into we island now since the 6th no one care much about it for the first two or

march 2 1857 i leave meadville this morning at six o'clock in a stage-coach for erie i have early in life a love for staging but it be fast die out nine hour over a rough road be enough to root out the most passionate love of that kind we stage be well fill but in spite of the solid base we occasionally find ourselves bump up against the roof or fall forward upon we opposite neighbor stage-coach be i believe always the arena for political debate to-day we be all on one side all buchanan man and yet all anti-slavery it seem reasonable as they say that the south should cease to push the slave question in regard to kansas now that it have elect its president when i take the stage out to meadville on the ` mud-road ' it be fill with fremont man and they seem to I more able man though they be no younger and no more cultivate march 5 i believe any one might travel from maine to georgium and be perfectly ignorant of the route and yet be well take care of mainly from the good-nature in every one i find from nantucket to chicago more attention than i desire i have a short seat in one of the car through the night i do not think it large enough for two and so coiled myself up and go to sleep there be man stand all around once one of they come along and say something about there be room for he on my seat another man say ` she be asleep do not disturb she ' i be too selfish to offer the half of a short seat and too tired to reason about the man 's be possibly more tired than i i be invariably offer the seat near the window that i might lean against the side of the car and one gentleman throw he shawl across my knee to keep I warm -lrb- i be suffer with heat at the time -rrb- another see I go to chicago alone warn I to beware of the imposition of hack-driver tell I that i must pay two dollar if i do not make a bargain beforehand i find it true for i pay one dollar for go a few step only one peculiarity in travel from east to west be that you lose the old man in the car in new england you see white-headed man and i keep one in the train up to new york and one of grayish-tinted hair as far as erie but after cleveland no man be over forty year old for hundred of mile the prairie land stretch on the illinois central railroad between chicago and st loui it may be pleasant in summer but it be a dreary waste in winter the space be too broad and too uniform to have beauty the girdle of tree would be pretty doubtless if see near but in the distance and in winter it be only a black border to a brown plain the state of illinoi must be capitally adapt to railroad on account of this level and but little danger can threaten a train from run off of the track as it might run on the soil nearly as well as on the rail we engine be uncouple and have go on for nearly half a mile without the car before the conductor perceive it the time from chicago to st loui be call fifteen hour and a quarter we make it twenty-three if the prairie land be good farming-land illinoi be destine to be a great state if its people will think less of the dollar and more of the refinement of social life and the culture of the mind it may become the great state of the union yet march 12 planter 's hotel st loui we visit mercantile hall and the library the lecture-room be very spacious and very pretty no gallery hide the frescoed wall and no painful economy have be make of the space on the floor 13th i begin to perceive the commerce of st loui we go upon the levee this morning and for mile the edge be border with the pipe of steamboat stand like a picket-fence then we come to the wholesale street and see the immense store for dry-goods and crockery to-day i have hear of a scientific association call the ` scientific academy of st loui ' which be about a year old

a man of more than sixty year gray-haired healthy-looking and pleasant in manners he have spend long year of labor in decipher the inscription find upon ancient pillar egyptian and arabic date five thousand year before christ i ask he if he find the observation continuous and he say that he do not but that they seem to be astrological picture of the configuration of the planet and to have be make at the birth of prince he have just be read the slab send from nineveh by mr marsh they date be only about five hundred year bc mr seyffarth 's publish work amount to seventy and he be surprise to find a whole set of they in the astor library in new york march 19 we come on board of the steamer ` magnolia ' this morning in great spirit we be a little late and miss s rush on board as if she have only new orlean in view i follow a little more slowly and the brigadier-general come after in a sober and dignified manner we be scarcely on board when the plank be pull in and a few minute pass and we be afloat on the mississippus river miss s and myself be the only lady passenger we have therefore the whole range of stateroom from which to choose each could have a stateroom to herself and we talk in admiration of the pleasant time we should have watch the scenery from the stateroom window or from the saloon reading etc we start off finely i who have be use only to the rough water of the atlantic coast be surprise at the steady glide of the boat i see nothing of the mingling of the water of the missourus and the mississippus of which i have be tell perhaps i need somebody to point out the difference the two bank of the river be at first much alike but after a few hour the left bank become more hilly and at interval present bluff and rock rude and irregular in shape which we imagine to be ruin of some old castle at interval too we pass steamer go up to st loui all laden with passenger we exult in we majestic march over the water i think it the very perfection of travel and wish that all my family and all my friend be on board i wonder at the stupidity of the rest of the world and think that they ought all to leave the mart of business to step from the desk the counting-room and the workshop on board the ` magnolia ' and go down the length of the ` father of water ' and so they would i suppose but for sand-bar here we be five hour out and fast aground we be just at dinner the captain make himself agreeable the dinner show itself to be good when a peculiar motion of the boat make the captain heave a sigh -- he have be heave the lead all the morning ` ah ' he say ` just what i fear we have get to one of those bad place and we be rub the bottom ' i ask very innocently if we must wait for the tide and be inform that there be no tide feel on this part of the river miss s turn a little pale and show a loss of appetite i be a little bit move but keep it to myself and eat on as soon as dinner be over we go out to look at the prospect of affair we be close into the land and could be put on shore any minute the captain have send round a little boat to sound the water and the report bring back be of shallow water just ahead of we but more on the right and leave while we stand on deck a small boat pass and a sailor very gleefully call out the sounding as he throw the lead ` eight and a half-nine ' but we be still high and dry now at two o'clock pm they be shake the steamer and make effort to move she they say if she get over this there be no worse place for she to meet i ask the captain of what the bottom be compose and he say ` of mud rock snag and everything ' he be now move very cautiously and the boat have a unpleasant tremulous motion march 20 latitude about thirty-eight degree we be just where we stop at noon yesterday -- there be no change and of course no event one of we crew kill a ` possum yesterday and another boat stop near we this morning and seem likely to lie as long as we do on the sand-bar we read shakspere this morning after breakfast and then betake ourselves to the wheel-house to look at the scenery again while there a little colored boy come to we bear a waiter of orange and tell we that the captain send they with he compliment we eat they greedily because we have nothing else to do 21st still the sand-bar no hope of get off we hear the pilot hail a steamboat which be go up to st loui and tell they to send on a lighter and i suppose we must wait for that it be my private opinion that this great boat will not get off at all but will lie here until she petrify march 24 we leave the ` magnolia ' after four day and four hour upon the sand-bar near turkey island upon see the ` woodruff ' approach we leave in a little rowboat and it seem at first as if we could not overtake the steamer but the captain see we and slacken he speed miss s and i clutch hand in a little terror as we small boat seem likely to run under the great steamer but we oarsman know they duty and we be safely put on board of the ` woodruff ' march 25 we stop at cairo at eight o'clock this morning mr s go on shore and bring newspaper on board the cairo paper i do not think of high order i see no mention in it of the detention of the ` magnolia ' march 26 yesterday we count as a day of event it begin to look sunny on the bank especially on the kentucky side and miss s and i see cherry-blossom we remember the eclipse and mr s have bring with he a piece of broken glass from one of the window of the ` magnolia ' i smoked it over a piece of candle which i have bring from room no 22 of the planter 's house at st loui and we prepare to see the eclipse i expect to see the moon on at five o'clock and twenty minute but as i have no time i could not tell when to look for it it be not on at that time by my watch but in ten minute after be so far on that i think my time can not be much wrong it be a little cloudy so that we see the sun only ` all fleck with bar ' and catch sight of the phenomenon at interval we be at a coal-landing at the time and not far from madrid the boat stop so long to take in a immense pile of corn-bag that we passenger go on shore -- such of they as could climb the slippery bank when we see they come back laden with peach-blossom and see the little child dress they hat with they we be seize with a longing for they and mr s offer to go and get we some we beg to go too but he object we be really envious of he good luck when we see he jump into a country wagon draw by ox which trot off like horse and wave he handkerchief to we ride off in great glee he come back with a armful of peach-tree branch whose orchard he rob at we instigation i can not say a little girl the daughter of the captain pull some blossom open and show we that the fruit germ be not dead but would have become peach if we have not covet they the 25th be also we first night steam-boating after pass cairo the river be consider safe for night travel and the boat start on she way at 830 pm we have be out about half a hour when a lady who be play card throw down she card and rush with a shriek to she stateroom i perceive then that there have be a peculiar motion to the boat and that it suddenly stop we find that one of the paddle-wheel be catch in a snag but there be no harm do it make we a little nervous but we sleep well enough after it when i look out upon the river i wonder that boat be not continually snag little tree be stick up on all side and sometimes we seem to be go over a meadow and push among rush a yawl which be send out yesterday to sound be snag by a stump which be high out of water probably they be carry on to it by a current the little boat whirl round and round and the man be plainly frighten for they drop they oar and clutch the side of the boat they get control however in a few minute and have the jeer of the man leave on the steamer for they pain march 30 we stop at natchez before breakfast this morning and have half a hour we take a carriage and drive through the city it be like drive through a succession of garden : rose be hang over the fence in the richest profusion and the arbor-vita be ornament every little nook and adorning every cottage natchez stand on a high bluff very romantic in appearance jagged and rugged as if volcano have be at work in a time long past for tall tree grow in the ravine most of we lady passenger be like ourselves on a tour of pleasure six of they go with we to the st charle hotel some be from keokuk ia and i think i like these the best one young lady go ashore to spend some time on a plantation as a governess she look feeble and we all pity she to-day we pass among plantation on both side of the river we begin to see the live-oak -- a noble tree the foliage be so thick and dark that i have learn to know it by its color the magnolia tree too be become fragrant march 31 we be at length in new orlean and up three flight at the st charle in a dark room the peculiarity of the city dawn upon I very slowly i first notice the showy dress of the child then the turbaned head of the black woman in the street and next the bouquet-selling boy with they french phrase April 3 this morning we go to a slave market it look on first entrance like a intelligence office man woman and child be seat on long bench parallel with each other all rise at we entrance and continue standing while we be there we be tell by the trader to walk up and down the passage between they and talk with they as we like as mr s pass the man several lift they hand and say ` here be the boy that will suit you i can do any kind of work ' some advertise themselves with a good deal of tact one woman pull at my shawl and ask I to buy she i tell she that i be not a housekeeper ` not marry ' she ask -- ` no ' -- ` well then get marry and buy I and my husband ' there be a girl among they whiter than i who rouse my sympathy very much i could not speak to she for the past and the future be too plainly tell in she face i speak to another a bright-looking girl of twelve ` where be you raise ' -- ` in kentucky ' -- ` and why be you to be sell ' -- ` the trader come to kentucky buy I and bring I here ' i think what right have i to be homesick when that poor girl have leave all she kindred for life without she consent i could hold my tongue and look around without much outward show of disgust but to talk pleasantly to the trader i could not consent he tell I that he have be bring up in the business but he think it a pity no buyer be present so there be no examination that be painful to look upon the slave be intelligent-looking and very healthy and neat in appearance those who belong to one owner be dress alike -- some in striped pink and white dress other in plaid all a little showy the man be in thick trousers and coarse dark-blue jacket April 5 we have be this morning to a negro church we find it a miserable-looking house mostly unpainted and unplastered but well fill with the swarthy face they be sing when we enter we be pointed to a good seat there may have be fifty person present all well dress the woman in the fanciful checkered headdress so much favor by the negro race the man in clean collar nankin trousers and dark coat all show that they be well keep and well feed the audience be increase by new comer frequently and these whatever the exercise might be shake hand with those around they as they seat themselves and join immediately in the service the singing be by the whole congregation the minister lining out the hymn as in the early time in new england several person carry on the exercise from the pulpit and in the prayer and sermon the audience take a active part respond in groan ` oh yes ' or ` aman ' sometimes perform a kind of chant to accompany the word a negro minister say in he prayer ' o god we be not for much talk ' i be delighted at the prospect of a short discourse but i find he ` not much talk ' exactly correspond to ' a good deal ' in my use of word he talk for a full hour there be something pleasing in the earnestness of the preacher and the sympathetic feeling of the audience but they peculiar condition be not allude to and probably be not feel the discourse be almost ludicrous at time and at time be pathetic i save up a few specimen : ' o god you have say that where one or two be gather together in you name there will you be if anything stand between we that you can not come put it aside ' ` god want a kingdom upon earth with which he can coin-cide and that kingdom be you heart ' ` god be near you when you be at the wash-tub or the ironing-table ' ` brethren i think last sabbath i would not live to this a man get such a notion sometimes ' April 9 alabama river some lesson we of the north might learn from the south and one be a greater regard for human life i ask the captain of we boat if they have any accident in these water he say ` we do not kill people at the south we give that up some year ago we leave it to the north and the north seem to be capable of do it ' the reason for this be that they be in no hurry the southern character be oppose to haste safety be of more worth than speed and there be no hurry every one at the south introduce its ` peculiar institution ' into conversation they talk as i expect southern people of intelligence to talk they lament the evil and say ` it be upon we what can we do to give they freedom would be cruel ' southerner fall back upon the bible at once there be more of the old-fashioned religion at the south than at the north that be they be not intellectual religionist they be shock by the irreligion of massachusett and by theodore parker they read the bible and can quote it they be ready with it as a argument at every turn i be of course not use to the warfare and so withdraw from the fight one argument which three person have bring up to I be the superior condition of the black now to what it would have be have they parent remain in africa and they be child of the soil i make no answer to this for if this be a argument it would be we duty to enslave the heathen instead of attempt to enlighten they we hear some anecdote which be amusing a judge smith of south carolina move to alabama and become a prominent man there he be send to the senate he be violently oppose by a young man who say that but for he gray hair he would challenge he judge smith say ` you be not the first coward who have take shelter beneath my gray hair ' the same judge smith when a proposition come before the senate to build a state penitentiary say ` wall in the city of mobile you will have you penitentiary and its inmate ' so far i have find it easier to travel without a escort south and west than at the north that be i have more care take of I every one be courteous too in speech i know that they can not love massachusett but they be careful not to wind my feeling they acknowledge it to be the great state in education they point to a pretty village and say ` almost as neat as a new england village ' savannah April 15 to-day we leave town at ten o'clock for a drive in any direction that we like mr f and i go in a buggy and miss s canter behind we on she horse the road that we take lead to some rice plantation ten mile out of the city we path be ornament by the live-oaks cedar tree the dogwood and occasionally the mistletoe and enliven sometimes by the whistle of the mocking-bird down low by the wheel grow the wild azalea and the jessamine above we head the spanish moss hang from the tree in beautiful drapery by mistake we drive into the plantation grounds of mr gibbon a man of wealth who be seldom on he land and where the avenue be therefore a little wild and the road a little rough we come afterwards upon a road lead under the most magnificent oak that i ever see i feel as if i be under the arched roof of some ancient cathedral the tree be irregularly group and of immense size throw they hundred of arm far upon the background of heaven and bear the drapery of the spanish moss fold upon fold as if they seek to keep they raiment from touch the earth i be perfectly delighted and think it the finest picture i have yet see retrace we step we seek the plantation of mr potter -- a very different one from that of mr gibbon as all be finish and neatness a fine mansion well store with book and some fine oak some of which mr potter have plant himself mr potter walk through the field with we and stop among the negro hut he say to a little boy ` call the child and give we some singing ' the little boy run off shout ` come and sing for massa ' and in a few minute the little darky might be see run through the field and tumble over the fence in they anxiety to get to we to the number of eighteen they sit upon the ground around we and begin they song the boy who lead sing ` early in the morning ' and the other seventeen bring in a chorus of ` let we think of jesus ' then the leader set up something about ` god almicha ' to which the other bring in another chorus they be a dirty and shabby look set but as usual fat even to the little baby whom the larger boy be tend one little girl as she pass mr potter carelessly put she hand in he and say ` good morning massa ' mr g tell I a anecdote which show the southern sentiment on the one subject the lady of charleston be much pleased with miss murray and get up for she

talk with a richness of expression which show a full mind mr holbrook be a rutledge and it be amusing after see she to open miss bremer 's ` home of the new world ' and read she extravagant comment miss bremer be certainly make happy at belmont April 29 to-day i have be to see miss pinckney she be the last representative of she name be over eighty and still retain the animation of youth though somewhat shake in she physical strength by age i find she sit in a armchair she foot rest upon a cushion surround by some half-dozen caller she rise at once when i enter and insist upon my occupy she seat while she take a less comfortable one the wall of the room be ornament with portrait of major-general pinckney by stuart stuart 's washington one by morri of general thoma pinckney and a portrait of miss pinckney 's mother miss pinckney be a very plain woman but much beloved for she benevolence it be say that on look over she diary which she keep record the reason for she many gift to she friend and to she slave such entry as these will be find : ' $ -- to mary because she be marry ' ' $ -- to julium because she have no husband ' miss pinckney show I among she centre-table ornament a miniature of washington one of she grandmother of exceed beauty one of each of the pinckney whose portrait be on the wall charleston be full of ante-revolution house and they please I they be build when there be no hurry they be build to last and they have last and will yet last for the child of they present possessor nothing can be happier in expression than the face of the colored child they have what must be the ease of the lower class in a despotic country the slave have no care no ambition they place be a fix one -- they know it and take all the good they can get the child be fat sleek and inherit no nervous longing from they parent be on a constant grin -- at play with loud laugh and high leap may 1 it do not follow because the slave be sleek and fat and really happy -- for happy i believe they be -- that slavery be not a evil and the great evil be as i always suppose in the effect upon the whites the few southern gentleman that i know interest I from they courtesy agreeable manners and ready speech they also strike I as childlike and fussy i catch myself feel that i be the man and they be woman and i see this even in the captain of a steamer then they all like to talk sentiment -- they religion be a feeling may 2 the negro be remarkable for they courtesy of manner those who belong to good family seem to pride themselves upon they dress and style a lady walk in charleston be never jostle by black or white man the white man step out of she way the black man do this and touch he hat the black woman bow -- she be distinguish by she neat dress she clean plaid head-dress and she upright carriage it would be well for some of we young lady to carry burden on they head even to the risk of flatten the instep if by that mean they could get the straight back of a slave mr w who take we out to drive come with she black coachman and a little boy the coachman wear white glove and look like a gentleman the little boy ring door-bell when we stop when it rain the other day mr w drop the window of the carriage and desire the two to put on they shawl for fear they would take cold they be plainly a great care to they owner for they be like child and can not take care of themselves and yet in another way the master be like child from the constant wait upon that they receive one would think where one class do all the thinking and the other all the work that master would be active thinker and slave ready worker but neither result seem to happen -- both be listless and inactive may 3 i ask miss pinckney to-day if she remember george washington she and mr poinsett speak at once ` oh yes we be child ' say mr poinsett ` but my father would have he come to see we and he take each of we in he arm and kiss we and at another time we go to mt vernon and make he a visit ' never be more intelligent old lady than mr poinsett and miss pinckney the latter step around like a young girl and bring a heavy book to show I the sketch of she sister marie henrietta pinckney who in the nullification time of 1830 write a pamphlet in defense of the state miss pinckney 's father be the originator of the celebrated maxim ` million for defense but not one cent for tribute ' they house be the headquarters for the nullifier and they have serenade she say without number it be pleasant to hear the old lady chatter away and it be interesting to think of the distinguished man who have be under that roof and of the cultivate and beautiful woman who have adorn the mansion miss pinckney when i leave follow I to the door and put into my hand a elegant little volume of poem call ` reliquiaus ' they seem to be simple effusion of some person who die early may 9 we leave charleston its old house and its good people on Monday and reach augusta the same day augusta be prettily lay out but the place be of little interest and for the hotel where we stay i can only give this advice to its inmate : ` do not examine a black spot upon you pillow-case go to sleep at once and keep asleep if you can ' when we be on the road from augusta to atlanta the conductor say ` if you be go on to nashville you will be on the road in the night people do not love to go on that road in the night i do not know why ' when we come to the nashville road i think that i know ` why ' the road run around the base of a mountain while directly beneath it at a great depth run a river a dash off the track on one side would be against the mountain on the other side would be into the river while the sharp turn seem to invite such a catastrophe when we be somewhat work up to a nervous excitement the car would plunge into the darkness of a tunnel -- darkness such as i almost feel it be a picturesque but weary ride and we be tired and hungry when we reach nashville may 11 to-day we have be out for a two-hour ' drive it be warm cloudy and look like a tempest we be too tired for much effort mr fogg of nashville take we to call on the widow of president polk we find she at home though apparently just ready for a walk she be still in mourning and tell I that she have not travel fifty mile from home in the last eight year she speak to I of governor brigg -lrb- of massachusett -rrb- a old friend of professor hare and say that among she card on she return from a journey some year ago she find charle sumner 's and forget at the moment who he be she ask the servant who he be ` the abolitionist senator from massachusett -- i ask he in ' be the reply mr polk talk readily be handsome elegant in figure and show at once that she be well read she tell I that she read all the newspaper report of the progress of science she live simply as any new england woman would though she house be larger than most private residence mr fogg tell I many anecdote of dorothea dix that lady be at one time travel alone and be oblige to stop at some little village tavern as she lay half asleep upon the sofa the driver of the stage in which she be to take passage come into the room approach she and hold a light to she closed eye she do not dare to move nor utter a sound but when he turn away she open she eye and watch he he go to the mail-bag open they take out the letter hastily break the seal take out money enclose put it into he pocket close the bag and again approach she with he lamp she shut she eye and pretend to sleep again then at the proper time enter the stage and pursue she journey at the end of the journey she report he conduct to the proper authority i be a little doubtful about the propriety of go to the mammoth cave without a gentleman escort but if two lady travel alone they must have the courage of man so i call the landlord as soon as we arrive at the cave house and ask if we could have mat who i have be tell be the best guide now that stephen be ill the landlord promise mat to I for two day after dinner we make we first attempt the ground descend for some two hundred foot towards the mouth of the cave then you come to a low hill and you descend through a small aperture not at all impose in front of which trickle a little stream for some little while we need no light but soon the guide light and give to each of we a little lamp mat take the lead i come next miss s follow and a old slave bring up in the rear i confess that i shudder as i come into the darkness we lamp of course give but feeble light we barely see at first where we foot must step i look up try in vain to find the ceiling or the wall all be darkness in about a hour we see more clearly the chamber be many of they elliptical in shape the ceiling be of mixed dark and white color and look much like the sky on a cloudy moonlight evening a friend of ours who have be much in the cave say ` if the top be lift off and the whole be expose to view no woman would ever enter it again ' we clamber over heap of rock we descend ladder wind through narrow passage pass along chamber so low that we crouch for the whole length enter upon lofty hall ascend ladder and cross a bridge over a yawning abyss every nightmare scene that i have ever dream of seem to be realize i shudder several time and be oblige to reason with myself to assure I of safety occasionally we sit down and rest upon some flat rock miss s who have a great taste for costuming wound she plaid shawl about she shoulder turban she head with a green veil swing she lamp upon a stick which she rest upon she shoulder and then throw herself upon a rock in a most picturesque attitude the guide take a lower seat and he dirty tin cup swing across he breast look like a ornament as the light strike it he swarthy face be bright and i wonder what we friend at home would give for a picture one of these elliptical hall have its ceiling immensely far off and of the deepest black until we feeble little light strike upon innumerable point when it shine forth like a dark starlight night the star be faint but they look so exceedingly like the heaven that one easily forget that it be not reality the guide ask we to be seat while he go behind down a descent with the light to show we the creep over of the shadow of the rock as if a dark cloud pass over the starlit vault the black cloud creep on and on as the guide descend until a fear come over we and we cry out together to he to come back not to leave we in total darkness he beg that he might go still lower and show we entire darkness but we would not permit it guin 's dome what the name mean i can not say the guide tell you to pause in you scramble over loose stone and muddy soil -- which you be always willing to do -- and to put you head through a circular aperture and to look up while he light the bengal light you obey and look up upon column of fluted snowy whiteness he tell you to look down and you follow the same pillar down -- up to height which the light can not climb down to depths on which it can not fall you shudder as you look up and you shudder as you look down indeed the march of the cave be a series of shudder geologist may enjoy it a large party may be merry in it but if the ` underground railroad ' of the slave be of that kind i should rather remain a slave than undertake a runaway trip may 18 to-day we retrace we step from nashville to chattanooga it have be rain nearly all night and we find when not far from the latter place that the stream be pour down from the high land upon the car-track so that we come through river when we dash into the dark tunnel it be darker than ever from the darkness of the day and it seem to I that the darkness press upon I i be sure i should keep my sens a very little while if i be confine in a dark place as we come out of the tunnel the water from the hill above dash upon the car and although it do not break the pane of glass it force its way through and sprinkle we the route with all its terror be beautiful and the tree be now much finer than they be ten day ago may 27 there be this great difference between niagara and other wonder of the world : that of it you get no idea from description or even from painting of the ` mammoth cave ' you have a conception from what you be tell of the natural bridge you get a really truthful impression from a picture but cave and bridge be in still life niagara be all activity and change no picture give you the vary form of the water or the change of color no description convey to you mind the ceaseless roar so too the ocean must be unrepresentable to those who have not look upon it the natural bridge stand out bold and high just as you expect to see it you be agreeably disappointed however on find that you can go under the arch and be completely in the coolness of its shade while you look up for two hundred foot to the rocky black and white ceiling above one of the prettiest peculiarity be the fringing above of the tree which hang over the edge and look out past the arch the wooded bank of the ravine be very pleasant from above one have the pain always attendant to I upon look down into a abyss but at the same time one obtain a better conception of the depth of the valley it be well worth see partly for itself partly because it can be reach only by a ride among the hill of the blue ridge chapter v 1857 first european tour -- liverpool -- the hawthorne -- london -- greenwich observatory -- admiral smyth -- dr lee shortly after she return from the south miss mitchell start again for a tour in europe with the same young girl miss mitchell carry letter from eminent scientific people in this country to such person as it would be desirable for she to know in europe especially to astronomer and mathematician when miss mitchell go to europe she take she almanac work with she and what time she be not sight-seeing she be continue that work she wisdom in this respect be very soon apparent she have not be in england many week when a great financial crisis take place in the united state and the father of she young charge succumb to the general failure the young lady be call home but after consider the matter seriously miss mitchell decide to remain herself put the young lady into careful hand for the return passage from liverpool miss mitchell enjoy the society of the scientific people whom she meet in england to she heart 's content she be very cordially receive and the astronomer not only open they observatory to she but welcome she into they family life on arrive at liverpool miss mitchell deliver the letter to the astronomer live in or near that city and visit they observatory aug 3 1857 i bring a letter from professor silliman to mr john taylor cotton merchant and astronomer and to-day i have take tea with he he be a old man nearly eighty i should think but full of life and talk by the hour on heathen mythology he be the principal agent in the establishment of the liverpool observatory but disclaim the honor because it be establish on so small a scale compare with he own gigantic plan mr taylor have invent a little machine for show the approximate position of a comet have the element he have also make addition to the globe make by de morgan so that they can be use for any year and show the correct rise and set of the star he strike I as be a man of taste but of no great profundity he have a painting which he believe to be by guido it seem to I too fresh in its color for the sixteenth century August 4 3 pm i put down my pen because old mr taylor call and while he be here rev jame martineau come mr martineau be one of the handsomest man i ever see he can not be more than thirty or if he be he have keep he dark hair remarkably he have large bluish-gray eye and be tall and elegant in manner he say he be just pack to move to london he give I he london address and hope he should see I there but i doubt if he do for i do not like to tell he my address unless he ask for it for fear of seem to be push August i have be to visit mr lassell he call yesterday and ask I to dine with he to-day he have a charming place about four mile out of liverpool a pretty house and grounds mr lassell have construct two telescope both on the newtonian plan one of ten the other of twenty foot in length each have its separate building and in the smaller building be a transit instrument mr lassell must have be a most indefatigable worker as well as a most ingenious man for besides construct he own instrument he have find time to make discovery he be besides very genial and pleasant and tell I some good anecdote connect with astronomical observation one story pleased I very much we massachusett astronomer alvan clark have long be a correspondent of mr dawe but have never see he wish to have a idea of he person and be a portrait painter mr clark send to mr dawe for he daguerreotype and from that paint a likeness which he have send out to liverpool and which be say to be excellent mr lassell look in at the side of he reflect telescope by means of a diagonal eye-piece when the instrument be point at object of high altitude he hang a ladder upon the dome and mount the ladder move around with the dome mr lassell work only for he own amusement and have be to malta -- carry he larger telescope with he -- for the sake of clearer sky neither mr lassell nor mr hartnup -lrb- footnote : of the liverpool observatory -rrb- make regular observation the miss lassell four in number seem to be very accomplish they take photograph of each other which be beautiful make they own picture-frame and work in the same workshop with they father one of they tell I that she make observation on my comet suppose it to belong to mr dawe who be a friend of hers they keep a album of the autograph of they scientific visitor and among they i see those of professor young of dartmouth and of professor loomi August 4 i have just return from a visit to the liverpool observatory under the direction of mr hartnup it be situate on waterloo dock and the pier of the observatory rest upon the sandstone of that region the telescope be a equatorial like many good instrument in we country it be almost unused mr hartnup 's observatory be for nautical purpose i find he a very gentlemanly person and very willing to show I anything of interest about the observatory but they make no regular series of astronomical observation other than those require for the commerce of liverpool mr hartnup have a clock which by the application of a electric current control the action of other clock especially the town clock of liverpool -- distant some mile the current of electricity be not the motive power but a corrector much attention be pay to meteorology the pressure of the wind the horizontal motion and the course be record upon sheet of paper run upon cylinder and connect with the clock the instrument which obey the voice of the wind be outside aug 5 1857 i do not send my letter to mr hawthorne until yesterday suppose that he be not in the city but yesterday when rev jame martineau call on I he say that he have not yet leave mr martineau say that it would be a great loss to liverpool when mr hawthorne go away i send my letter at once from all that i have hear of mr hawthorne 's shyness i think it doubtful if he would call and i be therefore very much pleased when he card be send in this morning mr hawthorne be more chatty than i have expect but not any more diffident he remain about five minute during which time he take he hat from the table and put it back once a minute brushing it each time the engraving in the book be much like he he be not handsome but look as the author of he book should look a little strange and odd as if not of this earth he have large bluish-gray eye he hair stand out on each side so much so that one 's thought naturally turn to comb and hair-brush and toilet ceremony as one look at he later when miss mitchell be in pari alone on she way to rome she send to the hawthorne who be also in pari ask for the privilege of join they as they too be journey in the same direction she say in she diary : mr hawthorne be feeble and she tell I that she object but that mr hawthorne assure she that i be a person who would give no trouble therefore she consent we be about ten day on the journey to rome and three month in rome living however some street asunder i see they nearly every day like everybody else i find mr hawthorne very taciturn he few word be however very tell when i talk french he tell I it be capital : ` it come down like a sledge-hammer ' he little satirical remark be such as these : it be march and i take a bunch of violet to rosa notch white paper be wind around they and mr hawthorne say ` they have on a cambric ruffle generally he sit by a open fire with he foot thrust into the coal and a open volume of thackeray upon he knee he say that thackeray be the greatest living novelist i sometimes suspect that the volume of thackeray be keep as a foil that he might not be talk to he shrink from society but ride and walk extract from a letter rome feb 16 1858 the hawthorne be invaluable to I because the little one come to my room every day and i go there when i like mr hawthorne sometimes walk with we mr h _ never _ he have a horror of sight-seeing and of emotion in general but i like he very much and when i say i like _ he _ it only mean that i like _ she _ a little more julian the boy be in love with I when i be last there mr h come home with I as he put on he coat he turn to julian and say julian i should think with you _ tender interest _ in miss mitchell you would not let I escort she home we arrive in rome in the evening mr h be somewhat of a invalid and mr hawthorne try in vain to make the servant understand that she must have a fire in she room he speak no word of french german or italian but he say emphatically ` make a fire in mr hawthorne 's room ' wear out with he effort he turn to I and say ` do miss mitchell tell the servant what i want you french be excellent englishman and frenchman understand it equally well ' so i say in execrable french ` make a fire ' and point to the grate of course the gesture be understand mr hawthorne be minutely and scrupulously honest i should say that he be a rigid temperance man once i hear mr hawthorne say to the clerk ` send some brandy to mr hawthorne at once ' we be six in the party when i pay my bill i hear mr hawthorne say to miss s the teacher who take all the business care ` do not let miss mitchell pay for one-sixth of my brandy ' so if we order tea for five and six partook of it he call the waiter and say ` six have partake of the tea although there be no tea add to the amount ' i tell mr hawthorne that a friend of mine miss w desire very much to see he as she admire he very much he say ` do not let she see I let she keep she little lamp burning ' he be a sad man i could never tell why i never could get at anything of he religious view he be wonderfully blest in he family mr hawthorne almost worship he she be of a very serious and religious turn of mind i dine with they the day that una be sixteen year old we drink she health in cold water mr hawthorne say ` may you live happily and be ready to go when you must ' he join in the family talk very pleasantly one evening we make up a story one say ' a party be in rome ' another say ` it be a pleasant day ' another say ` they take a walk ' it come to hawthorne 's turn and he say ` do put in a incident ' so rosa say ` then a bear jump from the top of st peter 's ' the story go no further i be with the family when they first go to st peter 's hawthorne turn away say ` the st peter 's of my imagination be better ' i think he could not have be well he be so very inactive if he walk out he take rosa then a child of six with he he once come with she to my room but he seem tire from the ascent of the stair i be on the fifth floor i have be surprise to see that he make severe personal remark in he journal for in the three month that i know he i never hear a unkind word he be always courteous gentle and retire mr hawthorne say she take a wifely pride in he have no small vice mr hawthorne say to miss s ' i have yet to find the first fault in mr hawthorne ' one day mr hawthorne come to my room hold up a inkstand and say ` the new book will be begin to-night ' this be ` the marble faun ' she say ` mr hawthorne write after every one have go to bed i never see the manuscript until it be what he call _ clothe _ ' mr h say he never know when he be write a story how the character will turn out he wait for _ they _ to influence _ he _ i ask she if zenobium be intend for margaret fuller and she say ` no ' but mr hawthorne admit that margaret fuller seem to be around he when he be write it london August we go out for we first walk as soon as breakfast be over and we walk on regent street for hour look in at the shop window the first view of the street be beautiful for it be a misty morning and we see its length fade away as if it have no end i like it that in we first walk we come upon a crowd stand around ` punch ' it be a ridiculous affair but as it be as much a ` peculiar institution ' as be southern slavery i stop and listen and after we come into the house miss s throw out some penny for they we rest after the shop window of regent street take dinner and go out again this time to piccadilly the servility of the shopkeeper be really a little offensive ` what shall i have the honor of show you ' they say we chambermaid at we lodgings thanks we every time we speak to she i feel ashamed to reach a four-penny piece to a stout coachman who touch he hat and beg I to remember he sometimes i be ready to say ` how can i forget you when you have hang around I so closely for half a hour ' we waiter at the adelphi hotel at liverpool be a very respectable middle-aged man with a white neck-cloth he look like a methodist parson he wait upon we for five day with great gravity and then another waiter tell we that we could give we waiter what we please we be charge # 1 for ` attendance ' in the bill but i very innocently give half as much more as fee to the ` parson ' August 14 to-day we take a brougham and drive around for hour of course we do not _ see _ london and if we stay a month we shall still know nothing of it it be so immense i keep think as i go through the street of ` the rat and the mouse they make such a strife he have to go to london ' etc and especially ` the street be so wide and the lane be so narrow ' for i never see such narrow street even in boston we have begin to send out letter but as it be ` out of season ' i be afraid everybody will be at the watering-place the greenwich observatory the observatory be found by charle ii the king that ` never say a foolish thing and never do a wise one ' be yet sagacious enough to start a institution which have grow to be a thing of might and this too of he own will and not from the influence of courtier one of the hospital building of greenwich then call the ` house of delight ' be the residence of henrietta marium and the young prince probably play on the little hill now the site of the observatory but charle though he start a observatory do not know very well what be need the first building consist of a large octagonal room with window all around it be consider sufficiently firm without any foundation and sufficiently open to the heaven with no opening higher than window this room be now use as a place of deposit for instrument and bust and portrait of eminent man and also as the dancing-hall for the director 's family under mr airy 's -lrb- footnote : the late sir george airy -rrb- direction the wall of the observing-room have become page of its history the transit instrument use by halley bradley and pond hang side by side the zenith sector with which bradley discover the ` aberration of light ' now move rustily on its arc be the ornament of another room while the shelf of the computing-room be fill with volume of unpublished observation of flamstead and other the observatory stand in greenwich park the prettiest park i have yet see be a group of small hill they point out oak say to belong to elizabeth 's time -- noble oak of any time the observatory be one hundred and fifty foot above the sea level the view from it be of course beautiful on the north the river the little thame big with its fleet be wind around the isle of dog on the left london always overhang with a cloud of smoke through which st paul 's and the house of parliament peep mr airy be exceedingly kind to I and seem to take great interest in show I around he appear to be much gratify by my interest in the history of the observatory he be naturally a despot and he position increase this tendency sit in he chair the zero-point of longitude for the world he command not only the little knot of observer and computer around he but when he say to london ` it be one o'clock ' london adopt that time and she ship start for they voyage around the globe and continue to count they time from that moment wherever the english flag be bear it be singular what a quiet motive-power science be the breath of a nation 's progress mr airy be not favorable to the multiplication of observatory he predict the failure of that at albany he say that he would gladly destroy one-half of the meridian instrument of the world by way of reform i tell he that my reform movement would be to bring together the astronomer who have no instrument and the instrument which have no astronomer mr airy be exceedingly systematic in lead I by narrow passage and up steep staircase from one room to another of the irregular collection of room he be continually caution I about my footstep and in one place he seem to have a kind of formulum : ` three step at this place ten at this eleven at this and three again ' so in descend a ladder to the birthplace of the galvanic current he say ` turn you back to the stair step down with the right foot take hold with the right hand reverse the operation in ascend do not on come out turn around at once but step backwards one step first ' near the throne of the astronomical autocrat be another proof of he system in a case of portfolio these contain the daily bill letter and papers as they come in and be answer in order when a portfolio be full the papers be remove and be sew together each year 's accumulation be bind and the bind volume of mr airy 's time nearly cover one side of he private room mr airy reply to all kind of letter with two exception : those which ask for autograph and those which request he to calculate nativity both of these be very frequent in the drawing-room mr airy be cheery he love to recite ballad and know by heart a mass of verse from ' a apple pie ' to the ` lady of the lake ' a lover of nature and a close observer of she way as well in the forest walk as in the vault of heaven mr airy have roam among the beautiful scenery of the lake region until he be as good a mountain guide as can be find he have stroll beside grassmere and ascend helvellyn he know the height of the mountain peak the shingle that lie on they side the flower that grow in the valley the mine beneath the surface at one time the government survey plant what be call a ` man ' on the top of one of the hill of the lake region in a dry season they build up a stone monument right upon the bed of a little pond the country people miss the little pond which have seem to they a eye of nature reflect heaven 's blue light they beg for the removal of the surveyor 's pile and mr airy at once change the station the established observatory of england do not step out of they beaten path to make discovery -- these come from the amateur in this respect they differ from america and germany the amateur of england do a great deal of work they learn to know of what they and they instrument be capable and it be do the library of greenwich observatory be large the transaction of learn society alone fill a small room the whole impression of the thirty volume of print observation fill a wall of another room and the unpublished papers of the early director make of themselves a small manuscript library October 22 1857 we have just return from we fourth visit to greenwich like the other twenty-four hour in length we go again to-morrow to meet the sabine herr struve the director of the pulkova observatory be at greenwich with he son karl the old gentleman be a magnificent-looking fellow very large and well proportion he great head be cover with white hair he feature be regular and handsome when he be introduce to any one he thrust both hand into the pocket of he pantaloons and bow i find that the son consider this position of the hand particularly _ english _ however the old gentleman do I the honor to shake hand with I and when i tell he that i bring a letter to he from a friend in america he say ` it be quite unnecessary i know you without ' he speak very good english herr struve 's mission in england be to see if he can connect the trigonometrical survey of the two country it be quite singular that he should visit england for this purpose so soon after russium and england be at war one of he son be a army surgeon at the crimea five visitor remain all night at the observatory i sleep in a little round room and miss s in another at the top of a little jutting-out curved building mr airy say ` mr airy get permission of the board of visitor to fit up some of the room as lodging-room ' mr airy say ` my dear love i do as i always do : i fit they up first and then i report to the board that i have do it ' October 23 another dinner-party at the observatory consist of the struve general and mrs sabine professor and mr powell mr main and ourselves more guest come to tea mr airy tell I that she should arrange the order of the guest at table to please herself that properly all of the married lady should precede I but that i be really to go first with mr airy to effect this however she must explain it to mr sabine the lady of highest rank so we go out professor airy and myself professor powell and mr sabine general sabine and mr powell mr charle struve and miss s mr main mr airy and professor struve general sabine be a small man gray haired and sharp feature about seventy year old he smile very readily and be chatty and sociable at once he speak with more quickness and ease than most of the englishman i have meet mr sabine be very agreeable and not a bit of a blue-stocking the chat at table be general and very interesting mr airy say ` the best of a good dinner be the amount of talk ' he talk of the great ` leviathan ' which he and struve have just visit then anecdote be tell by other then they go on to comic poetry mr airy repeat ` the lose heir ' by hood general sabine tell droll anecdote and the point be often lose upon I because of the local allusion one of he anecdote be this : ` archbishop whately do not like a professor name robert daly he say the irish be a very contented people they be satisfy with one _ bob daily _ ' i find that a ` bob ' be a shilling when the dinner be over the lady leave the room and the gentleman remain over they wine but not for long for mr airy do not like it and struve hate it then before tea other drop in from the neighborhood and the tea be serve in the drawing-room hand round informally August 15 westminster abbey interested I more than i have expect we go into the chapel and admire the sculpture when the guide tell we we ought and stop with interest sometimes over some tomb which he do not point out i step aside reverently when i find i be stand on the stone which cover the remains of dr johnson it be crack across the middle garrick lie by the side of johnson and i think at first that goldsmith lay near but it be only a monument -- the body be inter in temple churchyard you be continually mislead in this way unless you refer at every minute to you guide-book and to go through europe read a guide-book which you can read at home seem to be a waste of time on the stone beneath which addison lie be engrave the verse from tickell 's ode : ` ne'er to these chamber where the mighty rest ' etc the base of newton 's monument be of white marble a solid mass large enough to support a coffin upon that a sarcophagus rest the remains be not enclose within as i step aside i find i have be stand upon a slab marked ` isaac newton ' beneath which the great man 's remain lie on the side of the sarcophagus be a white marble slab with figure in bas-relief one of these imaginary being appear to be weigh the planet on a steel-yard they hang like pea another have a pair of bellows and be blow a fire a third be tend a plant on this sarcophagus recline a figure of newton of full size he lean he right arm upon four thick volume probably ` the principium ' and he point he left hand to a globe above he head on which the goddess uranium sit she lean upon another large book newton 's head be very fine and be probably a portrait the left hand which be raise have lose two finger i think at first that this have be the work of some ` undevout astronomer ' but when i come to ` read up ' i find that at one time soldier be quarter in the abbey and probably one of they want a finger with which to crowd the tobacco into he pipe and so break off one August 17 to-day we have be to the far-famed british museum i carry a ` open sesame ' in the form of a letter give to I by professor henry ask for I special attention from all society with which the ` smithsonian ' at washington be connect i give the paper first to a police officer a police officer be meet at every turn in london he hand it to another official who say ` you would better go to the secretary ' i walk in the direction towards which he point a long way until i find the secretary he call another man and ask he to show I whatever i want to see this man take I into another room and consign I to still another man -- the fifth to whom i have be refer no 5 be a intelligent and polite person and he begin to talk about america at once i ask to see anything which have belong to newton and he tell I they have one letter only -- from newton to leibnitz -- which he show I it be write in latin with diagram and formula intersperse the reply of leibnitz copy by newton be also in they collection and a order from newton write while he be director of the mint no 5 also show I the illuminate manuscript of the collection they be keep lock in glass-topped case and a curtain protect they from the light we see also the oldest copy of the bible in the world the art of printing have bring incalculable blessing but as i look at a neat manuscript book by queen elizabeth copy from another as a present to she father i could not help think it be much better than worsted work a much-worn prayer-book be show I say to be the one use by lady jane gray when on the scaffold nothing make I more conscious that i be on foreign soil than the constant recurrence of association connect with the executioner 's block we hang the quaker and we burn the witch but we be careful not to remember the locality of we barbarism we show instead the plymouth rock or the washington elm among other thing we be show the ` magna charta ' -- a few fragment of worn-out paper on which some word could be trace now carefully preserve in a frame beneath a glass thus far england have impress I seriously i can not imagine how it have ever earn the name of ` merrie england ' August 19 there be four great man whose haunt i mean to seek and on whose footstep i mean to stand : newton shakspere milton and johnson to-day i tell the driver to take I to st martin 's where the guide-book say that newton live he put I down at the newton hotel but i look in vain to its top to see anything like a observatory i go into a wine-shop near and ask a girl who be pour out a dram in which house newton live she point not to the hotel but to a house next to a church and say ` that be it -- do not you see a place on the top that be where he use to study night ' it be a little oblong-shaped observatory build apparently of wood and blacken by age the house be a good-looking one -- it seem to be of stone the girl say the room be let for shop next i tell the driver to take I to fleet street to gough square and to bolt court where johnson live and die bolt court lie on fleet street and it be but few step along a narrow passage to the house which be now a hotel where johnson die but you must walk on farther through the narrow passage a little fearful to a woman to see the place where he write the dictionary the house be so completely within a court in which nothing but brick wall could be see that one wonder what the charm of london could be to induce one to live in that place but a great city always draw to itself the great mind and there johnson probably find he enjoyment August 27 we take st paul 's church to-day we take ticket for the vault the bell the crypt the whispering-gallery the clock and all we do not know what be before we it be a little tiresome as far as the library and the room of nelson 's trophy but to my surprise when the guide say ` go that way for the clock ' he do not take the lead but point up a staircase and i find myself the pioneer in the narrowest and darkest staircase i ever ascend it be really perfect darkness in some of the place and we have to feel we way we all take a long breath when a gleam of light come in at some narrow window scatter along at the top in front of the clock work stand a woman who begin at once to tell we the statistics of the pendulum to which recital i do not choose to listen she be not to go down with we and pant with fatigue and tremble with fright we grope we way down again there be another long but easy ascent to the ` whispering-gallery ' which be a fine place from which to look down upon the interior of the church the man in attendance look like a respectable elderly gentleman he tell we to go to the opposite side of the gallery and he would whisper to we we go around and wear out with fatigue drop upon a bench the man begin to whisper put he mouth to a opening in the wall we hear noise but could not tell what he say to my amazement this very respectable-looking elderly gentleman as we pass he in go out whisper again and as this time he put he mouth close to my ear i understand he say ` if you will give anything for the whisper it will be gratefully receive ' there be notice all over the church forbid fee and i feel that the man be a beggar at best -- more properly a pickpocket a figure of dr johnson stand in one of the aisle of the church it must be like he for it be exceedingly ugly September 3 we have be three week in london ` out of season ' but with plenty of letter at present we have as many acquaintance as we desire last night we be at the opera to-night we go out to dine and to-morrow evening to a dance the next day to admiral smyth 's the opera fatigue I as it always do i tired my eye and ear in the vain effort to appreciate it mario be the great star of the evening but i know no difference one little circumstance show I how a american with the best intention may offend against good manners american-like we have secure very good seat be in good season and as comfortable as the very narrow seat would permit we to be before most of the audience arrive the house fill and we sit at we ease feel we importance and quite unconscious that we be guilty of any impropriety while the curtain be down i hear a voice behind I say to the gentleman who be with we ` be the lady on you leave with you ' -- ` yes ' say mr r -- ` she wear a bonnet which be not accord to rule ' -- ` too late now ' say mr r -- ` it be my fault ' say the attendant ' i ought not to have admit she i think it be a hood ' i be really in hope that i should be order out for i be exceedingly fatigued and should have be glad of some fresh air on look around i see that only the ` pit ' wear bonnet September 6 we leave london yesterday for aylesbury it be two hour by railroad like all railroad in england it run seemingly through a garden in many case flower be cultivate by the roadside from aylesbury to stone the residence of admiral smyth it be two mile of stage-coach ride stage-coach be now very rare in england and i be delighted with the chance for a ride we find the stage-coach crowd the driver ask I if we be for st john 's lodge and on my reply in the affirmative give I a note which mr smyth have write to he to ask for inside seat the note have reach he too late and he say we must go on the outside he bring a ladder and we get up for a minute i think ` what a height to fall from ' but the afternoon be so lovely that i soon forget the danger and enjoy the drive there be six passenger on top aylesbury be a small town and stone be a very small village the driver stop at what seem to be a cultivate field and tell I that i be at my journey 's end on look down i see a wheelbarrow near the fence and i remember that mr smyth have say that one would be wait for we luggage and i soon see mr smyth and she daughter come towards we it be a walk of about a eighth of a mile to the ` lodge ' -- a pleasant cottage surround by a beautiful garden admiral smyth 's family go to a little church seven hundred year old standing in the midst of tombstone and surround by thatched cottage english scenery seem now -lrb- September -rrb- much like we southern scenery in April -- rich and lovely but want mountain and water a english village could never be mistake for a american one : the outline against the sky differ a thatched cottage make a very wavy line on the blue above we find enough in st john 's lodge in the admiral 's library and in the society of the cultivate member of he family to interest we for a long time the admiral himself be upwards of sixty year of age noble-looking loving a good joke a antiquarian and a good astronomer i pick up many a anecdote from he and many curious bit of learn he tell a good story illustrative of he enthusiasm when look at a crater in the moon he say the night be remarkably fine and he apply higher and higher power to he glass until he seem to look down into the abyss and imagine himself stand on its verge he feel himself fall in and draw back with a shudder which last even after the illusion be over in speaking of stratford-upon-avon the admiral tell I that the lucy family one of whose ancestor drive shakspere from he grounds and who be caricature in justice shallow still reside on the same spot as in shakspere 's time he say no family ever retain they characteristic more decidedly some year ago one of this family be invite to a shakspere dinner he resent the well-meant invitation say they must surely have forget how that _ person _ treat he ancestor the amateur astronomer of england be numerous but they be not like those of america in america a poor schoolmaster who have some bright boy who ask question buy a glass and become a star-gazer without time and almost without instrument or a watchmaker must know the time and therefore watch the star as time-keeper in almost all case they be hard-working man in england it be quite otherwise a wealthy gentleman buy a telescope as he would buy a library as a ornament to he house admiral smyth say that no family be quite civilized unless it possess a copy of some encyclopedia and a telescope the english gentleman use both for amusement if he be a man of philosophical mind he soon become a astronomer or if a benevolent man he perceive that some friend in more limited circumstance might use it well and he offer the telescope to he or if a ostentatious man he hire some young astronomer of talent who come to he observatory and make a name for he then the queen confer the honor of knighthood not upon the young man but upon the owner of the telescope sir jame south be knight for this reason we have be visit hartwell house a old baronial residence now the property of dr lee a whimsical old man this house be for year the residence of loui xviii and he queen die here the drawing-room be still keep as in those day the blue damask on the wall have be change by time to a brown the room be spacious and lofty the chimney-piece of richly carve marble the ceiling of one room have fine bas-relief allegorical figure book of antiquarian value be all around -- one whole floor be cover with they they be almost never open in some of the room painting be on the wall above the door dr lee 's modern addition be mostly painting of himself and a former wife and be in very bad taste he have however two bust of mr somerville from which i receive the impression that she be handsome but mr smyth tell I she be not so certainly she be sculpturesque the royal family on they retreat from hartwell house leave they prayer-book and it still remain on its stand the room of the lady of the bedchamber be paper and the figure of a pheasant be the prevail characteristic of the paper the room be call ` the pheasant room ' one of the bird have be carefully cut out and it be say be carry away as a memento by one of the damsel dr lee be second cousin to sir george lee who die childless he inherit the estate but not the title the estate have belong to the lees for four hundred year as the doctor be a lee only through he mother he be oblige to take she name on he accession to the property he apply to parliament to be permit to assume the title and be refuse from a strong tory he become a liberal and delight in curry favor with the lowest class he have twice marry below he rank be remotely connect with the hampden he claim john hampden as one of he family and keep a portrait of he in a conspicuous place a summer-house on the grounds be erect by lady elizabeth lee and some verse inscribe on its wall write by she show that the lees have not always be fool but dr lee have he way of do good be fond of astronomy he have buy a eight and a half foot equatorial telescope and with a wisdom which one could scarcely expect he employ admiral smyth to construct a observatory he have also a fine transit instrument and the admiral be he near neighbor have the privilege of use the observatory as he own in the absence of the lees he have a private key with which he admit himself and mr smyth they make the observation -lrb- mr smyth be a very clever astronomer -rrb- sleep in a room call ` the admiral 's room ' find breakfast prepare for they in the morning and return to they own house when they choose i saw in the observatory a timepiece with a double second-hand one of these could be stop by a touch and would in that way show a observer the instant when he think a phenomenon as a occultation for instance have occur and yet permit he to go on with he count of the seconds and if necessary correct he first impression admiral smyth be a hard worker but i suspect that many of the amateur astronomer of england be dr lees -- rich man who as a hobby ride astronomy and employ a good astronomer dr lee give the use of a good instrument to the curate another to mr payson of cambridge who have lately find a little planet i see at admiral smyth 's some excellent photograph of the moon but in england they have not yet photograph the star chapter vi 1857 first european tour continue -- cambridge university -- ambleside -- miss southey -- the herschel -- a london rout -- edinboro ' and glasgow observatory -- reflection and muttering if any one wish to know the custom of century ago in england let he go to cambridge sit at the window of the hotel he will see the scholar the fellow the master of art and the master of college pass along the street in they different gown very unbecoming gown they be in all case and much as the wearer must be accustom to they they seem to step awkwardly and to have a ungraceful feminine touch in they motion everything that you see speak of the olden time even the image above the arched entrance to the court around which the building stand be crumble slowly and the face have a unearthly expression if the visitor be fortunate enough to have a introduction to one of the college professor he will be take around the building to the library the ` combination ' room to which the fellow retire to chat over they wine and perhaps even to the kitchen we first knowledge of cambridge be the entrance to trinity college and the master 's lodge we arrive in cambridge just about at lunch time -- one o'clock mr airy say to I ` although we be invite to be guest of dr whewell he be quite too mighty a man to come to meet we she son however meet we and we walk with they to dr whewell 's the master 's lodge where dr whewell live be one of the building compose the great pile of trinity college one of the room in the lodge still remain nearly as in the time of henry viii it be immense in size and have two oriel window hang with red velvet in this room the queen hold she court when she be in cambridge for the lodge then become a palace and the ` master ' retire to some other apartment and come to dinner only when ask it be say that the present master do not much like to submit to this position in this great room hang full-length portrait of henry and elizabeth on another wall be a portrait of newton and on a third the sweet face of a young girl dr whewell 's niece of whom i hear he speak as ` kate ' dr whewell receive we in this room standing on a rug before a open fireplace a wood fire be burn cheerily mr airy 's daughter a young girl be with we dr whewell shake hand with we and we stand i be very tired but we continue to stand in a american gentleman 's house i should have ask if i might sit and should have drop upon a chair here of course i continue to stand after perhaps fifteen minute dr whewell say ` will you sit ' and the four of we drop upon chair as if shoot the master be a man to be note even physically he be much above ordinary size and though now gray-haired would be extraordinarily handsome if it be not for a expression of ill-temper about the mouth a englishman be proud a cambridge man be the proudest of englishman and dr whewell the proudest of cambridge man in the opinion of a cambridge man to be master of trinity be to be master of the world at lunch to which we stay dr whewell talk about american writer and be very severe upon they some of they be friend of mine and it be not pleasant but i be especially hurt by a remark which he make afterwards american be note in england for they use of slang the english suppose that the language of sam slick or of nasby be the language use in cultivate society they do not seem to understand it and i have no doubt to-day that lowell 's comic poem be take seriously so at this table dr whewell wish to say that we would do something in the way of sight-seeing very thoroughly turn to I say ` we 'll go the whole hog miss mitchell as you say in america ' i turn to the young american girl who sit next to I and say ` miss s do you ever hear that expression except on the street ' ` never ' she reply afterwards he say to I ` you in america think you know something about the english language and you get out you webster 's dictionary and you worcester 's dictionary but we here in cambridge think we know rather more about english than you do ' after lunch we go to the observatory the cambridge observatory have the usual number of meridian instrument but it have besides a good equatorial telescope of twenty foot in length mount in the english style for mr airy be in cambridge at the time of its establishment in this pretty observatory overlook the peaceful plain with some small hill in the distance mr and mr airy pass the first year of they married life professor challi the director be exceedingly short thick-headed -lrb- in appearance -rrb- and like many of the english thick-tongued while i be look at the instrument mr airy come into the equatorial house bring mr adam the rival of leverrier -lrb- footnote : see chapter vii -rrb- -- another short man but bright-look with dark hair and eye and again the thick voice this time with a nasal twang he be a fellow of pembroke college and master of art if mr adam have become a fellow of he own college st john he must have go into holy order as it be call this he be not willing to do he accept a fellowship from pembroke mr adam be a merry little man love game with child and be a favorite with young lady at 630 we go again to the lodge to dine we be a little late and the servant be in a great hurry to announce we but i make he wait until my glove be on though not button he announce we with a loud voice and dr whewell come forward to receive we be announce in this way the other guest do not wait for a introduction there be a group of guest in the drawing-room and those nearest I speak to I at once dinner be announce immediately and dr whewell escort I downstairs across a immense hall to the dining-room outside of which stand the waiter six in number arrange in a straight line in livery of course one of they have a scarlet vest short clothes and drab coat as i sit next to the master i have a good deal of talk with he he be very severe upon american he say that emerson do not write good english and copy carlyle i think he severity reach really to discourtesy and i think he perceive it when he ask I if i know emerson personally and i reply that i do and that i value my acquaintance with he highly i get a little chance to retort by tell he that we have outgrow mr heman in america and that we now read mr brown more he laugh at it and say that mr brown 's poetry be so coarse that he could not tolerate it and he be amuse to hear that any people have get above mr heman and he ask I if we have outgrow homer to which i reply that they be not similar case altogether there be a tone of satire in dr whewell 's remark which i do not think amiable there be as there be very commonly in english society some dress too low for my taste and the wine-drinking be universal so that i have to make a special point of get a glass of water and be afraid i might drink all there be on the table before the dessert come on saucer be place before each guest and a little rose-water dip into they from a silver basin then each guest wash he face thoroughly dip he napkin into the saucer professor willi who sit next to I tell I that this be a custom peculiar to cambridge and date from its earliest time the finger bowl come on afterwards as usual it be customary for the lady of the house or the ` first lady ' to turn to she nearest neighbor at the close of dinner and say ` shall we retire to the drawing-room ' now there be no lady of the house and i be in the position of first lady they might have sit there for a thousand year before i should have think of it i draw on my glove when the other lady draw on theirs and then we wait mr airy see the dilemma make the little speech and the gentleman escort we to the door and then return to they wine we go back to the drawing-room and have coffee after coffee new guest begin to come and we go into the magnificent room with the oriel window professor sedgwick come early -- a old man of seventy-four already a little shattered and subject to giddiness he be say to be very fond of young lady even now and when younger make some heartache for he could not give up he fellowship and leave cambridge for a wife which to I be very unmanly he be consider the greatest geologist in england and of course they would say ` in the world ' and be much loved by all who know he he come to cambridge a young man and the elm which he see plant be now sturdy tree it be pleasant to hear he talk of cambridge and its growth he point to the stately tree and say ` those tree do not look as old as i and they be not ' i do not see professor adam at that time but i spend the whole of Monday morning walk about the college with he i ask he to show I the place where he make he computation for neptune and he be evidently well pleased to do so we laugh over a roll which we see in the college library contain a list of the ancestor of henry viii among they be jupiter professor adam tell I that in wale genealogical chart go so far back that about half-way between the beginning and the present day you find this record : ` about this time the world be create ' November 2 at lunch to-day dr whewell be more interesting than i have see he before he ask I about laura bridgman and say that he know a similar case he contend in opposition to mr airy and myself that loss of vision be preferable to loss of hearing because it shut one out less from human companionship dr whewell 's self-respect and immense self-esteem lead he to imperiousness of manner which touch the border of discourtesy he love a good joke but he jest be serious he write verse that be touchingly beautiful but it be difficult to believe in he presence that he write they mr airy say that dr whewell and i _ rile _ each other i be at a evening party and the airy boy young man of eighteen and twenty be present they stand the whole time occasionally lean against a table or the piano in they blue silk gown i urge they to sit ` of course not ' they say ` no undergraduate sit in the master 's presence ' i go to three service on ` scarlet Sunday ' for the sake of see all the sight the costume of cambridge and oxford be very amusing and show more than anything i have see the old-fogyism of english way dr whewell wear on this occasion a long gown reach nearly to he foot of rich scarlet and adorn with flow riband the riband do not match the robe but be more of a crimson i wonder that a strong-minded man like dr whewell could tolerate such trappings for a moment but it be say that he be rather proud of they and love all the etiquette of the olden time as also it be say do the queen in these robe dr whewell escort I to church -- and of course we be a great sight before dinner on this scarlet Sunday there be a interval when the master be evidently try to know what to do with I at length he hit upon a expedient ` boy ' he say to the young airy ` take miss mitchell on a walk ' i be a little surprised to find myself on a walk ` nolens volens ' so as soon as we be out of sight of the master of trinity i say ` now young gentleman as i do not want to go to walk we will not go ' it be hard for I to become accustomed to english idea of caste i hear professor sedgwick say that miss herschel the daughter of sir john and niece to caroline marry a gordon ` such a great match for she ' he add and when i ask what match could be great for a daughter of the herschel i be tell that she have marry one of the queen 's household and be ask to _ sit _ in the presence of the queen when i hear a missionary tell that the pariah caste sit on the ground the peasant caste lift themselves by the thickness of a leaf and the next rank by the thickness of a stalk it seem to I that the heathen have reach a high state of civilization -- precisely that which victorium have reach when she permit a herschel to sit in she presence the university of cambridge consist of sixteen college i be tell that of these trinity lead and st john come next trinity have always lead in mathematics it boast of newton and byron among its graduate milton belong to christ church college the mulberry tree which he plant still flourish even to-day a young scholar of trinity express he regret to I that milton do not belong to the college in which he himself study he point out the room occupy by newton and show we ` newton 's bridge ' ` which will surely fall when a greater man than he walk over it ' milton first plan the great poem ` paradise lose ' as a drama and this manuscript keep within a glass case be open to the page on which the _ dramati persona _ be plan and replan on the opposite page be a part of ` lycida ' neatly write and with few correction the most beautiful of the college building be king 's chapel a cambridge man be sure to take you to one of the bridge span the wretched little stream call the ` silver cam ' that you may see the architectural beauty of this building it be well to attend service in one or the other of the chapel to see assemble the young man who be almost all the son of the nobility or gentry the propriety of they conduct strike I the fellow of the college be choose from the ` scholar ' who be most distinguish as the ` scholar ' be choose from the undergraduate they receive a income so long as they remain connected with the college and unmarried they have also the use of room in the college they dine in the same hall with the undergraduate but they table be place upon a raise dais they have also little garden-place give they ` what be they duty ' i ask mr airy ` none at all _ they _ be the college it would not be a seat of learn without they ' they say in cambridge that dr whewell 's book ` plurality of world ' reason to this end : the planet be create for this world this world for man man for england england for cambridge and cambridge for dr whewell ambleside September 13 we have spend the Sunday in ascend a mountain i have a minute route mark out for I by professor airy who have ramble among the lake and mountain of cumberland and westmoreland for month and say that no man live who know they better than he in accordance with these direction i take a one-horse carriage this morning for coniston water in order to ascend the ` old man ' the waiter at the ` salutation ' at ambleside which we make headquarters tell I that i could not make the ascent as the day would not be fine but i have not travel six month for nothing and i know he be say ` you be fine american goose you be not to leave my house until you have be well pluck ' -- which threat he will of course keep but i shall see all the ` old man ' that i choose so i borrow the waiter 's umbrella when he say it would rain and off we go in a open carriage a drive of seven mile up hill and down dale among mountain and around pond -lrb- lake _ they _ call they -rrb- in the midst of rich land and pretty mansion with occasionally a castle and once a ruin to diversify the scenery arrive at coniston hotel the waiter say the same thing : ` it be too cloudy to ascend the old man ' but as soon as it be find that if it be too cloudy we do not intend to stay it clear off amazingly fast and the pony be order i think at first of walk up but have a value for my foot and not like to misuse they i mount a pony and walk he he be beautifully stupid but i could not help thinking of henry colman the agriculturist who when in england go on a fox-hunt he say ` think of my poor wife 's old husband leap a fence ' but i soon forget any fear for the pony need nothing from I or the guide but scramble about any way he choose and the scenery be charming for although the mountain be not very high they be throw together very beautifully and remind I of those of the hudson highland then the little lake be lovely and occasionally we come to a tarn or pond and exceedingly small waterfall be rush about everywhere without any apparent object in view but evidently look for something and spite of the weatherwise head-waiter of the ` salutation ' and of he of coniston inn the day be beautiful we have to give up the pony when we be half a mile from the top and clamber up ourselves the guide be very intelligent and point out the lake windermere coniston and the mountain helvellyn skiddaw and saddleback but at one time he speak a name that i could not understand and forget that i be in england and not in america i ask he to _ spell _ it he reply ` they call it so always ' he do not fail however to ask question like a yankee if he could not spell like one ` which way be ye come ' -- ` from america ' -- ` ye 'll be go to scotland like ' -- ` yes ' -- ` ye 'll be spend much money before ye be home again ' when we be quite on top of the mountain i ask what the white glimmering be in the distance and he say it be what i suppose a arm of the sea the shadow of the fly cloud be very pretty fall on the hill around we and the village in the valley beneath look like white dot on the green Sunday sept 20 1857 we have be to see miss southey to-day i

the child all come to table which be not common in england think what a table they must set when the whole twelve be at home the first object that strike I in the house be borden 's map of massachusett hang in the hall opposite the entrance over the mantelpiece in the dining-room be a portrait of sir william herschel in the parlor be a portrait of caroline herschel and bust of sir william sir john and the eldest daughter i spend the evening in look at engraving sip tea and talk sir john be like the elder mr bond except that he talk more readily but he be womanly in he nature not a tyrant like whewell sir john be a better listener than any man i have meet in england he join in all the chit-chat be one of the domestic circle and tell funny little anecdote -lrb- so do whewell and airy -rrb- the herschel know abbot lawrence and edward everett -- and everywhere these two have leave a good impression but i be certainly mortify by anecdote that i hear of push american mr -- seek a introduction to sir john herschel to tell he about a abridgment of he astronomy which she have make and she intimate to he that in consequence of she abridgment he work be or would be much more widely know in america lady herschel tell I of it and she remark i believe sir john be not much pleased for he do not like abridgment i tell she that i have never hear of the abridgment there be other guest in the house : a lady whose sister be among those kill in indium and she husband who be a officer in the army we have all be play at spell this evening with the letter as we do at home last winter Sunday 15th i thought of go to london to-day but be easily persuade to stay and go with lady herschel to-morrow all this afternoon i have spend listen to sir john who have show I he father 's manuscript he aunt 's beautifully neat and he tell I about he cape observation the telescope use at the cape of good hope lie in the barn -lrb- the glass of course take care of -rrb- unused and sir john now occupy himself with write only he make many drawing at the cape which he show I and very good one they be lady herschel offer I a letter to mr somerville who be godmother to one of she child i be afraid i shall have no letter to leverrier for every one seem to dislike he lady herschel say he be one of the few person whom she ever ask for a autograph he be she guest and he refuse just as i be come away sir john bustle up to I with a sheet of paper say that he think i would like some of he aunt 's handwriting and he would give it to I he have before give I one of he own calculation he say if there be no war pestilence or famine and one pair of human being have be put upon the globe at the time of cheop they would not only now fill the earth but if they stand upon each other 's head they would reach a hundred time the distance to neptune i turn over they scrap-book and sir john 's poetry be much better than many of the specimen they have carefully keep by sir william hamilton sir william hamilton 's sister have some specimen in the book and also lady herschel and she brother lady herschel be the head of the house -- so be mrs airy -- so i suspect be the wife in all well-ordered household i perceive that sir john do not take a cup of tea until he wife say you can have some my dear mr airy wait and wait and then say my dear i shall lose all my flesh if i do not have something to eat and drink i be hope to get to paris next week about the 23d i have have just what i want in england as to society November 26 a few day ago i receive a card ` mrs baden powell at home November 25 ' of course i do not know if it be a tea party or a wedding reception so i appeal to mr airy she say ` it be a london rout i never go to one but you 'll find a crowd and a good many interesting people ' i take a cab and go at nine o'clock the servant who open the door pass I to another who show I the cloak-room the girl who take my shawl number it and give I a ticket as they would at a public exhibition then she point to the other end of the room and there i see a table with tea and coffee i take a cup of coffee and then the servant ask my name _ yell _ it up the stair to another and he announce it at the drawing-room door just as i enter mr powell and the professor be of course standing near and mr admiral smyth just behind to my delight i meet four english person whom i know and also prof henry b roger who be a great society man people keep come until the room be quite full i be very glad to be introduce to professor stoke who be call the best mathematician in england and be a friend of adam he be very handsome -- almost all englishman be handsome because they look healthy but professor stoke have fine black eye and dark hair and good feature he look very young and innocent stoke be connect with cambridge but live in london just as professor powell be connect with oxford but also live in london several gentleman speak to I without a special introduction -- one tell I he name be dr townby -lrb- qy toynbie -rrb- and he be a great admirer of emerson -- the first case of the sort i have meet dr townby be a young man not over thirty full of enthusiasm and progress like a american he really seem to I all alive and be either a genius or crazy -- the shade between be so delicate that i can not always tell to which a person belong i ask he if babbage be in the room and he say ` not yet ' so i hope he would come he tell I that a fine-looking white-headed good-featured old man be roget of the ` thesaurus ' and another old man in the corner be dr arnott of the ` element of physics ' i have suppose he be dead long ago afterwards i be introduce to he he be a old man but not much over sixty he hair be white but he be full of vigor short and stout like almost all englishman and englishwoman i have meet only two woman taller than myself and most of they be very much shorter dr arnott tell I he be only now finish the ` element ' which he first publish in 1827 he intend now to publish the more mathematical portion with the other volume he be very sociable and i tell he he have twenty year ago a great many reader in america he say he suppose he have more there than in england and that he believe he have make young man study science in many instance i ask he if babbage be in the room and he too say ` not yet ' dr arnott ask I if i wear as many stocking when i be observe as the herschel -- he say sir william put on twelve pair and caroline fourteen i stay until eleven o'clock then i say ` good-by ' and just as i step upon the threshold of the drawing-room to go out a broad old man step upon it and the servant announce ` mr babbage ' and of course that glimpse be all i shall ever have edinboro ' September 30 the people of edinboro ' have a passion for grecian architecture and be very proud of the athenian character of they city seek to increase the resemblance by imitation of ancient building grecian pillar be see on calton hill in great number and the observatory would delight a old greek its four front be adorn by grecian pillar and it be indeed beautiful as a structure but the greek do not build they temple for astronomical observation they probably adapt they architecture to they need this beautiful building be erect by a association of gentleman who raise a good deal of money but of course not enough they build the grecian temple but they could not supply it with priest about a hundred year ago colin maclaurin have lay the foundation of a observatory and the curious gothic building which still stand be the first germ we laugh now at the narrow idea of those day which seem to consider a observatory a lookout only but the first step in a work be a great step -- the other be easily take there be add to the building of maclaurin a very small transit room and then the present edifice follow when the builder of the observatory find that they could not support it they present it to the british government so that it be now a government child but it be not pet like the first-born of greenwich there be three instrument a excellent transit instrument of six and a half inch ' aperture rest on its y 's of solid granite the correction of the error of the instrument by means of little screw be give up and the error which be know to exist be correct in the computation professor smyth find that although the two pillar upon which the instrument rest be cut from the same quarry they be unequally affect by change of temperature so that the variation of the azimuth error though slight be irregular the collimation plate they correct with the micrometer so that they consider some position-reading of the micrometer-head the zero point and correct that for the error which they determine by reflection in a trough of mercury with this instrument they observe on certain star of the british catalogue whose place be not very well determine and with a mural circle of smaller power they determine declination the observatory possess a equatorial telescope but it be of mixed composition the object glass be give by dr lee the eye-piece by some one else and the two be put together in a case and use by professor smyth for look at the crater in the moon of these he have make fine drawing and have publish they in color print the whole staff of the observatory consist of professor smyth mr wallace a old man and mr williamson a young man the city of edinboro ' have no amateur astronomer and there be two only of note in scotland : sir william bisbane and sir william keith murray from the observatory the view of edinboro ' be lovely ` auld reekie ' as the scotch call it always look she best through a mist and a scotch mist be not a rare event -- so we see the city under its most become veil October 1857 i stop in glasgow a few hour and go to the observatory which be also the private residence of professor nichol miss nichol receive I and be a very pleasant blue-eyed young lady i find that the observatory boast of two good instrument : a meridian circle which must be good from its appearance and a newtonian telescope differently mount from any i have see case in a composition tube which be paint bright blue -- rather a striking object the iron mount seem to I good it be of the german kind but modify it seem to I that it could be use for observation far from the meridian the iron part be hollow so that the clock be inside as be the azimuth circle and thus space be save they have a wind and rain self-register and a self-registering barometer mark on a cylinder turn by a clock the paper revolve once a hour when i be at dungeon ghyll a little ravine among the english lake down which trickle a exceedingly small stream of water but which be nevertheless very picturesque -- as i follow the old man who show it for a sixpence he ask if we have come a long way ` from america ' i reply ` we have many american here ' say he ` it be much easier to understand they language than that of other foreigner they speak very good english better than the french or german ' i feel myself a little annoyed and a good deal amuse i suppose that i speak the language that addison write and here be a westmoreland guide speak a dialect which i translate into english before i could understand it compliment I upon my ability to speak my own tongue i learn afterwards as i journeyed on to expect no appreciation of my country or its people the english be strangely deficient in curiosity i can scarcely imagine a englishwoman a gossip i find among all class a knowledge of the extent of america by the better class its geography be understand and its physical peculiarity one astronomer have bind the scientific papers from america in green morocco as typical of a country cover by forest among the most intelligent man whom i meet i find a appreciation of the different character of the state everywhere massachusett be honor everywhere i meet the horror of the honest englishman at the slave system but anything like a discriminate knowledge of we public man i could not meet webster have be hear of everywhere they assure I that we _ really great _ man be know we really great deed appreciate but this be not true they make mistake in they measure of we man second-rate man who have travel be of course know to the man whom they have meet these traveller have not perhaps think it necessary to mention that they represent a secondary class of people and they be consider we ` first man ' the english forget that all american travel i be vex when i see some of we most miserable novel bind in showy yellow and red expose for sale a friend tell I that they have copy from the cheap publication of america it may be so but they have outdo we in the cheapness of the material and the showy cover i never see yellow and red together on any american book the english be far beyond we in they highest scholarship but why should they be ignorant of we scholar the englishman be proud and not without reason but he may well be proud of the american offshoot it be not strange that england produce fine scholar when we consider that she college confer fellowship on the best undergraduate england differ from america in the fact that it have a past well may the great man of the present be proud of those who have go before they it be scarcely to be hope that the like can come after they and yet i suppose we must admit that even now the strong mind be bear across the water at the same time england have a class to which we have happily no parallel in we country -- a class to which even english gentleman liken the sepoy and who would they admit under like circumstance be guilty of like enormity but the true englishman shut he eye for a great part of the time to the step in the social scale down which he race descend and look only at the upper walk he have therefore a glance of patronize kindness for the people of the united state and regard we of new england as we regard we rich brethren of the west i wonder what be to become of the english people they island be already crowd with people the large town be numerous and be very large suppose for a instant that she commerce be cut off will they starve it be a illustration of moral power that little island as that of great britain be its power be the great power of the world crowd as the people be they be healthy i never see i think so many ruddy face as meet I at once in liverpool dirty child in the street have red cheek and good tooth nowhere do i see little child whose mind have outgrow they body they do not live in the school-room but in the street one continually meet little child carry smaller one in they arm little girl hand in hand walk the street of london all day there be no free school and they have nothing to do beggar be everywhere and as importunate as in italy for a well-behaved common people i should go to pari for clean working-woman i should look in paris i see a little boy in england torment a smaller one he spit upon he cap and then declare that the little one do it the little one sob and say he do not i give the little one a penny he evidently do not know the value of the coin and appeal to the bigger boy ` be it a penny ' he ask with a look of amazement ` yes ' say the bigger off run the smaller one triumphant and the bigger begin to cry which i permit he to do chapter vii 1857-1858 first european tour continue -- leverrier and the pari observatory -- rome -- harriet hosmer -- observatory of the collegio romano -- secchus at this time the feeling between astronomer of great britain and those of the united state be not very cordial it be the time when adam and leverrier be contend to which of they belong the honor of the discovery of the planet neptune and each side have its strong partisan among miss mitchell 's papers we find the follow with reference to this subject : adam a graduate of cambridge make the calculation which show how a unseen body must exist whose influence be feel by uranus it be a problem of great difficulty for he have some half-dozen quantity touch uranus which be not accurately know and as many wholly unknown concern the unseen planet we think it a difficult question which involve three or four unknown quantity with too few circumstance but this problem involve twelve or thirteen so that x y z reach pretty high up into the alphabet but adam have work the problem carry he work to airy the astronomer royal of england and await he comment a little later leverrier the french astronomer complete the same problem and wait for no authority beyond he own fling he discovery out to the world with the self-confidence of a frenchman when the news of the discovery of neptune reach this country i happen to be visit at the observatory in cambridge mass professor bond -lrb- the elder -rrb- have look for the planet the night before i arrive at he house and he look again the evening that i come he observatory be then a small round building and in it be a small telescope he have draw a map of a group of star one of which he suppose be not a star but the planet he set the telescope to this group and ask he son to count the seconds he allow the star to pass by the motion of the earth across the field if they keep the relative distance of the night before they be all star if any one have approach or recede from the other it be a planet and when the father look at he son 's record he say ` one of those have move and it be the one which i think last night be the planet ' he look again at the group and the son say ` father do give I a look at the new planet -- you be the only man in america that can do it ' and then we both look it look precisely like a small star and george and i both ask ` what make you think last night that it be the new planet ' mr bond could only say ' i do not know it look different from the other ' it be always so -- you can not get a man of genius to explain step he leap after the discovery of this planet professor peirce in we own country declare that it be not the planet of the theory and therefore its discovery be a happy accident but it seem to I that it be the planet of the theory just as much if it vary a good deal from its prescribed place as if it vary a little so you might have say that uranus be not the uranus of the theory sir john herschel say ` its movement have be feel tremble along the far-reaching line of we analysis with a certainty hardly inferior to ocular demonstration ' i consider it be superior to ocular demonstration as the action of the mind be above that of the sens adam in he study at cambridge england and leverrier in he closet at pari poring over they logarithm know better the locus of that outside planet than all the practical astronomer of the world put together of course in paris i go to the imperial observatory to visit leverrier i carry letter from professor airy who also send a letter in advance by post leverrier call at my hotel and leave card then come a note and i go to tea leverrier have succeed arago arago have be a member of the provisional government and have die leverrier take exactly opposite ground politically to that of arago he stand high with the emperor he take I all over the observatory he have a large room for a ballroom because in the ballroom science and politics be discuss for where a press be not free salon must give the tone to public opinion both leverrier and madame leverrier say hard thing about the english and the english say hard thing about leverrier the astronomical observatory of pari be found on the establishment of the academy of science in the reign of loui xiv the building be begin in 1667 and finish in 1672 like other observatory of that time it be quite unfit for use john dominie cassinus come to it before it be finish see its defect and make alteration but the whole building be afterwards abandon m leverrier show I the transit instrument and the mural circle he have like mr airy make the transit instrument incapable of mechanical change for its correction of error so that it depend for accuracy upon its fault be know and correct in the computation all the early observatory of europe seem to have be build as temple to uranium and not as working-chamber of science the royal observatory at greenwich the imperial observatory of pari and the beautiful structure on calton hill edinboro ' be at first wholly useless as observatory that of greenwich have no steadiness while every pillar in the astronomical temple of edinboro ' though it may tell of the enlightenment of greece hide the light of the star from the scottish observer well might struve say that ` a observatory should be simply a box to hold instrument ' the leverrier speak english about as well as i do french and we have a very awkward time of it m leverrier talk with I a little and then talk wholly to one of the gentleman present madame be very chatty leverrier be very fine-looking he be fair-haired full-faced altogether very healthy-looking he wife be really handsome the child beautiful i be glad that i could understand when leverrier say to the child ` if you make any more noise you go to bed ' while i be there a woman as old as i rush in in bonnet and shawl and fly around the room kiss madame jump the child about and shake hand with monsieur and there be a great amount of scream and laugh and all talk at once as i could not understand a word it seem to I like a theater i ask monsieur when i could see the observatory and he answer ` whenever it suit you convenience ' December 15 i go to leverrier 's again last evening by special invitation four gentleman and three lady receive I all standing and bow without speak monsieur be however more sociable than before and shriek out to I in french as though i be deaf the lady be in blue dress a good deal of crinoline deep flounce high neck very short flow sleeve and short undersleeve the dress be brocade and the flounce much trim madame 's with white plush the room be cold of course have no carpet and a wood fire in a very small fireplace the gentleman continue standing or promenading and take snuff except leverrier no one of they speak to I the lady all do and all speak french the two child be present again -- the little girl five year old play on the piano and the boy of nine play and sing like a public performer he promenade about the room with he hand in he pocket like a man i think he manners be about equal to ----- 's as occasionally he yell and be tell to be quiet about ten o'clock m leverrier ask I to go into the observatory which connect with the dwelling they be build immense additional room and be have a great telescope twenty-seven foot in focal length construct with leverrier 's bad english and my bad french we talk but little but he show I the transit instrument the mural circle the computing-room and the private office he put on he cloak and cap and say ` voila le directeur ' one room he tell I have be arago 's and arago have he bed on one side m leverrier say ' i do not wish to have it for my room ' he be say to be much oppose to arago and to be merciless towards he family he show I another room intend for a reception-room and explain to I that in france one have to make science come into social life for the government must be reach in order to get money there be huge globe in one room that belong to cassinus if what he show I be not surpass in the other room i do not think much of they instrument m leverrier say he have ask m chacornac to meet I but he be not there i feel that we get on a little better but not much and it be evident that he do not expect I to understand a observatory we do not ascend to the dome leverrier have telegraphic communication with all europe except great britain it be quite singular that they make such different remark to I leverrier say that they have to make science popular airy say ` in england there be no astronomical public and we do not need to make science popular ' jan 24 1858 i be in rome i have be here four day and already i feel that i would rather have that four day in rome than all the other day of my travels i have be uncomfortable cold tired and subject to all the evil of travel but for all that i would not have miss the sort of realization that i have of the existence of the past of great glory if i must have a thousand time the discomfort i go alone yesterday to st peter 's and the vatican and today take murray i go alone to the roman forum and stand beside the ruin portico and the broken column of the temple then i push on to the coliseum and walk around its whole circumference i could scarcely believe that i really stand among the ruin and be not dream i really think i have more enjoyment for go alone and find out for myself afterwards the hawthorne call and i take mr h to the same spot i really feel the impressiveness of rome all europe have be serious to I rome be even sad in its seriousness you can not help feeling in the coliseum some little of the influence of the scene that have be enact there even if you know little about they you must remember that the vast number of people who have be within its wall for age have not be common mind whether they be christian martyr or travel artist i think if i have never hear before of the reputation of the picture and statue of the vatican i should have perceive they superiority there be more idea of _ action _ convey by the statuary than i ever receive before -- they do not seem to be _ dead _ January 25 i have finer room than i have in pari but the let of apartment be better manage in pari there you always find a _ concierge _ who tell you all you want to know and who speak several language in rome you enter a narrow dark passage and look in vain for a door then you go up a flight of stair and see a door with a string you pull the string and a woman put she mouth to a square hole cover with tin puncture with hole and ask what you want you tell she and she tell you to go up higher you repeat the process and at last reach the room the higher up the better because you get some sun and one learn the value of sunlight i see no sun in paris in my room and here i have it half of the day and it seem very pleasant all the custom of the people differ from those of pari a little of italian art enter into the ornament of room and furniture but anything like mechanical skill seem to be unheard of and i dare say the pretty stamp use on the butter i have which represent some antique picture be cut by some northern hand i could make a better cart than those that i see on the street and i could _ almost _ make as good horse as those that draw they it be holy week i have spend seven hour at a time at st peter 's in terrible crowd for ten day and now i go no more the lady be seat but as the ceremony be in different part of the immense building they rush wildly from one to the other with they black veil they look like fury let loose i stay five hour to-day to see the pope wash foot which be very silly for i see mother wash they much more effectually twenty year ago the crowd be better worth see than the ceremony if one could only see it without be in it i shall not try to hear the ` miserere ' -- i have give up the study of music since i fail to appreciate mario i sha 'n' t try any more i go to the story ' on Sunday evening to look at st peter 's lighting up march 21 i have be to vespers at st peter 's they begin a hour before sunset when my work be do for the day i walk to st peter 's this be Sunday and the floor be full of kneel worshipper but that make no difference i walk about among they i be there a hour to-day before i see a person that i know then i meet the nichols and go with they into a side chapel to hear vespers then i see next the waterston then miss lander but i be unusually short of friend i generally meet so many more there be kneel woman to-day with baby in they arm the baby of the lower class have they leg so wrap up that they can not move they they look like small pillow even when they be six month old i think it must dwarf they we american be a tall people i be a very tall woman here i think that p 's height would cause a sensation in the street my servant admire my height very much march 22 i call on miss bremer to-day have hear that she desire to see I she be a ` little woman in black ' but not so plain she face be a little red but she complexion be fair and the expression very please she chat away a good deal ask I about astronomy and how i come to study it i tell she that my father put I to it and she say she be just write a story on the affection of father and daughter she tell I i have good eye it be a long time now since any one have tell I that miss bremer and mr w meet in my room and remain a hour miss bremer be quiet and unpretending mr w be flashy and brilliant and as i usually say when i do not understand a person a little insane she have the floor all the time after she come in she give a sketch of she life from she birth up mention incidentally that she have be a belle surround with beau the pride of she parent with a reputation for intellect etc i have be urge miss bremer into a interesting talk before mr w appear and i feel what a pity it be that she have not the same propensity to talk that the latter have she talk very pleasantly however and i think what a pity it be that i shall not see she again for i leave rome in three day for florence i be in rome for a winter a idler by necessity for six week it be the very place of all the world for a idler on the pleasant day there be the ruin to visit the campagna to stroll over the villa and they grounds to gather flower in the forum to muse in the pincian hill or the capitoline for a gossip walk with some friend on rainy day it be all art there be the cathedral the gallery and the studio of the thousand artist for every winter there be a thousand artist in rome a rainy day find I in the studio of paul aker as i be look at some of he model the studio door open and a pretty little girl wear a jaunty hat and a short jacket into the pocket of which she hand be thrust rush into the room seemingly unconscious of the presence of a stranger begin a rattle all-alive talk with mr aker of which i catch enough to know that a ride over the campagna be plan as i hear mr aker say ` oh i will not ride with you -- i be afraid to ' after which he turn to I and introduce harriet hosmer i be just from old conservative england and i have be among its most conservative people i have catch something of its old musty-parchment idea and the cricket-like manners of harriet hosmer rather trouble I it take some week for I to get over the impression of she madcap way they seem childish i go to she studio and see ` puck ' a statue all fun and frolic and i imagine all be fun to the core of she heart as a general rule people disappoint you as you know they to know they better and better be to know more and more weakness harriet hosmer parade she weakness with the conscious power of one who know she strength and who know you will find she out if you be worthy of she acquaintance she make poor joke -- she be a little rude -- a good deal eccentric but she be always _ true _ in the town where she use to live in massachusett they will tell you a thousand anecdote of she vagary -- but they be proud of she she do not start on a false scent she know the royal character of the game before she hunt a lady who be a great rider say to I a few day since : ` of course i do not ride like harriet hosmer but if you will notice there be method in harriet hosmer 's madness she do not mount a horse until she have examine he carefully ' at the time when i see she she be think of she statue of zenobium she be study the history of palmyra read up on the manners and custom of its people and examine eastern relic and costume if she hear that in the sacristy of a certain cathedral hundred of mile away be lie robe of eastern queen she mount she horse and ride to the spot for the sake of learn the lesson they could teach day after day alone in she studio she study the subject think what knowledge of the country of the history of the people must be gather must be mould to bring into the face and bearing of its queen the expression of the race think what familiar acquaintance with the human form to represent a lifelike figure at all for year after i come home i read the newspaper to see if i could find any notice of the statue of zenobium and i do at length see this announcement : ` the statue of zenobium by miss hosmer be on exhibition at child & jenk '' it be after five year all through those five year miss hosmer have keep she project steadily turn in this direction whatever may be the criticism of art upon she work no one can deny that she be above the average artist but she be herself as a woman very much above herself in art if there come to any struggle artist in rome the need of a friend -- and of the thousand artist in rome very few be successful -- harriet hosmer be that friend i know she to stretch out a help hand to a unfortunate artist a poor uneducated unattractive american against whom the other american in rome shut they house and they heart when the other american turn from the unsuccessful artist harriet hosmer reach forth the help hand when harriet hosmer know herself to be a sculptor she know also that in all america be no school for she she must leave home she must live where art could live she might model she bust in the clay of she own soil but who should follow out in marble the delicate thought which the clay express the workman of massachusett tend the loom build the railroad and read the newspaper the hard-handed man of italy work in marble from the design put before they one copy the leaf which the sculptor throw into the wreath around the brow of he hero another turn with he tool the fold of the drapery another work up the delicate tissue of the flesh none of they dream of idea : they be copyist -- the very hand-work that she head need and to italy she go for she school she seek the studio of gibson -- the greatest sculptor of the time she resolve ` to scorn delight and live laborious day ' and there she have live and work for year she fashion the clay to she ideal -- every little touch of she finger in the clay be a thought she think in clay the model finish and cast in the dull hard inexpressive plaster she stand by the workman while they put it into the marble she must watch they for a touch of the tool in the wrong place might alter the whole expression of the face as a wrong accent in the reader will spoil a line of poetry collegio romano secchus there be another observatory which have a reputation and be know in america it be the observatory of the collegio romano and be in the monastery behind the church of st ignasio its director be the father secchus who have visit the united state and be well know to the scientist of this country i say to myself ` this be the land of galileo and this be the city in which he be try i know of no sadder picture in the history of science than that of the old man galileo worn by a long life of scientific research weak and feeble tremble before that tribunal whose frown be torture and declare that to be false which he know to be true and i know of no picture in the history of religion more weakly pitiable than that of the holy church tremble before galileo and denounce he because he find in the book of nature truth not state in they own book of god -- forget that the book of nature be also a book of god it seem to be difficult for any one to take in the idea that two truth can not conflict galileo be the first to see the four moon of jupiter and when he announce the fact that four such moon exist of course he be meet by various objection from establish authority one writer declare that as astrologer have get along very well without these planet there could be no reason for they start into existence but he greatest heresy be this : he be try condemn and punish for declare that the sun be the center of the system and that the earth move around it also that the earth turn on its axis for teaching this galileo be call before the assemble cardinal of rome and clothe in black cloth be compel to kneel and to promise never again to teach that the earth move it be say that when he arise he whisper ` it do move ' he be try at the hall of sopre minerva in fewer than two hundred year from that time the church of st ignasio be build and the monastery on whose wall the instrument of the modern observatory stand it be a very singular fact but one which seem to show that even in science ` the blood of the martyr be the seed of the church ' that the spot where galileo be try be very near the site of the present observatory to which the pope be very liberal from the hall of sopre minerva you make but two turn through short street to the fontenelle de borghese in the rear of which stand the present observatory indeed if a cardinal should at the hall of sopre minerva call out to secchi ` watchman what of the night ' secchus could hear the question and no bolder view emanate from any observatory than those which secchi send out i send a card to secchus and await a call well satisfied to have a little more time for listless stroll among ruin and into the studio and so we spend many a hour : pick up land shell from the top of the coliseum gathering violet in the upper chamber of the palace of the caesar -- for the overgrown wall make climb very easy -- or rest upon some broken statue on the forum we admire the arch of the temple of peace throw upon the rich blue of the sunny sky return one day from a drive i meet two priest descend one of the upper flight of stair in the house where i live as my room have be bless once and holy water sprinkle upon they i think perhaps another process of that kind have just be go through and be about to pass they when one of they accost I ask if i be the signorine mitchell -- change he italian to good english as he see that i be and introduce himself as father secchus he tell I that the younger man be a young _ religieux _ and the two turn and go back with I i recall as i see father secchus a anecdote i have hear no way to he credit -- except for ingenious trickery it be say that come to america he bring with he the object-glass of a telescope at a time when scientific apparatus pay a high duty be ask by some official what the article be he reply ` my looking-glass ' and in that way pass it off as personal wardrobe so escape the duty -lrb- it may have be de vico -rrb- father secchus have bring with he to show I negative of the planet saturn -- the ring show beautifully although the image be not more than half a inch in size i be ignorant enough of the way of papal institution and indeed of all italy to ask if i might visit the roman observatory i remember that the day of galileo be day of two century since i do not know that my heretic foot must not enter the sanctuary -- that my woman 's robe must not brush the seat of learn the father 's refusal be see in he face at once and i feel that i have do something highly improper the father say that he would have be most happy to have I visit he but he have not the power -- it be a religious institution -- he have already apply to he superior who be not willing to grant permission -- the power lay with the holy father or one of he cardinal i be tell that mr somerville the most learn woman in all europe have be deny admission that the daughter of sir john herschel in spite of english rank and the higher stamp of nature 's nobility be at that time in rome and could not enter a observatory which be at the same time a monastery if i have before be mildly desirous of visit the observatory i be now intensely anxious to do so father secchus suggest that i should see cardinal antonellus in person with a write application in my hand this be not to be think of -- to ask a interview with the wily cardinal from a letter to she father i be work to get admit to see the observatory but it can not be do without special permission from the pope and i do not like to be present if i can get permission without the humbug of put on a black veil and receive a blessing from pius i shall but i shrink from the formality of presentation i know thou would say be present we minister at that time have the reputation of be very careless of the need and wish of he countryman and i be not surprise to find a long delay in the course of my wait i have tell my story to a young italian gentleman the nephew of a monseigneur a monseigneur be next in rank to a cardinal he assure I that permission would never be obtain by we minister after a fortnight 's wait i receive a permit write on parchment and sign by cardinal antonellus when the young italian next call i hold the parchment up in triumph and boast that minister -- have at length move in the matter the young man coolly reply ` yes i speak to my uncle last evening and ask he to urge the matter with cardinal antonellus but for that it would never have come ' there have be ` red tape ' and i have not see it at the same time that the formal missive be send to I a similar one be send to father secchus authorize he to receive I the father call at once to make the arrangement for my visit i make the most natural mistake i suppose that the door which open to one woman open to all and i ask to take with I my italian servant a quick-witted and bright-eyed woman who have escort I to and from social party in the evening and who have learn in these walk the name of the star receive they from I in english and give back to I the sweet italian word and who have come to think herself quite a astronomer father secchus refuse at once he say i be to meet he at the church of st ignasio at one and a half hour before ave marie and he would conduct I through the church into the observatory my servant might come into the church with I the ave marie bell ring half a hour after sunset at the appoint time the next fine day -- and all day seem to be fine -- we set out on we mission when we enter the church we see far in the distance father secchus standing just behind a pillar he slip out a little way as much as to say ' i await you ' but do not come forward to meet we so the woman and i pass along through the row of kneel worshipper by the stroll student and past the lounge tourist -- who guide-book in hand be see in every foreign church -- until we come to the standpoint from which the father have be watch we then the italian woman put up a petition not one word of which i could understand but the gesture and the point show that she beg to go on and enter the monastery and see the observatory father secchus say ` no the holy father give permission to one only ' and alone i enter the monastery wall through long hall up wind staircase occasionally stop by some priest who touch he broad hat and ask ` parlate italiano ' occasionally pass by student often stop by picture on the wall -- once to be introduce to a professor then through the library of the monastery full of manuscript on which monk have work away they life then through the astronomical library where young astronomer be work away theirs we reach at length the dome and the telescope one observatory be so much like another that it do not seem worth while to describe father secchus 's this observatory have a telescope about the size of that at washington -lrb- about twelve inch -rrb- secchus have no staff and no prescribed duty the base of the observatory be the solid foundation of the old roman build the church be build in 1650 and the monastery in part at that time certainly the dome of the room in which be the meridian instrument the staircase be cut out of the old roman wall which no roll of carriage except that of the earthquake chariot can shake have no prescribe duty secchus could follow he fancy -- he could pick up comet as he pick up bit of mosaic upon the roman forum he learn what himself and he instrument can do and he keep to that narrow path he be at that time much interested in celestial photography italy must be the very paradise of astronomer certainly i never see object so well before the purity of the air must be very superior to ours we look at venus with a power of 150 but it be not good jupiter be beautiful and in broad daylight the belt be plainly see with low power the moon be charming but the air would not bear high one father secchus say he have use a power of 2000 but that 600 be more common i have rarely use 400 saturn be exquisite the ring be separate all around the dusky ring could be see and of course the shadow of the ball upon the ring the spectroscopic method of observe starlight be use by secchus as early as by any astronomer by this method the starlight be analyze and the sunlight be analyze and the two compare if it do not disclose absolutely what be the peculiarity of starlight and sunlight relatively it trace the relationship in order to be successful in this kind of observation the telescope must keep very accurately the motion of the earth in its axis and so the papal government furnish nice machinery to keep up with this motion -- the same motion for declare whose existence galileo suffer the two hundred year have do they work i should have be glad to stay until dark to look at nebula but the father kindly inform I that my permission do not extend beyond the daylight which be fast leave we and conduct I to the door he inform I that i must make my way home alone add ` but we live in a civilized country ' i do not express to he the doubt that rise to my thought the ave marie bell ring half a hour after sunset and before that time i must be out of the observatory and at my own house chapter viii 1858-1865 first european tour conclude -- mr somerville -- humboldt -- mr mitchell 's death -- removal to lynn mass -- present of a equatorial telescope-extract from letter i have no hope when i go to europe of know mr somerville american man of science do not know she and there have be unpleasant passage between the savant of europe and those of the united state which make my friend a little reluctant about give I letter professor henry offer to send I letter and say that among they should be one to mr somerville but when he package come no such letter appear and i do not like to press the matter -- indeed after i have be in england i be not surprise at any amount of reluctance they rarely ask to know my friend and yet if they be make know to they they do they utmost so i go to europe with no letter to mr somerville and no letter to the herschel i be very soon domesticate with the airy and really feel my importance when i come to sleep in one of the round room of the royal observatory i dare give no hint to the airy that i want to know the herschel although they be intimate friend ` what be i that i should love they save for feeling of the pain ' but one fine day a letter come to mr airy from lady herschel and she ask ` would not miss mitchell like to visit we ' of course miss mitchell jump at the chance mr airy reply and probably hint that miss mitchell ` could be induce ' etc if the airy be old friend of mr somerville the herschel be older the airy be just and kind to I the herschel be lavish and they offer I a letter to mr somerville so provide with this open sesame to mr somerville 's heart i call at she residence in florence in the spring of 1858 i send in the letter and a card and wait in the large florentine parlor in the open fireplace blaze a wood fire very suggestive of american comfort -- very deceitful in the suggestion for there be little of home comfort in italy after some little delay i hear a footstep come shuffling along the outer room and a exceedingly tall and very old man enter the room in the singular head-dress of a red bandanna turban approach I and introduce himself as dr somerville the husband he be very proud of he wife and very desirous of talk about she a weakness quite pardonable in the judgment of one who be desirous to know he begin at once on the subject mr somerville he say take great interest in the american for she claim connection with the family of george washington washington 's half-brother lawrence marry anne fairfax who be one of the scotch family when lieutenant fairfax be order to america washington write to he as a family relative and ask he to make he a visit lieutenant fairfax apply to he command officer for permission to accept and it be refuse they never meet and much to the regret of the fairfax family the letter of washington be lose the fairfax of virginium be of the same family and occasionally some member of the american branch return to see he scotch cousin while dr somerville be eagerly talk of these thing mr somerville come trip into the room speaking at once with the vivacity of a young person she be seventy-seven year old but appear twenty year younger she be not handsome but she face be please the forehead low and broad the eye blue the feature so regular that in the marble bust by chantrey which i have see i have consider she handsome neither bust nor picture however give a correct idea of she except in the outline of the head and shoulder she speak with a strong scotch accent and be slightly affect with deafness a infirmity so common in england and scotland while mr somerville talk the old gentleman seat by the fire busy himself in toast a slice of bread on a fork which he keep at a slow-toasting distance from the coal a english lady be present learn in art who with a volubility worthy of a american rush into every little opening of mr somerville 's more measured sentence with she remark upon recent discovery in _ she _ specialty whenever this occur the old man grow fidgety move the slice of bread backwards and forwards as if the fire be at fault and when at length the english lady have fairly conquer the ground and be start on a long sentence he could bear the eclipse of he idol no longer but come to the sofa where we sit he testily say ` mr somerville would rather talk on science than on art ' mr somerville 's conversation be mark by great simplicity it be rather of the familiar and chatty order with no tendency to the essay style she touch upon the recent discovery in chemistry or the discovery of gold in californium of the nebula more and more of which she think might be resolve and yet that there might exist nebulous matter such as compose the tail of comet of the satellite of the planet the last of which she think have other use than as subordinate she speak with disapprobation of dr whewell 's attempt to prove that we planet be the only one inhabit by reasoning being she believe that a higher order of being than ourselves might people they on subsequent visit there be many question from mr somerville in regard to the progress of science in america she regret she say that she know so little of what be do in we country from lieutenant maury alone she receive scientific papers she speak of the late dr -lrb- nathaniel -rrb- bowditch with great interest and say she have correspond with one of he son she ask after professor peirce whom she consider a great mathematician and of the bond of cambridge she be much interested in they photography of the star and say it have never be do in europe at that time photography be but just apply to the star i have carry to the royal astronomical society the first successful photograph of a star it be that of mizar and alcor in the great bear -lrb- since that time all these thing have improve -rrb- the last time i see mr somerville she take I into she garden to show I she rose-bush in which she take great pride mr somerville be not a mathematician only she speak italian fluently and be in early life a good musician i could but admire mr somerville as a woman the ascent of the steep and rugged path of science have not unfitted she for the drawing-room circle the hour of devotion to close study have not be incompatible with the duty of wife and mother the mind that have turn to rigid demonstration have not thereby lose its faith in those truth which figure will not prove ' i have no doubt ' say she in speaking of the heavenly body ` that in another state of existence we shall know more about these thing ' mr somerville at the age of seventy-seven be interested in every new improvement hopeful cheery and happy she society be seek by the most cultivate people in the world -lrb- she die at ninety-two -rrb- berlin may 7 1858 humboldt have reply to my letter of introduction by a note say that he should be happy to see I at 2 pm may 7 of course i be punctual humboldt be one of several resident in a very ordinary-looking house on oranienberge strasse all along up the flight of stair to he room be print notice tell person where to leave package and letter for alexander humboldt the servant show I at first into a sort of anteroom hang with deer ' horn and carpet with tiger ' skin then into the study and ask I to take a seat on the sofa the room be very warm comfort be evidently carefully consider for cushion be all around the sofa be handsomely cover with worsted embroidery a long study-table be full of book and papers i have wait but a few moment when humboldt come in he be a smaller man than i have expect to see he be neater more ` trig ' than the picture represent he in look at the picture you feel that he head be too large -- out of proportion to the body -- but you do not perceive this when you see he he bow in a most courtly manner and tell I he be much oblige to I for come to see he then shake hand and ask I to sit and take a chair near I there be a clock in sight and i stay but half a hour he talk every minute and on all kind of subject : of dr bache who be then at the head of the we coast survey of dr gould who have recently return from long year in south america of the washington observatory and its director lieutenant maury of the dudley observatory at albany of sir george airy of the greenwich observatory of professor enke 's comet reputation of argelander who be there observe variable star of mr somerville and goldschmidt and of he brother it be the period when the subject of admit kansa as a slave state be discuss -- he touch upon that it be during the administration of president buchanan and he talk about that have be nearly a year in europe i have not keep up my reading of american newspaper but humboldt could tell I the latest news scientifically and politically to my ludicrous mortification he tell I of the change of position of some scientific professor in new york state and when i show that i do not know the location of the town which be clinton he tell I if i would look at the map which lay upon the table i should find the town somewhere between albany and buffalo humboldt be always consider a good-tempered kindly-natured man but he talk be a little fault-finding he say : ` lieutenant maury have be useful but for the director of a observatory he have put forth some strange statement in the ` geography of the sea ' he ask I if mr somerville be now occupy with pure mathematics he say : ` there she be strong i never see she but once she must be over sixty year old ' in reality she be seventy-seven he speak with admiration of mr somerville 's ` physical geography ' -- say it be excellent because so concise ' a german woman would have use more word ' humboldt ask I if they could apply photography to the small star -- to the eighth or ninth magnitude i have ask the same question of professor bond of cambridge and he have reply ` give I $ 500000 and we can do it but it be very expensive ' humboldt speak of the fifty-three small planet and give he opinion that they could not be group together that there be no apparent connection have lose all he tooth humboldt 's articulation be indistinct -- he talk very rapidly he hair be thin and very white he eye very blue he nose too broad and too flat yet he be a handsome man he wear a white necktie a black dress-coat button up but not so much so that it hide a figure dark-blue and white waistcoat he be a little deaf he tell I that he be eighty-nine year old and that he and bonpland alone be living of those who in early life be on expedition together that bonpland be eighty-five and much the more vigorous of the two he say that we have go backwards morally in america since he be there -- that then there be strong man there : jefferson and hamilton and madison that the three month he spend in america be spend almost wholly with jefferson in the course of conversation he tell I that the fifth volume of ` cosmos ' be in preparation he urge I to go to see argelander on my way to london he follow I out still urge I to do this and at the same time assure I that kansa would go all right it be singular that humboldt should advise I to use the sextant it be the first instrument that i ever use and it be a very difficult one no young aspirant in science ever leave humboldt 's presence uncheered and no petty animosity come out in he record you never hear of humboldt 's complain that any one have steal he thunder -- he know that no one could lift he bolt when i come away he thank I again for the visit follow I into the anteroom and make a low bow in 1855 mr mitchell be take suddenly ill and although partial recovery follow she illness last for six year during which time marium be she constant nurse for most of the six year she mother 's condition be such that merely a general care be need but it use to be say that marium 's eye be always upon she when the opportunity to go to europe come a older sister come with she family to take marium 's place in the home and when miss mitchell return she find she mother so nearly in the state in which she have leave she that she feel justified in have take the journey mr mitchell die in 1861 and a few month after she death mr mitchell and he daughter remove to lynn mass -- miss mitchell have purchase a small house in that city in the rear of which she erect the little observatory bring from nantucket she be very much depress by she mother 's death and absorb herself as much as possible in she observation and in she work for the nautical almanac soon after she return from europe she have be present with a equatorial telescope the gift of american woman through miss elizabeth peabody the follow letter refer to this instrument : letter from admiral smyth st john 's lodge near aylesbury 25-7 - '59 my dear miss mitchell : we be much pleased to hear of you acquisition of a equatorial instrument under a revolving roof for it be a true scientific luxury as well as a efficient implement the aperture of you object-glass be sufficient for do much useful work but if i may hazard a opinion to you do not attempt too much for it be quality rather than quantity which be now desirable i would therefore leave the multiplication of object to the larger order of telescope and to those who be give to sweep and ransack the heaven of whom there be a goodly corps now for you purpose i would recommend a batch of neat but not over-close binary system select so as to have always one or the other on hand i however have be bestir myself to put amateur upon a more convenient and i think a better mode of examine double star than by the wire micrometer with its fault of illumination fiddle jump and dirty lamp this be by the beautiful method of rock-crystal prism not the rochon method of double-image but by thin wedge cut to give angle i have tell mr alvan clark my experience and i hope he will apply he excellent mind to the scheme i be insist upon this point in some astronomical twaddle which i be now print and of which i shall soon have to request you acceptance of a copy there be a very important department which call for a zealous amateur or two namely the color of double star for these have usually be note after the eye have be fatigue with observe in illuminate field the volume i hope to forward -- _ en hommage _ -- will contain all the pro and con of this branch there be for ultimate utility nothing like form a plan and then steadily follow it those who profess they will attend to everything often fall short of the mark the division of labor lead to beneficial conclusion as well in astronomy as in mechanic and art mr smyth and my daughter unite with I in wish you all happiness and success and believe I my dear miss mitchell yours very faithfully w h smyth in regard to the color of star miss mitchell have already begin they study as these extract from she diary show : feb 19 1853 i be just learn to notice the different color of the star and already begin to have a new enjoyment betelgeuse be strikingly red while rigel be yellow there be something of the same pleasure in notice the hue that there be in look at a collection of precious stone or at a flower-garden in autumn blue star i do not yet see and but little lilac except through the telescope feb 12 1855 i sweep around for comet about a hour and then i amuse myself with notice the variety of color i wonder that i have so long be insensible to this charm in the sky the tint of the different star be so delicate in they variety what a pity that some of we manufacturer should not be able to steal the secret of dyestuff from the star and astonish the feminine taste by new brilliancy in fashion -lrb- footnote : see chapter xi -rrb- -lrb- nantucket -rrb- April -lrb- 1860 -rrb- my dear : you father just give I a great fright by tap at my window -lrb- i believe poe 's be a door be not it -rrb- and hold up you note i be busy examine some star notice just receive from russium or germany -- i never know where dorpat be -- and just think that my work be as good as theirs i always notice that when school-teacher take a holiday in order to visit other institution they come home and quietly say no school be better or as good as mine and then i read you note and perceive you reading be as good as mr kemble 's now be _ modest _ i always feel afraid the reason i think you such a good reader be because i do not know any better but if all the world be equally ignorant it make it all right i have be intensely busy i have be look for the little inferior planet to cross the sun which it have not do and i get a article ready for the paper and then have not the courage to publish -- not for fear of the reader but for fear that i should change my own idea by the time 'twa in print i be hope however to have something by the meeting of the scientific association in August -- some paper -- not to get reputation for myself -- my reputation be so much beyond I that as policy i should keep quiet -- but in order that my telescope may show that it be at work i be embarrass by the amount of work it might do -- as you do not know which of mr brown 's poem to read there be so many beauty the little republic of san marino present miss mitchell in 1859 with a bronze medal of merit together with the _ ribbon _ and _ letter patent _ sign by the two captain regent this medal she prize as highly as the gold one from denmark nantucket may 12 18 -lrb- 60 -rrb- i send you a notice of a occultation the last sentence and the last figure be mine you and i can never occult for have we not always help one another to shine do you have worcester 's dictionary i read it continually do you feast on ` the marble faun ' i have a charming letter from una hawthorne herself a poet by nature all about ` papa 's book ' ought not mr hawthorne to be the happiest man alive he be not though do save all the anecdote you possibly can piquant or not starve people be not over-nice lynn jan 5 -lrb- 1864 -rrb- i very rarely see the b -- s they go to a different church and you know with that class of people not to be with we be to be against we indeed i know very little of lynn people if i can get at mr j when you come to see I i 'll ask he to tea he have call several time but he be in such demand that he must be engage some week in advance would you if you live in lynn want to fall into such a mass of idolater i be wretchedly busy up to December 31 but have get into quiet sea again i have have a great deal of company -- not a person that i do not want to see but i can not make the day more than twenty-four hour long with all my economy of time this week professor crosby of salem come up with he graduate class and he corps of teacher for a evening they remain in lynn until miss mitchell be call to vassar college in 1865 as professor of astronomy and director of the observatory chapter ix 1865-1885 life at vassar college in she life at vassar college there be a great deal for miss mitchell to get accustom to if she duty have be merely as director of the observatory it would have be simply a continuation of she previous work but she be expect of course to teach astronomy she be by no means sure that she could succeed as a teacher and with this new work on hand she could not confine herself to original investigation -- that which have be she great aim in life but she be so much interested in the movement for the higher education of woman a interest which deepen as she work go on that she give up in a great measure she scientific life and throw herself heart and soul into this work for some year after she go to vassar she still continue the work for the nautical almanac but after a while she relinquish that and confine herself wholly to the work in the college 1866 vassar college bring together a mass of heterogeneous material out of which it be expect that a harmonious whole would evolve -- pupil from all part of the country of different habit different training different view teacher mostly from new england differ also professor largely from massachusett yet differ much and yet after a year we can say that there have be no very noisy jarring of the discordant element small jostle have be feel but the president have oil the rough place and we have slide over they miss -- be a bigot but a very sincere one she be the most conservative person i ever meet i think she a very good woman a woman of great energy she be very kind to I but have we live in the colonial day of massachusett and have she be a power she would have burn I at the stake for heresy yesterday the rush begin miss lyman -lrb- the lady principal -rrb- have set the twenty teacher all around in different place and i be put into the parlor to talk to ` anxious mother ' miss lyman have a hoarse cold but she receive about two hundred student and have all they room assign to they while she have one anxious mamma i take two or three and keep they wait until she could attend to they several teacher be with I i make a rush at the visitor as they enter and sometimes i be ask if i be lady principal and sometimes if i be the matron this morning miss lyman 's voice be go she must have see five hundred people yesterday among other there be one miss mitchell and of course that anxious mother put that girl under my special care and she be very bright then there be two who be send with letter to I and several other whose mother take to I because they be frighten by miss lyman 's _ style _ one lady who seem to be a bright woman get I by the button and hold I a long time -- she want this that and the other impracticable thing for the girl and tell I how honest she daughter be then with a flood of tear she say ` but she be not a christian i know i put she into good hand when i put she here ' -lrb- then i be strongly tempt to avow my unitarianism -rrb- miss w who be stand by say ` miss lyman will be a excellent spiritual adviser ' and we both look very serious when the mother wipe she weep eye and say ` and miss mitchell will you ask miss lyman to insist that my daughter shall curl she hair she look very graceful when she hair be curl and i want it insist upon ' i make a note of it with my pencil and as i happen to glance at miss w the corner of she mouth be twitch upon which i break down and laugh the mother bear it very good-naturedly but go on she want to know who would work some buttonhole in she daughter 's dress that be not quite finish etc and it all end in she invite I to make she a visit oct 31 1866 we faculty meeting always try I in this respect : we do thing that other college have do before we wait and ask for precedent if the earth have wait for a precedent it never would have turn on its axis sept 22 1868 i have write to-day to give up the nautical almanac work i do not feel sure that it will be for the best but i be sure that i could not hold the almanac and the college and father be happy here i tell miss lyman that my father be so much pleased with everything here that i be afraid he will be immerse -lrb- footnote : vassar college though professedly unsectarian be mainly under baptist control -rrb- only those who know vassar college in its earlier day can tell of the life that the father and daughter lead there for four year mr mitchell die in 1869 -lrb- illustration : the father and daughter -rrb- jan 3 1868 meeting dr hill at a private party i ask he if harvard college would admit girl in fifty year he say one of the most conservative member of the faculty have say within sixteen day that it would come about in twenty year i ask he if i could go into one of professor peirce 's recitation he say there be nothing to keep I out and that he would let I know when they come at eleven be the next Friday i stand at professor peirce 's door as the professor come in i go towards he and ask he if i might attend he lecture he say ` yes ' i say ` can you not say i shall be happy to have you ' and he say ' i shall be happy to have you ' but he do not look happy it be with some little embarrassment that mr k and i seat ourselves sixteen young man come into the room after the first glance at we there be not another look and the lecture go on professor peirce have fill the blackboard with formula and go on develop they he walk backwards and forwards all the time think it out as he go the student at first all take note but gradually they drop off until perhaps only half continue when he make simple mistake they receive it in silence only one that one he son -lrb- a tutor in college -rrb- remark that he be wrong the step of he lesson be all easy but of course it be impossible to tell whence he come or whither he be go the recitation-room be very common-looking -- we could not tolerate such at vassar the form and bench of the recitation-room be better for take note than ours be the professor be polite enough to ask we into the senior class but i have a engagement i ask he if a young lady present herself at the door he _ could _ keep she out and he say ` no and i should not ' i tell he i would send some of my girl oct 15 1868 resolve in case of my outlive father and be in good health to give my effort to the intellectual culture of woman without regard to salary if possible connect myself with liberal christian institution believe as i do that happiness and growth in this life be best promote by they and that what be good in this life be good in any life in August 1869 miss mitchell with several of she vassar student go to burlington ia to observe the total eclipse of the sun she write a popular account of she observation which be print in hour at home for September 1869 she record be publish in professor coffin 's report as she be a member of he party sept 26 1871 my class come in to-day for the first time twenty-five student -- more than ever before fine splendid-looking girl i feel almost frighten at the responsibility which come into my hand -- of the possible _ twist _ which i might give they 1871 i never look upon the mass of girl go into we dining-room or chapel without feel they nobility the sovereignty of they pure spirit the follow letter from miss mitchell though write at a later date give a idea of the practical observe do by she class : my dear miss -- : i reply to you question concern the observatory which you propose to establish and first let I congratulate you that you begin _ small _ a large telescope be a great luxury but it be a enormous expense and not at all necessary for teach my beginning class use only a small portable equatorial it stand out-doors from 7 be to 9 pm the girl be encourage to use it : they be expect to determine the rotation of the sun on its axis by watch the spot -- the same for the planet jupiter they determine the revolution of titan by watch its motion the retrograde and direct motion of the planet among the star the position of the sun with reference to its setting in winter and summer the phase of venus all they book learning in astronomy should be mathematical the astronomy which be not mathematical be what be so ludicrously call geography of the heaven -- be not astronomy at all my senior class generally small say six be receive as a class but in practical astronomy each girl be teach separately i believe in _ small _ class i instruct they separately first in the use of the meridian instrument and next in that of the equatorial they obtain the time for the college by meridian passage of star they use the equatorial just as far as they can do with very insufficient mechanism we work wholly on planet and they be teach to find a planet at any hour of the day to make drawing of what they see and to determine position of planet and satellite with the clock and chronograph they determine difference of right ascension of object by the electric mode of record they make sometimes very accurate drawing and they learn to know the satellite of saturn -lrb- titan rhea etc -rrb- by they different physiognomy as they would person they have sometimes measure diameter if you add to you observatory a meridian instrument i should advise a small one _ size _ be not so important as people generally suppose nicety and accuracy be what be need in all scientific work startling effect by large telescope and high power be too suggestive of sensational advertisement the relation between herself and she pupil be quite remarkable -- it be very cordial and intimate she speak of they always as she girl but at the same time she require they very best work and be intolerant of shirk or of a ambition to do what nature never intend the girl in question to do one of she pupil write thus : if it be only possible to tell you of what professor mitchell do for one of she girl ` she girl ' it mean so much to come into daily contact with such a woman there be no need of speaking of she ability the world know what that be but as she class-room be unique have something of home in its belongings so its atmosphere differ from that of all other anxiety and nervous strain be leave outside of the door perhaps one clue to she influence may be find in she remark to the senior class in astronomy when '76 enter upon its last year : ` we be woman study together ' occasionally it happen that work require two hour or more to prepare call for little time in the class then would come one of those treat which she bestow so freely upon she girl and which seem to put they in touch with the great outside world letter from astronomer in europe or america or from member of they family give delightful glimpse of home life story of she travels and of visit to famous people account of scientific convention and of large gathering of woman -- not so common then as now -- give she listener a wider outlook and new interest professor mitchell be chairman of a standing committee of the american association for the advancement of woman -- that on woman 's work in science -- and some of she student do they first work for woman 's organization in gathering statistics and fill out blank which she distribute among they the benefit derive from my college course be manifold but time and money would have be well spend have there be no return but that of two year ' intercourse with marium mitchell another pupil and later she successor at vassar college miss mary w whitney have say of she method of teaching : as a teacher miss mitchell 's gift be that of stimulus not that of drill she could not drill she would not drive but no honest student could escape the pressure of she strong will and earnest intent the mark system she hold in contempt and wish to have nothing to do with it ` you can not mark a human mind ' she say ` because there be no intellectual unit ' and upon take up she duty as professor she stipulate that she should not be hold responsible for a strict application of the system July 1887 my student use to say that my way of teaching be like that of the man who say to he son ` there be the letter of the english alphabet -- go into that corner and learn they ' it be not exactly my way but i do think as a general rule that teacher talk too much a book be a very good institution to read a book to think it over and to write out note be a useful exercise a book which will not repay some hard thought be not worth publish the fashion of lecturing be become a rage the teacher show herself off and she do not try enough to develop she pupil the greatest object in educate be to give a right habit of study \* \* \* \* \* not too much mechanical apparatus -- let the imagination have some play a cube may be show by a model but let the drawing upon the blackboard represent the cube and if possible let nature be the blackboard spread you triangle upon land and sky one of my pupil always throw she triangle on the celestial vault above she head a small apparatus well use will do wonder a celebrated chemist order he servant to bring in the laboratory -- on a tray newton roll up the cover of a book he put a small glass at one end and a large brain at the other -- it be enough \* \* \* \* \* when a student ask I ` what specialty shall i follow ' i answer ` adopt some one if none draw you and wait ' i be confident that she will find the specialty engross feb 10 1887 when i come to vassar i regret that mr vassar do not give full scholarship by degree i learn to think he plan of give half scholarship better and to-day i be ready to say ` give no scholarship at all ' i find a helping-hand lift the girl as crutch do she learn to like the help which be not self-help if a girl have the public school and want enough to learn she will learn it be hard but she be bear to hardness -- she can not dodge it labor be she inheritance i be bear for instance incapable of appreciate music i mourn it should i go to a music-school therefore no avoid the music-school it be a very expensive branch of study when the public school have teach read write and arithmetic the boy or girl have he or she tool let they use these tool and get a few hour for study every day do not give educational aid to sickly young people the old idea that the feeble young man must be fit for the ministry because the more sickly the more saintly have go out health of body be not only a accompaniment of health of mind but be the cause the converse may be true -- that health of mind cause health of body but we all know that intellectual cheer and vivacity act upon the mind if the gymnastic exercise help the mind the concert or the theater improve the health of the body let the unfortunate young woman whose health be delicate take to the culture of the wood and field or raise strawberry and avoid teaching better give a young girl who be poor a common-school education a little lift and tell she to work out she own career if she have a distaste to the homely routine of life leave she the opportunity to try any other career but let she understand that she stand or fall by herself not every girl should go to college the over-burdened mother of a large family have a right to be aid by she daughter 's hand i would aid the mother and not the daughter i would not put the exceptionally smart girl from a _ very _ poor family into college unless she be a genius and a genius should wait some year to _ prove _ she genius endow the already establish institution with money endow the woman who show genius with _ time _ a case at john hopkin university be a excellent one a young woman go into the institution who be already a scholar she show what she can do and she take a scholarship she be not place in a happy valley of do nothing -- she be put into a workshop where she can work we be all apt to say ` could we have have the opportunity in life that we neighbor have ' -- and we leave the unfinished sentence to imply that we should have be genius no one ever say ` if i have not have such golden opportunity thrust upon I i might have develop by a struggle ' but why look back at all why turn you eye to you shadow when by look upward you see you rainbow in the same direction but we want of opportunity be we opportunity -- we privation be we privilege -- we need be stimulant we be what we be because we have little and want much and it be hard to tell which be the more powerful factor \* \* \* \* \* small aid to individual large aid to mass \* \* \* \* \* the russian czar determine to find a observatory and the first thing he do be to take a million dollar from the government treasury he send to america to order a thirty-five inch telescope from alvan clark -- not to promote science but to surpass other nation in the size of he glass ` to he that have shall be give ' read it ` to he that have _ should _ be give ' \* \* \* \* \* to give wisely be hard i do not wonder that the millionaire found a new college -- why should he not millionaire be few and he be a man by himself -- he must have view or he could not have earn a million but let the man or woman of ordinary wealth seek out the best institution already start -- the best girl already in college -- and give the endowment i know a rich woman who wish to give aid to some girl ' school and she travel in order to find that institution which give the most solid learning with the least show she find it where few would expect it -- in tennessee it be worth while to travel the aid that come need not be money let it be a careful consideration of the object and a evident interest in the cause when you aid a teacher you improve the education of you child it be a wonder that teacher work as well as they do i never look at a group of they without use mentally the expression ` the noble army of martyr ' the chemist should have have a laboratory and the observatory should have have a astronomer but we be too apt to bestow money where there be no man and to find a man where there be no money \* \* \* \* \* if every girl who be aid be a very high order of scholar scholarship would undoubtedly conquer poverty but a large part of the aid student be ordinary they lack at least executive power as they ancestor probably do poverty be a misfortune misfortune be often the result of blamable indiscretion extravagance etc it be one of the many blessing of poverty that one be not oblige to ` give wisely ' 1866 _ to she student : _ i can not expect to make astronomer but i do expect that you will invigorate you mind by the effort at healthy mode of think when we be chafe and fret by small care a look at the star will show we the littleness of we own interest but star-gazing be not science the entrance to astronomy be through mathematics you must make up you mind to steady and earnest work you must be content to get on slowly if you only get on thoroughly the phrase ` popular science ' have in itself a touch of absurdity that knowledge which be popular be not scientific the law which govern the motion of the sun the earth planet and other body in the universe can not be understand and demonstrate without a solid basis of mathematical learning \* \* \* \* \* every formulum which express a law of nature be a hymn of praise to god \* \* \* \* \* you can not study anything persistently for year without become learn and although i would not hold reputation up to you as a very high object of ambition it be a wayside flower which you be sure to have catch at you skirt whatever apology other woman may have for loose ill-finished work or work not finish at all you will have none when you leave vassar college you leave it the _ best educate woman in the world _ live a little outside of the college beyond the reach of the little current that go up and down the corridor i think i be a fairer judge of you advantage than you can be yourselve and when i say you will be the best educate woman in the world i do not mean the education of text-book and class-room and apparatus only but that broader education which you receive unconsciously that higher teaching which come to you all unknown to the giver from daily association with the noble-souled woman who be around you 1871 when astronomer compare observation make by different person they can not neglect the constitutional peculiarity of the individual and there enter into these computation a quantity call ` personal equation ' in common term it be that difference between two individual from which result a difference in the _ time _ which they require to receive and note a occurrence if one see a star at one instant and record it the record of another of the same thing be not the same it be true also that the same individual be not the same at all time so that between two individual there be a mean or middle individual and each individual have a mean or middle self which be not the man of to-day nor the man of yesterday nor the man of to-morrow but a middle man among these different self \* \* \* \* \* we especially need imagination in science it be not all mathematics nor all logic but it be somewhat beauty and poetry there will come with the greater love of science greater love to one another live more nearly to nature be live farther from the world and from its folly but nearer to the world 's people it be to be of they with they and for they and especially for they improvement we can not see how impartially nature give of she riches to all without love all and help all and if we can not learn through nature 's law the certainty of spiritual truth we can at least learn to promote spiritual growth while we be together and live in a trust hope of a greater growth in the future the great gain would be freedom of think woman more than man be bind by tradition and authority what the father the brother the doctor and the minister have say have be receive undoubtingly until woman throw off this reverence for authority they will not develop when they do this when they come to truth through they investigation when doubt lead they to discovery the truth which they get will be theirs and they mind will work on and on unfettered -lrb- 1874 -rrb- i be but a woman for woman there be undoubtedly great difficulty in the path but so much the more to overcome first no woman should say ' i be but a woman ' but a woman what more can you ask to be bear a woman -- bear with the average brain of humanity -- bear with more than the average heart -- if you be mortal what higher destiny could you have no matter where you be nor what you be you be a power -- you influence be incalculable personal influence be always underrate by the person we be all centre of sphere -- we see the portion of the sphere above we and we see how little we affect it we forget the part of the sphere around and before we -- it extend just as far every way another common say ` it be not the way ' etc who settle the way be there any one so forgetful of the sovereignty bestow on she by god that she accept a leader -- one who shall capture she mind there be this great danger in student life now we rest all upon what socrate say or what copernicus teach how can we dispute authority which have come down to we all establish for age we must at least question it we can not accept anything as grant beyond the first mathematical formula question everything else ` the world be round and like a ball seem swing in the air ' -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : from peter parley 's primary geography -rrb- no such thing the world be not round it do not swing and it do not _ seem _ to swing i know i shall be call heterodox and that unseen lightning flash and unheard thunderbolt will be play around my head when i say that woman will never be profound student in any other department except music while they give four hour a day to the _ practice _ of music i should by all means encourage every woman who be bear with musical gift to study music but study it as a science and a art and not as a accomplishment and to every woman who be not musical i should say ` do not study it at all ' you can not afford four hour a day out of some year of you life just to be agreeable in company upon _ possible _ occasion if for four hour a day you study year after year the science of language for instance do you suppose you would not be a linguist do you put the mere pleasing of some social party and the reception of a few compliment against the mental development of four hour a day of study of something for which you be bear when i see that girl who be require by they parent to go through with the irksome practise really become respectable performer i wonder what four hour a day at something which they love and for which god design they would do for they i should think that to a real scientist in music there would be something mortifying in this rush of all woman into music as there would be to I if i see every girl learn the constellation and then think she be a astronomer jan 8 1876 at the meeting of graduate at the deacon house the speech that be make be mainly those of dr r and professor b i be sorry now that i do not at least say that the college be what it be mainly because the early student push up the course to a collegiate standard jan 25 1876 it have become a serious question with I whether it be not my duty to beg money for the observatory while what i really long for be a quiet life of scientific speculation i want to sit down and study on the observation make by myself and other during she later year at vassar miss mitchell interested herself personally in raise a fund to endow the chair of astronomy in march 1886 she write : i have be in new york quite lately and be quite hopeful that miss -- will do something for vassar mr c of newburyport be to ask whittier who be say to be rich and -- tell I to get anything i could out of she father but after all i be a poor beggar my idea be small since miss mitchell 's death the fund have be complete by the alumna and be know as the marium mitchell endowment fund with $ 10000 appropriate by the trustee it amount to $ 50000 June 18 1876 i have imagine the emperor of brazil to be a dark swarthy tall man of forty-five year that he would not really have a crown upon he head but that i should feel it be somewhere around handy-like and that i should know i be in royal presence but he turn out to be a large old man -- say sixty-five -- broad-headed and broad-shouldered with a big white beard and a very pleasant even chatty manner once inside of the dome he seem to feel at home to my astonishment he ask if alvan clark make the glass of the equatorial as he step into the meridian-room and see the instrument he say ` collimator ' i say ` you have be in observatory before ' ` oh yes cambridge and washington ' he reply he seem much more interested in the observatory than i could possibly expect i ask he to go on top of the roof and he say he have not time yet he stay long enough to go up several time i be tell that he follow out remarkably he own idea as to he movement in 1878 miss mitchell go to denver colorado to observe the total eclipse of the sun she be accompany by several of she former pupil she prepare a account of this eclipse which will be find in chapter xi aug 20 1878 dr raymond -lrb- president of vassar college -rrb- be dead i can not quite take it in i have never know the college without he and it will make all thing different personally i have always be fond of he he be very enjoyable socially and intellectually officially he be in he relation to the student perfect he be cautious to a fault and have probably be very wise in he administration of college affair he be broad in he religious view he be not broad in he idea of woman and be make to broaden the education of woman by the woman around he June 18 1881 the dome party to-day be sixty-two in number it be breakfast and we open the dome we seat forty in the dome and twenty in the meridian-room this dome party require a few word of explanation because it be unique among all the vassar festivity the week before commencement miss mitchell 's pupil would be inform of the approach gathering by a notice like the following : circular the annual dome party will be hold at the observatory on Saturday the 19th at 6 pm you be cordially invite to be present m m -lrb- as this gathering be highly intellectual you be invite to bring poem -rrb- it be at first hold in the evening but during the last year be a breakfast party its character in other respects remain the same little table be spread under the dome around the big telescope the flower be rose from miss mitchell 's own garden the poem be nonsense rhyme in the writing of which miss mitchell be a adept each student would have a few verse of a more or less personal character write by miss mitchell and there be other write by the girl themselves some be impromptu other be set to music and sing by a select glee-club June 5 1881 we have write what we call we dome poetry some nice poem have come in to we i think the vassar girl in the main be magnificent they be so all-alive may 20 1882 vassar be get pretty i gather lily of the valley this morning the young robin be out in a tree close by we and the phoebe have build as usual under the front step i be rush dome poetry but so far show no alarming symptom of brilliancy a former student write as follow about the dome poetry : at the time it be read though it seem mere merry nonsense it really serve a more serious purpose in the work of one who do nothing aimlessly this apparent nonsense serve as the vehicle to convey a expression of approbation affection criticism or disapproval in such a merry mode that even the bitterest draught seem sweet 1881 July 5 we leave vassar June 24 on the steamer ` galatea ' from new york to providence i look out of my state-room window and see a strange-looking body in the northern sky my heart sink i know instantly that it be a comet and that i must return to the observatory call the young people around I and point it out to they i have they assurance that it be a comet and nothing but a comet we go to bed at nine and i arise at six in the morning as soon as i could get my niece start for providence i start for stonington -- the most easy of the way of get to new york as i should avoid point judith i go to the boat at the stonington wharf about noon and remain on board until morning -- there be few passenger it be very quiet and i sleep well arrive in new york i take car at 9 be for poughkeepsie and reach the college at dinner-time i go to work the same evening as i could not tell at what time the comet would pass the meridian i station myself at the telescope in the meridian-room by 10 pm and watch for the comet to cross as it approach the meridian i see that it would go behind a scraggy apple-tree i send for the watchman mr crumb to come with a saw and cut off the upper limb he come back with a axe and chop away vigorously but as one limb after another fell and i say ' i need more cut away ' he say ' i think i must cut down the whole tree ' i say ` cut it down ' i feel the barbarism of it but i feel more that a bird might have a nest in it i find when i go to breakfast the next morning that the story have precede I and i be call ` george washington ' but for all this i get almost no observation the fog come up and i have scarcely anything better than a estimation i see the comet blaze out just on the edge of the field and i could read its declination only on the 28th 29th and July 1st i obtain good meridian passage and the ra must be very good jan 12 1882 there be a strange sentence in the last paragraph of dr jacobus 's article on the study of medicine by woman to the effect that it would be better for the husband always to be superior to the wife why and if so do not it condemn the ablest woman to a single life march 13 1882 3 pm i start for faculty and we probably shall elect what be call the ` honor girl ' i dread the struggle that be pretty certain to come each of we have some favorite whom she wish to put into the highest class and whom she honestly believe to be of the highest order of merit i never have the whole ten to suit I but i can truly say that at this minute i do not care i should be sorry not to see s and w and p and e and g and k on the list of the ten but probably that be more than i ought to expect the whole system be demoralizing and foolish girl study for prize and not for learn when ` honor ' be at the end the unscholarly motive be wear if they study for sound learn the cheer which would come with every day 's gain would be health-preserving i have seven advanced student and to-day when i look around to see who should be call to help look out for meteor i could consider only _ one _ of they not already overworked and she be the post-graduate who take no honor and never hurry and have always be a excellent student we be send home some girl already -lrb- November 14 -rrb- and -- be among they i be somewhat alarm at the drop down but -- do a enormous amount of work belong to every club and write for every club and for the ` vassar miscellany ' etc of course she have the headache most of the time sometimes i be distressed for fear dr clarke -lrb- footnote : author of sex in education -rrb- be not so far wrong but i do not think it be the study -- it be the morbid conscientiousness of the girl who think they must work every minute April 26 1882 miss herschel come to the college on the 11th and stay three day she be one of the little girl whom i see twenty-three year since play on the lawn at sir john herschel 's place collingwood miss herschel be just perfect as a guest she fit in beautifully the teacher give a reception for she -- give she he poem and henry the gardener find out that the man in whose employ he lose a finger be she brother-in-law in leed jan 9 1884 mr -lrb- matthew -rrb- arnold have be to the college and have give he lecture on emerson the audience be make up of three hundred student and three hundred guest from town never be a man listen to with so much attention whether he be right in he judgment or not he hold he audience by he manly way he kindly dissection and he graceful english socially he charm we all he chat with every one he smile on all he say he be sorry to leave the college and that he feel he must come to america again we have not have such a awakening for year it be like a new volume of old english poetry march 16 1885 in February 1831 i count seconds for father who observe the annular eclipse at nantucket i be twelve and a half year old in 1885 fifty-four year later i count seconds for a class of student at vassar it be the same eclipse but the sun be only about half-covered both day be perfectly clear and cold chapter x 1873 second european tour -- russium -- france power cobbe -- the glasgow college for girl in 1873 miss mitchell spend the summer in europe and avail herself of this opportunity to visit the government observatory at pulkova in russium eydkuhnen Wednesday July 30 1873 certainly i never in my life expect to spend twenty-four hour in this small town the frontier town of prussium here i remember that we little bag would be examine and i ask the guard about it but he say we need not trouble ourselves we should not be examine until we reach the first russian town of wiersbelow so after a mile more of travel we come to wiersbelow know that we should keep we little compartment until we get to st petersburg we have scatter we luggage about glove be in one place veil in another shawl in another parasol in another and book all around the train stop imagine we consternation two official enter the carriage tall russian in full uniform and seize everything -- shawl book glove bag and then look around very carefully espy w 's poor little ragged handkerchief and seize that too as a contraband article we look at one another and say nothing the tall russian say something to we we look at each other and sit still the tall russian look at one another and there be almost a official smile between they then one turn to I and say very distinctly ` passy-port ' ` oh ' i say ` the passport be all right where be they ' and we produce from we pocket the passport prepare at washington with the official seal and we deliver they with a sort of air as if we have say ` you 'll find that they do thing all right at washington ' the tall russian get out and i be about to breathe freely when they return and say something else -- not a word do i understand they exchange a look of amusement and w and i one of amazement then one of they make sign to we to get out the sign be unmistakable and we get out and follow they into a immense room where be table all around cover with luggage and about a hundred traveller stand by and we book shawl glove etc be throw in a heap upon one of these table and we awake to the disagreeable consciousness that we be in a custom-house and only two out of a hundred traveller and that we do not understand one word of russian but of course it could be only a few minute of delay and if german and french fail there be always leave the language of sign and all would be right after perhaps half a hour two or three official approach we and hold the passport begin to talk to we how do they know that those two passport belong to we out of two hundred person how could they at once see that the woman whose age be give at more than half a century and the lad whose age be give at less than a score of year be the two fatigued and weary traveller who stand guard a small heap of glove book handkerchief and shawl two of the official hold up the passport to we point to the blank page shake they head ominously the third take the passport put they into he vest pocket button up he coat and motion to we to follow he we follow he open the door of a ordinary carriage wave he hand for we to get in jump in himself and we find we be start back we could not cross the line between germany and russium we meekly ask where we be to go and be relieve when we find that we go back only to the nearest town but that the passport must be send to konigsberg sixty mile away to be endorse by the russian ambassador -- it might take some day w be very much inclined to refuse to go back and to attempt a war of word but it do not seem wise to I to undertake a war against the russian government i know we country do not lightly go into a ` unpleasantness ' of that kind so we go back to eydkuhnen -- a little miserable german village we take room at the only hotel and there we stay twenty-four hour before the end of that time we have visit every shop in the village and air we german to most of we fellow-traveller whom we meet at the hotel the landlord take we part and declare it be hard enough on simple traveller like ourselves to be stop in such a way and that russium be the only country in europe which be rigid in that respect happily we passport be back in twenty-four hour and we start again we trunk have be register for st petersburg and to st petersburg they have go ahead of we and of the small heap of thing throw down promiscuously at the custom-house the whole have not come back to we -- it be not very important i learn how to wear one glove instead of two or to go without we have the ordeal of the custom-house to pass again but once pass and tell that we be free to go on it be like go into a clear atmosphere from a fog we cross the custom-house threshold into another room and we find ourselves in russium and in a excellent well-furnished and cheery restaurant we lose the german smoke and the german beer we find hot coffee and clean table-cloth we do not return to we dusty red-velvet palace but we enter a clean comfortable compartment with easy sofa for the night we start again for st petersburg we be now four day from london i will omit the detail of a break-down that night and another change of car we have some sleep and awake in the morning to enjoy russium and first of russian railroad when the railroad of russium be plan the emperor nichola allow a large sum of money for the build the engineer show he he plan the road wound by slight curve from one town to another this do not suit the emperor at all he take he ruler put it down upon the table and say : ' i choose to have my road run so ' of course the engineer assent -- he have he large fund grant a straight road be much cheaper to build than a curved one as a consequence he build and furnish a excellent road at every ` verst ' which be not quite a mile a small house be place at the roadside on which in very large figure the number of verst from st petersburg be tell the train run very smoothly and very slowly twenty mile a hour be about the rate of course the journey seem long for a large part of the way it be a uninhabited level plain so green however that it seem like travel on prairie occasionally we pass a dreary little village of small hut and as we near st petersburg we pass larger and better build town which the dome of some cathedral light up for mile the road be enliven too by another peculiarity the restaurant be all adorn by flag of all color and festoon by vine at one place the green arch run across the road and we pass under a bower of evergreen i accept this at first as a russian peculiarity and be surprise that so much attention be pay to traveller but i learn that it be not for we at all the duke of edinboro ' have pass over the road a few day before on he way to st petersburg for he betrothal to the only daughter of the czar and the decoration be for he and so we feel that we be of the party although we have not be ask we approach st petersburg just at night and catch the play of the sunlight on the dome it be a city of dome -- blue dome green dome white dome and above all the golden dome of the cathedral of st isaac 's it be almost never a single dome st isaac 's central gilded dome loom up above its fellow dome but four smaller one surround it it be summer the temperature be delightful about like we October the shower be frequent there be no dust and no sultry air there must be a great deal of nice mechanical work require in st petersburg for on the nevsky perspective the principal street there be a great many shop in which graduating and measure instrument of very nice workmanship be for sale especially i notice the excellence of the thermometer and i naturally stop to read they figure be a common language but it be clear that i be in another planet i could not read the thermometer i judge that the weather be warm enough for the thermometer to be at 68 i read say 16 and then i remember that the russian do not put they freezing point at 32 as we do and i be oblige to go through a troublesome calculation before i could tell how warm it be but i come to a still stranger experience i date my letter August 3 and go to my banker 's before i seal they to see if there be letter for I the banker 's little calendar be hang by he desk and the day of the month be on exhibition in large figure i read July 22 this be distressing be i like alice in wonderland do time go backward surely i have date August 3 could i be in error twelve day and then i perceive that twelve day be just the difference of old and new calendar how many time i have teach student that the russian still count they time by the ` old style ' but have never learn it myself and so i be oblige to teach myself new lesson in science the earth turn on its axis just the same in russium as in boston but you do not get out of the sunlight at the boston sunset hour when the thermometer stand at 32 in st petersburg it do not freeze as it do in boston on the contrary it be very warm in st petersburg for it mean what 104 do in boston and if you leave london on the 22d of July and be five day on the way to st petersburg a week after you get there it be still the 22d of July and we complain that the day be too short another peculiarity we stroll over the city all day we come back to we hotel tire we take we tea we talk over the day we write to we friend we plan for the next day we be ready to retire we walk to the window -- the sun be striking on all the chimney top it do not seem to be right even for the lark to go to sleep while the sun shine we look at we watch but the watch say nine o'clock and we go off to we bed in daytime and we awake after the first nap to perceive that the sun still shine into the room like all careful aunt i be unwilling that my nephew should be out alone at night he be desirous of do the right thing but urge that at home as a little boy he be always allow to be out until dark and he ask if he could stay out until dark alas for the poor lad there be no dark at all i could not consent for he to be out all night and the twilight be not over you may read and read that the summer day at st petersburg be twenty hour long but until you see that the sun scarcely set you can not take it in i wonder whether the labor man work eight or ten hour under my window it seem to I that he be saw wood the whole twenty-four w come in one night after a stroll and describe a beautiful square which he have come upon accidentally i listen with great interest and say ' i must go there in the morning what be the name of it ' -- ' i do not know ' he reply -- ` why do not you read the sign ' i ask -- ' i can not read ' be the reply -- ` oh no but why do not you ask some one ' -- ' i can not speak ' he answer neither read nor speak we have to learn st petersburg by we observation and it be the best way most traveller read too much there be learn institution in st petersburg : university library picture-gallery and museum but the first institution with which i become acquaint be the drosky the drosky be a very very small phaeton it have the driver 's seat in front and a very narrow seat behind he one person can have room enough on this second seat but it usually carry two invariably the drosky be line with dark-blue cloth and the drosky-driver wear a dark-blue wrapper come to the foot gird around the waist by a crimson sash he also wear a bell-shaped hat turn up at the side you be a little in doubt if you see he at first separate from he drosky whether he be a market-woman or a serving-man the dress be very much like a morning wrapper but he be rarely six foot away from he carriage and usually he be upon it sound asleep the trunk have go to st petersburg in advance of ourselves we first duty be to get possession of they they be at the custom-house across the city my nephew and i jump upon a drosky -- we could not say that we be really _ in _ the drosky for the seat be too short the drosky-driver start off he horse over the cobble-stone at a terrible rate i could not keep my seat and i clung to w he shout ` do not hold by I i shall be out the next minute ' what could be do i be sure i should not stay on half a minute blessing on the red sash of the drosky-man -- i catch at that he drive faster and faster and i clung tighter and tighter but alarm at two immense danger : first that i should stop he breath by drag the girdle so tightly and next that when it become unendurable to he he would loosen it in front i could not perceive that he be aware of my existence at all he have only one object in life -- to carry we across the city to we place of destination and to get he copeck in return in a few day i learn to like the jolly vehicle very much they be so numerous that you may pick one up on any street whenever you be tire of walk my principal object in visit st petersburg be the astronomical observatory at pulkova some twelve mile distant i have letter to the director otto von struve but we consul declare that i must also have one from he for struve be a very great man i of course accept it we make the journey by rail and coach but it would be better to drive the whole way most observatory be temple of silence and quiet reign as we drive into the grounds at pulkova a small crowd of child of all age and servant of all degree come out to meet we they do not come out to do we honor but to gaze at we i could not understand it until i learn that the director of the observatory have a large number of aid and they with all they family live in large house connect with the central building by covered way all about the grounds too be small observatory -- little temple -- in which young man be practise for observation on the transit of venus these little building i afterwards learn be to be take down and transport instrument and all to the coast of asia the director of the observatory be otto struve -- he father wilhelm struve precede he in this office properly the director be herr von struve but the old russian custom be still in use and the servant call he wilhelm-vitch that be ` the son of william ' when i buy a photograph of the present emperor alexander i see that he be call nicholas-vitch herr struve receive we courteously and a assistant be call to show we the instrument all observatory be much alike therefore i will not describe this except in its peculiarity one of these be the presence of small light portable room ie baseless box which roll over the instrument to protect they two side be of wood and two side of green silk curtain which could of course be turn aside when the box or little room be roll over the apparatus be cover in this way the heavy shutter can be leave open for week at a time everything be on a large scale -- the room be immense the director have three assistant who be call ` elder astronomer ' and two who be call ` adjunct astronomer ' each of these have a servant devoted to he i ask one of the elder astronomer if he have room in the observatory and he answer ` yes my room be 94 ft by 50 ' they seem to be amuse at the size of they lodgings for mr struve when he tell I of he apartment give I at once the dimension -- 200 ft by 100 ft the room in which we dine with the family of herr struve be immense i speak of it and he say ` we can not open we window in the winter -- the winter be so severe -- and so we must have good air without it ' they drawing-room be also very large the chair -lrb- innumerable it seem to I -rrb- stand stiffly around the wall of the room the floor be paint and highly varnished and flower-pot be at the numerous window on little stand it be scrupulously neat everywhere there be very little ceremony at dinner we have the delicious wild strawberry of the country in great profusion and the talk the best part of the dinner be in german russian and english madame struve speak german russian and french and complain that she could not speak english she say that she have spend three week with a english lady and that she must be very stupid not to speak english i notice that in one of the room which be not so very immense there be a circular table a small centre-carpet and chair around the table i have be tell that ` in society ' in russium the lady sit in a circle and the gentleman walk around and talk consecutively with the lady -- kindly give to each a share of they attention they assure I that the winter be charming the sleighing constant and the social gathering cheery but think of four hour only of daylight in the depth of the winter they dread be the spring and the autumn when the mud be deep everything in the observatory which could be be build of wood they have the fir which be very indestructible it be suppose to show no mark of change in two hundred year wood be so susceptible of ornamentation that the pretty village of russium -- and there be some that look like new england village -- strike we very pleasantly after the stone and brick village of england i try when i be abroad to see in what they be superior to we -- not in what they be inferior we great idea be of course freedom and self-government probably in that we be ahead of the rest of the world although we be certainly not so much in advance as we suppose but we be sufficiently inflate with we own greatness to let that subject take care of itself when we travel we travel to learn and i have never be in any country where they do not do something better than we do it think some thought better than we think catch some inspiration from height above we own -- as in the art of italy the learning of england and the philosophy of germany let we take the scientific position of russium when half a century ago john quincy adam propose the establishment of a astronomical observatory at a cost of $ 100000 it be ridicule by the newspaper consider utopian and dismiss from the public mind when we government a few year since vote a appropriation of $ 50000 for a telescope for the national observatory it be consider magnificent yet a quarter of a century since -lrb- 1838 -rrb- russium found a astronomical observatory the government spend $ 200000 on instrument $ 1500000 on building and annually appropriate $ 38000 for salary of observer i naturally think that a million and a half dollar and oriental idea combine would make the observatory a showy place i expect that the observatory would be surmount by a gilded dome and that ` pearly gate ' would open as i approach there be not even a dome the central observation-room be a cylinder and its door swing back on hinge wherever it be possible wood be use instead of stone or brick i could not detect in the whole structure anything like carve gilding or painting for mere show it be all for science and its ornamentation be adapt to its use and come at they demand in we country the man of science lead a isolate life if he have capability of administration we government do not yet believe in they the director of the observatory at pulkova have the military rank of general and he be privy councillor to the czar every subordinate have also he military position -- he be a soldier what would you think of it if the director of any observatory be one of the president 's cabinet at washington in virtue of he position struve 's position be that of a member of the president 's cabinet here be another difference : ours be a democratic country we recognize no caste we be bear ` free and equal ' we honor labor work be ennoble these expression we be all accustomed to use do we live up to they many a rich man many a man in fine social position have marry a school-teacher but i never hear it speak of as a source of pride in the alliance until i go to despotic russium struve tell I as he would have tell of any other honor which have be he that he wife as a girl have teach school in st petersburg and then madame struve join in the conversation and tell I how much the subject of woman 's education still hold she interest st petersburg be about the size of philadelphium struve say ` there be thousand of woman study science in st petersburg ' how many thousand woman do you suppose be study science in the whole state of new york i doubt if there be five hundred then again as to language it be rare even among the common people to meet one who speak one language only if you can speak no russian try you poor french you poor german or you good english you may be sure that the shopkeeper will answer in one or another and even the drosky-driver pick up a little of some one of they of late the russian government have found a medical school for woman give they advantage which be give to man and the same rank when they graduate the czar himself contribute largely to the fund one wonder in a country so rich as ours that so few man and woman gratify they taste by found scholarship and aid for the tuition of girl -- it must be such a pleasant way of spend money then as regard religion i be never in a country where the catholic or greek church be dominant but i see with admiration the zeal of its follower i may pity they delusion but i must admire they devotion if you look around in one of we church upon the congregation five-sixth be woman and in some town nineteen-twentieth and if you form a judgment from that fact you would suppose that religion be entirely a ` woman 's right ' in a catholic church or greek church the man be not only as numerous as the woman but they be as intense in they worship well-dressed man with good head will prostrate themselves before the image of the holy virgin as many time and as devoutly as the beggar-woman i think i see a russian gentleman at st isaac 's touch he forehead to the floor rise and stand erect touch the floor again and rise again ten time in as many minute and we be one day forbid entrance to a church because the czar be about to say he prayer we find he be make the pilgrimage of some seventy church and pray in each one christian who believe in public prayer and who claim that we should be instant in prayer would consider it a severe tax upon they energy to pray seventy time a day -- they do not care to do it then there be the _ democracy _ of the church there be no pew to be sell to the highest bidder -- no ` reserved seat ' the oneness and equality before god be always recognize a russian gentleman as he pray do not look around and move away from the poor beggar next to he at st peter 's the crowd stand or kneel -- at st isaac 's they stand and they stand literally on the same plane i notice in the crowd at st isaac 's one festival day young girl who be have a friendly chat but they religion be ever in they thought and they cross themselves certainly once a minute they religion be not a affair of Sunday but of every day in the week the drosky-driver certainly the most stupid class of my acquaintance in russium never forget he prayer if he passenger be never so much in a hurry and the bribe never so high the drosky-driver will check he horse and make the sign of the cross as he pass the little image of the virgin -- so small perhaps that you have not notice it until you wonder why he slacken he pace then as to government we boast of we national freedom and we talk about universal suffrage the ` home of the free ' etc yet the serf in russium be free in march 1861 just before we civil war begin they free they serf without any war and each serf receive some acre of land they free twenty-three million and we free four or five million of black and all of we who be old enough remember that one of the fear in free the slave be the number of lawless and ignorant black who it be suppose would come to the north we talk about _ universal _ suffrage a larger part of the antiquated russian vote than of american just as i come away from st petersburg i meet a moscow family travel we occupy the same compartment car it be a family consist of a lady and she three daughter when they find where i have be they ask I in excellent english what have carry I to st petersburg and then why i be interested in pulkova and so i must tell they about american girl and so of course of vassar college they ply I with question : ` do you have woman in you faculty do man and woman hold the same rank ' i return the question : ` be there a girl 's college in moscow ' ` no ' say the youngest sister with a sigh ` we be always _ go _ to have one ' the eldest sister ask : ` do woman vote in america ' ` no ' i say ` do woman vote in russium ' she say ` no ' but she mother interrupt she and there be a spicy conversation between they in russian and then the mother who have rarely speak turn to I and say : ' i vote but i do not go to the poll myself i send somebody to represent I my vote rest upon my property ' have you not read a story of late in the newspaper about some excellent woman in a little town in connecticut whose pet heifer be take by force and sell because they refuse to pay the large tax levy upon they by they townsman they be the largest holder of property in the town that circumstance could not have happen in barbarous russium there the owner of property have a right to say how it shall be use ` why do you ask I about we government ' i say to the russian girl ` be you interested in question of government ' they reply ` all russian woman be interested in question of that sort ' how many american woman be interested in question concern government these young girl know exactly what question to ask about vassar college -- the course of study the diploma the number of graduate etc the eldest say : ` we be at once excite when we hear of woman study we have long for opportunity to study all we live we father be the engineer of the first russian railroad and he spend two year in america i confess to a feeling of mortification when one of these girl ask I ` do you ever read the translation of a russian book ' and i be oblige to answer ` no ' this girl have read american book in the original they be talk russian french german and english and yet mourning over they need of education and in general education especially in that of woman i think we must be in advance of they one of these sister forget my ignorance say something to I in russian the other laugh ` what do she say ' i ask the eldest reply ` she ask you to take she back with you and educate she ' ` but ' i say ` you read and speak you language -- the learning of the world be open to you -- find you own college ' and the young girl lean back on the cushion draw she mantle around she and say ` we have not the energy of the american girl ' the energy of the american girl the rich inheritance which have come down to she from man and woman who seek in the new world a better and higher life when the american girl carry she energy into the great question of humanity into the practical problem of life when she take home to she heart the interest of education of government and of religion what may we not hope for we country london 1873 it be the 26th of August and i have no hope that miss cobbe could be at she town residence but i feel bind to deliver mr howe 's letter and i wish to give she a vassar pamphlet so i take a cab and drive it be at a enormous distance from my lodging -- she tell I it be six mile i be as much surprised as delighted when the girl say she be at home for the house have painter in it the carpet be up and everything look uninhabitable the girl come back after take my card and ask I if i would go into the studio and so take I through a pretty garden into a small building of two room the outer one fill with picture and book i have never hear that miss cobbe be a artist and so i look around and be afraid that i have get the wrong miss cobbe but as i glance at the table i see the ` contemporary review ' and i take up the first article and read it -- by herbert spencer i have become somewhat interested in a pretty severe criticism of the mode of reasoning of mathematical man and have perceive that he say the problem of concrete science be harder than any of the physical science -lrb- which i admit be all true -rrb- when a very white dog come bound in upon I and i drop the book know that the dog 's mistress must be come -- and miss cobbe enter she look just as i expect but even larger but then she head be magnificent because so large she be very cordial at once and tell I that miss davy have tell she i be in london she say the studio be that of she friend i could not refrain from thank she for she book and tell she how much we value they in america and how much good i believe they have do she color a very little and say ` nothing could be more gratify to I ' i have hear that she be not a woman 's rights woman and she say ` who could have tell you that i be remarkably so i write suffrage article continually -- i sign petition ' i be delighted to find that she have be a intimate friend of mr somerville have correspond with she for year and have a letter from she after she be ninety-two year of age when she be read quaternion for amusement she say that mr somerville would probably have call herself a unitarian but that really she be a theist and that it come out more in she later life she say she be correct proof of the life by the daughter that the life be intensely interesting that mr somerville mourn all she life that she have not have the advantage of education i ask she how i could get a photograph of mr somerville and she say they could not be buy she tell I without any hint from I that she would give vassar college a plaster cast of the bust of mr somerville -lrb- footnote : this bust always stand in miss mitchell 's parlor at the observatory -rrb- she say as woman grow older if they live independent life they be pretty sure to be ` woman 's rights woman ' she say the clergy -- the broadest who be in harmony with she -- be very courteous and that since she have grow old -lrb- she be about forty-five -rrb- all man be more tolerant of she and forget the difference of sex i feel draw to she when she be most serious i tell she i have suffer much from doubt and ask she if she have and she say yes when she be young but that she have have in she life rare interval when she believe she hold communion with god and on those rare period she have rest in the long intermission she laugh and the tear come to she eye all together she be _ quick _ and all-alive and so courteous when she give I a book she say ` may i write you whole name and may i say from you friend ' then she hurry on she bonnet and walk to the station with I and she round face with the blond hair and the light-blue eye seem to I to become beautiful as she talk in edinburgh i ask for a photograph of mary somerville and the young man behind the counter reply ' i do not know who it be ' in london i ask at a bookstore which the murray recommend for a photograph of mr somerville and of sir george airy and the man say if they could be have in london he would get they and then he ask ` be they english ' and i inform he that sir george airy be the astronomer royal \* \* \* \* \* ` the glasgow college for girl ' see a sign of this sort i ring the door-bell of the house to which it be attach enter and be tell the lady be at home as i wait for she i take up the ` prospectus ' and it be enough -- ` music dancing draw needlework and english ' be the prominent feature and the pupil be child all well enough -- but why call it a college when the lady superintendent come in i tell she that i have suppose it be for more advanced student and she say ` oh it be for girl up to twenty one suppose a girl be finish by twenty ' i ask as modestly as i could ` have you any pupil in latin and mathematics ' and she say ` no it be for girl you know dr m hope we shall have some mathematics next year ' ` and ' i ask ` some latin ' ` yes dr m hope we shall have some latin but i confess i believe latin and mathematics all bosh give they modern language and accomplishment i suppose you school be for professional woman ' i tell she no that the daughter of we wealthiest people demand learn that it would scarcely be consider ` good society ' when the woman have neither latin nor mathematics ` oh well ' she say ` they get marry here so soon ' when i ask she if they have lady teacher she say ` oh no -lrb- as if that would ruin the institution -rrb- nothing but first-class master ' it be clear that the woman teach the needlework chapter xi papers -- science -lrb- 1874 -rrb- -- the denver eclipse -lrb- 1878 -rrb- -- color of star the dissemination of information in regard to science and to scientific investigation relieve the scientist from the small annoyance of extreme ignorance no one to-day will expect to receive a letter such as reach sir john herschel some year ago ask for the writer 's horoscope to be cast or such as he receive at another time which ask shall i marry and have i see _ she _ nor can it be long if the whole population be somewhat educate that i shall be likely to receive as i have do application for information as to the recovery of steal goods or to tell fortune when cross the atlantic a irish woman come to I and ask I if i tell fortune and when i reply in the negative she ask I if i be not a astronomer i admit that i make effort in that direction she then ask I what i could tell if not fortune i tell she that i could tell when the moon would rise when the sun would rise etc she say ` oh ' in a tone which plainly say ` be _ that _ all ' only a few winter since during a very mild winter a young lad who be drive a team call out to I on the street and say he have a question to ask I i stop and he ask ` shall we lose we ice-crop this winter ' it be January and it be new england it take very little learning and no alchemy to foretell that the month of February and the neighborhood of boston would give ice enough and i tell he that the ice-crop would be abundant but i be honest enough to explain to he that my outlook into the future be no better than he one of the unfavorable result of the attempt to popularize science be this : the reader of popular scientific book be very likely to think that he understand the science itself when he merely understand what some writer say about science take for example the method of determine the distance of the moon from the earth -- one of the easiest problem in physical astronomy the method can be tell in a few sentence yet it take a hundred year to determine it with any degree of accuracy -- and a hundred year not of the average work of mankind in science but a hundred year during which able mind be bent to the problem still with all the school-master and all the teaching and all the book the ignorance of the unscientific world be enormous they be ignorant both way -- they underrate the scientific people and they overrate they there be on the one hand the irish woman who be disappointed because you can not tell fortune and on the other hand the cultivate woman who suppose that you must know _ all _ science i have a friend who wonder that i do not take my astronomical clock to piece she suppose that because i be a astronomer i must be able to be a clock-maker while i do not handle a tool if i can help it she do not expect to take she piano to piece because she be musical she be as careful not to tinker it as i be not to tinker the clock which only a expert in clock-making be prepare to handle only a few week since i receive a letter from a lady who wish to come to make I a visit and to ` scan the heaven ' as she term it now just as she write the clock which i be careful not to meddle with have be rapidly gain time and i be stand before it watch it from hour to hour and slightly change its rate by drop small weight upon its pendulum time be so important a element with the astronomer that all else be subordinate to it then too the uneducated assume the unvarying exactness of mathematical result while in reality mathematical result be often only approximation we say the sun be 91000000 mile from the earth plus or minus a probable error that be we be right probably within say 100000 mile or the sun be 91000000 minus 100000 mile or it be 91000000 plus 100000 mile off and this probable error be only a probability if we make one more observation it can not agree with any one of we determination and it change we probable error -lrb- illustration : bust of marium mitchell _ from original make by miss emma f brigham in 1877 _ -rrb- this ignorance of the mass lead to a misconception in two way the little that a scientist can do they do not understand -- they suppose he to be godlike in he capacity and they do not see result they overrate he and they underrate he -- they underrate he work there be no observatory in this land nor in any land probably of which the question be not ask ` be they do anything why do not we hear from they they should make discovery they should publish ' the one observation make at greenwich on the planet neptune be not publish until after a century or more -- it be record as a star the observation have to wait a hundred year about before the time have come when that evening 's work should bear fruit but it be good faithful work and its time come kepler be year in pass from one of he law to another while the school-boy to-day rattle off the three as if they be bear of one breath the scientist should be free to pursue he investigation he can not be a scientist and a school-master if he pursue he science in all he interval from he class-work he class suffer on account of he engrossment if he devote himself to he student science suffer and yet we all go on year after year try to work the two field together and they need different culture and different implement 1878 in the eclipse of this year the dark shadow fall first on the united state thirty-eight degree west of washington and move towards the south-east a circle of darkness one hundred and sixteen mile in diameter circle overlap circle of darkness until it could be map down like a belt the mapping of the dark shadow with its limitation of one hundred and sixteen mile lay across the country from montana through colorado northern and eastern texa and enter the gulf of mexico between galveston and new orlean this be the region of total eclipse look along this dark strip on the map each astronomer select he bit of darkness on which to locate the light of science but for the distance from the large city of the country colorado seem to be a most favorable part of the shadow it be little subject to storm and repute to be enjoyable in climate and abundant in hospitality my party choose denver col i have a friend who live in denver and she be visit I i seek she at once and with fear and tremble ask ` have you a bit of land behind you house in denver where i could put up a small telescope ' ` six hundred mile ' be the laconic reply i feel that the hospitality of the rocky mountain be at my foot space and time be so unconnected for a observation which would last two minute forty seconds i be offer six hundred mile after a journey of thousand a journey from boston to denver make one hopeful for the future of we country we have hour after hour and day after day of railroad travel over level unbroken land on which cattle feed unprotected summer and winter and which seem to implore the traveller to stay and to accept its richness it must be century before the now unpeopled land of western kansa and colorado can be crowd we start from boston a party of two at cincinnatus a third join we at kansas city we come upon a fourth who be ready to fall into we rank and at denver two more await we so we be a party of six -- ` all good woman and true ' all along the road it have be evident that the country be rouse to a knowledge of the come eclipse we overhear remark about it small telescope travel with we and we landlord at kansas city when i ask he to take care of a chronometer say he have take care of fifty of they in the previous fortnight we party have three telescope and one chronometer we have travel so comfortably all along the santa fé road from kansas city to pueblo that we have forget the possibility of other railroad annoyance than those of heat and dust until we reach pueblo at pueblo all seem to change we leave the santa fé road and enter upon that of the rio grande which road be to blame it be not for I to say but there be trouble at once about we ` round-trip ticket ' that settle we suppose all be right in send out telescope so far as from boston to denver i have carefully take out the glass and pack they in my trunk i carry the chronometer in my hand it be only five hour ' travel from pueblo to denver and we go on to that city the trunk for some unexplained reason or for no reason at all choose to remain at pueblo one telescope-tube reach denver when we do but a telescope-tube be of no value without glass we learn that there be a war between the two railroad which unite at pueblo and war no matter where or when it occur mean ignorance and stupidity the unit of measure of value which the railroad man believe in be entirely different from that in which the scientist rest he faith a war between two railroad seem very small compare with two minute forty seconds of observation of a total eclipse one be terrestrial the other cosmic it be Wednesday when we reach denver the eclipse be to occur the follow Monday we haunt the telegraph-room and send implore message we place ourselves at the station and watch the train as they toss out they freight we listen to every express-wagon which pass we door without stop and just as we be try to find if a telescope could be hire or buy in denver the glass arrive it be now Friday we must put up tent and telescope and test the glass it rain hard on Friday -- nothing could be do it rain harder on Saturday it rain hardest of all on Sunday and hail mingle with the rain but Monday morning be clear and bright it be strange enough to find that we might camp anywhere around denver we hostess suggest to we to place ourselves on ` mccullough 's addition ' in new york or boston if i be about to camp on private grounds i should certainly ask permission in the far west you choose you spot of ground you dig post-hole and you pitch tent and you set up telescope and inhabit the land and then the owner of the land come to you and ask if he may not put up a fence for you to keep off intruder and the nearest resident come to you and offer aid of any kind we camping-place be near the house occupy by sister of charity and the black-robed sweet-faced woman come out to offer we the refreshing cup of tea and the new-made bread all that we need be ` space ' and of that there be plenty we tent be up and the telescope mount we have time to look around at the view the space have the unlimitedness that we usually connect with sea and sky we tent be on the slope of a hill at the foot of which we be about six thousand foot above the sea the plain be three time as high as the hill of the hudson-river region and there arise on the south almost from west to east the peak upon peak of the rocky mountain one need to live upon such a plateau for week to take in the grandeur of the panorama it be always difficult to teach the man of the people that natural phenomenon belong as much to he as to scientific people camp party who put up telescope be always suppose to be corporation with particular privilege and curious lookers-on gather around and try to enter what they consider a charmed circle we be remarkably free from specialist of this kind camping on the south-west slope of the hill we be hide on the north and east and another party which choose the brow of the hill be much more attractive to the crowd we good serving-man be tell to send away the few stroller who approach even we friend from the city be ask to remove beyond the reach of voice there be always some one to be find in every gathering who will not submit to law at the time of the total eclipse in iowa in 1869 there pass in and out among we telescope and observer a unknown closely veil woman the remembrance of that occasion never come to my mind without the accompaniment of a flutter green veil this time it be a man how he come among we and why he remain no one can say each one suppose that the other know and that there be good reason for he presence if i be under the tent wipe glass he stand beside I if the photographer wish to make a picture of the party this man come to the front and when i ask the servant to send off the half-vagrant boy and girl who stand gaze at we this man come up and say to I in a confidential tone ` they do not understand the sacredness of the occasion and the fineness of the condition ' there be something regal in he audacity but he be none the less a tramp person who observe a eclipse of the sun always try to do the impossible they seem to consider it a solemn duty to see the first contact of sun and moon the moon when see in the daytime look like a small faint cloud as it approach the sun it become wholly unseen and a observer try to see when this unseen object touch the glowing disc of the sun when we look at any other object than the sun we stimulate we vision a good observer will remain in the dark for a short time before he make a delicate observation on a faint star and will then throw a cap over he head to keep out strong light when we look at the sun we at once try to deaden its light we protect we eye by dark glass -- the less of sunlight we can get the better we calculate exactly at what point the moon will touch the sun and we watch that point only the exact second by the chronometer when the figure of the moon touch that of the sun be always note it be not only valuable for the determination of longitude but it be a check on we knowledge of the moon 's motion therefore we try for the impossible one of we party a young lady from californium be place at the chronometer she be to count aloud the seconds to which the three other be to listen two other one a young woman from missourus who bring with she a fine telescope and another from ohio besides myself stand at the three telescope a fourth from illinoi be station to watch general effect and one special artist pencil in hand to sketch view absolute silence be impose upon the whole party a few minute before each phenomenon of course we begin full a minute too soon and the constrain position be irksome enough for even time be relative and the minute of suspense be longer than the hour of satisfaction -lrb- footnote : as the computed time for the first contact draw near the breath of the counter grow short and the seconds be almost gasp and threaten to become inaudible when miss mitchell without move she eye from the tube of the telescope take up the counting and continue until the young lady recover herself which she do immediately -rrb- the moon so white in the sky become densely black when it be closely range with the sun and it show itself as a black notch on the burning disc when the eclipse begin each observer make she record in silence and then we turn and face one another with record in hand -- we differ more than a second it be a large difference between first contact and totality there be more than a hour and we have little to do but look at the beautiful scenery and watch the slow motion of a few cloud on a height which be cloud-land to dweller by the sea we photographer beg we to keep we position while he make a picture of we the only value to the picture be the record that it preserve of the parallelism of the three telescope you would say it be stiff and unnatural do you not know that it be the order of nature herself -- they all point to the center of the solar system as totality approach all again take they position the corona which be the ` glory ' see around the sun be visible at least thirteen minute before totality each of the party take a look at this and then all be silent only the count on and on of the young woman at the chronometer when totality come even that cease how still it be as the last ray of sunlight disappear the corona burst out all around the sun so intensely bright near the sun that the eye could scarcely bear it extend less dazzlingly bright around the sun for the space of about half the sun 's diameter and in some direction send off streamer for million of mile it be now quick work each observer at the telescope give a furtive glance at the un-sunlike sun move the dark eye-piece from the instrument replace it by a more powerful white glass and prepare to see all that could be see in two minute forty seconds they must note the shape of the corona its color its seeming substance and they must look all around the sun for the ` interior planet ' there be certainly not the beauty of the eclipse of 1869 then immense radiation shoot out in all direction and throw themselves over half the sky in 1869 the rosy prominence be so many so brilliant so fantastic so weirdly change that the eye must follow they now scarcely a protuberance of color only a roseate light around the sun as the totality end but if streamer and prominence be absent the corona itself be a great glory we special artist who make the sketch for my party could not bear the light when the two minute forty seconds be over each observer leave she instrument turn in silence from the sun and write down brief note happily some one break through all rule of order and shout out ` the shadow the shadow ' and look toward the southeast we see the black band of shadow move from we a hundred and sixty mile over the plain and toward the indian territory it be not the flitting of the closer shadow over the hill and dale : it be a picture which the sun throw at we foot of the dignified march of the moon in its orbit and now we look around what a strange orange light there be in the north-east what a spectral hue to the whole landscape be it really the same old earth and not another planet great be the self-denial of those who follow science they who look through telescope at the time of a total eclipse be martyr they severely deny themselves the person who can say that they have see a total eclipse of the sun be those who rely upon they eye my aid who touch no glass have a season of rare enjoyment they see mercury with its gleam of white light and mar with its ruddy glow they see regulus come out of the darkening blue on one side of the sun venus shimmer and procyon twinkle near the horizon and arcturus shine down from the zenith _ we _ see the giant shadow as it _ leave _ we and pass over the land of the untutored indian _ they _ see it as it approach from the distant west as it fall upon the peak of the mountain-top and in the impressive stillness move directly for we camping-ground the savage to whom it be the frowning of the great spirit be awe-struck and alarm the scholar to whom it be a token of the inviolability of law be serious and reverent there be a dialogue in some of the old school-reader and perhaps in some of the new between a tutor and he two pupil who have be out for a walk one pupil complain that the way be long the road be dusty and the scenery uninterest the other be full of delight at the beauty he have find in the same walk one have walk with he eye intellectually close the other have open he eye wide to all the charm of nature in some respects we be all at different time like each of these boy : we shut we eye to the enjoyment of nature or we open they but we be capable of improve ourselves even in the use of we eye -- we see most when we be most determine to see the _ will _ have a wonderful effect upon the perceptive faculty when we first look up at the myriad of star see in a moonless evening all be confusion to we we admire they brilliancy but we scarcely recognize they grouping we do not feel the need of know much about they a traveller lose on a desert plain feel that the recognition of one star the pole star be of itself a great acquisition and all person who like mariner and soldier be leave much with the companionship of the star only learn to know the prominent cluster even if they do not know the name give to they in book the daily want of the body do not require that we should say ` give I the way of wander star to know the depths of heaven above and earth below ' but we have a hunger of the mind which ask for knowledge of all around we and the more we gain the more be we desire the more we see the more be we capable of see besides learn to see there be another art to be learn -- _ not to see _ what be not if we read in to-day 's paper that a brilliant comet be see last night in new york we be very likely to see it to-night in boston for we take every long fleecy cloud for a splendid comet when the comet of 1680 be expect a few year ago to reappear some young man in cambridge tell professor bond that they have see it but professor bond do not see it continually be amateur in astronomy send note of new discovery to bond or some other astronomer which be no discovery at all astronomer have long suppose the existence of a planet inferior to mercury and m leverrier have by mathematical calculation demonstrate that such a planet exist he found he calculation upon the suppose discovery of m lesbarcault who declare that it cross the sun 's disc and that he see it and make drawing the internal evidence from the man 's account be that he be a honest enthusiast i have no doubt that he follow the path of a solar spot and as the sun turn on its axis he mistake the motion for that of the dark spot or perhaps the spot change and become extinct and another spot closely resemble it break out and he be deceive he wish all the time be ` father to the thought ' the eye be as teachable as the hand every one know the most prominent constellation -- the pleiade the great bear and orion many person can draw the figure make by the most brilliant star in these constellation and very many young people look for the ` lose pleiad ' but common observer know these star only as bright object they do not perceive that one star differ from another in glory much less do they perceive that they shine with differently color ray those who know sirius and betel do not at once perceive that one shine with a brilliant white light and the other burn with a glowing red as different in they brilliancy as the precious stone on a lapidary 's table perhaps for the same reason and so there be a endless variety of tint of paler color we may turn we gaze as we turn a kaleidoscope and the change be infinitely more startling the combination infinitely more beautiful no flower garden present such a variety and such delicacy of shades but beautiful as this variety be it be difficult to measure it it have a phantom-like intangibility -- we seem not to be able to bring it under the law of science we call the star garnet and sapphire but these be at best vague term we language have not term enough to signify the different delicate shades we factory have not the stuff whose hue might make a chromatic scale for they in this dilemma we might make a scale of color from the star themselves we might put at the head of the scale of crimson star the one know as hind 's which be four degree west of rigel we might make a scale of orange star begin with betel as orange red then we should have betelgeuze aldebaran ß ursa minori altair and _ a _ cani _ a _ lyrae the list gradually grow paler and paler until we come to a lyra which might be the leader of a host of pale yellow star gradually fading off into white most of the star see with the naked eye be variety of red orange and yellow the red when see with a glass reach to violet or dark purple with a glass there come out other color : very decide green very delicate blues brown gray and white if these color be almost intangible at best they be render more so by the variation of the atmosphere of the eye and of the glass but after these be all account for there be still a real difference two star of the class know as double star that be so little separated that considerable optical power be necessary to divide they show these different tint very nicely in the same field of the telescope then there come in the chance that the color be complementary that the eye fatigue by a brilliant red in the principal star give to the companion the color which would make up white light this happen sometimes but beyond this the reare innumerable case of finely contrast color which be not complementary but which show a real difference of light in the star result perhaps from distance -- for some color travel farther than other and all color differ in they order of march -- perhaps from chemical difference single blue or green star be never see they be always give as the smaller companion of a pair out of several hundred observe by mr bishop forty-five have small companion of a bluish or greenish or purplish color almost all of these be star of the eighth to tenth magnitude only once be both see blue and only in one case be the large one blue in almost every case the large star be yellow the color most prevailing be yellow but the variety of yellow be very great we may assume then that the blue star be faint one and probably distant one but as not all faint star or distant one be blue it show that there be a real difference in the star call 35 piscium the small star show a peculiar snuffy-brown tinge of two star in the constellation ursa minori not double star one be orange and the other be green both very vivid in color from age to age the color of some prominent star have certainly change this would seem more likely to be from change of place than of physical constitution nothing come out more clearly in astronomical observation than the immense activity of the universe ` all change no loss ` tis revolution all ' observation of this kind be peculiarly adapt to woman indeed all astronomical observe seem to be so fit the training of a girl fit she for delicate work the touch of she finger upon the delicate screw of a astronomical instrument might become wonderfully accurate in result a woman 's eye be train to nicety of color the eye that direct a needle in the delicate mesh of embroidery will equally well bisect a star with the spider web of the micrometer routine observation too dull as they be be less dull than the endless repetition of the same pattern in crochet-work professor chauvenet enumerate among ` accidental error in observe ' those arise from imperfection in the sens as ` the imperfection of the eye in measure small space of the ear in estimate small interval of time of the touch in the delicate handling of a instrument ' a girl 's eye be train from early childhood to be keen the first stitch of the sewing-work of a little child be about as good as those of the mature man the taking of small stitch involve minute and equable measurement of space be a part of every girl 's training she become skilled before she be aware of it in one of the nicest peculiarity of astronomical observation the ear of a child be less trained except in the case of a musical education but the touch be a delicate sense give in exquisite degree to a girl and she training come in to its aid she thread a needle almost as soon as she speak she touch thread as delicate as the spider-web of a micrometer then come in the girl 's habit of patient and quiet work peculiarly fit to routine observation the girl who can stitch from morning to night would find two or three hour in the observatory a relief chapter xii religious belief -- comment on sermon -- concord school -- whittier -- cooking school -- anecdote partly in consequence of she quaker training and partly from she own indifference towards creed and sect miss mitchell be entirely ignorant of the peculiar phrase and custom use by rigid sectarian so that she be apt to open she eye in astonishment at some of the remark and sectarian prejudice which she meet after she settlement at vassar college she be a good learner however and after a while know how to receive in silence that which she do not understand miss mitchell ask one good missionary what be you favorite position in prayer flat upon my back the answer come swift as lightning in 1854 she write in she diary : there be a god and he be good i say to myself i try to increase my trust in this my only article of creed miss mitchell never join any church but for year before she leave nantucket she attend the unitarian church and she sympathy as long as she live be with that denomination especially with the more liberally inclined portion there be always a few of the teacher and ' some of the student who sympathize with she in she view but she usually attend the college service on Sunday president taylor of vassar college in he remark at she funeral state that all she life professor mitchell have be seek the truth -- that she be not willing to accept any statement without study into the matter herself -- and he add i think she have find the truth she be seek miss mitchell never obtrude she view upon other nor do she oppose they view she bear in silence what she could not believe but always insist upon the right of private judgment miss w a teacher at vassar be fret at be oblige to attend chapel exercise twice a day when she need the time for rest and recreation and apply to miss mitchell for help in get away from it after some talk miss mitchell say : oh well do as _ i _ do -- sit back folding you arm and think of something pleasant Sunday dec 18 1866 we hear two sermon : the first in the afternoon by rev mr a baptist the second in the evening by rev mr b congregationalist rev mr a take a text from deuteronomy about ` mose ' rev mr b take a text from exodus about ` mose ' and i be tell that the sermon on the precede Sunday be about mose it seem to I strange that since we have the history of christ in the new testament people continue to preach about mose rev mr a be a man of about forty year of age he chant rather than read a hymn he chant a sermon he description of the journey of mose towards canaan have some interesting point but he manner be affect he cry or pretend to cry at the pathetic point i hope he really cry for a weakness be better than a affectation of weakness he say ` the unbeliever be already condemn ' it seem to I that if anything would make I a infidel it would be the threat lavish against unbelief mr b be a self-made man the son of a blacksmith he bring the anvil the hammer and bellows into the pulpit and he pound and blow for he be in earnest i feel the more respect for he because he be in earnest but when he snap he finger and say ' i do not care that for the religion of a man which do not begin with prayer ' i be provoke at he forgetfulness of the character of he audience 1867 i be more and more disgusted with the preach that i hear why can not a man act himself be himself and think for himself it seem to I that naturalness alone be power that a borrow word be weaker than we own weakness however small we may be if i reach a girl 's heart or head i know i must reach it through my own and not from bigger heart and head than mine march 1873 there be something so genuine and so sincere in george macdonald that he take those of we who be _ emotional _ completely -- not by storm so much as by gentle breeze what he say be not profound except as it reach the depths of the heart he give we such broad theological lesson in he sermon he say ` do not trouble yourself about what you _ believe _ but _ do _ the will of god ' he consciousness of the existence of god and of he immediate supervision be feel every minute by those who listen he stay several day at the college and the girl will never get over the good effect of those three day -- the cheerier view of life and death rev dr peabody preach for we yesterday and be lovely everyone be charm in spite of he old-fashioned way he voice be very bad but it be such a simple common-sense discourse mr vassar say if that be unitarianism it be just the right thing aug 29 1875 go to a baptist church and hear rev mr f ` christ the way the only way ' the sermon be wholly without logic and yet he say near its close that those who have follow he must be convince that this be true he say a traveller whom he meet on the car admit that we all desire heaven but believe that there be as many way to it as to boston mr f say that god have prepare but one way just as the government in those country of the old world whose city be upon almost inaccessible pinnacle have prepare one way of approach -lrb- it occur to I that if those government possess godlike power they would have make a great many way -rrb- mr f be very severe upon those who expect to be save by they own desert he say ` you tender a farthing when you owe a million ' i could not see what they owe at all at this point he might well have give some attention to ` good work ' and if he must mention ` debt ' he might well remind they that they sit in a unpaid-for church it be plain that he rely upon he anecdote for the hold upon he audience and the anecdote be attach to the main discourse by a very slender thread of connection i feel really sad to know that not a listener would lead a better life for that sermon -- no man or woman go out cheer or comfort or stimulate on the whole it be strange that people who go to church be no worse than they be sept 26 1880 a clergyman say in he sermon ' i do not say with the frenchman if there be no god it would be well to invent one but i say if there be no future state of reward and punishment it would be better to believe in one ' do he mean to say ` better to believe a lie ' march 27 1881 dr lyman abbott preach i be surprise to find how liberal congregational preaching have become for he say he hope and expect to see woman at the bar and in the pulpit although he believe they would always be exceptional case he preach mainly on the motherhood of god and he whole sermon be a tribute to womanhood i rejoice at the ideal womanhood of purity which he put before the girl i wish some one would preach purity to young man July 1 1883 i go to hear rev mr -- at the universalist church he enumerate some of the danger that threaten we : one be ` the doctrine of scientist ' and he name tyndale huxley and spencer i be most surprised at he fear of these man can the study of truth do harm do not every true scientist seek only to know the truth and in we deep ignorance of what be truth shall we dread the search for it i hold the simple student of nature in holy reverence and while there live sensualist despot and man who be wholly self-seeking i can not bear to have these sincere worker hold up in the least degree to reproach and let we have truth even if the truth be the awful denial of the good god we must face the light and not bury we head in the earth i be hopeful that scientific investigation push on and on will reveal new way in which god work and bring to we deeper revelation of the wholly unknown the physical and the spiritual seem to be at present separate by a impassable gulf but at any moment that gulf may be overleap -- possibly a new revelation may come April 1878 i call on professor henry at the smithsonian institute he must be in he eightieth year he have be ill and seem feeble but he be still the majestic old man unbent in figure and undimmed in eye i always remember when i see he the remark of dorothy dix ` he be the truest man that ever live ' we be leave alone for a little while and he introduce the subject of he nearness to death he say ` the national academy have raise $ 40000 the interest of which be for myself and family as long as any of we live -lrb- he have daughter only -rrb- and in view of my death it be a great comfort to I ' i venture to ask he if he fear death at all he say ` not in the least i have think of it a great deal and have come to feel it a friend i _ cherish _ the belief in immortality i have suffer much at time in regard to that matter ' scientifically consider only he think the probability be on the side of continued existence as we must believe that spirit exist independent of matter he go to a desk and pull out from a drawer a old copy of ` gregory 's astronomy ' and say ` that book change my whole life -- i read it when i be sixteen year old i have read previously work of the imagination only and at sixteen be ill in bed that book be near I i read it and determine to study science ' i ask he if a life of science be a good life and he say that he feel that it be so when i be travel with miss s who be near-sighted and keep she eye constantly half-shut it seem to I that every other young lady i meet have wide stare eye now after two year sit by a person who never reason it strike I that every other person whom i meet have be think hard and he logic stand out a prominent characteristic aug 27 1879 scientific association meet at saratoga professor peirce now over seventy year old be much the same as ever he go on in the car with we and be read mallock 's ` be life worth live ' and i ask ` be it ' to which professor peirce reply ` yes i think it be ' then i ask ` if there be no future state be life worth live ' he reply ` indeed it be not life be a cruel tragedy if there be no immortality ' i ask he if he conceive of the future life as one of embodiment and he say ` yes i believe with st paul that there be a spiritual body ' professor peirce 's paper be on the ` heat of the sun ' he consider the sun feed not by impact of meteor but by the compression of meteor i do not think it very sound he say some good thing : ` where the truth demand accept what the truth deny reject ' concord mass 1879 to establish a school of philosophy have be the dream of alcott 's life and there he sit as i enter the vestry of a church on one of the hottest day in August he look full as young as he do twenty year ago when he give we a ` conversation ' in lynn elizabeth peabody come into the room and walk up to the seat of the ruler she white hair stream over she shoulder in wild carelessness and she be as careless as ever about she whole attire but it be beautiful to see the attention show to she by mr alcott and mr sanborn emerson enter -- pale thin almost ethereal in countenance -- follow by he daughter who sit beside he and watch every word that he utter on the whole it be the same emerson -- he stumble at a quotation as he always do but he thought be such as only emerson could have think and the sentence have the emersonian pithiness he make he frequent sentence very emphatic it be impossible to see any thread of connection but it always be so -- the oracular sentence make the charm the subject be memory ' he say ` we remember the selfishness or the wrong act that we have commit for year it be as it should be -- memory be the police-officer of the universe ' ` architect say that the arch never rest and so the past never rest ' -lrb- be it never sleep -rrb- ` when i talk with my friend who be a genealogist i feel that i be talk with a ghost ' the little vestry fit perhaps for a hundred people be pack with two hundred -- all people of a intellectual cast of face -- and the attention be intense the thermometer be ninety in the shade i do not speak to mr emerson i feel that i must not give he a bit of extra fatigue July 12 1880 the school of philosophy have build a shanty for its meeting but it be a shanty to be proud of for it be exactly adapt to its need it be a long but not low building entirely without finish but water-tight a porch for entrance and a recess similar at the opposite end which make the place for the speaker there be a small table upon the platform on which be pond lily some shelf around and a few bust -- one of socrate i think i go in the evening to hear dr harri on ` philosophy ' the rain begin to come down soon after i enter and my philosophy be not sufficient to keep I from the knowledge that i have neither overshoe nor umbrella i remember too that it be but a narrow foot-path through the wet grass to the omnibus but i listen to dr harri and enjoy it he laud fichte as the most accurate philosopher follow kant -- he say not of the greatest _ breadth _ but the most acute after dr harri ' address mr alcott make a few remark that be excellent and say that when we have study philosophy for fifteen year as the lecturer have do we might know something but as it be he have pull we to piece and then put we together again the audience number sixty person may 1880 i have just finish miss peabody 's account of channing i have be more interested in miss peabody than in channing and have feel how valuable she must have be to he how many of channing 's sermon be instigate by she question miss peabody must have be very remarkable as a young woman to ask the question which she ask at twenty April 1881 the waste of flower on easter Sunday distressed I something be due to the flower themselves they be mass together like a bushel of corn and look like red and white sugar-plum as see in a confectioner 's window a pillow of flower be a monstrosity a calla lily in a vase be a beautiful creation so be a single rose but when the rose be crush by a pink on each side of it and daisy crush the pink and azalea surround the daisy there be no beauty and no fitness the cathedral have no flower aug 22 1882 we visit whittier we find he at lunch but he soon come into the parlor he be very chatty and seem glad to see we mrs l be with I and whittier be very ready to write in the album which she bring with she belong to she adopted son we drift upon theological subject and i ask mr whittier if he think that we fall from a state of innocence he reply that he think we be better than adam and eve and if they fall they ` fall up ' he faith seem to be unbounded in the goodness of god and he belief in moral accountability he say ' i be a good deal of a quaker in my conviction that a light come to I to dictate to I what be right ' we stay about a hour and we be afraid it would be too much for he but miss johnson he cousin who live with he assure we that it be good for he and he himself say that he be sorry to have we go one thing that he say i note : that he fancy be for farm-work but he be not strong enough he have as a young man some literary ambition but never think of attain the reputation which have come to he July 31 1883 i have have two or three rich day on Friday last i go to holderness nh to the asquam house i have be ask by mr t to join she party there be at this house mr whittier mr and mr cartland professor and mr johnson of yale mr william the chinese scholar he brother a episcopal clergyman and several other the house seem full of fine cultivate people we stay two day and a half and first of the scenery the road up to the house be a steep hill and at the foot of the hill it wind and turn around two lake the panorama be complete one hundred and eighty degree beyond the lake lie the mountain we do not see mt washington the house have a piazza nearly all around it we have a room on the first floor -- large and with two window open to the floor the program of the day 's work be delightfully monotonous for a hour or so after breakfast we sit in the lady ' parlor we sew and we tell anecdote whittier talk beautifully almost always on the future state and he confidence in it occasionally he touch upon person he seem to have love lydium marium child greatly when the cool of the morning be over we go out upon the piazza and later on we go under the tree where it be say whittier spend most of the time there be little of the old-time theology in he view he faith have be always very firm mr cartland ask I one day if i really feel there be any doubt of the immortality of the soul i tell he that on the whole i believe it more than i doubt it but i could not say that i feel no doubt whittier ask I if there be no immortality if i should be distressed by it and i tell he that i should be exceedingly distressed that it be the only thing that i crave he say that ` annihilation be better for the wicked than everlasting punishment ' and to that i assent he say that he think there might be person so depraved as not to be worth save i ask he if god make such nobody seem ready to reply besides myself there be another of the party to whom a die friend have promise to return if possible but have not come whittier believe that they do sometimes come he say that of all whom he have lose no one would be so welcome to he as lydium marium child we hold a little service in the parlor of the hotel and mr c read the fourteenth chapter of john rev mr w read a sermon from ` the pure in heart shall see god write by parkhurst of new york he think the child should be tell that in heaven he should have he hobby-horse after the service when we talk it over i object to tell the child this whittier do not object he say that luther tell he little boy that he should have a little dog with a golden tail in heaven aug 26 1886 i have be to see a exhibition of a cooking school i find sixteen girl in the basement of a school-house they have long table across which stretch a line of gas-stove and jet of gas some of the girl be use saucepan they set they upon the stove and then sit down where they could see a clock while the boiling process go on at one table a girl be cut out doughnut at another a girl be make a pudding -- a layer of bit of bread follow by a layer of fruit each girl have she rolling-pin and moulding-board or saucepan the chief peculiarity of these process be the cleanliness the rolling-pin be clean the knife be clean the apron be clean the hand be clean not a drop be spill not a crumb be drop if into the kitchen of the crowded mother there could come the utensil the commodity the clean towel the ample _ time _ there would come without the lesson a touch of the millennium i be always afraid of manual-labor school i be not afraid that these girl could not read for every american girl read and to read be much more important than to cook but i _ be _ afraid that not all can _ write _ -- some of they be not more than twelve year old and what of the boy must a common cook always be a girl and must a boy not cook unless on the top of the ladder with the pay of the president of harvard college i be jealous for the school i have hear a gentleman who stand high in science declare that the cooking school would eventually kill out every literary college in the land -- for woman but why not for man if the food for the body be more important than the food for the mind let we destroy the latter and accept the former but let we not continue to do what have be try for fifteen hundred year -- to keep one half of the world to the starvation of the mind in order to feed better the physical condition of the other half let we have cook but let we leave it a matter of choice as we leave the dressmaking and the shoe-making the millinery and the carpentry -- free to be choose there be cultivate and educate woman who enjoy cooking so there be cultivate man who enjoy kensington embroidery who object but take care that some rousing of the intellect come first -- that it may be a enlighten choice -- and do not so fill the day with bread and butter and stitch that no time be leave for the appreciation of whittier let at least the simple song of daily life and the influence of rhythm beautify the dreary round of the three meal a day miss mitchell have a stock of conundrum on hand and be a good guesser she tell she story at all time when they happen to come into she mind she would arrive at she sister 's house just from poughkeepsie on a vacation and after the threshold be cross and she have say good morning in a clear voice to be hear by all within she sight she would perhaps say well i have a capital story which i must tell before i take my bonnet off or i shall forget it and there go with she tell a action voice and manner which add greater point to the story but which can not be describe one of she associate at vassar in recall some of she anecdote write : professor mitchell be quite likely to stand and deliver herself of a bright little speech before take she seat at breakfast it be as though the short walk from the observatory have be a inspiration to think she be quick at repartee on one occasion charlotte cushman and she friend miss stebbin be visit miss mitchell at vassar miss mitchell take they out for a drive and point out the different object of interest as they drive along the bank of the hudson what be that fine building on the hill ask miss cushman -- that say miss mitchell be a boy ' school originally but it be now use as a hotel where they charge five dollar a day -- five dollar a day exclaim miss cushman jupiter ammon -- no say miss stebbin jupiter mammon -- not at all say miss mitchell jupiter _ gammon _ farewell marium say a old friend i hope the lord will be with thee good-by she reply i _ know _ he will be with you a characteristic trait in miss mitchell be she aversion to receive unsolicited advice in regard to she private affair a suggestion be a impertinence she would often say the follow anecdote show how she receive such counsel : a literary man of more than national reputation say to one of she admirer i for one can not endure you marium mitchell at she solicitation he explain why and he reason be as she have anticipate found on personal pique it seem he have go up from new york to poughkeepsie especially to call upon professor mitchell during the course of conversation with that patronize condescension which some self-important man extend to all woman indiscriminately he proceed to inform she that she manner of living be not in accordance with he idea of expediency now he say instead of go for each one of you meal all the way from you living-room in the observatory over to the dining-hall in the college building i should think it would be far more convenient and sensible for you to get you breakfast at least right in you own apartment in the morning you could make a cup of coffee and boil a egg with almost no trouble at which professor mitchell draw herself up with the air of a tragic queen say and be my time worth no more than to boil egg chapter xiii miss mitchell 's letter -- woman suffrage -- membership in various society -- publish article -- death -- conclusion miss mitchell be a voluminous letter writer and a excellent correspondent but she letter be not essay and not at all in the approved style of the complete letter writer if she have any particular thing to communicate she rush into the subject in the first line in write to she own family and intimate friend she rarely sign she full name sometimes she leave it out altogether but ordinarily mm be append abruptly when she have express all that she have to say she write as she talk with directness and promptness no one in watch she while she be write a letter ever see she pause to think what she should say next or how she should express the think when she come to that point the mm be instantly add she have no secretiveness and in look over she letter it have be almost impossible to find one which do not contain too much that be personal either about herself or other to make it proper especially as she herself would be very unwilling to make the affair of other public oct 22 1860 i have spend $ 100 on dress this year i have a very pretty new feel bonnet of the fashionable shape trim with velvet it cost only $ 7 which of course be pitifully cheap for broadway if thou think after $ 100 it would not be extravagant for I to have a waterproof cloak and a linsey-woolsey morning dress please to send I pattern of the latter material and a description of waterproof of various price they be so ugly and i be so ditto that i feel if a few dollar more or less would make I look better even in a storm i must not mind it my orthodoxy be settle beyond dispute i trust by the follow circumstance : the editor of a new york magazine have write to I to furnish a article for the christmas number on ` the star in the east ' i have venture in my note of declination to mention that if i investigate that subject i might decide that there be no star in the case and then what would become of I and _ where should i go _ since that he have not write so i may have hang myself 1879 April 25 i have ` do ' new york very much as we do it thirty year ago on Saturday i go to miss booth 's reception and it be like miss lynch 's only larger than miss lynch 's be when i be there miss booth and a friend live on fifty-ninth street and have live together for year miss booth be a nice-looking woman she say she have often be tell that she look like I she have gray hair and black eye but be fair and well-cut in feature i have a very nice time on Sunday i go to hear frothingham and he be at he very best the subject be ` aspiration of man ' and the sermon be rich in thought and in word frothingham 's discourse be more cheery than usual he talk about the wonderful idea of personal immortality and he say if it be a dream of the imagination let we worship the imagination he speak of mr child 's book on ` aspiration ' and i shall order it at once the only satire be such a sentence as this : on speaking of a piece of egyptian sculpture he say ` the gate of heaven open to the good not to the orthodox ' to-day Monday i have be to a public school -lrb- a primary -rrb- and to stewart 's mansion i ask the majordomo to take we through the room on the lower floor which he do i know of no palace which come up to it the palace always have a look as if at some point they need refurbish up i suppose that mr stewart use that dining-room but it do not look as if it be make to eat in i still like gérôme 's ` chariot race ' better than anything else of he the ` horse fair ' be too high up for I to enjoy it and a little too mixed up 1873 st petersburg be another planet and strange to say be a agreeable planet some of these european be far ahead of we in many thing i think we be in advance only in one universal democracy of freedom but then that be everything nov 17 1875 i think you be right to decide to make you home pleasant at any sacrifice which involve _ only _ silence and you be so all over a radical that it will not hurt you to be tone down a little and in a few year as the world move you family will have move one way and you the other a little and you will suddenly find yourself on the same plane it be much the way that have be between miss -- and myself to-day she be more of a woman 's rights woman than i be when i first know she while i begin to think that the girl would better dress at tea-time though i think on that subject we think alike at first so i 'll take another example i have learn to think that a _ young _ girl would better not walk to town alone even in the daytime when i come to vassar i should have allow a child to do it but i never know _ much _ of the world -- never shall -- nor will you and as we be both bear a little deficient in worldly caution and worldly policy let we receive from other those lesson -- _ do as well as we can _ and keep we _ heart _ unworldly if we manners take on something of those way oct 25 1875 i have scarcely get over the _ tire _ of the congress -lrb- footnote : the annual meeting of the association for the advancement of woman of which miss mitchell be president it be hold at syracuse ny in 1875 -rrb- yet although it be a week since i return i feel as if a great burden be lift from my soul you will see my ` speech ' in the ` woman 's journal ' but in the last sentence it should be ` eastward ' and not ' _ earth_ward ' it be a grand affair and baby come in arm school-boy stand close to the platform and school-girl come book in hand the hall be a beautiful opera-house and could hold at least one thousand seven hundred it be pack and jam and rough man stand in the aisle when i have to speak to announce a paper i stand _ very still _ until they become quiet once as i stand in that way a man at the extreme rear before i have speak a word shout out ` louder ' we all burst into a laugh then of course i have to make they quiet again i lift the little mallet but i do not strike it and they all become still i be surprise at the good breeding of such a crowd in the evening about half be make up of man i could not have believe that such a crowd would keep still when i ask they to they say i do well think of my develop as a president of a social science society in my old age miss mitchell take no prominent part in the woman suffrage movement but she believe in it firmly and its leader be some of she most highly value friend sept 7 1875 go to a picnic for woman suffrage at a beautiful grove at medfield mass it be a gathering of about seventy-five person -lrb- mostly from needham -rrb- whose president seem to be vigorous and good-spirited the main purpose of the meeting be to try to affect public sentiment to such a extent as to lead to the defeat of a man who when the subject of woman suffrage be before the legislature say that the woman have all they want now -- that they could get anything with ` they eye as bright as the button on a angel 's coat ' lucy stone mr blackwell rev mr bush miss eastman and william lloyd garrison speak garrison do not look a day older than when i first see he forty year ago he speak well -- they say with less fire than he use in he younger day garrison say what every one say -- that the struggle for woman be the old anti-slavery struggle over again that as he look around at the audience beneath the tree it seem to be the same scene that he have know before we have a very good bit of missionary work do at we table -lrb- at vassar -rrb- to-day a man whom we all despise begin to talk against voting by woman i feel almost incline to pay he something for he remark a group from the washington woman suffrage association stop here to-day i like susan b anthony very much she seem much worn but be all alive she be eighteen month younger than i but seem much more alert i suppose brickbat be livelier than logarithm miss mitchell be a member of several learn society she be the first woman elect to membership of the american academy of art and science whose headquarters be at boston in 1869 she be choose a member of the american philosophical society a society found by benjamin franklin in philadelphium the american association for

be president of the association and for many year serve as chairman of the committee on science in this latter capacity she reach through circular and letter woman study science in all part of the country and the report as show from year to year show a wonderful increase in the number of such woman she be a member also of the new england woman 's club of boston and after she annual visit at

college in 1870 she first degree of lld from hanover college in 1832 and she last lld from columbium college in 1887 miss mitchell have no ambition to appear in print and most of she publish article be in response to application from publisher a paper entitle mary somerville appear in the atlantic monthly for may 1860 there be several article in silliman 's journal -- mostly result of observation on jupiter and saturn -- a few popular science papers in hour at home and one on the herschel print in the century just after she death miss mitchell also read a few lecture to small society and to one or two girl ' school but she never allow such outside work to interfere with she duty at vassar college to which she devote herself heart and soul when the failure of she health become apparent to the member of she family it be with the utmost difficulty that miss mitchell could be prevail upon to resign she position she have fondly hope to remain at vassar until she should be seventy year old of which she lack about six month it be hope that complete rest might lead to several year more of happy life for she but it be not to be so -- she die in lynn June 28 1889 it be one of miss mitchell 's boast that she have earn a salary for over fifty year without any intermission she also boast that in July 1883 when she slip and fall sprain herself so that she be oblige to remain in the house a

among the chief inspiration of vassar college throughout its history of public reputation you have doubtless have enough but i be sure you can not have too much of the affection and esteem which we feel toward you who have have the privilege of work with you jan 10 1888 you will consent you _ must _ consent to have you home here and let the work go it be not astronomy that be wanted and need it be marium mitchell the richest part of my life here be connect with you i can not picture vassar without you there be nothing to point to may 5 1889 in all the great wonder of life you have give I more of what i have want than any other creature ever give I i hope i should amount to something for you sake dr eliza m mosher at one time resident physician at the college say of she : she be quick to withdraw objection when she be convince of error in she judgment i well remember she opposition to the ground i take in my ` maiden speech ' in faculty meeting and how at supper she stand before sit down to say ` you be right this afternoon i have think the matter over and while i do not like to believe it i think it be true ' of she room at the observatory miss grace anna lewi who have be a guest write thus : she furniture be plain and simple and there be a frank simplicity corresponding therewith which make I believe she choose to have it so it look natural for she i think i should have be disappoint have i find she room fit up with undue elegance professor mitchell 's position at vassar give astronomy a prominence there that it have never have in any other college for woman and in but few for man i suppose it would have make no difference what she have teach doubtless she never suspect how many student endure the mathematical work of junior astronomy in order to be within range of she magnetic personality -lrb- from wide awake September 1889 -rrb- a graduate write : she personality be so strong that it be feel all over the college even by those who be not in she department and who only admire she from a distance extract from a letter write after she death by a former pupil : i count marium mitchell 's service to vassar and she pupil infinitely valuable and she character and attainment great beyond anything that have yet be tell i be one of the pupil upon whom she freedom from all the sham and self-deception make a impression that elevated my whole standard mental and moral the influence of she own personal character sustain its supreme test in the evidence constantly accumulate that it strengthen rather than weaken with the lapse of time she influence upon she pupil who be she daily companion have be permanent character-moulding and unceasingly progressive president taylor in he address at she funeral say : if i be to select for comment the one most striking trait of she character i should name she _ genuineness _ there be no false note in marium mitchell 's thinking or utterance one who have know she kindness to little child who have watch she little evidence of thoughtful care for she associate and friend who have see she put aside she own long-cherished rights that she might make the way of a new and untried officer easier can not forget the tenderer side of she character but if would be vain for I to try to tell just what it be in miss mitchell that attract we who love she it be this combination of great strength and independence of deep affection and tenderness breathe through and through with the sentiment of a perfectly genuine life which have make for we one of the pilgrim-shrine of life the study in the observatory of vassar

known he discovery to mr schumacher at altona if a resident in great britain or any other quarter of the globe except the continent of europe he be to make he discovery know directly to mr francis baily london -lrb- since mr baily 's decease gb airy esq astronomer royal have be substitute in this and in the 7th and 8th article of the regulation -rrb- 3 this communication must be make by the _ first post _ after the discovery if there be no regular mail at the place of discovery the first opportunity of any other kind must be make use of without wait for other observation exact compliance with this condition be indispensable if this condition be not comply with and only one person discover the comet no medal will be give for the discovery otherwise the medal will be assign to the discoverer who earliest comply with the condition 4 the communication must not only state as exactly as possible the time of the discovery in order to settle the question between rival claim but also as near as may be the place of the comet and the direction in which it be move as far as these point can be determine from the observation of one night 5 if the observation of one night be not sufficient to settle these point the enunciation of the discovery must still be make in compliance with the third article as soon as a second observation be make it must be communicate in like manner with the first and with it the longitude of the place where the discovery be make unless it take place at some known observatory the expectation of obtain a second observation will never be receive as a satisfactory reason for postpone the communication of the first 6 the medal will be assign twelve month after the discovery of the comet and no claim will be admit after that period 7 messr baily and schumacher be to decide if a discovery have be make if they differ mr gauss of göttingen be to decide 8 messr baily and schumacher have agree to communicate mutually to each other every announcement of a discovery altona April 1840 on the 1st of October 1847 at half-past ten o'clock pm a telescopic comet be discover by miss marium mitchell of nantucket nearly vertical above polari about five degree the further progress and history of the discovery will sufficiently appear from the follow correspondence on the 3d of October the same comet be see at half-past seven pm at rome by father de vico and information of the fact be immediately communicate by he to professor schumacher at altona on the 7th of October at twenty minute past nine pm it be observe by mr wr dawe at camden lodge cranbrook kent in england and on the 11th it be see by madame rümker the wife of the director of the observatory at hamburg mr schumacher in announce this last discovery observe : -lrb- footnote : astronomische nachrichten no 616 -rrb- madame rümker have for several year be on the lookout for comet and she persevere industry seem at last about to be reward when a letter be receive from father de vico address to the editor of this journal from which it appear that the same comet have be observe by he on the 3d instant at rome not deem it probable that he daughter have anticipate the observer of this country and europe in the discovery of this comet no step be take by mr mitchell with a view to obtain the king of denmark 's medal prompt information however of the discovery be transmit by mr mitchell to he friend william c bond esq director of the observatory at cambridge the observation of the messr bond upon the comet commence on the 7th of October and on the 30th be transmit by I to mr schumacher for publication in the astronomische nachrichten it be state in the memorandum of the messr bond that the comet be see by miss mitchell on the 1st instant this notice appear in the nachrichten of dec 9 1847 and the priority of miss mitchell 's discovery be immediately admit throughout europe my attention have be draw to the subject of the king of denmark 's comet medal by some allusion to it in my correspondence with professor schumacher in reference to the discovery of telescopic comet by mr george p bond of the observatory at cambridge have learn some week after miss mitchell 's discovery that no communication have be make on she behalf to the trustee of the medal and aware that the regulation in this respect be enforce with strictness i be apprehensive that it might be too late to supply the omission still however as the spirit of the regulation have be comply with by mr mitchell 's letter to mr bond of the 3d of October it seem worth while at least to make the attempt to procure the medal for he daughter although the attempt might be unsuccessful it would at any rate cause the priority of she discovery to be more authentically establish than it might otherwise have be i accordingly write to mr mitchell for information on the subject and apply for and obtain from mr bond mr mitchell 's original letter to he of the 3d of October with the nantucket postmark these papers be transmit to professor schumacher with a letter date 15th and 24th January on the 8th of February i write a letter to my much esteemed friend captain wh smyth rn formerly president of the astronomical society at london request he to interest himself with professor schumacher to obtain the medal for miss mitchell captain smyth enter with great readiness into the matter and address a note on the subject to mr airy the astronomer royal at greenwich mr airy kindly write to professor schumacher without loss of time but it be they unite opinion that a compliance with the condition relative to immediate notice of a discovery be indispensable and that it be consequently out of they power to award the medal to miss mitchell mr schumacher suggest as the only means by which this difficulty could be overcome a application to the danish government through the american legation at copenhagen conceive that the correspondence could be carry on more promptly through the danish legation at washington i address a letter on the 20th of April to mr steene-billé chargé d'affaire of the king of denmark in this country and send with it copy of the document which have be forward to professor schumacher mr steene-billé however be of opinion that the application if make at all should be make through the american legation at copenhagen but he express at the same time a confident opinion that owe to the condition and political relation of denmark the application would necessarily prove unavailing it be at this time that the difficulty in schleswig-holstein be at they height and it seem hopeless at such a moment and in face of the opinion of the official representative of the danish government in this country to engage its attention to a affair of this kind no further attempt be accordingly make by I for some week to pursue the matter in fact a report reach the united state that the medal have actually be award to father de vico although this be believe by I to be a unfounded rumor the regulation allow one year for the presentation of claim there be reason to apprehend that it proceed from some quarter well inform as to what would probably take place at the expiration of the twelvemonth on the 5th of August father de vico who have leave rome in the spring in consequence of the trouble there make a visit to cambridge in company with the right rev bishop fitzpatrick of boston and on this occasion inform I that he have receive a intimation from professor schumacher that the comet-medal would be award to miss mitchell i be dispose to think that father de vico labor under some misapprehension as to the purport of professor schumacher 's communication as afterwards appear to be the case i feel encouraged however by he statement not only to renew my correspondence on the subject with professor schumacher but i determine on the 8th of August to address a letter to rp fleniken esq chargé d'affaire of the united state at copenhagen this letter be accompany with copy of the original papers mr fleniken enter with great zeal and interest into the subject he lose no time in bring it before the danish government by means of a letter to the count de knuth the minister at that time for foreign affair and of another to the king of denmark himself he majesty with the most obliging promptness order a reference of the case to professor schumacher with direction to report thereon without delay mr schumacher have be for a long time in possession of the document establish miss mitchell 's priority which be indeed admit throughout scientific europe professor schumacher immediately make he report in favor of grant the medal to miss mitchell and this report be accept by the king the result be forthwith communicate by the count de knuth to mr fleniken with the gratifying intelligence that the king have order the medal to be award to miss mitchell and that it would be deliver to he for transmission as soon as it could be strike off this have since be do it must be regard as a striking proof of a enlighten interest for the promotion of science not less than of a kind regard for the rights and feeling of the individual most concern in this decision that the king of denmark should have bestow he attention upon this subject at a period of so much difficulty and alarm for europe in general and he own kingdom in particular it would not have be possible to act more promptly in a season of the profoundest tranquillity he majesty have on this occasion show that he be animated by the same generous zeal for the encouragement of astronomical research which lead he predecessor to find the medal while he have perform a act of gracious courtesy toward a stranger in a distant land which must ever be warmly appreciate by she friend and countryman nor ought the oblige agency of the count de knuth the minister of foreign affair to be pass without notice the slightest indifference on he part even the usual delay of office would have prevent the application from reach the king before the expiration of the twelvemonth within which all claim must by the regulation be present no one can reflect upon the pressure of business which must have exist in the foreign office at copenhagen during the past year without feeling that the count de knuth must largely share he sovereign 's zeal for science as well as he love of justice nothing else will account for the attention bestow at such a political crisis on a affair of this kind the same attention appear to have be give to the subject by he successor count moltka it be quite fortunate for the success of the application that the office of chargé d'affaire of the united state at copenhagen happen to be fill by a gentleman dispose to give it he prompt and persevere support a matter of this kind of course lay without the province of he official duty but no subject officially commit to he by the instruction of he government could have be more zealously pursue on the very day on which my communication of the 8th of August reach he mr fleniken address he letter to the minister of foreign affair and to the king and he continue to give he attention to the subject till the object be happily effect and the medal place in he hand the event itself however insignificant in the great world of politics and business be one of please interest to the friend of american science and it have be think proper that the follow record of it should be preserve in a permanent form i have regret the frequent recurrence of my own name in the correspondence and have suppress several letter of my own which could be spare without render less intelligible the communication of the other party to whom the interest and merit of the transaction belong edward everett cambridge 1st February 1849 correspondence hon william mitchell to william c bond esq cambridge nantucket 10 mo 3d 1847 my dear friend : i write now merely to say that marium

forward it to the danish minister at washington with a certified extract from you journal i will have a certified copy of all these papers prepare and send to mr schumacher and if any departure from
