mean to wed she about the middle of this year be this a working of the law of attraction i want to make we married life happy and peaceful i long for a wed life of pure blessedness and love and joy without even a pinhead of bitterness ever find lodgment in we household how can i attain this state of peace this be what i now do : i enter into the silence daily at a particular hour and enjoy the mental picture of how i desire to be when marry be i right please tell I how to make my ideal real tudor island of ceylon the above letter come from a member of the success circle who be a highly culture and interesting look native east indian we have a full length photo of he in native costume he ask if this be the working of the law of attraction certainly it be just as the sun act through a sheet of glass so the law of attraction act through the conventionality of a race whatever come together be draw together by the law whatever be hold together be hold by that same law of attraction this be just as true in unhappy marriage as in happy one if two people be distinctly enough individualize that be if they understand and command themselves sufficiently they attraction and marriage will bring to they only pleasure if they be not distinctly enough individualized there will be a monkey-and-parrot experience whilst they be work out the wisdom _ for which they be attract _ when soda and sour milk be draw together there be a great stew and fizz but the end thereof be sweetness and usefulness so with two adverse and uncontrolled nature but out of the stew come add wisdom self-command and round character for each when each have finish the work of help the other to develop they will either find themselves _ really _ in love with each other or they will fall apart _ some stronger attraction will separate they at the right time _ -- perhaps through divorce perhaps through death _ all _ we going and coming be due to the law of attraction the law of attraction giveth and it taketh away _ bless _ be the law _ let _ it work and forget not that _ all _ thing be due to its work this do not mean that the law have no way of work _ except _ through the conventionality of a people many time the attraction be to break away from the conventional _ the stronger attraction always win _ -- whatever be be _ best _ for _ that time and place _ tudor say he enter into the silence daily at a particular hour and enjoy the mental picture of how he desire to be when marry he success all depend upon the _ equity _ in that picture upon its truth to the law of be a impractical idealist live in the silence with beautiful picture of how he desire to be when marry when he get marry there be not a single detail of he daily experience which be like he mental picture he be sadly disappointed and perhaps embittered or discourage it all depend upon the picture if tudor 's picture contain a benignant lord and master and a sweet little alice ben bolt sort of wife who shall laugh with delight when he give she a smile and would not hurt he feeling for a farm who do he bidding before he bid and be always content with what he be pleased or able to do for she if this be the style of tudor 's mental picture he be certainly doom to disappointment i have a suspicion that tudor be a natural bear teacher he mental picture may represent himself as a dispenser of moral and mental blessing he may see ada sit adoringly at he foot ever eager to learn if so there will certainly be disappointment east indian girl may be more docile than american girl east indian man may be better and wiser lord and master but ada be a human be before she be a east indian and a human be instinctively revolt from a life pass in lead string if tudor continue to remind she that he be she schoolmaster she will certainly revolt inwardly if not outwardly whether the revolt come inwardly or outwardly harmony be doom the first principle of happy marriage be _ equality _ the second principle be _ mutual confidence _ which can never exist without the first i do not mean by equality what be usually mean one member of the married twain may be rich the other poor in worldly goods one a aristocrat the other plebeian one educate the other unschooled and yet they may be to each other what they be in _ truth _ equal equality be a _ mental state _ not a matter of birth or breed wisdom or ignorance the truth be that _ all _ man and woman be equal all be spark of the one life all child of the one highly aristocratic father all heir to the wisdom and wealth of the age which go to make up eternity but all man and woman be more or less unconscious in spot at least of this truth they spend they life look down upon each other man look down upon they wife as weak or inferior and woman look down upon they husband as animal or great brute man be contemptuous of they wife visionariness and woman despise they husband for cold and calculate tendency every man and woman value certain quality highly and in proportion as another fail to manifest these particular quality he be class as low and he society be not value this be the great source of trouble between husband and wife each value he or she own quality and despise the other 's so _ in they own mind _ they be not equal and the first principle of harmony be miss the real truth be that in marriage a man be schoolmaster to he wife _ and she be equally schoolmistress to he _ this be true in a less degree of _ all _ the relationship of life the law of attraction draw people together _ that they may learn _ there be but one life which be growth in wisdom and knowledge there be but one death _ which be refusal to learn _ if husband and wife be equal _ in they own mind _ they would not despise each other and _ refuse to learn _ of each other the law of attraction or love almost invariably attract opposite and for they own good a visionary idealistic woman be draw to a practical man where kick and fuss and despise each other as they will she be bind to become more practical and he more idealistic they exchange quality in spite of themselves each be a unconscious agent in round out the character and make more abundant the life of the other much of this blending of nature be accomplish through passion the least understand of force and the child of a union of opposite even where there be _ great _ contempt and unhappiness between the parent be almost invariably _ better balanced _ than _ either _ of the parent i can not believe that unhappy marriage be mistake or that they serve no good purpose the law of attraction draw together those who need each other at that particular stage of they growth the unhappiness be due to they own foolish _ refusal _ to learn and this refusal be due to they contempt for each other they be like naughty child at school who cry or sulk and refuse to work out they problem like those same naughty child they _ make themselves _ unhappy and fail to pass as soon as they might remember that contempt for each other be at the very bottom of all marital unhappiness the practical man despise he wife 's impulsive idealism and try to make she over the wife despise he cold and calculate tendency and try to make he over that mean war for it be impossible to make over _ anybody but yourself _ _ because _ the man despise he wife 's tendency and she despise he it never occur to either to try make over _ themselves _ thus help along the very thing they be draw together for if tudor 's picture hold two people who be _ always _ equal though utterly different whose future action be a unknown quantity to be take as they come and each action to be meet in a spirit of _ respect _ and inquiry with a view to understanding and learning from it if over and through all he picture tudor spread a glow of _ purpose _ to preserve _ he own _ respect and love _ for she _ at all cost -- if this be the sort of picture tudor make in the silence he will surely realize it later it require but one to strike the keynote of respect and personal freedom in marriage the other will soon come into harmony you can readily see that all marital jar come from this lack of equality in the individual mind if a man think he be perfectly able to take care of and to judge for himself he resent interference from another on the other hand if he believe he wife be equally able to judge for _ herself _ he _ never _ think of interfere with she action of course the same be true of the wife it be lack of respect and confidence which beget the making-over spirit in a family and from this one cause arise all in harmony individual freedom be the _ only _ basis for harmonious action not only in marriage but in all other relationship of life and individual freedom _ can not _ be grant by the man or woman who consider he or she judgment superior to the judgment of another a man _ must _ accord he wife _ equal _ wisdom and power with himself else he _ can not _ free she to act for herself a woman must accord she husband that same equality or she _ can not _ leave he free it be human -lrb- and divine -rrb- nature to correct what we believe to be wrong only in believe that the other king -lrb- or queen -rrb- can do no wrong lie the possibility of individual freedom in marriage or out the man or woman who know he or she be believe in and trust be very careful to _ deserve _ that trust do you know that the sure way to have you wish consult be to exalt and appreciate the other party do you know that a man or woman will cheerfully sacrifice he or she own opinion in order to retain the respect and love of the other but if he think the respect and love of the other party be grow less he will give free reign to he own desire marry people grow apart for the one reason that they find fault with each other of course it begin by they be disrespectful to each other 's fault but it soon develop into disrespect of each other from look down upon a husband 's fault it be only a few short step to look down upon _ he _ he fault keep grow by recognition and he good point keep shrivel for lack of notice until _ in you _ _ mind _ there be nothing left but fault from try to make he over you come to despair and give he up as a altogether bad job and there be not a grain of sense in all this madness stick to the truth and you will get rid of the madness and the friction too the truth be that you husband or you wife would be a egregious _ fool _ to follow you judgment you do not know bean from barley corn when it come to the action of anybody but yourself the one spirit which enlighten _ you _ as to _ you _ action be also enlighten you other half as to _ she _ action and do you suppose this spirit be go to favor _ you _ with better judgment about you other half 's duty than it have give _ she _ i guess _ not _ do not be presumptuous my boy do you own little best and _ trust _ you other half to do hers trust that she _ be _ do the best and above all trust the one spirit to run you both if you do this you wife will _ rise fast _ in you esteem and the higher she find herself in you esteem the harder she will try to please you -- and rise higher and girl do not forget that the shoe fit equally well the other foot either man or wife can bring harmony out of chaos simply by _ respect _ the other half _ and all he or she act _ a marriage without even a pinhead of bitterness be a marriage without a pin-point of fault-finding mental or oral chapter ii a tale of woe why be it that in more than two-third of family the wife and mother bear not only the child but the burden and heartache the husband supply the _ money _ -lrb- generally not enough -rrb- the wife have the care of a grow and increase family the best of everything be save for ` father ' and he be wait on etc if the child annoy he he go to he club if the wife die why there be plenty more woman for the ask thousand of woman be simply starve for love and man be either willfully blind or wholly and utterly selfish you possibly know that this be quite true another thing that have cause I many a time to question everything : during the christmas holiday many time i have see half-clad hungry shiver little one gaze longingly into the wonderful show window want probably just one toy while child no more worthy drive by in carriage have more than they want love home mother everything on the other hand hunger want blues -lrb- many time -rrb- and both god 's child let we hear what you have to say about this b b why do the mother in two-third of the family bear not only the child but the burden and heartache _ because she be too thoughtless and inert not to _ it be _ easier _ to submit to bear child than it be to rise up and take command of she own body it be easier to carry burden than to wake up and _ fire _ they it be easier to bear thing and grumble than it be to kick over the trace and _ change _ they to be sure most woman be yet under the hypnotic spell of the old race belief that it be woman 's duty to submit herself to any kind of a old husband but that be just what i say -- woman find it easier to go through life half asleep rather than to _ think _ for themselves paul say a woman be _ not _ to think she be to ask she husband to think for she -lrb- at least that be what the translator _ say _ paul say privately i have my suspicion that those manly translator help paul to say a bit more than he mean to -rrb- it be _ easier _ to let she husband think for she even when she do not like he thought so she use she brain in _ grumble _ instead of think people who do not think be rule by _ feeling _ woman feel they feel not only for themselves but for other people they shoulder the burden of the whole family and a few outside the family they do it themselves -- because it be _ easier _ to feel than to think nobody walk up to a woman and say here -- i have a burden that be very heavy -- _ you _ carry it whilst i go off and have a good time no the woman simply _ take _ the burden and hug it and feel it -- and _ pride herself on do it _ and maybe the thing _ she _ hug as a burden be no burden at all to the other people in the family my dear woman as a rule be chump they would rather feel _ anything _ than to _ think _ the right thing now i would like to know if you think a woman who have make herself round - shoulder and wrinkle and sour-visage over burden -- _ anybody 's _ burden real or fancied -- be such a creature as attract love or consideration from _ anybody _ of course she be not it be no wonder she receive no love or consideration from she husband or anybody else she have make a pack mule out of herself for the carrying of utterly useless burden that nobody _ want _ carry and the carrying of which benefit nobody and now that she have grow ugly and sour at the business she need not feel surprised at be slight and she need not blame folk for slight she _ she _ assume the burden _ she _ carry they _ she _ wear herself out at it it be all she own fault it be _ easier _ for she to feel and grumble than to wake up and think and change thing nobody who _ think _ will carry a single burden for even a single day he know that fret and worry and grumble only _ double the burden _ and accomplish nothing woman have _ build herself _ for bear child and burden when she get tired of she bargain she will _ think she way out of the whole thing _ in the meantime the harder the burden grow the more quickly she will revolt and make of herself something besides a burden bearer it be all nonsense to talk about the man be willfully blind or wholly and utterly selfish no man _ want _ a burden-bearing round - shoulder wrinkled and fagged-out wife no man respects or love a woman who will submit to bear unlimited burden or baby either and if a woman submit and yet keep up a continual grumbling and nagging about it a man simply despise she what every man _ hope _ for when he marry a woman be that she will be a bright trim _ reasonable comrade _ if she be even half-way that she will get all the love and consideration she can long for but in three - quarter of the case of marriage the woman degenerate into a whine bundle of _ thought-less _ feeling do up in a slattern 's dress and smell like a drug-shop she husband in despair give up try to understand she or to love she either the woman in such a case be apt to suffer most why not _ she make it the business of she life to suffer _ she _ pride _ herself on how much she have have to suffer and bear she cultivate she feeling to the limit a man think it unmanly to _ give way _ to feeling so he use all he wit to keep from do so and to enable he to hide he own disappointment and make the best of life as he find it a man use he best _ judgment _ when he meet disappointment a woman trot out she feeling and she best pocket-handkerchief and call in the neighbor so the woman get the lion 's share of sympathy -- which mean that all the other woman get out _ they _ best handkerchief and try to imagine just how _ they _ would feel if in she place of course there _ be _ exception i _ have _ hear of man who weep and retail they woe and i have hear of woman with gumption the woman who write the letter at the head of this chapter be a feel-er not a thinker she look at the forlorn bedraggled specimen of she own sex and _ feel _ with they never think that the woman themselves have anything to do with make they condition she feel with the woman because _ she _ be a woman be a unthinking creature she can not feel for the man at all woman be the weaker creature for no other reason than that she live in she feeling man be the stronger for no other reason than that he use he wit and he will to _ control _ he feeling b b have see child gaze into shop window immediately she imagine how _ she _ would feel if in they place she do not stop to think that in all probability the simple act of gaze into the window may bring more real joy to those child than the _ possession _ of the whole windowful of toy would bring to some rich man 's child she do not _ think _ that life consist not in possession or environment but in the _ ability to use _ possession or environment if she be a edwin abbey or a michael angelo she would gaze on we chromo-bedecked wall and work herself up into a great state of feeling because we have to have such miserable daub instead of real work of art if she see we gaze on a abbey or angelo picture she would weep tear to think we could not have such picture instead of those hideous bright chromo on we wall it would never occur to she that we might be privately compare she abbey and angelo with we chromo _ and wonder how anybody could possibly see beauty in the abbey and angelo _ about nine-tenth of woman 's so-called sympathy be just about as foolish and misplace as that if b b would go up and get acquaint with some of those small youngster she see gaze into the shop window she would find some of she illusion dispel she would find among they less longing than she think and more wonder and criticism and pure curiosity -- such as she would find in she own heart if she be gaze at a curio collection i remember a large family of very small boy that i use to feel for very deeply poor little pinched ragged look fellow they be and always work before and after school hour i give they nickel and dime and my child 's outgrow clothes and new fleece line glove for they blue little hand they keep the clothes hang up at home and the glove stuff in they pants pocket and one day i discover that every one of those small youngster have a _ bank account _ -- something i have never have in my life they live as they _ like _ to live and i have be harrowing my feeling and carry they -lrb- -rrb- burden for nothing this world be _ not _ a pitiful place it be a lovely great world full of all sort of people every one of whom _ exactly fit into _ he condition and the loveliest thing of all about this bright bless old world be that there be not a man woman or child in it who can not _ change _ he environment if he do not like the one he now occupy he can think he way into anything a real deep tender feeling will prompt one to do all he can to alleviate distress or add to the world 's joy _ real _ feeling prompt to action but this sentimental slush which slop over on anything and everything in general be nothing but a imitation of the real thing to sympathize to the extent of _ act _ be good to harrow up the feeling when you can not or will not act be simply weakness feeling be subject to the same law as water take away its bank and it spread all over creation and become a stagnant slough of despond confine it by bank of _ common-sense _ and _ will _ and it grow deep and tender and powerful and bear blessing on its bosom the professional pity-er be add to the sum total of the world 's misery the world be like sweet alice ben bolt it laugh with delight when you give it a smile and get out its pocket handkerchief to weep with you when you call it poor thing then it cut its call short and run around the corner to tell you neighbor what a tiresome old thing you be anyway never you mind the tribulation you can not help dearie just wake up and _ be _ the brightest happiest sweetest thing you know how to be and the world will-be that much better off chapter iii to be love i desire to attract love from the infinite or somewhere that i may not be starve for it as i have be ever since i marry my husband sneer at the new thought and in fact at nearly all that be best in I caroline and yet this woman have child to love she she think she be in need of be love but what she really need be _ to love _ be loved be the _ effect _ of love a loving man or woman can never want for love other turn to they in love as naturally as flower turn to the sun in order to be love you must _ radiate _ love instead of try to attract the love of other seek to _ give _ you love to other _ expect nothing in return _ after a time you will find the unexpected come to you spontaneously learn to love by loving _ all _ people and _ thing _ and especially all thing you find to do this same caroline want to rise above drudgery what _ be _ drudgery _ it be simply unloved work _ -- nothing more nor less _ any _ work which be look down upon and which be do with the hand _ whilst the heart and mind be criticize it _ and run out after other thing -- _ any _ work thus do be drudgery work do with the hand _ and a small and unwilling part _ of the mind be drudgery to she who _ respects _ and _ love _ and do with a will what she find to do there be no drudgery let the woman who long to be love begin to _ love _ by practice on she work to quit call it drudgery to put _ all _ she mind and will and _ soul _ into _ each _ piece of work as it come be the first and longest step toward love it it be a easily demonstrate fact that we learn to love anything we persist in do with a whole-souled will to love we work enlarge we capacity for loving people and the more we love people _ and the more people we love _ the more radiant we become it be the radiant lover whom all the world love do you know that love and the lack of love be govern by auto-suggestion it be _ natural _ to love as every child do but as we grow up we keep say to ourselves -lrb- this be auto-suggestion you know -rrb- that we do not like this and we do not like that until really we _ shut up _ we love and live in a continual state of do not like -- a state which in due time develop into _ hate _ -- hate for self as well as other do not like do it all now _ cultivate _ love by auto-suggestion keep say i _ like _ this and i like that _ hunt _ for thing to like and even tell yourself you like thing when you do not _ feel _ that you like they at all feeling be a _ result _ of suggestion nothing easier to prove than that a hypnotist can by suggestion make you feel almost anything whether it be true or not he will say you feel sad and straightway you will feel so then he will say you feel happy and you do you feeling be like a harp and you _ statement _ or auto-suggestion be the finger which pick the string take good care to play the tune you _ want _ -- to say you _ like _ thing or love they then you will quickly respond and _ feel _ that you like or love they keep _ practice _ until you love _ all _ the time then you will _ be _ loved to you heart 's content chapter iv the pharisee up-to-date as long as you continue to hug the delusion that you be not to blame for the unpleasant thing in you condition you might just as well profess the old thought as the new the very fundamental principle of mental science be the statement that _ man be a magnet and able to attract what he will _ to repudiate this statement be to knock the prop out from under the whole philosophy better stay a old-thoughter and let jesus suffer for you sin and those of you relative and friend at least jesus _ take _ the sin of the world to bear all of he own free will there be some comfort in let jesus do what he choose to do but you have turn away from jesus as a scapegoat you refuse to lay you burden on he who offer to bear they and you refuse to bear they yourself instead you distribute they around among you relation and friend and then fret you soul because they will not accept you distribution of course you excuse yourself by acknowledge you share of responsibility for the unpleasantness of condition but if you will examine carefully you will find that you portion of the responsibility include most of the _ good _ thing in you condition whilst you have portion off almost _ all _ the responsibility for the _ bad _ thing among you protest -- or indifferent -- relative you always say _ i _ try so hard but you never balance that with _ he _ try so hard -- _ they _ try so hard you get all the i-try-item in you own pile and the do not - try-item in other folk 's pile _ if _ it be not for tom and dick and harry and fan you would do wonder -- _ if _ they would only treat you with _ half _ the consideration other people give you or half _ they _ give other people -- _ if -- if _ i wonder why they do not indeed it be just because you be you _ and you attract you own particular kind of treatment _ to all intent and purpose tom dick harry and fan be a punch and judy show and _ you pull the string _ when other people pull the string there be a different sort of show you be the motive power in _ all they treatment of you _ not a tone or look or act of theirs in you direction but _ you _ be responsible for it be _ you _ and no other who draw they to you and it be you and no other who hold they there now do not say i do not see _ how _ of course not -- _ you have not want to see how _ -- you have be too intent justify yourself and anyway it take a open mind and some time and much _ faith _ to enable we to see the _ principle _ of thing we have to _ act _ as if they be so a long time before we see that they be if you have _ act _ upon the principle that you be a magnet and that _ all _ that come to you come by you attraction you would have long ago have you eye open to see how and you would have make progress and _ change you condition _ _ if you be ever go to be a magnet you be one now _ if you be ever go to be able to attract to the hair 's breadth whatsoever you will _ then you be do it now _ there will be no miraculous change in the run gear of this universe to enable you to attract what you want _ what you now be in essence and work principle you have always be and you will always be -- the same yesterday today and forever -- a self-made _ magnet _ work to the hair 's breadth _ only by change the quality of you magnetism can you change you environment and attract different treatment from tom dick harry and fan sweetness within bring sweetness without you have be more or less bitter and self-justifying within and tom dick harry and fan have dance to the string you pull as long as you think _ you _ try and they do not as long as you think _ you _ judgment superior to theirs _ you _ ideal loftier and worthier _ you _ way better you will get from they response of carelessness bitterness lack of consideration selfishness _ you _ be inconsiderate of _ they _ idea ideal judgment and way _ in self-preservation _ they be inconsiderate of yours if you have you way they would be pretty little putty image of _ you _ ideal judgment wish way and feeling the law of individuality prevent you impose yourself on they you think you be find fault with _ they _ lack of consideration _ you be really condemn the law of be _ if you be ever to be a magnet you be one now _ all _ that come _ be _ you fault if anything different come it will come through _ you _ change of mental attitude and action it will not do to throw it on karma either and say you be receive now the unpleasant thing deserve in a previous state of existence the mill of the god grind slowly but they be not so dead slow as all that what you think and do in a previous state have determine you parentage and childhood environment in this but the pang you suffer today have they root in yesterday or day before or the year before that cause and effect trip close upon each other 's heel -- so close that the careless or ignorant observer miss the trip he exaggerate the _ effect _ if it be a unhappy one and go nose for a bigger cause than the real one how could _ he _ little slip of this morning or yesterday be the cause of this _ terrible _ evil which have befall he -- and he slide completely over the real cause _ and keep on repeat it _ self-righteousness by blind you eye to the truth be the direct cause of the most gigantic and the most subtle misery of the world these awfully good people who fully realize how hard they have always try to do right be the unhappiest people in the world -- unless i except tom dick harry and fan the victim of these self-righteous reformer no i can not even except these for they at least generally succeed in have they own way in spite of the would-be reformer but what so utterly disheartening as continued _ lack of success _ and the self-righteous one never succeed it be hard _ hard _ to be so wise and willing with such _ high _ ideal -lrb- the self-righteous one in '' strong on ideal -rrb- and _ never _ to succeed in make tom dick and harry conform to they do you see why jesus say so often woe come to the pharisee -- the self-righteous and why he call they hypocrite of course they be unconscious of they hypocrisy -- self-righteousness blind they to the truth they think _ other _ be to blame for most of the self-righteous one 's own hard condition the self-righteous one be doom to a tread-mill of petty failure he go round and round he own little personal point of view and learn nothing it be by get at the _ other fellow 's _ point of view that we learn thing -- about he and ourselves too when the self-righteous one wake up to the _ fact _ that the world be _ full _ of people whose point of view be _ just exactly _ as right and wise and ideal as he own and begin to _ feel with _ and pull with these other people instead of against they when he do this he will find himself out of the treadmill to _ stay _ as he show a disposition to consider _ other _ people 's ideal and help other in the line _ they _ want to go he will find the whole world eager to help _ he _ in the way _ he _ want to go the self-righteous one work alone and meet defeat the one who recognize he own righteousness _ in intent _ yet forget not that _ other be even as he _ be the true friend and _ be _ - friend of all the world now do not let this homily slip off _ you _ shoulder we be _ all _ self-righteous in spot and none of we be so _ very _ wise that he can not by self-examination and readjustment learn a lot more each soul _ in its place _ be wisest and best do not _ you _ try to get into the pilot house and steer thing for tom dick or harry stay in you own and steer clear of the rock of anger malice revenge _ resentment re-sistance _ interference and _ immoderation _ chapter v so near and yet

she minister to the life -- to the joy of live a stronger woman physically could have minister more efficiently to the physical side without neglect the one thing needful this woman choose the better part and stick to it and _ result _ prove she righteousness the foolish woman looketh upon the outward appearance and be trouble over _ many _ thing she wear herself out try to keep the _ outside _

separated and they be separated _ only as the harbor be separate from the sea _ we body be but inlet of one great soul and they be but the smallest part of ourselves be it then not foolish to _ try _ to draw another nearer why we be _ now _ so near we _ can not _ be nearer we be _ one _ why strive to do what be _ already _ do ah you see we work from a false hypothesis we be so concerned with the many thing on the _ outside _ that we lose sight of _ inside truth _ _ take you husband 's nearness for grant _ be not trouble over the many thing of appearance _ have faith in he _ if there be any

person _ or to all person _ every man be in embryo a good and thoughtful and loving husband a wise wife will give he the loving full-of-faith appreciative atmosphere which encourage development we be all just as good as we know how to be and as bad as we dare be _ and we be all grow better _ why not chant the beauty of the good instead of imagine it we duty to eternally bark against the bad it be say there can not be a model husband without a model wife and _ vice versa _ true then if yours be not a model husband _ do not assume that you be a model wife fit to judge and admonish he _ be still and get acquaint with he \* \* \* \* \* make it you _ first _ object in life to cultivate a serene and faith-full heart and aura as a means toward this end cultivate a _ full _ appreciation of whatever and whoever come near you cultivate the spirit of praise and _ trust _ where you can not see second take _ good _ care of you body and personal appearance allow plenty of time for bathing caring for you hair nail tooth and clothing wear plain clothes if need be but do not wear soil or ragged one and do not ever put a pin where a hook or button ought to be no man can continue to love a woman who be slatternly third allow at least a hour _ every _ day for reading and meditate on new thought line _ and for go into the silence let nothing rob you of this hour for of it will come wisdom love and power to meet the work and trial of all other hour remember the parable of the ten virgin and take this hour for fill you lamp that you be ready for the unexpected only in such hour can you lay up love wisdom and power which will enable you to make the best of the other hour let not outward thing rob you of you source of power _ fourth unless you wish to fall behind the world 's procession see that you spend some time every day in read the best magazine and newspaper take pain to skip most of the criminal news read optimistically and cultivate a quick eye for all the good thing take the _ best _ magazine even if you have to leave feather off you hat and dessert off you table if you can find a _ interesting _ literary club it might be well to join it and do you part of the work but see that you do not _ rob _ the peter of you energy to pay the paul of club ambition and fifthly come you housework this be the juggernaut department which grind many a woman to skin and bone -- and she husband discard the remains when it come to housekeeping a woman have need of all the love wisdom and power she can muster in she hour of silence even a five room flat or cottage be more than one woman can keep _ spotless _ and allow time for anything else many thing _ must _ be leave undo the wise woman simplify to the last degree compatible with comfort useless bric-a-brac be dispense with not how much but _ how good _ be she rule when buy a few good thing _ keep in place _ be better than a clutter of flimsy thing which pander only to a uncultured esthetic taste -- and make work _ order _ be the wise woman 's first law in housekeeping cleanliness she second which be like unto the first in importance she let extra room furniture and fallal go _ until she can pay well to have they care for _ the same rule obtain in she kitchen and she personal dress the wise woman think of comfort and allow time for the _ joy _ of life wherefore _ all _ she life be a pleasure the foolish woman be ground under the wheel of routine to she housework be a stern duty which come _ first _ and to which body mind personal appearance happiness the joy of live all must be sacrifice lastly firstly and all the time the wise woman be guide in what to do and in what to leave undo by the spirit of love whilst the foolish woman be guide by the spirit of appearance note the order in which i have write these need of life a exact reversal of the usual order housework _ last _ and the spirit of comfort first the tendency of every woman be to lose _ herself _ in trouble over the many thing of she household if she would be happy useful young and grow she must turn she life the other side up the best way to begin the only successful way so far as i know be by make time for the hour of reading and meditation and silence she must _ take _ the time by sheer force of will -- take it until it grow into a habit which _ take she _ out of this hour will come first peace and self-control and gradually she will find unfold out of this peace and control the wisdom to know what to do and how and what _ not _ to do from this unfold come the only power which can make new think practical to the individual case be you satisfy with yourself and you condition then pursue you old way be you dissatisfy with yourself and surroundings _ in order to change they _ you _ must change _ -- _ that which be first with you must become last _ and the last must be first be still and know the i be god of you and lo all _ thing _ shall be add but the _ thing _ must be last not first seek ye _ first _ the kingdom of good in yourself _ and to be right with it _ and all thing shall be add all thing shall be add to you not to _ other thing _ be still until you find yourself -- you wise loving joy-giving self which dwell in the silence and be able to do whatsoever you desire chapter vi marriage contract that article of yours ` so near and yet so far ' have worry I to a extent i be ashamed of to my ` judgment ' that article be disingenuous it be not so much that you jump on that poor soul with hob-nailed shoe but that you formulate the ` jump ' quite as the husband might have do that be if _ she _ would repent and change she course she would soon find that _ he _ be all right and -- inferentially -- all the trouble be of she making not one word on the other side you even quote you own experience _ against _ she my dear _ do _ you really find that you ` trouble ' be of you own making and _ do _ you really change anything except you own amount of distress during the process of disintegration marriage be the only contract which society do not promptly admit to be break when either party refuse to fulfill he obligation -- as agree to and in view of the custom of age and the instinct in woman form by such custom -lrb- when instinct make the establish of individuality the _ very _ hardest thing in life for a generous woman -rrb- i think that you implication against the woman try with all the light she be _ get _ to keep she side of that very one-sided contract be simply -- cruel i wish i could get at that girl and tell she that she _ only _ chance for happiness be through the paradox ` whoso _ will _ not lose he life _ can not _ find it ' whoso will not ` let go ' of the love which he five per cent judgment claim as he only _ righteous _ chance can not inherit that which the ninety-five per cent would attract if the five per cent be ` offer up ' to the spirit this be the first time i have ever disagree with you point of view jane that article so near and yet so far have bring forth volume of comment most of it highly favorable and nearly all of it from woman themselves but among the writer be three critic and among the critic one of the brightest woman i know whose letter appear above and she say that article be to she disingenuous of course it be for she have not yet arrive at the point of _ give up she own way _ she be still a pharisee of the pharisee -- on the surface she be proud she _ know _ she have do she best to bring thing right -- accord to she judgment of right and she _ do hate _ to acknowledge she foolishness she will hold fast she own integrity as long as there be a shred of it leave do not i know do not i do exactly the same thing of course but the pressure of the great spirit of love wisdom justice be too much for I i _ have _ to give up my judgment i _ have _ to acknowledge that there _ must _ be the same spirit express in my husband 's judgment i _ have _ to let go be still and get at _ he _ point of view jane too will have to do it and the fact that that article worry she to a extent she be ashamed of be the proof when truth press she point we worry until we can hold out no longer then we give in one of the other two critic write that over that article she shed the first tear in over seven year then she ask I if i do not think i be a little hard on the taurus woman and go on to reveal plainly that she tear be those of _ self-pity _ do not i know have not i shed quart of such tear of course but not more than a ounce or two be shed after i give up my own way but this second critic be arrive just as i do and as jane will -- arrive all unconsciously to herself she letter sound like a chapter from my own thinking of a dozen year ago she give a bird 's eye view of she husband -- no of she husband 's _ fault _ she tell how she read new thought literature on the sly -- just as i do and she wind up with this _ piece _ of good advice : i will say to such live you own life as god intend you to regardless of the fact of you husband be brave hope will and pray dress look sweet if you husband tell you he do not care how you look but to not come near he with you foolishness as mine do why let he live he life in he own way make home attractive for you own sake read good book and in time book will be you chum the third critic too be full of self-pity though she do not mention she tear and she letter be a long portrait of she husband 's fault she want a little encouragement to leave he but she be afraid he will go to the dog if she do so like a generous woman she stick to he and make the best -lrb- -rrb- of a bad bargain jane say my article be cruel dearie it be -- as the surgeon 's knife be cruel but it be the truth and it hurt but to make way for heal the woman who blame have in she eye something worse than a cataract the woman who shed tear over she fate be move by the meanest of emotion she attract cruelty not only from that article _ but from she husband _ it take _ two _ to quarrel _ and either one can stop it _ it take _ two _ to maintain strained relation and _ either one can ease the strain _ the principle i try to elucidate in that article be as applicable to a man as to a woman but it be a woman a taurus woman who ask I therefore i talk straight to she and _ i _ be a taurus woman who have be through the same mill and i write not from a hardened heart but from one make tender by experience and the spirit of truth my point of view might have be the husband 's _ if _ the husband have be a unusually just one and i must say the husband 's point of view be more apt to be _ just _ than the wife 's for the reason that a woman be more apt to be blind by _ emotional self-interest _ in proportion as man or woman be rule by emotion he judgment be distorted _ as a rule man 's judgment _ be straighter than a woman 's but judgment be a shallow thing base upon _ already reveal fact _ woman 's intuition go to the heart of thing and flash fact into revelation woman as a rule _ see farther _ but be apt to misjudge what be _ close at hand _ only as man wake in woman and woman in man do right judgment and love commune why not judge with the husband as i _ feel _ with the wife be any man _ totally _ depraved jane feel abused because she think _ i _ think that in family strain the woman be more at fault _ in a sense _ i do _ woman can not only make and unmake empire but they do make or fail to make harmony _ _ at home _ why man with all they power be mere rag baby in the hand of woman of _ tact _ woman be the _ real _ power in the world -- the power behind the throne if only they would develop that particular kind of power instead of come around in front of the throne to lay down the law -- instead of measure they _ man _ - strength against man real _ woman _ - strength will move the most stubborn of man if i blame the woman _ -lrb- i blame neither any more than i blame a child for childishness -rrb- _ it be because _ i know she be the ruling power _ she responsibility be determine by she real power and above all a taurus woman may rule she home -- _ and do _ either she rule by force -- for she have more than she share of the man in she -- and make war and trouble for herself and other or she learn she lesson and rule by _ loving tact _ in which case she husband rise up and call she _ bless _ the _ woman who know and rule herself _ be the woman of proverb xxxi 10th to 31st verse she husband be honor among man _ because he be honor at home _ and because he be honor he _ live up to it _ why girl you hold you husband 's destiny in the hollow of you hand in a far greater sense than any man hold a woman 's but as i say before _ it take two to make a unhappy home and either one can bring harmony out of discord _ any ordinary woman can do it _ if she will _ and any extraordinary man can do it quite as well as a ordinary woman this be not a question of what society admit it be a personal question between one man and one woman it _ be _ a partnership whether society so admit or not and the failure of one of the partner to live up to the express or imply agreement do not justify the other party in the misdoing of she part _ as long as they live together _ do one theft or murder justify another no neither do a neglectful husband justify a scolding or spiteful wife nor _ vice versa _ two people marry _ first _ for the happiness of love and second for home privilege no matter whether love flee or not _ as long as they keep up _ the home-privilege partnership it should be do in the spirit of harmony remember it take _ two _ to destroy harmony and _ either one can restore it _ if marriage be not a love contract let it at least be a harmonious business contract if you can not or will not _ adjust yourself _ to you husband then leave he do not stay and half-do you part of the business and cultivate hate and contempt it be hell _ get out _ i have know several couple who live year in comparative happiness after love have fly who be kind to each other considerate business-like the wife make pleasant home and the husband come and go at will in they spare time the wife develop they personal interest and live they own life as critic number two advise when the husband take cranky streak the wife simply make light of it to themselves and forget it as soon as possible they live on as comfortable term as if the wife be simply _ first-class _ hire house-keeper little crankism be all in the bargain eventually every one of these couple separate and nearly all the party be now _ happily _ married _ and every _ _ couple part amicably _ each be _ satisfied _ to terminate the old partnership to I a divorce be not a disgrace but a family row _ be _ and i suspect that most divorce _ row _ be work up to _ drown guilty conscience _ neither have do he best by the other and he know it so he raise a great row to fix attention on the other 's shortcoming that he own may escape observation until a man and woman have succeed in live up to they home privilege in a manner befitting honest and intelligent man and woman _ they can not be sure that they be not fit for a real loving union _ friction over small thing obscure vision and judgment and hate hide the lovableness that _ must _ lie in every be get rid of the rowing over little thing of every day life and you will be able to love as much as you marriage will permit _ and you will be free to dissolve the entire partnership if you desire _ do i _ really _ change anything _ yes _ be it anything to bring peace and quiet pleasure and comfort and appreciation where they opposite be wont to hold bacchanale _ yes _ no woman who _ honestly _ try the course i have endeavor to outline will ever doubt that she really accomplish _ something _ neither will she regret here be a word every married woman will do well to heed as long as she live with she husband : _ if you can not have you way without a fuss then try he with a good will _ peace be unto you peace which be the foundation for _ all you desire _ chapter vii some hint and a kick and now elizabeth let I suggest something punch up the _ man _ a little in the matter of cultivate cleanly habit etc woman be preach to eternally on these matter and the man wholly neglect it would be a ` new thought ' to take to the man a little and might assist in make more of they fit companion for the sweet and cleanly woman they delight in associate with the absolute neglect of the masculine sex by writer on these subject cause they to think that nothing in the way of the aesthetic be expect of they it be a wrong to the man not to en-me and make I he chum as well as he wife help courage they to aspire to a common plane with woman in the matter of purity and cleanliness cleanliness be next to godliness but no more so in the case of woman than of man it be time for equality to be recognize in this matter as in all other carrie it be funny how many woman squirm when remind that it be they who set the pace in the home we be always longing for power and a field of effort and then when a 20th century prophetess arise and tell we we _ be _ all but almighty and show we how to direct we almightiness to accomplish result we -- well we squirm one would think some of we be a little bit ashamed of the pace we have be set of the thing we have be accomplish with we almightiness you know we first impulse when we see a error in we own self be to sound the trumpet and charge upon the error in the other fellow be this why carrie want the man scold well _ do not _ they get scold what be they wife and daughter and sweetheart for but to scold 'em or coax 'em into cleaner way of live no use to talk to man as a class about anything but politics do not you know that adam could not even taste a apple until eve coax he adam be a great theorizer he will gaze at a apple and tell you that he ought not to eat it and _ why _ not he will even amble long and wishfully about that apple but it take _ eve _ to wake in he the _ living impulse _ to take it just so with matter of personal neatness he know -- oh yes know be he long suit -- he know he ought to be neat and he think he want to be but unless eve and the serpent come along he have not the _ living impulse _ and eve must not lose sight of the serpent however far away the dive may fly eve must use wisdom and tact as well as example if she would have adam accept she standard of cleanliness she must see to it that she example be _ beautifully _ clean instead of _ painfully _ so there be man who be careless about they person simply as a matter of relief from the painful cleanness of they surroundings then there be adam who be careless for lack of interest in please eve in these case you will find that eve have little or no interest in please adam or that she overdo the matter of try to please and frequently dissolve in tear and precipitate countless reproach upon luckless adam then there be adam who be careless from petty spite -- with shame i say it and with greater shame i say you will find they eve be spiteful too probably more spiteful than the adam for eve you know be generally smart enough and ambitious enough to outdo adam in any line of endeavor -- especially in the use or misuse of the tongue in matter of niceness it be eve who set the pace adam be build for strength eve for beauty and adornment it be _ natural _ for eve to set the pace and for adam to follow in all matter of detail and niceness whether adam follow with good grace or ill depend upon eve and the serpent if eve be wise as the serpent in she and harmless as the dive in she she can lead adam a _ willing _ captive to heaven or hell now will you rise again and -- squirm -- because i attribute to eve all power over adam will you say i excuse adam 's transgression and come down hard on eve i suppose so but the very fact that you resent the imputation be proof that in you heart of heart you know i have hit _ very close _ to the mark when a arrow fly wide we be merely amuse at the poor marksmanship but the closer the arrow strike to the center the more excited we grow -- either with resentment or admiration accord to we sympathy in matter of cleanliness niceness and adornment eve set the pace and if she pace be a graceful one and _ not too fast _ adam follow in due time he _ acquire the habit _ of do the little ablutions and adorning eve have teach he if you adam be _ very _ careless about these matter you may depend upon it that when he be grow up he mother be either dead or careless or tactless and you may safely suspect that adam in he previous state of existence be a forlorn old bach so be gentle with he for it will take time to correct the fault of such a adam but do not give up eve dear be gentle but be firm and persistent use you ingenuity in find way to make adam _ want _ to please you and if you can look back over a year or two and see that he _ have _ improve in _ some _ respect at least that there be even one or two little trick of niceness which have become almost if not quite habitual then hold a little praise meeting and rejoice praise he for learn and praise yourself for what you have succeed in teach he and if you success have come _ without friction _ if you have inspire adam to _ want _ to please you then glorify yourself exceedingly -- _ all to yourself of course _ if you let adam know you be manage he even for he own good he will show he independence by go back to he old trick -- just as _ you _ would do if in he place if there have be friction or lack of success let it wake you up to use henceforth _ more of the wisdom and love which be in you _ now this little homily be write ostensibly to woman but all my man subscriber will read it and applaud _ i wonder how many of they will see that every word of it be as applicable to themselves as to they mother sister sweetheart wife _ every eve be adam at heart and every adam be eve and what in sauce for adam will prove equally effective with eve adam and eve be both green and grow they be the two half of a ripening peach bring together by the law of attraction or love because at this stage in they development _ they fit _ you will be incline to doubt that every adam 's nature fit he eve 's but i say unto you judge not accord to outward appearance but judge righteous judgment now listen : -- every human being have he manifest good point and he _ latent _ good point the manifest good point of a man be the adam of he the _ latent _ good point -- the weak place in he -- be the eve of he -- the interior as-yet-undeveloped part of he the strong point the good point of a woman be the eve the weak point where she be as yet undeveloped be the adam or interior nature of she if it be not for personal attraction particularly the attraction of one man and one woman the _ latent _ part of both man and woman would remain forever undeveloped and they strong point would continue to grow stronger in time -lrb- suppose the race do not die out -rrb- there would be two class of people utterly different and at variance with each other -- two opposite with no understanding or sympathy for each other attraction bring together opposite the strong steady man fall in love with a frivolous butterfly a handsome woman attract a homely man and _ vice versa _ a strong capable woman marry a sickly incompetent man -- and support he a sentimental woman be attract to a matter-of-fact man who develop she common sense by pruning she sentimentality a artistic temperament be draw to a phlegmatic a sanguine to a bilious a mental to a vital a active man marry a lazy wife or _ vice versa _ a bright man marry a stupid girl and so on and on man and wife be a rounded whole in which the man manifest what be latent in the woman and the woman supply that which in the man be as yet undeveloped just as eve coax or scold adam into habit of neatness as adam coax scold or drive eve into have he meal on time thus develop she self-command and _ promptness _ so they act and re-act upon each other to develop a thousand latency of which they and the onlooker be more or less unconscious the foolish adam and eve fret and strain against these process of development and bewail they mistake in marry not see that the association be really benefit both the wise adam and eve reduce the friction _ by kindness _ by _ co-operation with each other _ adam _ try _ to please eve eve try to please adam and both be kind about it wherefore in due time they _ appreciation _ for each other grow and mayhap they love grow with it if love wane instead of grow at least they be _ friend _ and can _ part _ as friend if they so desire someone have well say that without a model husband there can be no model wife i believe it as long as man and woman be hold together by love attraction or condition -lrb- in its last analysis it be _ all _ the law of attraction or _ god _ -rrb- they be literally _ one _ no matter how hard they kick against the oneness and neither man nor woman can _ alone _ be a model any more than one side of a peach can be _ entirely _ ripe and sweet and the other side entirely hard and green so when i speak to eve about tact and kindness i speak to _ the eve in adam _ as well as in eve herself and what i say of the attraction of man and wife apply equally well to other family relationship to friendship to acquaintanceship and even to we relationship to the people we pass on the street or _ the heathen we never see _ every person who touch we even in the slightest degree _ be draw by the law of attraction because we need he to bring out some latency in ourselves and because he need we to help develop some latency in he _ it be we own highest desire -lrb- the god in we -rrb- which constitute the attraction oh but _ that _ can not be you exclaim because so-and-so bring out only the _ evil _ in I he make I feel _ so _ hateful and mean let we see dearie _ the hateful and mean feeling be due to you resist that which he influence would bring out of you _ for instance you be late at you appointment with he of course you _ think _ you have a good excuse but if promptitude be _ one of you strong point _ instead of one of you latency you would have be on time in spite of that excuse -- if it be you _ habit _ to be on time you would have sweep aside a much greater hindrance before you would have allow yourself to be behind time now so-and-so be naturally prompt and have have some experience with you he know you be not so when he have arrive fifteen minute ahead of time as it be _ he _ nature to do _ you _ come tripping in fifteen minute late -- smile confidingly as you excuse yourself -lrb- he have spend the half hour in cultivate a grouch at you for not be as prompt as himself -rrb- -- he of course look sulky and answer shortly then you pout and finally _ work yourself _ into quite a temper over he inconsiderateness and crankiness because of that paltry little fifteen minute he have to wait he _ work himself _ into a temper because you be not on time you _ work yourself _ into a temper because he be not nice all that working be you individual doings but it all result in you resolve that if ever you have another engagement with that man -lrb- you would take good care not to if you could help it though -rrb- you would be _ on time _ if it kill you of course you do not tell he so and _ he _ resolve that the next time he make a engagement with you he would know it but _ if _ he do he would make up he mind to be _ on _ time instead of ahead of time and he would not care if you _ be _ late so you see the law of attraction accomplish its divine purpose in attract you two to make that engagement -- it wake in you a _ resolution _ toward promptness and it wake in he a _ resolution _ to be _ on _ time rather than _ before _ time in future and to be civil if you happen to be late -- since you be only a woman and can not be expect to appreciate the value of promptness this be the way all we association in life work together for good _ to develop we latency _ to strengthen we weak point _ the wiser we be the less emotion we waste in resent the develop process -- the more readily we see the point and take the resolution hint at _ you see you and you friend have have other such experience as the one describe -- you have be late before when so-and-so condone the matter and say nothing _ he let you off so easily that you never think of resolve not to be late again _ you _ feel _ that he have be displeased but you depend upon you niceness to make it all right again and it never occur to you to call yourself to account and _ resolve _ that it should not happen so again you be _ too heedless _ to take a hint so you have to have a kick you may set this down as a rule without exception : _ that all the kick you get from relative or friend come after you have ignore repeat hint from you own inner consciousness and they _ you have go on excuse yourself _ without correct the fault _ -lrb- perhaps without see it -rrb- until the law of attraction stop hint and administer a kick and if _ one _ kick will not cause you to develop that weak point the law of attraction will bring you other and yet harder kick on the same line _ you will attract _ worse experience of the same sort it be this very law which make married folk -lrb- or other relative or friend -rrb- quarrel adam refuse eve 's _ hint _ about neatness and eve kick -- harder and harder eve refuse adam 's hint and he get to kick _ it _ always _ take two to start the kick _ and either one can stop it _ a frank acknowledgement of error and a _ resolution _ to mend you end of the fault no matter what be do with the other end then a pleasant expression and _ no more word -- this will stop the kick _ and in proportion as you learn to take the _ hint _ you attract you will cease to attract kick _ by all of which i be remind of that old testament statement that ' _ the lord harden the heart of pharoah _ ' the lord or lord god of the old testament be what i call the _ god in we _ or the law of attraction in we and the god of the bible be the whole -- the god _ over all _ as well as _ in the individual _ it be the _ god in we _ which attract to we we experience _ in order to teach we wisdom and knowledge _ pharoah be not _ wise _ enough to let those people go so the god in mose give he a hint -- which he fail to take wherefore he attract a gentle kick in the way of a plague this dash he ardor a bit and he give permission for the israelite to go but he be only _ scared _ into do it and after the plague be call off he be not wise enough to keep he word -- here be a great lot of valuable slave which he _ could _ keep and why should not he -- he word be easy broken and all 's fair in business so _ he heart harden _ and he hold the israelite so he attract a harder kick which fail to accomplish its purpose kick after kick come each a bit harder than the last each scare pharoah for the moment but _ none convince he _ he still think it _ right _ to hang onto he slave if he could and he have the courage of he conviction a man of such splendid courage seem worthy of a better fate pharoah have the courage of a christ couple with the ethic of a savage whose only law be he own desire of possession because he could not take the hint and _ see he mistake _ he attract a series of kick increase in power until one finally land he in the red sea perhaps a glimmer of the truth reach he as the water roll over but he soul go march on and he mistake be still re-incarnating here on earth be adam kick eve take a hint before he kick harder be eve make thing warm for you adam take care you jump not out of the frying pan into the fire be circumstance plague you everybody take the hint lest worse plague arrive learn wisdom and avoid the red sea be not wise in thine own conceit _ lean _ not upon thine own understanding but in _ all _ thy way _ and thy neighbor 's way _ acknowledge that the one good spirit lead and he shall direct thy foot in path of peace and pleasantness the proof of foolishness be unrest and friction the proof of wisdom be peace _ be still and know the lord thy god and learn from what he draw to thee _ chapter viii the heart of woman my wife have fall in love with another man she keep house for I and i be try to show she all the love i can but it seem to have no effect upon she i love she dearly and desire to win she back what should be my attitude toward she and toward the man aj -lrb- who be one of many who have thus write I -rrb- goodness know _ be _ good and you will know in other word be just to all three before you be generous to anybody of course that be not easy to do but it be possible and it be the only thing you can never be sorry for afterward first get down to first principle there be three individual concern -- three separate and complete being each with he inherent right of choice nobody _ own _ anybody else nobody owe anybody else anything in the way of duty each individual stand on he or she own two foot and make a effort at least to go where he or she will find the most happiness every one of these three individual have make mistake -- he or she have think happiness be to be find in this place or that he or she have make the choice and trot on he or she two foot to this place or that only to find happiness be not there as he or she suppose _ we do not always know what be for we happiness _ but goodness know -- and _ all _ we mistake work together for ultimate happiness in the truest sense there be _ no _ mistake a mistake be simply a case where thing fail to come out as we calculate _ they come out right nevertheless _ that be they come out right for we enlightenment by they we grow in wisdom and knowledge next time we judgment will be better the wife in this case no doubt think just now that she marriage to aj be all a terrible mistake if so she be make another mistake that be she be think what be not so whatever experience she have have with aj be draw to she by herself for she own enlightenment and development they be all _ good _ it _ may _ be that she and aj have gain from they association all there be in it doubtless the wife think a separation and a new marriage would make she supremely happy may be it would may be she judgment be right this time on the other hand it may be wrong as it have be oft before many a woman have jump out of the frying pan of one marriage into the fire of another _ only time will tell _ if this new love be the soul mate she think the attraction will be all the stronger and steadier in a year or two from now if he be not the soul mate she think he the attraction will wane i know woman who under similar condition have elect to wait woman whose conscience would not allow they to leave a kind husband or young child for the sake of gratify they passion for another man _ i have know these same woman to despise a year or two later the man they have think themselves passionately and everlastingly in love with _ they have never get over thank whatever god there be that they be save from that rash step i have know _ many _ case of this kind and have receive many letter of fervent thanks from both man and woman who follow my private counsel to _ let time prove the new attraction _ before sever old tie and make new one and i must say that _ not one _ who wait but have say to I i be _ glad _ i wait _ whilst many who do not wait have bitterly regret _ a love affair be emotional insanity lover be insane not in fit condition to decide they own action the state of fall in love be moon-madness for the time be the lover 's sense of justice he reason he judgment be distort by _ reflection from another personality _ this be especially so in the woman 's case for the reason that she be generally a creature of untrained impulse instead of reasoning will there be that recent case of the beautiful and beloved princess louise who run away from she royal husband she think she love monsieur giron so devotedly that she could bear anything for the sake of be with he and surely she be miserable enough in she old environment but when it come to the reality she could not bear the consequence she want she child she proud spirit wince at the snub she get she long a little for the old life and familiarity with she soul mate reveal the knowledge that he be not _ all _ soul she flunk miserably and go home to she sick child you see she be literally love - _ sick _ she mind be disorder a life spend with she soul mate loom to she so large and dazzling that all other thing be as nothing she could not for the time be see straight she be literally insane if she have only _ wait _ until the new wear off she passion wait until she see thing in they proper proportion and relation to each other until she be _ sure _ she could _ live the life _ make inevitable by she change that be the trouble -- love-sick-ness _ blind she to the truth _ when she wake up by _ experience _ of the truth _ she wish she have not _ the only safe thing for a woman to do who find herself marry to one man and in love with another be to _ wait _ a year or two or three year until time prove she love and _ she know in she heart _ that she can make the change and never regret it no matter what happen _ you see she can never be happy with the new love as long as _ conscience or heart _ reproach she for she treatment of the old love _ it behoove she to consider well time will prove the new love in many such case time reveal the idol 's foot of clay he show that he love be for _ himself _ not for she he pout and kick and tease like a petulant child he want she now no matter how she may suffer in consequence of he haste in spite of herself in spite of she love for the new love she find he be not panning out as she suppose she begin to see he other he everyday side -- _ the side she will have to live with _ if she go to he now be the husband 's chance she _ know he _ every-day side from experience she have try it in weal and woe if he rise to this occasion the ideal man he stand a fair chance of win from he wife a _ deeper _ love than she have yet give any man he may catch she _ whole _ heart in its rebound from the idol with foot of clay to a husband in such a position i would say _ be kind _ there be nothing so kingly as kindness -- and true kindness under this most try condition will in time win even a recalcitrant wife 's admiration and love -- if _ the two be really mate _ if they be not real mate if they have outgrow they usefulness to each other the sooner they part the better to hold they together would only be another mistake because a man and wife be mate five or ten year ago be no proof that they be mate today we be all _ grow _ and it be often literally true that we grow away from people _ every loved one who go out of we life make room for a better fuller love -- unless we shut ourselves in with we grief _ it be say that robert loui stevenson fall in love with the wife of he best friend he tell he friend frankly intend to leave the city he friend question the wife and find she reciprocate stevenson 's love stevenson stay with he friend in pari and the wife go to she father 's home in californium a year later the attachment between he wife and stevenson still remain the friend apply for a divorce then he and stevenson journey all the way to californium together where stevenson be marry to the ex-wife the ex-husband attend the wedding and that same evening announce he engagement to a girl friend of mr stevenson i glory in the friendship of those two man who refuse to allow the unreasoning caprice of love to sever they love for each other a separation and remarriage like that be a _ credit _ to all party concerned _ it be the quarrel and estrangement which be the real disgrace _ in case of separation and remarriage john ruskin be another man too great and too good to resent love 's go where it be send he have marry know that she respect and admiration but not she _ love _ be he a beautiful and brilliant girl much younger than himself they live happily a number of year then ruskin bring home the painter millai to make a picture of he wife artist and model fall in love ruskin find it out and refuse to allow he wife to sacrifice herself for he he divorce she and give she to millais and the three be life-long friend if i be a man in such a case as a j 's i should treat my wife as i would a daughter i would treat she as a individual with the right of choice many a daughter have rush headlong into a marriage which she relative oppose and she regret at leisure if someone grab you by the arm and pull hard in one direction you be force to pull hard in the opposite direction or lose you balance and fall if a daughter be pull away from the man to whom she be attract she individuality rebel and she pull toward he harder than she would if let alone she _ choose _ to follow the attraction which at the time be pleasanter than that between herself and she frowning relative remember this i would _ free _ daughter or wife and trust to the god in she to work out she highest good i would _ believe _ that whatever she choose to do be really for she highest good if i _ really _ loved _ she _ i would _ prefer _ she happiness to my own and in it all i should be _ deeply _ conscious that whatever be be best and that _ all thing work together for _ my _ best good as well as for hers _ whatever appearance may show to the shortsighted the real truth be this : -- _ justice reign the happiness of one person be not buy at the expense of another the law of attraction bring we we own and hold to we we own in spite of all its effort to get away it never leave we until _ through some change or lack of change in ourselves _ it have cease to be we own _ a man 's mental attitude toward the other man in such case as aj 's should be the same as toward other man -- the attitude of real kindness toward a individual who like the rest of we be be as good as he know how to be and as bad as he dare be this do not mean that the husband shall allow himself to be use for a door mat nor hold up for the ridicule of the neighbor a sensible father expect he daughter to observe the propriety the daughter of a sensible father be more than willing to meet these expectation in the same way a sensible husband will expect he wife to see no more of the lover than society permit she to see of any man not related to she no sensible american woman will jeopardize she good name under such circumstance she will control she feeling until she have prove she new attraction and be duly release from the old if a woman will not conduct herself in a self-respecting manner the sooner she leave the better for the husband as for herself she will learn by experience -- as princess louise do love be the mightiest force in creation it will not be gainsay but it can be control to pen it up too completely bring explosion devastation to give it too free rein mean madness with no less devastation to _ direct _ it within reasonable limit be the only safe way it take a cool head and steadfast heart to meet such emergency as aj 's and eye have not see nor ear hear the well do and its attendant glory which enter into the heart and character of the man who meet such condition and conquer -- _ himself _ not once in a thousand life have a man such opportunity to prove he godship and bless himself and the world chapter ix the law of individuality all growth be by _ learn _ all learning come by the gratification of desire truly experience be not only the best teacher but the _ only _ infallible one the gratification of desire good or bad leave always one imperishable residue of wisdom the rest of the experience go with the chaff for burn desire point invariably accord to the individual 's intelligence in proportion as this be faulty he desire be bad what _ be _ a bad desire anyway in the main bad desire be self-made or thoughtlessly accept dancing be wicked to a methodist and good to a episcopalian but aside from these personal standpoint which be legion there be a immutable law to which intelligence be conform all action and thought -- the law of individuality -- the law recognize and express by confucius and jesus in negative and positive form of the golden rule do not unto other what ye would not they should do unto you interference with the freedom of the individual be bad -- that be _ it invariably bring pain _ to the one who interfere in thought or deed listen to this : you can not know anything of the source or cause of the crisis you be judge for no one who know will tell you and you would not know if you be tell the depths of elemental immortality of self-deceit and revenge lie in we eagerness to judge one another and to force one another under the yoke of we judgment when there be the faith of the son of man in the world life will be leave to make its own judgment the only judgment we have a right to make upon one another be the free and truthful living of we own life george d herron this force of other in mind or action under the yoke of _ we _ judgment be the only possible way we can break a _ real _ law to be _ ourselves _ and to leave other free be to _ be good _ dancing will come and go and come again so will fashion of all kind conventionality and creed but this law remain a eternal chalk line to be toe and eternal torment await he who do not toe it \* \* \* \* \* take the case of a man who desire to run away with another man 's wife the one immutable law of individuality say _ no man own a wife _ instead of this be a problem with two man and one man 's property as factor it be a case of _ three individual _ with god-given rights of individual choice you have hear it say that _ where two be agree _ as touching anything it shall be do unto they it take two to make or to keep make a bargain no matter what hallucination in regard to ownership any man may labor under _ he do not _ own a wife he have no more rights over one woman than over another or over another man except as the _ woman herself give _ he the right and _ keep on _ give it to he the law of individuality be absolute and in due time husband will know better than to imagine they own wife wife will know better than to be own and the other man will not imagine he can gain great pleasure from run away with anything each will be free and leave the other so but as a man thinketh in he heart so be he until a man _ recognize _ the law of individuality he action be govern by the law he _ do _ recognize and he desire act accordingly when he desire to run away with anything he _ conscience _ tell he he be steal if desire be strong enough he steal a wife and eventually suffer for it for though he may not have break a real law he _ have _ break a imagine one and in he _ own mind _ he deserve punishment and in he own mind he get it as a man thinketh so _ be _ he and what he be _ determine what he attract _ never be a deeper truer say than paul 's bless be the man that _ doubteth not _ in that thing which he alloweth the man who _ wait _ until he be _ fully persuade _ in he own mind will be bless in follow desire and he will grow in wisdom thereby the man who _ think _ he desire be bad and yet follow it will grow in wisdom _ by the scourging he get _ he have transgress _ he conception _ of the one law and suffer in get back to _ at-one-ment _ in either case he _ grow in wisdom _ and eventually he will desire only in accordance with the one law of individual choice there be no question of ought about it the individual be free to follow desire or to crucify it and the fact be _ he follow desire when he crucify it _ he _ desire _ to crucify desire because he _ be afraid _ to gratify it the man who be not afraid follow desire and grow fast _ in wisdom and in knowledge _ he may make mistake and suffer all sort of agony as a result but he learn from he miss as well as from he hit and he progress the man who be afraid to follow desire crucify _ he life _ and stunt he growth it be better for the individual to follow he desire and afterward repent than to crush he desire and repent for a lifetime under the false impression that the universe unjustly give to another that which should have belong to he there be just one kind of growth -- _ growth in wisdom _ we hear of child who grow up in ignorance we likewise hear that the earth be square and the moon a green cheese child can no more grow in ignorance than they can grow in a dark and air-tight case _ all _ growth mental moral spiritual or physical be by increase in in-telligence ie by _ recognition _ of more truth all thing exist in a limitless sea of pure wisdom wait wait _ to be understand _ as fast as this universal wisdom be use it become _ in-told -- _ intelligence -- _ recognize _ wisdom we _ breathe in wisdom _ and grow in intelligence _ all _ growth mineral plant animal man or god conscious or unconscious -- all growth be by this process it be desire that make we breathe everything cry out for more _ more -- it _ can not define always _ what _ it want but it _ want _ with insatiable craving it be _ more wisdom _ the whole creation groaneth and travaileth to get give I more understanding or i die -- the visible eternally cry out to the invisible desire be the ceaseless life-urge of all thing from amoeba to archangel desire be immanuer ' -- _ god with we _ -- god _ in _ we to will and to do chapter x harmony at home i have recently marry for the second time my husband be a splendid man but he grow up child be not in harmony with I good people but a different point of view i make no pretension to perfection of course but i do try to do the best lean this be the gist of several letter i have receive from as many different woman i will answer they together when you enter a new home the matter of importance be _ not _ whether you new relative harmonize with you but whether _ you _ harmonize with _ they _ it be for _ you _ to do _ all _ the adjust this may seem hard but it be not it be a easier matter for one person to readjust she living than for a whole family to change the family have not only its individual custom to hold each one but its family custom as well whilst you have leave you family and have only you individual self to readjust if you refuse to adjust yourself for no matter what reason you will act upon this family you have enter as a red hot iron would act upon a pan of water -- there 'll be boil and bubble toil and trouble and the family will fly to piece all because you come in with _ positive _ notion of you own which you insist upon enforce but if you come into the family like a lump of sugar into a glass of water you will all _ in time _ melt together and the whole family will be the sweeter and better for you come whatever there be in you which be better and sweeter than they own idea and custom will in time be _ absorb _ by the family for what be good be ever positive to the less good and have a power of its own to convert and every human soul if leave free will eventually _ choose _ the good the only danger lie in you tilt you nose at _ they _ way and idea and insist upon you own that rouse the sense of _ individuality _ in they and they then fight for _ they _ way and idea -- then there be boil and bubble and sputter and fly apart learn to vibrate _ with _ people where you can and keep still when you can not _ look _ for the little thing you can enjoy together and make light of the other recognize they _ right _ to differ from you and remember that _ all _ judgment be of god -- _ they _ judgment as well as _ yours _ all this differ of judgment among the people of earth be simply _ god reasoning out thing _ all the brain god have be you brain and mine just as in you brain you reason thing for and against wonder which be right and wait for time and experience to decide so god reason one way through _ you _ brain and another and opposite way through _ my _ brain and then rest and observe until the logic of event shall show _ he _ and we the point of real harmony just be still and _ let _ god think through you brain and do not kick up a muss because he think out the other side of thing through my brain or you new relative ' brain toleration be a great thing but loving _ willingness _ to _ let _ god think out _ all _ side of a question through all sort of brain be a glorious thing let 's stand for we point of view when it be call for but do not let 's insist upon it let 's remember always to use god 's still small voice do i need to tell you that what i have just say apply to you whether you have just marry a second time or not the whole world be we family you know let 's respect it and be kind to it and _ trust _ it to recognize and appropriate we point of view just as far as be good for it let 's be more interested in get at the _ other _ point of view than insist upon we own that be the way we shall grow in wisdom and knowledge and too that be the way we shall all get close enough together to really see the truth about thing chapter xi a mystery i desire to come face to face with the person or person who be control and influence my husband against he home and child and myself he have be estrange from we all for several year although sleep under the same roof once i can find out the person or cause of he action i can remove the effect for i shall know just what to do i want to solve the mystery the chance be you will never find that out and if you do it would do you absolutely no good you husband be no dumb fool to be influence this way or that by two woman he be a man with idea of he own if he be disappoint in you as wife he have possibly turn to some other woman if so the more you pry and suspect and hint around the more positively he will turn away from you if you find out and make thing warm for he or another he would simply hate and despise you and be the harder set against you this be the law the thing for you to do be to recognize you husband 's right to make and answer for he own mistake then drop the whole thing from you mind and calculation then treat you husband as you would any man who come to visit you make yourself as attractive and culture and agreeable as possible and look out for he comfort but never get in he way nor question he doings stand square up on you own foot and be as fine a woman as you know how to be -- as gracious a one if he do love some other woman it may be but a temporary infatuation and if you be attractive and kind and sensible and independent enough he may return to he first love in he own good time if not why no matter just you get interested in life on you own account and let he do as he will if he do care for another woman he deserve credit for not desert you as many a man would have do just respect and honor he for the good that be in he instead of condemn he mentally because the good do not show just accord to you idea of how it should love do not stay put no matter how hard folk try to keep it put all we can do be to be as lovable as possible and thus do we part to _ attract _ love it may be that you be simply a sentimental goose who imagine she husband be influence away from she because forsooth he do not pay she the attention he use to i be once that kind of a goose myself and it widen a breach that do not then exist except in my mind widen it until at last it become a real breach -- my husband go elsewhere for he companionship i be too morbid and finicky and exact for a healthy man just as the husband of the woman in confession of a wife in _ century _ do i read that serial each month and feel like shake that little simpleton -- she be just the kind of a sentimental hair-splitting little idiot that i use to be instead of get at she husband 's point of view and enjoy _ with _ he at least sometimes she insist on act the martyr because he will not dawdle around and gush at she foot whatever be the cause of you trouble the only cure for it be common-sense live you own life cheerily happily and enter into you husband 's life so far as you can take all the good thing that come you way and rejoice in they but do not moon around and fuss because you can not have the sort of love-life describe in some sentimental novel you business in life be to love not to _ be _ love the latter be a secondary matter and the first be the thing that bring happiness to you go in to win now and you can develop within yourself the full life that you really desire all you desire be yours and you will realize it in due time but every moment you set you thought on straighten out some other body 's life you be delay you own realization and happiness chapter xii the family jar if a man and woman love each other and be every way suit to marry should they yield to the opposition of he grown daughter ma this question in vary form come to I often it always stir within I something i use to call righteous indignation and incidentally it make I smile translate the question into plain english and anybody can answer it without hesitancy put it this way : when two individual know what they want and the whole world approve should they go away back and sit down because a third individual try to interfere with they inherent right to the pursuit of happiness of course _ not _ a man or woman old enough to have a grown daughter be old enough to know whether he want to marry again not even the most precocious daughter be a better judge than she father as to what be best for he own happiness ah there be the rub it be not _ he _ happiness she be concern about it be she own a new marriage would interfere with the daughter 's plan she would have to give the chief place to the new wife she would have to give up a share of the prospective inheritance she have more or less consciously be count upon so she oppose she father 's re-marrying but apparently not on these grounds -- dear no she father be too old or too weakly or the intended wife be not nice the daughter conjure up a dozen excuse but never the _ real _ one of which she be not fully conscious herself -- and _ do not want to be _ the parent 's duty to child be great far greater than the child 's duty to parent but parental self-sacrifice should certainly _ not _ be continue for life a grown daughter be a individual who should stand on she own foot and make she own happiness _ without _ curtail the happiness of parent let she leave she father to a renewal of youth and happiness or let she gracefully and kindly accept she rightful second place and use she loving energy in help to make bright the home a sensible well trained loving daughter will do one of these two thing a sensible well trained loving parent will consider he daughter 's feeling and will do all he can to gain she _ willingness _ before he marry but he will not make a lasting sacrifice of he own and the other woman 's happiness simply to please a selfish girl if daughter and parent be not sensible well trained and loving it will be a case of frying pan or fire either way the recognition of individual rights to the pursuit of happiness accord to individual desire be the only basis of happiness in family relation the daughter who _ help _ she father do as he desire will find _ he _ ready to help _ she _ do as _ she _ desire and _ vice versa _ the daughter who oppose she father 's marriage be quite apt to be the daughter who have _ be oppose by she father _ he reap as he have sow or else she be the daughter who have be bring up with the idea that parent be a mere convenience for she use the way out of the family jar be often labyrinthine but the loving individual can always thread it chapter xiii the truth about divorce in January _ psychic and occult view and review _ the editor mtc wing present a view of wife and work which be anything but a _ occult _ view of the subject he evidently still cling to the old notion that man be make for the family and not the family for man he inveigh against george d herron and elbert hubbard _ et al _ because they permit themselves to be separate from they wife apparently he think the chief end of man be to tote some woman around on a chip and the fact that in he callow youth man pick out -lrb- or be pick out by -rrb- the wrong woman cut no figure in the matter man must keep on tote she even if he have to give up he life work by which he have be enable to supply the chip not to mention the other thing the woman demand all of which be the very superficial view of the world at large and have no place among new think occult teaching it be entirely too obvious -- to the old-fashioned sentimentalist who be blind to the real fact in case of separation the sentimentalist get just two view of the family and draw he hasty conclusion therefrom he see first a happy family a charming clinging little simpleton of a wife with half a dozen or so infant cling to she skirt and bosom and she round eye lift in adorable helplessness to the face of that great strong lord and master she husband in he second view of the family he behold this strong man turn he back upon this adoring family and walk deliberately forth to self-gratification leave they to perish from hunger and grief fire with these pretty and entirely fanciful picture the superficial observer burn with indignation and call down anathema upon the head of the deserter the fact be that _ no _ man ever desert a family under such condition there be always a long period of disintegration before any family go to piece -- a period of which _ both _ man and wife be well aware when a separation come it be _ really _ a relief to _ both _ party the only real pain in such case come from the spirit of _ revenge _ or a desire on the part of one or the other to pose as injured innocence that she or he may rake in the sympathy and fire the indignation of just such uninformed friend as mtc wing i have know a lot of people who separate -- known they intimately and observe they well in not one of these case do the desert party claim to _ love _ the deserter in all there be a real _ relief _ when it be all over in every case the one thing which have hold they together so long be _ fear of disgrace _ oh _ what _ will people think of I -- be the first cry of everybody -- especially woman it be _ that _ which make the desert one unhappy and resentful it be that which make many woman pose as injured innocent and rate the deserter as a villain and all the time _ in secret _ they be glad _ glad _ that they be relieved of the burden of live with a uncongenial husband or wife of course there be other reason why woman hate to be leave by they husband one be that they support be apt to go with the deserter public opinion keep many a family in the same house year after it really _ know _ it be separated widely as the pole the dread of have to take care of herself keep many a woman hang like grim death to a man she know she do not love and who despise she the fear of public opinion and the love not of money but of _ ease _ hold together under one roof ten of thousand of family who have be _ occultly _ and really separate for year a man be hold by the same sentimental notion that mtc wing have -- that he must protect the woman so he stay in hell to do it he _ have _ to stay in hell _ until she get out _ in almost every one of these separation case it be the woman and _ not _ the man who give the signal in george d herron 's case the wife offer to take a certain sum of money and release he from support she he meet she condition -- and bear all the odium like a man to she credit be it say she do not pose as a injured woman i know nothing about elbert hubbard 's case but i venture to say that if he and he wife be separate that _ she _ be the one who do the leave act we hear a lot about the biblical reason for divorce but i say unto you that infidelity be no reason at all for divorce the one just cause for separation be _ incompatibility of temper _ a man be a individual a woman be another individual and neither can make himself or herself over to please the other when two people from lack of similar ideal and aim can not _ pull together _ the quicker they pull apart the better it will be for they -- and the child too i know well a couple who live together long enough to have grow child for nearly a score of year they pull like a pair of balky horse -- what time they be not do the monkey and parrot act the husband stay out night and tipple the wife sit at home and feel virtuous finally the woman work up spunk enough to do what she have be die to do for year she pack up and left now she be happily marry to a man she can pull _ with _ and he be marry to another woman who pull with he she have quit feeling virtuous and he have quit tipple they be both prosper financially the child have _ two _ pleasant home and more educational and other advantage than they ever dare hope for everyone of the family be _ glad _ of that separation the family be a institution of man 's own make it be a good and glorious thing so long as it serve to increase the happiness and health of its member but whenever the family institution have to be maintain at the expense of the life liberty or happiness of its member it be time to lay that particular institution on the shelf what god do not hold together by love let not man try to paste together by law one great cause of the increase of divorce be the financial emancipation of woman woman can now get out and take care of themselves where a few year ago they have to grin and bear it or bear it without grin if the new thought mean anything brother wing it mean that every individual man or woman have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness wherever and with whom he choose to seek it so long as he or she do not attempt to abridge the same rights for other it mean that a woman be as much a individual as a man and must stand or fall hold she husband or lose he _ on she own merit _ the new thought deal with individual regardless of sex marriage be a partnership subject in the eye of justice to the same rule which govern other partnership let we be just to the deserter be he man or woman before we be sentimentally generous to the desert and do not let we be _ too _ sure that we know all the fact in these separation case it be human nature to fix up outward appearance for the benefit of the passer-by seek rather to _ understand _ condemn not have any one tell you it be lucky to be marry i hasten to inform you it be just as lucky to be divorce and i know it chapter xiv the old old story this be the springtime when fancy lightly turn to

already leave they husband -lrb- -rrb- and want to know whether or not they should go back or go on to one such i write the following letter which i publish in the hope that it will help other to find and follow _ themselves _ here be the letter : one thing at a time get off with the old love before you go fret about a new one do not you think you be a silly girl to ask _ anybody 's _ advice as to whether or not you be to go back to you so-called husband if _ i _ know what _ you _ ought to do i do not see what _ you _ be worth to yourself or the universe the truth be that you be the only person in creation who can make that decision if you do not yet _ know _ that you have a right to make you own life as you see fit if you do not yet _ know _ whether or not you could go back to he then _ be still _ until you _ do _ know you know thing today that you do not know yesterday and tomorrow you will know thing you can not decide about today so attend strictly to business and keep still and stiller yet until you know what be best to do then do it so much for the old love as to the new one not even _ you _ can know for certain whether that other man would pan out the soul mate you now imagine he but the law of love or attraction will _ prove _ whether or not he be what you think _ you own _ will come to you and all creation can not hinder it -- if you keep that man be not what i long for a real comrade sweet and cool and free in you own mind and make the best of this day as it come along age ago i have a similar experience to yours i find the only and original one intend for I but i be tie to another man -- not by a ceremony for that tie nobody but by my own conscience which compel I to stand by the man i think need I so i stand though i think my heart be break in a few year i find that my soul mate be no mate at all -- i would not have have he as a gracious gift i feel like ben franklin who as a barefooted boy resolve that when he grow up and have penny he would buy a stick of red striped peppermint candy but when he grow up and have the penny he do not want the candy i have learn to smile at that experience as the bitterest and sweetest of my past life and the source of volume of wisdom the _ law of attraction know _ and the law keep he from I i afterward find the real comrade and _ more _ than the joy i think i have forever miss we be pretty silly child dearie without the child 's best quality trust just you _ let go _ of everything and everybody and apply yourself to do this hour with _ love _ what you _ hand _ find to do and trust the law to bring
