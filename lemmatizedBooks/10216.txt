god-speed and bon voyage marietta holley new york June 1887 what make the summer it be not the lark 's clear tone cleave the morning air with a soar cry nor the nightingale 's dulcet melody all the balmy night -- not these alone make the sweet sound of summer but the drone of beetle and bee the murmurous hum of the fly and the chirp of the cricket hide out of sight -- these help to make the summer not rose redly blow nor golden lily light the dusky mead nor proud imperial pansy nor queen-cup quaint and rare -- not these alone make the sweet sight of summer but the countless forest leave the myriad wayside weed and slender grass spring up everywhere -- these help to make the summer one heaven bend above the lowliest head ofttime have sweetest rest o'er song-bird in the pine and bee in the ivy low be the same love it be all god 's summer well pleased be he if we patiently do we best so hum little bee and low green grass grow you help to make the summer the brother high on a rocky cliff do once a gray old castle stand from whence rough-bearded chieftain lead they vassal -- rule the land for century have dwell here sire and son till it befall last of they ancient line two brother here alone do dwell the eldest be stern-visaged but the youngest smooth and fair of countenance both zealous man who bent the knee in prayer to god alone love much read much he holy word and pray above all gift desire that they might see they lord for this the elder brother carve a silent cell of stone and in its deep and dreary depths he enter dwelt alone and strive with scourging vigil fast to purify he gaze and seek amidst these shadow to behold the master 's face and from the love of god that smile on we from bright lipped flower and from the smile of god that fall in sunlight 's golden shower that thrill earth 's slumbering heart so where its warm ray fall that it laugh out in beauty turn he as from tempter all from bird-song run morn 's sweet-scented chalice o'er with cheer the child 's light laughter lifting lowliest soul heaven near from tear and glad smile link light and gloom of the golden day he count these temptation all austerely turn away and thus he live alone unblest and die unblest alone save for a brother monk who hold the carve cross of stone in he cold rigid clasp the while he die eye do wear a look of mortal strive mortal agony and prayer though at the very last as he stiff finger drop the cross a gleam as from some distant city sweep he face across the clay lip settle into calm -- thus do the monk attest a look of one who through much peril enter into rest not thus do he the younger brother seek the master 's face but in earth 's lowly place do he strive he step to trace wherever want and grief besought with clamorous complaint there he behold he lord -- naked athirst and faint and when he hand be wet with tear wring with a grateful grasp he lightly feel upon he palm the elder brother 's clasp and when above the loathsome couch of woe and want bent he a low voice thrill he soul so have ye do it unto I despise he not the mystic tie of blood yet do he claim the broader wider brotherhood with every race and name to he own kin he kind and loyal be in truth yet still he mother and he brethren be all who do god 's will all little one be dear to he for light from paradise seem fall on he through they pure and innocent eye the very flower that fringe cool stream and gemm the dewy sod to he rapt vision seem like the visible smile of god the deep 's full heart that throb uncease against the silent ship the wave together murmur with weird mysterious lip to hear they untranslated psalm draw down he anointed ear and listen lo he hear god 's voice to he be he so near the happy hum of bee to he make summer silence sweet not lightly do he view the very grass beneath he foot it pave he presence-chamber where he walk a happy guest ah slight the veil between in very truth he life be blest and when on a still twilight pass he to the summer land those whom he have befriend weep cling to he hand the west gleam with a sudden glory and from out the glow tremble the semblance of a crown and rest on he brow and with wide eager eye he smile and stretch he hand abroad as if he dearest friend be welcome he to he abode eternal silence seal that wondrous smile as he cry -- thy face thy face dear lord and say this he die but legend tell that on he grave fall such a strange pure light that wine-red rose plant thereupon would spring up white hold such mystic healing in they cool snow bloom that lie on ache brow or sorrowful heart they would ease they pain a rich man 's reverie the year go by but they little seem like those within we dream the year that stand in such lure guise beckon we into paradise to jailer turn as time go by guard that fair land by-and-by where we think to blissfully rest the sound of whose forest ' balmy leaf sway to dream wind strangely sweet we hear in we bed ` neath the cottage eave whose tower we see in the western sky when with eager eye and tremulous lip we watch the silent silver ship of the crescent moon sailing out and away o'er the land we would reach some day some day but year have fly and we weary foot have never reach that isle of the blest but care we have feel and a ache breast a lifelong struggle grief unrest that have no part in we boyish plan and yet i have gold and house and land and ladened vessel a white-winged fleet that fly at my bidding across the sea and hat be doff by willing hand as i tread the village street but wealth and fame be not to I what i think that they would be i turn from it all to wander back with memory down the dusty track of the year that lie between to the farm-house old and brown shaded with poplar dusky green i pause at its gate not a bearded man but a boy with earnest eye i stand at the gate and look around at the fresh fair world that before I lie the misty mountain-top aglow with love of the sun and the pleasant ground asleep at its foot with sunny dream of milk-white flower in its heart and clear the tall church-spire in the distance gleam point up to the tranquil sky 's blue roof that seem so near and up from the wood the morning breeze come freight with all the rich perfume that from myriad spicy cup distil loitering along o'er the locust-tree scatter down the plum-tree ' bloom in flake of crimson snow -- down on the gold of the daffodil that border the path below and the silver thread of the rivulet tangled and knot with fern and sedge and the mill-pond like a diamond set in the streamlet 's emerald edge and over the stream on the gradual hill its headstone glimmer palely white be the graveyard quiet and still i wade through its grass rank and deep past slanting marble mossy and dim carven with line from some old hymn to one where my mother use to lean on Sunday noon and weep that tall white shape i look upon with a mysterious dread link unto the senseless stone the image of the dead -- the father i never have see i remember on dark night of storm when we parlor be bright and warm i would turn away from its glowing light and look far out in the churchyard dim and with infinite pity think of he shut out alone in the dismal night and the ruin mill by the waterfall i see again its crumble wall and i hear the water 's song it all come back to I -- its song come back to I float out like a spirit 's call the drowsy air along blend forever with my name wonderful prophecy dreamy talk of future path when i should walk crown with manhood and honor and fame i shut my eye and the rich perfume of the tropical lily fill the room from its censer of frosted snow but it seem to float to I through the night from those apple-blossom red and white that star the orchard 's fragrant gloom those old bough hang low where my sister 's swing sway to and fro through the scented aisle of the air while she merry voice and she laugh ring out like a bird 's to answer my brother 's shout as he shake the bough o'er she curly head till the blossom fall in a rosy rain on she neck and she shine hair oh little belle oh little sister i love so well it seem to I almost as if she die in that lose time so gay and fair and be bury in childhood 's sunny plain and she who walk the street to-day or in gilded carriage sweep through the town stare she humbler sister down with she jewel gleam like lucent flame proud of she grandeur and fine array be only a stranger who bear she name and the little boy who play with I hunting bird ' - nest in sheltered nook trudge at nightfall after the cow explore the barn-loft ford the brook end in school-time puzzle brow over the same small lesson book who kneel by my side in the twilight dim pray the lord we soul to keep then on the same pillow fall asleep hush by we mother 's evening hymn whose heart and mine keep such perfect time such loving cadence such tender rhyme blent in child grief and perfect in glee -- we meet on the street and we clasp the hand and we name on charitable papers stand side by side and we go and bow we two gray head with prayer and vow in the same grand church and hasty word of anger have never we bosom stir yet a whole wide world be between we now how broad and deep do the gulf appear between the heart that be so near i have pleasure grounds and mansion grand low-voiced servant come at my call from senate my name sound over the land in aye and nay so solemnly read they call I honorable general and all but to-night i be only charley again i be charley and want to lay my head on my mother 's heart and rest with she soft hand press upon my brow cure its weary pain but never nevermore will it be for mould and marble rise now between my head and that loving breast and death have a cruel power to part -- forever go and lose to I that true and tender heart oh mother i have never find love like thine never have eye look into mine with such proud love such perfect trust never have hand be so true and kind to lead I into the path of right -- hand so gentle and soft and white that on my head like a blessing lay and lead I a child and guide my youth to-night ` tis a dreary thought in truth that those gentle hand be dust that i may be blame and you not be sad that i may be praise and you not be glad ` tis a dreary thought to you boy to-night that over you sweet smile over you brow the clay-cold turf be press now that never again as the twilight fall you will welcome you boy to the old brown wall of the homestead far away the homestead be ruin -- go to decay but we read of a house not make with hand whose firm foundation forever stand and there be a twilight soft and sweet will she not stand with outstretched hand my homesick eye to meet -- to welcome she boy as in day before to home and to rest forevermore but the year come and the year go and they lay on she grave as they silently pass red summer bud and wreath of snow and spring and fading grass and far away in a english town in the secluded tranquil shade of a old cathedral quaint and brown another grave be make -- a small grave yet so high it shadow all the world to I and darkened earth and sky but only for a time it pass the unreasoning agony like a cloud that drop its rain and light shone into we heart at last and patience bear of pain and now like a breath of healing balm the sweet thought come to I that my child have reach the isle of calm over the silent sea -- that my pure little blanche be safe in truth safe in immortal beauty and youth when she leave we in the twilight gloom when she leave she empty nest and the ache heart below full well full well i know what tender-eyed angel bent down for my brown-eyed little bird from the shine battlement i know with what fond caressing and loving smile and word and look of tender blessing she take she to she breast and lead she into some quiet room in the mansion of the blest oh mother beloved oh child so dear not by a wish would i lure you here my son be a bright brave boy with a grace of beauty catch from he mother 's face and he mother and he in truth be dear full tenderly and fond and near my heart be bind to my wife and child but the summer of life be not its may and dream and hope that we youth beguile be but pallid form of clay there be the boy 's first love and passionate dream a face like a morning star a gleam of hair the hue of a robin 's wing -- brown hair aglow with a golden sheen and eye the sweetest that ever be see mary we have be part long you be proud and we both be wrong but ` tis over and past no living gleam can come again to the dear dead dream it be dead so let it lie but nothing nothing can ever be like that old dream to you or to I i think we shall know shall know at last all that be strange in all the past shall one day know and shall haply see that the sorrow and ill that with tear and sigh we vainly endeavor to flee be angel who veil in sorrow 's guise come to we only to bless maybe we shall kneel and kiss they foot with grateful tear when we shall meet they unveil face pure and sweet they eye ' deep tenderness we shall know perchance have these angel come like mendicant unto a kingly gate when we sit in joy 's royal state we have bar they from we home but when in we doorway one appear clothe in the purple of sorrow 's power he will enter in no prayer or tear avail we in that hour so what we call we pain and loss we may not always count aright the rough bar of we heavy cross may change to live light glorium the true gayly a knight set forth against the foe for a fair face have shine on he in dream a voice have stir the silence of he sleep go win the battle and i will be thine so for the love of those appeal eye lead by low accent of fair glorium 's voice he wind the bugle down he castle 's steep and gayly ride to battle in the morn and none be braver in the tented field like lightning herald the doomful bolt the enemy behold he snowy plume and death-light flash along he glance spear but in the lonesome watch of the night a angel come and warn he with clear voice against high god he rash right arm be raise be rashly raise against the true the right he strive to drown the angel voice with song and merry laughter with he princely peer but still the angel bid he with clear voice go join the rank you rashly have oppose oh angel cry he they be few and weak they may not stand before the press of knight but still the angel bid he with clear voice go help the weak against the mighty wrong at last the word sink deep within he heart with god-like courage cry he out at last oh glorium beautiful i can lose thee lose life and thee to battle for the right and when he join the brave and stalwart rank like saul amid he brethren he stand braver and seemlier than all he peer and nobly do he battle for the right gentlest unto the weak and in the fray so dauntless none -- no fear of man have he he work dismay in error 's blacken rank so nobly do he battle for the right but at the last he lay on a lose field couch on a broken spear he pallid lay with die lip he murmur glorium 's name the field be lose and thou art lose to I when lo she stand beside he pure and fair with tender eye that bless he as he lay and lo she kneel and clasp he die hand and murmur i be thine be thine at last with wonder eye he moan all -- all be lose and i be die ah not so she cry nothing be lose to he who dare be true who give he life shall find it evermore methought i see the spear beat down like grain and the rank reel before the press of knight the level ground run gory with we wound methought the field be lose and then i fall be calm she cry the right be never lose though spear and shield and cross may shatter be out of they dust shall spring avenge blade that yet shall rid we of some giant wrong and all the blood that fall in righteous cause each crimson drop shall nourish snowy flower and quicken golden grain bright sheaf of good that under happier sky shall yet be reap when right oppose wrong shall evil win nay never -- but the year of god be long and you be weary rest ye now in peace for so he giveth he beloved sleep he smile and murmur low i be content with blissful tear that hide the battle 's loss so hold to she true heart he close he eye in quietest rest that ever he have know the deacon 's daughter the spare-room window wide be raise and you could look that summer day on pasture green and sunny hill and low rill wander away near by the square front yard be sweet with rose and caraway upon a couch draw near the light the deacon 's only daughter lay bend upon the distant hill she eye of dark and thoughtful gray the blue vein on she forehead shine 'twa waste so away she move and from she slender hand fall off she mother 's wedding-ring she smile into she father 's face -- so drop from I each earthly thing my hand be free to hold the flower of the eternal spring she have ever walk in quiet way not over bed of flowery ease but sunday in the village choir she sweetly sing of way of peace of way of peace and pleasantness she tread such path as these no sweeter voice in all the choir praise god in innocence and truth the deacon in he straight-backed pew have dream of she he lose in youth and thought of fair-faced hebrew maid -- of rachel and of ruth but she have fade day by day grow more mild and pure and sweet as nearer to she ear there come a distant sea 's mysterious beat till now this summer afternoon its water touch she foot upon the paint porch without two woman stand and whisper low they think she would go out with the day they say the deacon 's wife go so and then they gently pity he -- it be a dreadful blow but she be good she be prepare she would be better off than here and then they think 'twa strange that he she father have not shed a tear and then they talk of news and all the promise of the year she father sit beside the bed hold she cold hand tenderly and to the everlasting hill he mutely turn he eye away : my god my shelter and my rock oh shadow I to-day he know not when she cross the stream and pass into the land unseen so gently do she go from he into its pasture still and

glance and song into my shine net provokingly cold at first he seem like crystal to smile and sigh but at last he feel the magic that gleam in my dreamy violet eye and i lead he on and on farther in truth than i strove for he frighten I with the earnestness and violence of he love these calm-eyed man deceive -- have i know the man have a heart i would have pause i would i believe have act a different part in he royal indignation he utter some wholesome truth -- he almost rouse the emotion that die in my innocent youth emotion that live when life be new ere that man my pathway cross who

shine northward far as eye could reach southward a rocky bluff rise high break in wild fantastic shape near by one jagged rock tower high and o'er the water lean like giant grim strive to peer into the mystery the ocean whisper of continually and cover with she soft treacherous face for the rest the sun be sink low like a great golden globe into the sea above the rock a bird be fly in dizzy circle with shrill cry and on a plank float from some wreck with shred of musty seaweed cling to it yet a woman sit hold a child within she arm a sweet-faced woman -- look out to sea with dark patient eye and singing to the child and this the song she in the sunset sing : thine eye be brown my beauty brown and bright drowned deep in languor now the angel sleep be clasp thee within she arm so white

the east and slowly rise -- the silver crescent of the moon another paler light than the warm sunset glow but clear enough to guide she home the land of long ago now while the crimson light fade in the west and twilight drop she purple shadow low -- we stand with memory on the mountain 's crest that overlook the land of long ago unmoved and still the form beside we stand while mournful tear we heavy eye o'erflow as silently he lift he shadowy hand and point we to the land of long ago it lie in beauty ` neath we sad eye ' range bath in a richer light a warmer glow for fairer moon and sunset

land as long ago we see the gleaming spire of those high hall we garnish with bright gem and precious show no foot within the gilded doorway fall empty the room within the long ago troops of white dove still haunt the shine tower and fold in blissful calm they wing of snow we bid they build they nest in brighter bower but still they linger in the long ago there in its sunny bay stand stately

like he of normandy and die with sword unstained that have lead we to victory sometime on the shore i sit and gaze out on the twilight sea for my ship may come though many day i have wait patiently with wait trust eye a lonely watch i keep for its silver sail to rise like a blossom out of the deep it be build of a costly wood bear the strange perfume of the gorgeous solitude where it grow in tropical gloom and the odorous scent the spicy balm of its isle it will bear to I as i stand on the shore in the magic calm and my ship come in from sea it be laden with all that be sweet of the beauty of every clime slowly and proudly ` twill glide to my foot in the eve of that fair sometime before I its sail will be furl a princess i shall be crown with the wealth of the world when my ship come in from sea sweet face i then shall see tender undoubting true soft hand will be stretch to I with a welcome i never know in the peace of such tenderness i shall rest forevermore and weep in my perfect bliss as i never weep before sometimes i think it be not far and i bend my head and list for i think i see a slender spar gleam through the golden mist and i fancy i hear the sound of wind in a silken sail and a odor rare from eastern ground float in on the languid gale but i sit and watch the west till the sun go down in vain it be only a cloud with a ivory crest a cloud of vapor and rain it rise and hide the sea and my heart grow chill and numb lest this terrible thing should be that my ship will never come but the morn be bright -- the wave be a golden and shine track softly the water the white sand lave and my trusting faith come back oh all that i ever lose and all that i long to be will be mine when the deep be cross and my ship come home from sea motive i say that i would see she once to curse she fair deceitful grace to curse she for my life-long agony but when i see she face i say sweet christ forgive both she and I high swell the chant hymn low on the marble sweep the velvet pall i bent above and my eye grow dim my sad heart see it all -- she love I love I though she wed he and then shoot through my soul a thrill of fierce delight to think that he must yield

come to she through woe say she have find rest at last and i i must not love she now it may be in heaven 's grace beneath the shade of some immortal palm that god will let I see she angel face then wild wild heart be calm wipe out that old love every sorrowful trace i know that if it be we two should meet again in paradise ` twould trouble she pure soul if she should see the old grief in my eye ` twould grieve she dear heart through eternity wipe out that grief my soul and shall i lose all love in lose this unclasp my spirit self 's close stolid steal be there no life to bless so will i give my love my life no stinted dole god will note deed and sigh thron in far splendor on the heavenly hill though mad sound from this wretched planet rise -- moan wild enough to fill heaven 's air and drown its harp in doleful cry and angel shall look down through incense rise from my godly deed approve gleam those eye of tender brown sure on a brow that bleed the thorn should change to a more glorious crown well do my soul well do out of thy grief to rear a ladder tall to reach the land that lie beyond the sun to scale the jasper wall and rise to glory on grief 's step stone god look into the tide angel and demon trouble of a man 's mind and if my alms be scatter far and wide only my love to find only to pave a path to reach she side -- will he accept from I my worship gift -- the

-- in the curl of he princely lip in he slightly insolent eyelid in he pointed finger-tip very erect and grand look the squire as he walk o'er he broad estate for he feel that the earth be honor in bear he honorable weight proudly he stroll through he wooded park deer-haunted and gloomily grand or gaze from he pillared portico on he far-outlying land in a tiny whitewashed cottage half-covered with rose wild he cheerful-faced old gardener dwelt alone with he motherless child the squire own the very floor he tread the grass in he garden lot the poor man have only this one little lamb yet he envy the rich man not poor be the gardener yet rich withal in this priceless pearl of a girl so perfect a form so faultless a face never brighten the hall of a earl she eye be two fathomless star of light and they shine on the squire day by day till they warm and perilous splendor so melted he pride away that he fain would have take this pretty pet lamb to dwell in he stately fold to fetter it fast with a jeweled chain and cage it with bar of gold but this coy little lamb love its freedom not so free be she though to be true but oh the dainty and shy little lamb well she master 's voice she know 'twa vain for the squire the story to tell of he riches and high descent as it fall into one rosy shell of a ear out of its mate it go how one grim old ancestor into the land with william the conqueror come she think the sweet of a conqueror she know with that very name so in this tender conflict the great man be force to yield to the handsome sunburnt ploughman who sow and reap in he field for vainly he pour out he glitter gift vainly he plead and beseech she heart be a tender and soft little heart but it be not a heart to be buy so strange a thing i warrant you happen not every day that the pride that have thrive for century one slight little maiden should slay why the proud squire 's roman feature quiver and burn with shame and the picture of he grim ancestor blush in its antique frame be this a romance a idle tale the squire would sicken and die slay by the pitiless cruelty of she dark and dazzling eye and she in some shadowy convent would bow she beautiful head but the hand that should have tell penitent bead wear a plain gold ring instead and he not twice have he oak tree bloom ere he wed a lady grand whose tall and towering family tree have for age darken the

to muse o'er they musty name and to think that he child 's brain should be move by the sanguine current that have fly through such ancient vein but i think sometimes in he secret heart the squire breathe woeful sigh for the fresh sweet face of the little maid with the dark and wonderful eye but she no bird ever sing such song to its mate from contented nest as this wee wait wife when the twilight be tread the glorious west as she look through the clustering rose for the manly form that would come up through the cool green evening field to this sweet little wife and home she could see

see the maiden 's face and think she beauty would grace he stately southern home so he take she there with picture from france and statue from rome and marvellous work of art from many a ancient place

easy task she plead spirit 's restless wing to fold the wise world call she blest so heart be still she have beauty and splendor and youth and a husband calmly kind and crowd of flattering friend she lofty mansion line and dark-browed slave await she queenly will why should she dream of the past of the day of old of she childhood home and more oft of the home of the dead of the grave where she go alone the night before she be wed and kneel with she pure cheek press to the marble cold it be not sin she say that those eye of darkest blue haunt she dream more wildly from day to day since they look on heaven now and she be so far away she could love the dead and still be to the living true she could think of he the one who love she best of he who true have be if all the world deceive who feel all grief with she when she be grieve and share each joy that thrill she girlish breast it be not sin that she hear that voice gentle and deep and the echo of a name -- it be cut in marble now -- so it be not sin she say as she breathe it low in the midnight hour when all but she be asleep but she wearier grow of pride and pomp like a home sick child she pine and paler grow she cheek as worn with a wear pain she say the fresh free country air would seem so sweet again so she go to she childhood home as a pilgrim go to a shrine and she look down the orchard path and the meadow 's clover bloom she stand by the stone-walled well that have mirror she face when a child she see where the robin build and she rose clamber wild and linger lose in think in each low and rustic room and she sit in the cottage door while the fair June moon look down on a face as pure as its own a innocent face and sweet as the rose wet with dew that grow so thick at she foot white royal rose fit for a monarch 's crown but at night when silence and sleep on the lonely hamlet fall like a spirit clothe in white through the graveyard gate she pass and the star bent down to hear i have come to you love at last while through the valley solemnly sound the midnight bell and she southern bird will wait she come in vain they starry eye impatiently pierce the palm-tree ' shade and she rose droop in they bower alone they 'll wither and fade rose of June you be go but we know you will blossom again magdalena who falsely call thee destroyer still white angel of death oh not a destroyer here but a kind restorer thou for the guilty look be go die out with she fail breath and the sinless peace of a babe have come to lip and brow drown in the heave tide with she life be she burden of woe the dreary weight of sin the woeful troublesome year the cold pure touch of the water have wash the shame from she brow leave a calm immortal that look like the chrism of peace i fancy she smile be like this as she pull at she mother 's gown draw she out with childish finger to watch the red of the sky on the old brown doorstep of home while the peaceful sun go down with she mother 's hand on she brow and the glow of the west in she eye a outcast vile and lose you say yes she go astray astray when the crimson wine of life run fresh and wild with mother 's tender hand no more on she brow put away the grass beneath and she be alone and almost a child like a kid decoy to its death the stealthy panther lure mock the voice of its dam thus he lead the innocent child through she tenderness down to ruin he be a friend of yours and admire by all as you say man will be wild but i wonder if god so far above on he great white throne the clanging tumult of trouble and doubt that mortal vex when the murmur of a crime sweep up from earth with woeful moan if he pause ere he condemn to ask the offender 's sex and if so whether the weaker or stronger he blame the most the tempter or tempt a tithe of he tender compassion claim whether the selfish or too unselfish those who through love or lust be lose he in he infinite wisdom and mercy most condemn frown not i know she evil we womanly nature shun turn from with shudder horror but now so low be she head for god 's sake woman remember you own little one lie safely at home in they snow-white sheltered bed you own little girl for they do the flame of you anger burn such creature will draw down innocence into guilt and woe i think from eternity vast she will scarcely return to entice they to sin you can safely forgive she now you will not countenance wrong but fiercely war for the right even unto the bitter death very good you should do so but my friend if you own secret thought have blossom to light in temptation you might have be in this outcast 's place you know so let we be pitiful grateful that god 's strong hand have hold we own and the tale of a woman 's despair and penitent sin he stoop and write in the perish sand we carve the record in stone weak sinful soul that we be in the arm of the kind all-mother but close to the sorrowful wave with its voice no longer moan to she a despairing call but a dirge deplore and deep we will make she grave with healing grass above she and god over all my angel last night she come unto I and kneel by my side lay she head upon my bosom my beautiful my bride my lose one with she soft dark eye and wave of sunny hair i smooth the shine tress with tearful fond caress and word of thankful prayer and then a thrill of doubt and pain my jealous heart sweep o'er we be part -- she be

picture shaded wondrously quiet landscape sweet and lonely silvery sea and shadowy glade forest lake by man forsake where the white fawn 's step be stay and contadino stray ` neath the pantheon 's solemn shade and we see the wave bridge over by the moonlight 's mystic link desert well by tall palm shaded where dusky camel drink while dark-eyed arab maiden fill they pitcher at the brink and secluded convent chapel where veil nun kneel to pray with a dim light streaming o'er they through arch quaint and gray while down the long and wind aisle low music die away there be a starry twilight of the soul as sadly fair when we wild emotion be at rest like the pale nun at prayer and we grief be hush like sleeper and put off the robe of care the sewing-girl i ask to see the dead man 's face as i give the servant my well-filled basket and she deign to lead I a wondrous grace where he lay asleep in he rosewood casket i be only the sewing-girl and he the heir to this princely palace flower

least brown curl for i be only the sewing-girl if he stately mother know what i know as she weep stand by he side this morning would she clasp I in motherly love and woe -- or drive I out in the cold with scorn if she know that i love he better than life better than death since for he i give my hope of rest that i face life 's strife and renounce the quiet and restful grave when he strong true hand draw I back that day when woe and want and the want of pity drive I down where the cold wave lay like wolf round the wall of this cruel city not much would she say with she proud lip 's curl -- only the life of a sewing-girl now love for I in he heart do linger -- i see the lady he promise bride i see he ring on she slender finger as she weep stand by he mother 's side that same ring shone as he lift I drip and cold from the sea-waves bitter i have think heaven 's light i next should see but earth 's sun shone in its ruby glitter i have think when i look in the lord 's mild face that he would forgive my rashness and sin when he know there be not a single place not a place so small that i could creep in and i want a home and i long for love and god and mother be both above but he show I my sin and teach I to live above this life of tumult and whirl though i be only a sewing-girl what shall i do with the life he win from death that day in a hard-won battle shall i lay it down e'er the rise sun look down on the city 's roar and rattle shall i lay it down e'er the midnight dim with horrible shadow be roof and pave no i will make it so pure and sweet that angel shall say with smile to he when we meet above on the golden street : behold the soul of she you save maybe it shall add to he crown one pearl though only the soul of a sewing-girl harry the first in he arm-chair

soft page be lie fold closely to she bosom a little farther go he auntie aged fourteen -- age of fancy she look down the future age with she wise prophetic vision see the baby pass before she baby of the twentieth century all the long and dusty age to the thousand year of glory oh the host of bright-eyed child throng like the star at midnight face sweet and countless as the rose-leaf of a thousand summer all the pretty head so curly that shall hold a riper wisdom than we youthful planet dream of all the rank of dimple shoulder that shall move time 's roll chariot nearer to the golden city

wealth of flower flower of every form and color orange crimson royal purple all along the mountain pass all along the pleasant valley low the emerald branch bendeth with they weight of summer glory but they do not waken in we half the tender blissful feeling half the pure and sweet emotion as the first spring-flower in April with its lash tinge with crimson partly raise from eye half-timid fearful that the snow will drown it how we love the dainty blossom how we wear it in we bosom just so with the tree ancestral many flower may blossom on it but the first wee bud that be graft to its heart ah how we love it other may be love as fondly but they be not love so proudly love so blindly so entirely yes when first the heart 's door open to the touch of baby finger quick the dimpled foot will bear they to the dearest place and warmest plenty room enough for other bud of beauty bud of promise in the heart 's capacious chamber but the first be firmly settle -- little harry 's firmly

then no more just once as fond friend watch the fading sail bear away a guest of truest worth they give this little time to grief and then return to they desolate hearth and build new fire and gather dewy flower let the pure air into the vacant room so light and bloom and sweetness all shall penetrate its gloom i will be patient in a little time quiet and full of rest god 's peace will come and like a soft-winged bird settle upon my breast not always thus shall beat my restless heart like a wild eagle ` gainst its prison-bar in some calm twilight of the future time i will sit calm-browed underneath the star go before smooth the hair silken wave of sunny brown lay upon the white brow down crown with the blossom rare lily on a golden stream ne'er to float in summer air wreathe with meadow daisy fair lay away the broken crown and you broken dream with one shine tress of hair nevermore to need you care a woman 's heart my heart sing like a bird to-night that fly to its nest in the soft twilight and sing in its brooding bliss ah i so low and he so high what could he find to love i cry do ever love stoop so low as this as a miser jealously count he gold i sit and dream of my wealth untold from the curious world apart too sacred my joy for another eye i treasure it tenderly silently and hide it away in my heart dearer to I than the costliest crown that ever on queenly forehead shone be the kiss he leave on my brow would i change he smile for a royal gem he love for a monarch 's diadem change it ah no ah no my heart sing like a bird to-night that fly away to its nest of light to brood o'er its living bliss ah i so low and he so high what could he find to love i cry do ever love stoop so low as this warning when enwrap in rosy pleasure we careless pulse beat with a rhythm sweet sweet to the music 's merry measure when world wave rise around we with soft transparent weight light in seem yet so great the liquid chain have bind we then softly downward fall if we listen we can hear from a purer atmosphere a warning and a call ` tis not utter to we ear to we spirit it be speak in the wonderful unbroken heavenly speech that spirit hear strange and solemn doth it roll downward like a yearning cry from that belfry far on high warning call to we soul ever ever doth it roll we angel guard the tower ringing ring every hour warning call to we soul genieve to she lover i turn the key in this idle hour of a ivory box and look lo -- see only dust -- the dust of a flower the water will ebb the water will flow and dream will come and dream will go forever oh friend if you and i should meet beneath the bough of the bend lime should you in the same low voice repeat the tender word of the old love rhyme it could not bring back the same old time never when you lay this rise against my brow i be quite unused to the way of man with my trusting heart i be wiser now so i smile remember my heart-throb then the dust of a rose can not blossom again never the brow that you praise have colder grown and heart will change i suppose they must a rise to be last should blossom in stone ash to ash dust to dust dead be the rise the love and the trust forever the wild rose in a waste of yellow sand on the brow of a dreary hill a slight little slip of a rose struggle up to the light the seed maybe be sow there by the south wind 's idle will but there it grow and blossom pale and white only one flower it bear and that be frail and small but i think it be brave to try to grow at all in grove of fair cashmere or sheltered garden of king sweet with a thousand flower with bird of paradise fan she blushing cheek with they glowing wing praise she deepen bloom with they great bright eye life would have be a pleasure instead of a toil to my pale little patient rise of the sandy soil do she ever sadly think of she waste life folding she wan weak hand so helpless and still and the great oak by she shelter glad bird life and the thirsty meadow praise the run rill she could hear the happy work-day song of the busy brook while she poor thing could only stand and look do the wee white rise ever think of she lonely life that there be none to care if she try to grow none to care if the cloud that hang in the west should burst and scatter she pale leaf far and low do she ever wish that the heavy cloud would fall and hide she so unblest from the sight of all one sky bend o'er rich garden flower and those that dwell in barren soil untended and unblest and i think that god be please with the small white rise that try so patiently to live and do its best that bravely keep its small leaf pure and fair on the waste of dreary sand and the desert air we bird she lay asleep and she face shine white as under a snowy veil and the waxen hand clasp on she breast be full of snowdrop pale but a holy calm touch the baby lip the brow and the sleep eye the look of a angel pity we from the peace of paradise and now though she lie ` neath the coffin-lid we can not think she dead but we think of she as of some delicate bird to a milder country flee 'twa a long dark flight for we gentle dive we bird so tender and fair but we know she have reach the summer land and fold she white wing there the time that be to be i be thinking of fern forest that once do towering stand crowning all the barren mountain shade all the dreary land oh the dreadful quiet brood the solitude sublime that reign like shadowy spectre o'er the third great day of time in long low line the tideless sea on dull gray shore do break no song of bird no gleam of wing o'er wood or reedy lake -- no flower perfumed the pulseless air no star no moon no sun to tell in silver language night be past or day be do only silence rise with the ghostly morning 's misty light silence silence settle down upon the moonless starless night and the fern and giant moss noiseless sentinel do stand look o'er the tideless ocean watch o'er the dreary land fern give place to glowing olive and cluster drop wine moss change to oaken tissue and cleft to fragrant pine deft and noiseless finger toil and work the great creator 's plan through countless age mould earth for the abode of man till each imperial day be bind by sunset 's crimson bar the purple column of the night crown with the shine star the ripe fruit seek the sunlight through all the clustering leave the earth be deck with golden maize and costly yellow sheaf countless silent century pass in fashion good that doth appear shall we weary and grow hopeless wait for the golden year \* \* \* \* \* thy kingdom come in which thy will be do from myriad soul rise the yearning cry scatter palm-bough -- behold a brighter sun shall dawn in splendor in a clearer sky upon the distant hill a glow we see that tell we of the time that be to be the desert then shall blossom like the rise the almond flourish on the rocky slope wisdom and beauty in rare union close make earth beautiful beyond we hope high in the dusky east a star we see a herald of the time that be to be the free-born soul shall not be captive then bind by decay cord of narrow creed god 's image shall more clearly shine in man divinely shape by holy aim and deed gleam golden star oh gleam o'er earth and sea a herald of the time that be to be fetter be break so the fern-leaves fall a richer growth be bud wondrous fair the flower of liberty shall bloom for all and all shall breathe the healing of the air the bless air that wrap a people free within that glorious time that be to be for what be slavery but woe and crime and freedom be but liberty from these oh perfect hour ye come fair and sublime bear the sweet form of the baby peace shine golden star oh shine o'er earth and sea a herald of the time that be to be end of the project gutenberg ebook
