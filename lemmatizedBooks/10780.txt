phebe 's good-by xv only a incident to grace hill and edwin c litchfield to she for whose dear sake the story be pen although she eye have never rest upon its page and to he whose tender watch over its growth have be its vital inspiration -- to the two who be but one forever in the heart of they daughter this little first book be most lovingly inscribe only a incodent chapter i joppa joppa be the very center of all thing that be the opening clause in the creed of every well-educated and right-thinking joppite geographically however it be not the center of any thing be considerably off from the great line of railway travel but possess two little independent branch road of its own that connect it with all the world or rather that connect all the world with it for though there be larger place than joppa even in the county in which it condescend to find itself and though new york and philadelphium and even boston be undeniably larger as its inhabitant reluctantly admit when hard press yet they be unanimous in agree nevertheless that the sun rise and set wholly and entirely for the benefit of they one little aristocratic community yes the world be create for joppa that the joppite might live move and have they be with as much convenience and as little trouble as possible bethany a considerable town near by be build to be its shopping emporium galilee a little farther off to accommodate its art need morocco a more considerable town still farther off to be the birthplace of those ancestor who be so unfortunate as to come into the world before there be any joppa to be bear in even new york be erect mainly to furnish it with a place of comfortable resort once a year when it transplant itself there bodily in a clan console itself for its temporary aberration of body by visit exclusively and diligently back and forth among its own people and conform life in all particulars as far as possible to home rule still do when in new york not as the new yorker but as the joppite do and never for a moment abandon its proud position as the one only place in the world worth live in there certainly be much to say in favor of joppa in the first place it be remarkably salubrious its inhabitant die only of old age -- seldom even of that -- or of disease contract wholly in other locality measles have indeed be know to break out there once in the sacred person of the president of the village but have be promptly suppress besides it be universally concede that be in he second childhood he should be consider liable the last epidemic of small-pox even have sweep by they harmless only two old and extremely ugly woman take it whereas bethany and upper jordan be decimate so joppa be decidedly healthy for one thing for another it be moral there have not be a murder hear of in ever so long or a forgery and the last midnight burglar be such a nice simple fellow that he do not know real silver when he see it and run off with the plate ware instead and joppa be not only moral but religious go to church no end of time on sunday and keep as many of the commandment as it conveniently could it have four church : one methodist frequent exclusively by the plebeian one baptist of a mixed congregation one presbyterian where three fourth of the best people go and one episcopal which the best quarter of the best people attend and which among the presbyterian be popularly suppose to be if not exactly the entrance to the infernal region yet certainly only one short step remove from it and add to all these good trait joppa be a beautiful place there be a few common ugly little house in it of course but they be all tuck away out of sight at one end constitute what be know as the village while the real joppa mean in the thought of the inhabitant only the west end so to speak where be a series of pretty villa and commodious mansion run along a broad handsome street and stretch for quite a distance along the border of the lake for oh best of all joppa have a lake to speak of joppa in the presence of a joppite and not in the same breath to mention the lake with a appreciative adjective be to make as irrevocable a mistake as to be in conversation with a poet and forget to quote from he latest poem for next to they wife they dinner and they ease the joppite love they beautiful little lake and they have cause thus to love it for apart from its exquisite charm as the main feature of they landscape it give they a substantial reason for existence what could they have do with they _ dolce far niente _ life but for the fishing and rowing and sailing and bathing and slide and skate which it afford they in turn it be all they have to keep they from settle down into a rip van winkle sleep this dear little restless lake that coax they out of they land-torpor and force they occasionally to lend a manly hand to a manly pursuit for there be this distinguishing peculiarity about joppa that no one in it seem to need to work or to have any manner of business whatever its society outside of the village be form wholly of cultivate refined wealthy people who have nothing in the world to do but idly to eat and drink up the riches of the previous generation it be a widely admit truth that one generation always gather for another never for itself and that the generation which be thus generously gather for be invariably find willing to sacrifice without a murmur any latent duty to harvest on its own account consent to live out its life softly upon the hard-earned savings of its predecessor without regard to posterity and call itself gentleman where its father be content to be know as man so this be joppa a place mighty in its own conceit and high too in the estimate of other to whom it be become know as the gayest and the prettiest of all dear little summer resort and thither stranger be begin to flock in considerable number each year make warmly welcome by the joppite as a occasion for break out into a unending round of party and picnic and dinner and lunch and tea and even breakfast when there be not room to crowd in any thing else the summer be one continual whirl from begin to end there be visitor and visit there be give and receive there be flirtation and rumor of flirtation there be everything the human heart could desire in the way of friendly hospitality and liveliest entertainment saratoga might be well enough and newport would do in its way but for solid perfection say the joppite there be no place in the world quite like joppa but unknown to itself joppa nurse one apostate in its midst one unavowed but benighted little heretic who so far from share these sentiment and offer up nightly thanksgiving that despite she great unworthiness she have be suffer to be bear in joppa make it one of she most fervent and reiterate petition that she might not always have to live there that some time if she be very good and very patient it might be grant she to go she be so weary of it all : of the busy idleness and the idle business of the unthinking gayety and the gay thoughtlessness and of the nothingness that make up its all she want she do not exactly know what only something different and to go she do not quite know where only somewhere else but she have be bear in joppa -lrb- quite without she permission -rrb- and in joppa she have live for all of twenty-four healthful tranquil uneventful year spend semi-occasional winter in new york and unlike all other joppite return always more and more discontented with she native place who could ever have expect such treason in the heart of dear little phebe lane of course it would not have matter much have it be suspect since it be only phebe lane after all who entertain it -- little phebe lane whose ancestor though good and well-born enough do not hail from morocco and who live not in the west end proper but only on the border of it in a street where one could not get so much as a side peep at the lake it be not a pretty house either where she live it be square and clumsy and without any originality and moreover face plump on the street so that one could look right into its parlor and sitting-room window as one stroll along the wooden sidewalk and people be in the habit of look in that way a good deal nothing be ever go on in there that could not bear this sudden outside inspection and it be the shortest way to call phebe when she be want for any thing of a sudden -- to bear a fourth hand at whist or to stone raisin for mr adam the day before she luncheon or to run on a errand down town for some lazy body who prefer other people 's leg to she own for locomotion or to relieve some wearied host in the entertainment of he dull guest or to help in some way or other here there and yonder she be just the one to be call upon of course for she be just the one who be always on hand and always ready to go she never have any thing to keep she at home she father have long be dead and she live alone with she step-mother and step-aunt in the house which be leave she by she mother but in which the present mr lane still rule absolute as she do when she first come into it in phebe 's childish day mr lane be strong and energetic and commonplace and she run the little house from garret to cellar with a thoroughness that leave phebe no part whatever to take in it while the remainder of she energy she devote to nurse she invalid sister miss lydium a little weak complain creature who have have not only every ill that flesh be heir to but a great many ill besides that she be firmly persuade no other flesh have ever inherit and who stand in a awe of she sister sophium only equal by she intense admiration of she so what be there for phebe to do she be fond of music and whistle like a bird but she have no piano and do not know one note from another and she do not care for book which be fortunate as they wee library all tell do not count a hundred volume most of which too be miss lydium 's and be as weak and wishy-washy as that poor little woman herself and she do not care for sew though she make nearly all she own clothes besides attend at any number of impromptu dorca meeting where the needy be the unskilled rich instead of the helpless poor so that of course she labor do not count at all as a virtue since it be not do good but only oblige a friend and she do not care for party though she generally go and be always ask be such a help as regard wall-flower while none of the young girl dread she as a rival it be a well know fact that phebe lane general favorite though she be somehow or other never take with the man or at least not sufficiently to damage any other enterprising girl 's prospects why this be so be hard to say phebe be pretty and lovable and sweet temper if she be not sparkling or witty neither be she sarcastic and bright enough she be certainly though not intellectual and though she talk little save with a few it be strange true as steel possess of that keen sense of justice and honor so strangely lack in many woman with a passionate capability for love and devotion and self-sacrifice beyond power of fathoming and above all with a clinging womanly nature that yearn for affection as a flower long for light she be yet the only girl out of all she set who have never have any especial attention perhaps it be because she be no flirt bell master say no girl could get along who do not flirt perhaps because in she excessive truthfulness she be sometimes blunt and almost brusque it be dreadfully out of place not to be able to lie a little at time even mr upjohn the female lay-head of the presbyterian who be a walk decalogue she every sentence be a law begin with thou shalt not admit practically if not theoretically that without risk of damnation it be possible to swerve occasionally from a too rigid yea and nay perhaps -- ah well there be no use in exhaust the perhaps the fact remain of girl-friend she have plenty and of men-friend she have plenty but of lover she have none and this be why when the rev mr denham halloway be call to the vacant parish of st joseph 's and fall down in its maidenly midst like a meteor from a unexplored heaven -- a young handsome divine in every way marriageable though still unmarried and in every way attractive though still to the best of hope and belief unattracted -- this be why no girl of they all think she own chance lessen in the least when he and phebe become such friend no one gossip no one ah-ah would or oh-oh would no one think twice about it what difference could it make if it have be anybody else now but it be only phebe lane chapter ii phebe miss phebe oh mr halloway hush do not let they know i be here i could not help peeping in as i go by you look do up i be what be go on come in and see

of moral light she must live in but i ought to have be in my study a hour ago i must tear myself away i wish you all ill-luck possible with those stitch ah be that you mr halloway i be wonder what keep phebe so long in the window good-morning sir good-morning sir pray come in and have by a turn of he slow old head discover the young man standing just outside the window mr hardcastle come pompously forward wave he hand in a grand way he have that seem to bespeak he always the proprietor no matter in whose house he chance to be thank you mr hardcastle not this morning i be just tell miss phebe i ought to be at work good-morning mr lane good-morning mr upjohn -- mr hardcastle -- miss delano -- miss brook and with a cheery bow to each individual head crane itself forward to have a look at the unusual young man who have work to do the rev mr halloway walk off to he rectory which be directly opposite give a merry glance back at phebe from the other side of the street phebe be still smile as she go with the stock to its owner thank you my dear say mr hardcastle take it from she without look oh my child how could you be so careless you have let I pull out one of the needle well -- well phebe take the work silently back and sit herself down on a stool to remedy the mischief a nice young fellow enough remark mr hardcastle condescendingly return to the group of lady but he 'll never set the river on fire no need he should be there say mr upjohn look up sharply from she embroidery she always contradict if only for argument 's sake so that even she assent usually take a negative form it be enough if he be able to put out a fire in _ that _ church it do not take much of a man i understand to fill a episcopalian pulpit -lrb- nobody have ever yet be able to teach the good dame the difference between episcopal and episcopalian and she prefer the undivided use of the latter word -rrb- any thing will go down with they yes my dear mrs upjohn it be undeniably a poor church a poor church and i hope we may all live to witness its downfall it must have be a hard day for you mr lane when phebe go over to it i never forgive old mr white for receive she into it i never do indeed phebe only smile humph say mr lane bite off a thread phebe may go where she like for all I so long as only she go baptist i be breed and baptist i 'll be bury but it be with church as with tea i say one 's as good as another but people may take green or black or mixed as best agree with they stomach that be a very dangerous doctrine say mr upjohn push it a little further and you 'll have babe and suckling live on beef and they elder dine on pap humph ejaculate mr lane again if they like it what be the odds he-he snicker miss brook well now resume mr hardcastle it stand to reason child should learn to like what they elder have like before they that be the only decent and christian way of living and as i say to my son -- to my dick you know -lrb- mr hardcastle have a son of whom he always speak as if sole owner of he and indeed solely responsible for he be -rrb- -- ` dick ' i say when he speak disrespectfully of mr webb 's prayer -- and mr webb be a powerful prayer-maker to be sure -- ` dick ' i say ` church be like physic and the more you do not like it the more good it do you and if you think mr webb 's prayer be too long it be a sign that for you soul 's salvation they ought to be longer ' and i say -- mr lane know by long experience that now or never be the time to stop mr hardcastle once fairly start on the subject of he suppose advice to dick on any give occasion there be no arrest he eloquence she start up abruptly from she sewing-machine with she mouth full of pin empty they into she hand as she go those ginger-cookie -- she mumble as she pass mr hardcastle they ought to be do by this a promissory fragrance catch the old gentleman 's nostril as she open the door dispel sterner thought ah he say sniff the air with evident approbation i be about go but i do not mind if i stay and try a few you make phebe no answer phebe shortly move just out of reach of the bland old hand which stretch itself out to chuck she under the chin and be leave pat the air with infinite benevolence mother make they all wrong comment mr upjohn all wrong you should not leave you mother any work that you could spare she one of the first thing i teach we marium -lrb- mr upjohn in mr hardcastle 's presence always say _ we _ marium with great distinctness -rrb- -- one of the first thing i teach she be that it be she privilege to save I in every thing i do not believe in idleness for girl be not you ready yet to attend to these crewel phebe miss brook be snarl they terribly phebe 's really a very good girl in she way though remark mr hardcastle indulgently from she easy chair i will testify that she can make quite eatable cake at a pinch phebe secretly think mr hardcastle ought to know she remember she once spoil a new-made company loaf by slash into it without so much as a by-your-leave that be very nice cake miss lynch give we last night pipe in miss delano too much citron pronounce mr upjohn decisively you should never overload you cake with citron it turn it out heavy as sure as there be a sun in the heaven there be not any to-day it be cloudy phebe could not help put in demurely but no one pay any attention except that mr upjohn turn on she a unworded expression of : if i say so it be so whether or no a animated debate on cake follow in the middle of which mr lane reappear with a trayful of cookie hot from the oven and two more caller come in bell master and dick hardcastle which last first wake up miss lydium with a boisterous kiss frightening the poor soul half to death by assure she she have be snore so that he hear she way down street and then devoted himself to the cookie with a good-will and large capacity that fill one with compassionate feeling toward he mother 's larder with these new and younger element the talk vary a little they discuss last night 's party the supper the dress the people and then the probability of to-night 's party the people the dress the supper and then dick make a sensation by say right out that he have just meet mr upjohn on main street with mr bruce hold a parasol gallantly over she head and everybody look at once at mr upjohn and then back at the graceless dick and a awful silence succeed break by mr upjohn 's reach out she hand and say in the tone of a miss cushman on the stage : dick dear i 'll take another cookie if mr upjohn choose to walk down town shield woman 's complexion for they why in the world should she trouble herself about it beyond make sure that he do not by mistake take she parasol for the kindly office and so the talk go on people come and people go and mr lane do up a whole basketful of work undisturbed and phebe inwardly chafe and fume and long for dinner-time that at last the ceaseless aimless chatter might come to a end she go to the party that night because in joppa everybody have to go when ask to refuse be consider tantamount to a open declaration of war unless in case of illness and then it almost require a doctor 's certificate to get one off it be a good law and ensure the supper be dispose of there be no dancing to-night it be a understand thing that when mr upjohn be ask there should be none or she would not come but there be music bell master have a very nice contralto voice and be always willing to sing thus sure of secure one of joppa 's few young gentleman to stand by and turn over she leaf she thoughtfully take she music on that account give out that she could not play without note phebe have be do she best all unconsciously to herself to help she host entertain but when the singing begin she steal away to the nearly empty piazza and stand lean by the window enjoy the cool air and softly whistle a accompaniment to the song and there mr halloway find she she look up at he and smile as he join she but go on with she low sweet whistle all the same i like that better than the singing he say when at last it come to a end with the music you ought not to mr halloway do not you know it be very unlady-like to whistle mr upjohn put marium to bed for it dear I i must take care she do not ever catch _ I _ at it ah the dress have iron nicely have not it would you mind stand out a little from the shadow phebe move a step forward into the stream of light that shoot across the piazza from the open window and stand so look up at he out of she soft white muslin drapery and white ribbon not a ray of color about she anywhere like a very material and sweet little ghost yes you look very nice very nice indeed he say after a grave inspection that take in every detail of face and figure a young innocent face it be with soft brown hair as bright and as fine as silk all turn back from a low forehead around which it grow in the very prettiest way in the world and gather in loose braid in the neck and she have such a fresh clear complexion and such honest loving gray eye and such a round girlish figure -- how be it people never make more of she prettiness i think you look nicer than any one here mr halloway add in thorough conviction you must be a adept in iron phebe laugh softly in pure pleasure it be so new to have such pretty thing say to she would it be very wrong to slip away together for a rest he continue lead she a little farther along let we sit down on the step here and recruit i have talk my throat hoarse to each of the very deafest old lady in turn -- i suppose they come here purposely to be screech at -- and i see you work valiantly among the old man what a place this be for longevity you be find out its characteristic by degree i see yes be i not say he with he pleasant laugh i know intimately every member of my parish and every member of every other parish by this time from sheer hearsay each house i visit give I no end of valuable and minute information about all the other house i be wait to come out with a rousing sermon against gossip till i shall have gain all possible enlightenment and help from it i must not kill my goose that lay the golden egg before i have all the egg i want must i and know we all so well what do you think of joppa as a whole asked phebe curiously you always say it be too soon to judge but surely you must really know by this time he do not answer for a moment then turn to she very seriously i think he say slowly it be a place that need a much older a much better and a much wiser man than i be to be among its leader in any sense it be not at all what i think it would be when i accept the trust it be beyond I but since the bishop send I here i mean to stay and do my best how will you begin i will begin with you he answer lightly with a smile that light up all he face the moment 's seriousness quite go you be my first friend and i ought to take you first in hand ought i not i be go to do you a great deal of good how i be go to teach you to love book you can not yes i can you do not know book that be all i intend to introduce you to each other i have some so interesting you can not help like they and you 'll find yourself cry for more before you know it i be go to bring they over to you you shall have something better to do than fill up all you morning with promote stocking of exasperating color and listen to tale of sabbath-breaker just wait and see i be go to metamorphose you oh i wish you would sigh phebe clasp she hand and speak so earnestly that he look at she in surprise i be so sick of myself i do want to be something better than i be i be so dreadfully common-place i amount to so little i know so little i can do so little and there be no one here who care to help I to any thing better i do not know enough even to know how to improve myself but i do want to will you help I mr halloway will you really help I she positively have tear shine in she eye mr halloway lean forward and gently take she hand be i not here for that he ask here purposely to help you and all who need I in any way will it not be my greatest pleasure to do so as well as my best and truest work you may be sure miss phebe i will do all i can for you with god 's help rather damp for you to be sit there without a shawl be not it my child it be only mrs anthony 's friendly voice as that lady pass hurriedly by intent on hospitable duty but phebe start guiltily what right have she to be out here with mr halloway keep he from the other girl when she ought of course to be in the parlor see that the old lady get they ice-cream safely i 'll go right in she say rise hastily but mr halloway draw she hand through he arm to detain she why because it be damp no because i ought not to be selfish ought to go back and help ah say he i be get new light every moment then you do not go to party just to enjoy yourself she open wide serious eye oh no he smile down at she very kindly you shall go right away he say release she i will not keep you another instant from dear mr hardcastle and that nice mr upjohn but before you go let I tell you miss phebe that if only in view of you latest confession i do not think you commonplace at all chapter iii gerald it be another article of the joppian creed that there be no such thing possible as a purely platonic friendship between a young man and a young woman there must always be something in it : either a mitten for he or a disappointment for she or wedding-cake for all -- generally and preferably of course the wedding-cake -- and belong to such friendship as lawfully as a tail belong to a comet be a great wide-spreading area of gossip it be only in the case of phebe lane that this universal and common-sense rule have its one particular and unreasonable exception and it be act upon a speedily acquire knowledge of this by-law that mr halloway boldly pursue he plan for metamorphose he young friend right under the open eye and ear of the joppite he live so near that it be the most natural thing in the world for he to stop for a moment 's chat as every one else do either inside or outside of the window as he go by and as he be always sure of meeting other call when he would it certainly never could have be assert of he that he go there only to see phebe indeed he often scarcely speak with she at all when he so drop in and yet out of these frequent and informal meeting a intimacy have spring up between they such as phebe at least have never know before she submit herself to he docilely read he book patiently even when they bore she unutterably as not seldom happen and endeavor to form she opinion straitly upon he on all intellectual question recognize she own fallibility with a humility that at once touch and charm he real humility be rare enough the world over but nowhere be it less conspicuously apparent than among the flourish virtue of joppa and it be not long before this fact be discover by denham halloway who with all he gayety and light-heartedness be a keen and discriminate observer of character he be one of those interesting people whom all other people interest one of those who derive they peculiar charm more from what they find in you than from what they show you of themselves though one might be ashamed to confess the truth so baldly these be the people who without any especial gift of either mind or person wheedle you secret out of you before you know it possess all you trust and you liking before they have give any real evidence of deserving you confidence and yet somehow or other though rarely either great or talented or even heroically good never for one moment abuse it such character be not at all unusual yet be generally account so one of they chief quality accord to they friend be that they be so unlike everybody else but phebe certainly have never meet any one at all like mr halloway and she be soon of the settle conviction that she should never meet any one quite like he again he be true to he promise to help she -lrb- he never make a promise that he do not honestly try to keep -rrb- and he apply himself to the by no means thankless task with the good-humored directness and energy that characterize all he action there be quite a number of young girl in he parish more proportionately than in the other bell master and amy duckworth have long be hover on its border and the advent of so young and prepossess a rector have instantly remove they last scruple as to infant baptism and settle forever they doubt as to the apostolic succession they have come in at once it be even whisper that marium upjohn have in a incautious moment confess that she prefer the litany to mr webb 's spontaneous effusion and have be summarily sit upon by she mother whose bible contain a eleventh commandment curiously omit from the twentieth chapter of exodus in other version and reading : thou shalt not become a episcopalian and if possible thou shalt not be bear one then there be nellie atterbury and janet mudge and polly and mattie dexter there certainly be no lack of active young teacher for the sunday-school and phebe be well content to remain passively aside as of old but as mr lane remark there be no drone allow in mr halloway 's hive and before long phebe find herself insensibly draw in to be one of the worker too with any amount of business grow upon she hand and herself under this new and wise guidance become more and more capable for it every day a new broom sweep clean remark mr upjohn contemptuously as she hear of the stir and life in st joseph 's heretofore-dull little parish for my part i would rather have mr white back -- if he be not dead he be a good sensible old man who know he place and be contented to let he church simmer in the background where it belong _ he _ do not go flaunt he white gown in people 's face every saint 's day he could trump up let alone the Wednesday and Friday service who be mr halloway what do anybody know about he beyond that the bishop recommend he as if a bishop must know what be what better than other people forsooth do not tell I say mr upjohn in unutterable scorn he be a new broom and he be raise a big dust and i would liefer have mr white back and let the dust lie -- that be all but the joppite be far from share mr upjohn 's sentiment mr halloway do it be true belong to the wrong church but there be a strong suspicion among they that neither have this man sin nor he parent that he be bear to so grievous a fate it be rather he misfortune and as for the rest he be thoroughly a gentleman be excellently well educate and be moreover comely to look upon and eminently agreeable in he bear no joppa be far from begrudge mr white he departure to the land of the bless it be time the good old man go to he reward they say and as to mr whittridge mr halloway 's sister who keep house for he at the rectory through all the length and the breadth of joppa there be no two opinion with regard to she she be a woman of about fifty enough older than she brother to have be he mother and she seem indeed to cherish almost a mother 's idolatrous affection for he she have lose she husband many year before and have be leave with considerable fortune and no family besides this one brother so much information after repeat and unabashedly point-blank question have the joppite succeed in extract from mr halloway who with all he apparent frankness be the most difficult person in the world ever to be bring to talk of himself and he own affair but just to see mr whittridge with she sweet face and perfect manners be to recognize she at once for a gentlewoman in every sense of the word while to be in she society if but for ten minute be to come very nearly to love she the joppite see but one fault in she she do not and would not visit all who seek she out be make more than welcome but whether from the extreme delicacy of she health which render visit a burden or because of she widow 's dress of deepest mourning which she have never lay aside it come to be a accept thing that she go nowhere it be a great disappointment in joppa nevertheless it be impossible to harbor ill-will toward this lovely high-bred lady who draw all heart to herself by the very way she have of seem never to think of herself at all she win phebe lane 's affection at once and forever with almost she first word speak in the low clear sweet tone that sound always like sunday-night 's music do you know mr halloway phebe say to he one day i think it do I more good only to hear you sister 's voice than to listen to the very best sermon ever preach miss phebe he rejoin with a merry twinkle in he brown eye if you propagate that doctrine largely i be a ruin man i must hold you over to eternal secrecy but as regard the fact -- there be my hand -- i be quite of you way of think i be persuade a angel 's voice get into soeur angélique by mistake mr whittridge 's baptismal name be angelica but to she brother she have always be soeur angélique and nothing else yes and a angel 's soul too say phebe even that reply mr halloway she be all and more than you can possibly imagine that she be but i positively forbid you put she up on a pedestal and worship she in the first place too great a sense of she own holiness might mar she present admirable but purely earthly management of we little household thus seriously interfere with my comfort and in the second place i feel it my duty to warn you from a habit of canonization which if too extensively indulge in will inevitably warp

they moral and spiritual improvement any one could be amuse anywhere but _ she _ wish to show she guest that there be pleasanter thing than pleasure to be have even in social gathering and to teach they to hunger and thirst after better than meat and drink while at the same time she take pain always to provide a repast as superior to the general run as she sentiment quite atone to the joppite for the spiritual accompaniment to she feast by its material and solid magnificence which linger appetizingly in they memory long after they have settle they consequent doctor ' bill yes the joppite be not ask to mr upjohn 's to eat and drink only or merely to have a good time with whatever ulterior intention of so do they may have go thither they be ask for a purpose -- a purpose which it be vain to guess and impossible to escape go they must and be improve they must _ bon gré mal gré _ and enjoy themselves they would if they could so there be mingle feeling abroad when mr upjohn 's neatly write invitation find they way into each of the west-end house embrace native and stranger alike in they all-hospitable sweep and even creep into some outlying less aristocratic quarter where confusion worse confound in the shape of refurbish and make over follow agonizingly in they wake the invitation be indite by miss marium upjohn it be a opportunity to improve that young lady 's handwriting which she mother could not have conscientiously suffer to pass and state that mr and mr reuben o upjohn request the honor of you company on Thursday July 14th punctually at four o'clock

nothing loath accordingly come in take he glass and sit himself just where bell direct on a step at she foot amy color and there be a subdue titter somewhere in the background and bell calmly resume the rein of the conversation no there be no know what we shall be put through this afternoon one time when mr upjohn have get we all safely inside she door she divide we smartly into two class set herself in the middle and announce that we be there for a spelling bee we should not say we have not learn something at she house and upon my word we do learn something never before or since have i hear such merciless word as she deal we out my hair stand on end still when i recollect the horror i undergo that day i 'll smuggle in a dictionary declare mr moulton i 'll be ready for she no use she never run twice in the same groove it be only sure not to be a spelling bee this time when we last go there it turn out to be a french _ soirée _ say one of the miss dexter and she announce that there would be a penny 's fine collect at the end of the evening for each english word speak proceeds to go to a lately import poor family add the sister dexter there be quite a sum raise and the head of the family decamp with it two day after for heaven know where leave he wife and infant on mr upjohn 's hand poorer than ever but mrs upjohn 's entertainment prove to be neither orthographic nor linguistic the guest arrive punctually as bidden and they hostess clothe in she most splendid attire receive they with she most gracious manner there be nothing to foretell the fate that await they she tall awkward daughter stand nervously by she side mr upjohn too keep there valiantly for a time then he round ample figure and jolly face disappear somewhere under chaperonage of mr bruce he latest admiration but no one ever think of mr upjohn as the host any way beseem rather to be a sort of favored guest in he own parlor and he place be more than make good by mr hardcastle who stand in the center of the room exactly as he always stand in the center of everybody 's room on such a occasion appear himself to be quite master of ceremony from the grand way in which he step forward to meet each guest and hope he or she would make out to enjoy it the room fill rapidly and before long mr upjohn turn from the door and stand a instant review she guest with the triumphant mien of a victorious general then she advance solemnly to the middle of the room displace mr hardcastle who graciously make way and wave he hand to signify to she he permission to proceed my friend say the great lady with she deep positive voice draw she impose figure to its fullest height as you know it be never _ my _ way to give party i leave that for the rest of you to do when i ask you to my house it be with a higher motive than to make a few hour lie less heavily on you hand dear soul mutter dick hardcastle to he crony jake nobody could have the conscience to charge she with ever have lighten they to we and therefore continue the lady gaze around upon she victim with a benignant smile without further prelude i will inform you for what object i have ask you to honor I with you presence this afternoon she pause and a cold chill run through the company what would she do would she open on they with the westminster catechism this time or set they to shell pea for some poor man 's dinner or would she examine they in the multiplication table a few have run it hastily over before leave home to make sure that they be ready for such a emergency i have think first mr upjohn proceed of a series of game as instructive as delightful game of history and geography and one particularly of astronomy which i be persuade would be very helpful it bring out the nature of the spectroscope in a remarkably clear and intelligent light and after a few round i be sure none of we could ever again have forget those elusive figure relative to the distance and proportion of the planet however that must be for another time for today i think it would be a pleasure as well as a benefit to we all to learn something about a gifted and noble person who i be surprise to find be not so well know in joppa as she should be and whom i be convince we should all be infinitely the better and happier for know i have therefore persuade mr webb with whose power as a reader long year of acquaintanceship have so pleasantly familiarize we to read to we this afternoon extract from the ` life and letter of the baroness bunsen ' good lord ejaculate dick beneath he breath who be that hush whisper jake i have get a novel of miss braddon 's in my pocket i think it might come in handy that 'll help we through till feed time you be all familiar with the name of course pursue mr upjohn smile graciously around the dismayed circle of she guest the book have be in the library this long time past and observe with regret that only its first fifty page have be cut i catch at this invaluable opportunity to make you further acquaint with it mr webb now come forward a thick green-bound volume in he hand and a look on he face as if he be about to open the proceedings with a prayer but mr upjohn hold up she hand one moment please before we begin we lady be so unaccustomed to sit with idle hand even when listen to so absorb a theme as the virtue of this truly excellent christian wife and mother that i think it would be a kindness to ourselves to provide some simple work which should occupy we finger and at the same time be in itself a worthy object of industry marium my dear the silence in the room be appalling one could almost hear the shiver of apprehension run down the silk-and muslin-clad back the sign be give however by the docile marium and immediately two enormous basket be bring in : one the smaller contain every possible implement for unlimited sewing by unlimited hand the other of alarming dimension fill to overflow with shapeless and questionable garment of a canton-flannel coarse so yellow so indestructible so altogether unwearable and hideous that have it be brand charity in flaming letter its object could not have be more plainly designate mr upjohn lift the top article and unfold it lovingly it be a night-dress atoning in lavishness of material for deficiency in grace of make and would have be a loose fit for the wife of the giant chang these lady she say as you will have guess be for the winter wear of we parish poor though you be not all so fortunate as to belong to we church still i feel there be not one of you here but will be more than glad to help forward so bless a charity as clothing the naked -lrb- mrs upjohn in view of the nature of the garment speak even more literally than she intend -rrb- who none the less need you ministration whether you worship with we or apart marium my child bell phebe mattie will you kindly distribute the work among the lady there be another basket ready outside if the supply give out dick i would like you to carry around the thimble jake here be the needle and the spool and the scissors if i may be permit lady i would suggest that we should all begin with the button-hole nothing but the thought of the recompense in the come supper could have sustain mr upjohn 's doomed guest in the prospect before they extract from baroness bunsen and buttonhole in canton-flannel charity nightgown and a hot July afternoon make a sum of misery that be almost too great a tax upon even joppian amiability i say it be a shame cry bell master in unconcealed wrath the idea of spring such a trap on we let mr upjohn 's parish sew for its own poor _ i _ will not crease my fresh dress hold that great thick lump on my lap all the afternoon i be not go to be swindle into help in this fashion oh yes you be say mr halloway bubble over with suppress merriment at the intense fun of it all there be not one of you here who will refuse i never know any thing so delightful and novel in my whole life this condensed combination in one afternoon party of charity literature and indigestion be masterly miss mudge here be a seat for you right by miss master miss phebe let I find you a chair and in a few moment simply it seem by the natural law of gravitation without any engineering whatever mr upjohn 's guest have resolve themselves into two distinct party the elder all in the drawing-room the younger one in the parlor across the hall too far off from mr webb for they gay whispering to disturb that worthy as he boldly plunge headlong at he work to do or die write on every feature of he thin long face so this be what the party turn out miss master be it say moulton pull he moustache as he stand up beside she a first-class dorca society charity covereth a multitude of sin say bell crossly give a vindictive snap with she scissors but it will not begin to cover the enormity of mr upjohn 's transgression on this occasion you gentleman must be very devote to atone to we for the button-hole there be mr de forest standing in the other room look as if he wish he be dead go and bring he here thus summon mr de forest come leisurely enough look if possible a little more languid and blasé than he do in the morning bell instantly make a place for he on the sofa by she side thanks i would rather stand i can take it all in better well ask bell after a pause look saucily up at he be i right this morning do not we look prettier then infinitely bell color rather angrily and phebe laugh outright mr de forest favor she with a stare chew the end of he side-whisker reflectively a moment then deliberately walk over to she miss lane i believe phebe bow but somewhat stiffly excuse I continue de forest imperturbably there do not seem to be any one to introduce we and we know perfectly well who we each be you know and i want to ask about a mutual friend of ours -- miss vernor phebe brighten and soften instantly oh she exclaim drop she work you know she you have see she lately i know she yes quite well i see she some week since i understand then that there be a little talk of she come up here this summer one of those fearful child olly or hal or some one of the superfluous young one be a little off condition

thoughtfully i forget that and she probably will it would be like she to go if it bore she only there be olly say phebe grimly the light fading out of she face a little she 'll have to stay for he oh no she can put he to board somewhere and leave he miss vernor do not concern herself overmuch with the young one they be a awful nuisance to she she do every thing for they you can not know she say phebe indignantly do you say you know she well mr de forest i do not remember just what i say miss lane but it would have be the truth if i do and i generally speak the truth when it be equally convenient yes i do know miss vernor _ very _ well and i have worst she in a great many argument -- you know she argumentative turn perhaps if you will allow I i will do myself the honor of call upon she when she come -- and upon yourself if i may have the pleasure not if you come with the intention of put gerald out of conceit with joppa i want she to stay a long long time do not be afraid miss lane i 'll do my best to help keep she here so long at least as i stay myself ' _ aprés celà le déluge _ ' i do not speak french ah no i regret it you might have assist I in my gender i be never altogether sure of they mr de forest call bell imperatively from the other side of the room displeased at the defalcation of she knight i want to introduce you to miss mudge miss mudge try to make bell understand by frantic pantomime that she have not mean just now -- any time would do -- but bell choose it should be just now and slightly lift he eyebrow mr de forest take he handsome person slowly back to bell to make a almost impertinently indifferent bow to the new claimant upon he mr halloway have be stand near phebe too near not to overhear the conversation and he turn to she now quickly so this account for you beam face he say in a low tone as he take a seat just back of she in the window niche the mysterious gerald _ be _ really come then i wonder what have happen as soon as i see you why do you not tell I i be only wait till i have the chance she answer all the brightness come back into she bonny face as she smile up at he do you think i could keep any thing so nice from

she surely to see you again say denham that be what she write in she letter at least she say : ' i shall be glad to see you again phebe my dear ' be not that nice ` phebe my dear ' she say that be a great deal for gerald to say be it but i believe some young lady be less effusive with they pen than with they tongue it be not gerald 's nature ever to be effusive but oh i be so glad she be come i only get she letter last night see do not she write a nice hand and cautiously lest any one else should see too phebe slip a envelope into denham 's hand he bent back behind the lace curtain to inspect it do you generally carry about you letter in you pocket miss phebe no only gerald 's i love so always to have something of hers near I be not it a nice hand halloway look silently at the upright angular large script it be legible certainly but you do not like it miss phebe i be tear between conflict truth and politeness it be like a man 's hand if i must say something and so be she letter like a man 's read it and see oh she would not mind there be nothing in it and yet somehow it seem just like gerald do read it oh i want you to please please do and lead half by curiosity half by the eagerness in phebe 's pretty face denham open the letter and read phebe glancing over it with he as if she could not bear to lose sight of it a instant dear phebe so run the letter you favor of

never waste word you say it be like a man 's letter say denham but i must beg leave to differ with you there i do not think it be at all such a letter as _ i _ would have write you for instance of course not it would not be proper for you to say ` phebe my dear ' as gerald do yours would have to be a very dignified pastoral letter yes address to ` my lamb ' which you could not object to in a pastoral letter of course and which sound nearly as affectionate blame you for have cause I to lose the valuable information i might have gain about the baroness bunsen i never get much farther than she birth in that famous history i see poor miss delano casting longing glance in here i 'll smuggle she in among you young people he depart on he errand of mercy and soon have the timid little old maid in the more congenial atmosphere of the parlor where little by little though in a very stealthy and underhand way the talk grow more general and the restraint slacken more and more until sewing and reading be both forget and the fun become fast and furious culminate in the sudden appearance of jake dexter dress up as a ancient and altogether unlovely old woman whom dick hardcastle present in a stage whisper as baroness bunsen in the closing chapter and who forthwith proceed to act out in dumb show the various event of that admirable woman 's life as judiciously and sonorously touch upon by mr webb in the drawing-room opposite jake be a bear actor and have do up the baroness he proceed to do up several other note historical character not omit a few less celebrated contemporary of he own each representation better and truer to life than the last and wind up with snatch away they work from the young lady ' not unwilling hand and pile it in heap on the floor around he he sit himself in the middle with a armful hug close and a air of comically mingled resignation and opulence and announce himself as a photo from life of ye destitute poor of joppa mr upjohn may have have suspicion that all be not go on precisely as she have plan in that other half of she domain which she have surrender to marium 's feeble guardianship but it certainly could not be lay to she blame if young people would amuse themselves even at she house if they wilfully persist in neglect the means of grace she have conscientiously provide for they so much the worse for they not for she and if mr upjohn find the contemplation of mr bruce 's profile and she occasional smile at he as she bent over she ugly work not sufficient of a indemnity for he enforced silence and choose to sneak over to the young people 's side and enjoy himself too as a inopportune and hearty guffaw from thence testify just at the wrong moment when mr webb have reach the culminate point of the baroness ' death and be draw tear from the lady ' eye by the irresistible pathos of he voice -- why mr upjohn own in she heart that it be only what might be expect of he and that she could not help that either so at last the

original of the biography so identical be she virtue with those of the depart saint and so exactly do she resemble she in every particular except just in the outward circumstance of she life and mr upjohn modestly entreat they to desist draw so unworthy a comparison and say it be a example of a life they should each and all do well to imitate so far as in they lay and then she go about collect

bruce may have suspect this to be design as a neat way of cut she out but there be no know to what length a flippant widow 's imagination will not go and any way mr upjohn quite atone afterward for any temporary neglect by pay she the most assiduous attention right in the face of he wife who apparently do not care a straw and only think she husband a little more foolish than usual do not everybody know that it be only mr upjohn 's way and that it do not mean any thing and so the door be throw open supper be announce and joppa as it swarm around the loaded table feel that its hour of merit reward be come and mr hardcastle when at last he could eat and drink no more stand up and pronounce in the name of the unite assembly that mr upjohn 's entertainment have be a very very great

in yours -- but we be man first miss vernor afterward clergyman why may we not keep we distinct idiosyncrasy even in we clerical uniform gerald slash she dress gently with she ride whip it seem to I as if you should all be clergyman first and man afterward fitting yourselve to the profession rather than the profession to you and so by all confessedly follow one pattern you would be necessarily draw into a greater similitude with each other than any other class of man ah here be mr de forest at last at last repeat that gentleman as he join the group or rather pause just beyond it survey gerald with a critical glance which seem to take in accurately at one swift sweep every least detail of she dress my watch stand at the minute miss vernor and here come the horse add phebe not much to boast of say de forest turn the severe criticism of he look upon the animal as the boy bring they up i would not let you be see in central park with they however they be the best joppa can do for we

the horse again and let we have we ride not to-day reply gerald i could not it be impossible she look up at he hold the little victim press close in she arm utterly regardless of its rough and grimy coat she eye be swim with tear as you decide of course say de forest sulkily release she and toss he bridle to the boy here you sim or tim or jim or whatever you be take away the horse and as you value you tip mind you do not have any more dog around the next time i want you gerald turn away without another word gather up she dress as she best could and go into the house olly who have witness

dead come and help I bury he decently somewhere no phebe stay there i wish it do not let we have any more fuss about it please de forest lift he hat and turn to leave as gerald disappear pray do not let I detain you from the interesting ceremony miss lane he say with he most cynical and mocking voice miss vernor as high-priestess will be worth a full audience good-morning gerald would not like it if i go to she when she say not i must stay here say phebe turn she distressed face to halloway who have stand a silent spectator of it all oh i be so sorry it happen be not it too bad it certainly be -- for the dog she will not get over it for ever so long and it be not really she fault she be only in fun when she turn she horse that way gerald be very tender-hearted i see she be -- toward dog mr halloway you do not like she miss phebe i be madly in love with she do not laugh at I please be not she handsome well i could not judge of the length of she hair nonsense tell I what you really think of she denham ponder a moment i think all sort of thing he answer presently with a amuse laugh she be so contradictory she 'll fit almost any opinion and the worst i can say of she be that she 'll never concern herself in the least to find out what my opinion may be ah say phebe softly just wait you do not either of you know each other yet chapter vi the picnic gerald 's and olly 's visit be quite a event in the quiet lane household olly flagrantly break every exist custom in it with the sublime autocracy of childhood and regain he health at the cost of the peace of mind of every individual with whom he come in contact from nervous miss lydium down to the protest servant while gerald be one of those intense personality whose influence seem to recreate the entire atmosphere about they at once go where they will poor miss lydium be afraid of she quick speech and brusque way and decide opinion and spend more hour than usual upstairs alone in she own little room and wear she best cap whenever she appear below as a sort of mute appeal to the young lady 's indulgence but gerald in she robust health have no sympathy whatever with invalid as a class and for chronic nerve she have a absolute contempt unmitigated by even the best cap 's gay ribbon it be altogether a matter of will she assert people need not be ill if they be only resolve not to be so humph say mr lane who have chance to overhear and there be a trifle more tenderness than usual in she manner when she go up later to put the mid-day cup of beef-tea into she sister 's thin hand and stand look compassionately down at she nothing be easier than to insist that a thing be so and so just because there be no way to prove that it be not so how you do always talk in proverb sister sophy say miss lydium admiringly i only wish solomon could have hear you i do believe he would have put some of they in he would have be far too busy take down mr upjohn 's fine speech to mind _ I _ grunt mr lane and i never do think much of solomon anyway he be too much of a mormon with he hundred wife and that want any thing else lyddy no thank you the house be very nice and still this morning there be a picnic up at the dexter 's farm be not there i suppose they have all go to it of course who ever hear of a picnic unless phebe go along to do all the fuss and muss that everybody else shirk do not tell _ I _ there be any fun in a picnic -- go off in the wood like that to do for yourself what you would sell the clothes off you back to have somebody else do for you at home and eat all kind of heathenish mess with you finger because you have forget the fork but what people like let they have they 'll get experience out of it if nothing better and of course phebe have to go true enough phebe be as essential to any picnic as the feast though much less obtrusively so and gerald watch she friend 's quiet helpfulness with lazy interest she herself be stretch at ease on the clean fresh grass under some glorious old tree the place choose be a lovely spot at the head of the lake the drive there have be long and hot and now she lay enjoy to the full the refreshment of the shadow and the breeze and the perfection both of the view and of she immediate surroundings bell master sit near she have discover that she be generally surest of mr de forest 's company when in gerald 's neighborhood nor have she be mistake this time he have openly abandon the greedy band of berry-picker and the artistic knot of sketcher and the noisy body of pleasure-seeker who be paddle frivolously around the shore of the lake and scream with causeless laughter as soon as he find that gerald do not intend attach herself to any of they but have strike out the new and independent line of do absolutely nothing at all halloway have be help industriously with the fire but he come toward the group under the tree when he service seem no longer require you look most invitingly comfortable he say fan himself with he hat we must try to coax miss phebe here for a rest pray do not say de forest lift a lazy hand with a air of find even that motion too great a effort at least not till the coffee be well under way i taste a cup of she make yesterday do not call she off we be all benefit in a manner by she absence i can make good coffee too when i choose say bell bite at the rim of she straw hat de forest contemplate she with new interest ah can you ` tis a gift of the god give to few and when do you choose may i ask apparently not to-day ` tis not my picnic oh be it miss lane 's one would say it be from the way she slave for it remark gerald why do not you help too asked de forest break off blade of grass and fling they out singly upon the air for miss master ' excellent reason : it be not my picnic you contribute you valuable aid solely to you own undertaking then why be i call upon to contribute it to any other ` tis a problem for philosopher but for argument 's sake let we say for the good of humanity at large and of the dexter in particular i be not bind to the dexter by any obligation that i can see to help they carry out they entertainment if they be not equal to it they should not give it nothing quixotic about you be there say de forest look at she quizzically nothing whatever reply gerald easily why should there be let every one look out for himself and if some can not that be no business of mine it be simply my business to make sure that i can look after myself what a outrageously frank exposure of a universally conceal sentiment mr halloway be scandalize he be think how he can fit a scorching text to it to wither you with next Sunday no here be a sermon ready make on the spot say denham as phebe come slowly toward they miss lane in herself be a sufficient illustration of the opposite doctrine prove it answer gerald shrug she shoulder prove that phebe who toil for everybody be any happier than i who only follow my inclination you certainly look vastly the more comfortable at present say de forest look from gerald 's cool cheek and unruffled muslin flounce to phebe 's flush face and tumble cambric you be a practical embodiment of the beauty and expediency of selfishness what be you talk about ask phebe come up and lean wearily against a tree about you and miss vernor explain bell which of you be happier _ i _ should say miss vernor decidedly a loving look come into phebe 's eye as she glance down at gerald miss vernor _ of course _ she say with a very tender inflection of voice be what she be how can she help be the happier virtue advocate vice say de forest mr halloway you sermon be a dead failure -- as a sermon by no means answer denham smile i do not expect to convert you in a single lesson will you not sit down with we miss phebe you look tired not just yet thank you and why not ask gerald i want to see a little after miss delano first she be off there all alone hunting for fern well persist gerald what of it be you fonder of she society than ours that you must run after she i be not fonder of any one 's society than of yours gerald but be you fond of that tiresome creature at all confess it do not she bear you to death with she interminable grasshopper chatter phebe glance at halloway and laugh a little as she move away oh i be learn by degree not to be bore by people -- not even by miss delano now will any one explain why she should wish to teach herself _ not _ to know a bear from a christian exclaimed gerald impatiently it be quite beyond I but do you really never talk to anybody unless you want to miss vernor ask bell disagreeably conscious that gerald have not voluntarily address she once that morning never reply gerald stare out at the lake do not you ever do any thing you do not want to because you ought to i do not always see the ought for instance why should i put myself out to entertain miss delano as phebe do i do not know muttered bell i would not i be sure she be mortally dull one might imagine reason for the self-sacrifice i suppose say de forest make a languid snatch at a butterfly fluttering near the possibility we will say that it might please the gentle old babbler to come under the condescension of you notice how would that do for a motive why should i want to please she insist gerald remove a hideous beetle from she dress with all possible care lest she should hurt it i do not want to i do not care for she nor she for I why should i put myself out for she what claim have she on I that i should displease myself to please she let we see say denham ruminatingly miss delano 's pleasure against miss vernor 's displeasure or _ vice versa miss vernor 's pleasure against miss delano 's displeasure yes the balance of pleasure remain quite the same whichever lady have it apart from principle the logic be unanswerable it be admirable comment de forest i always do like logic so much better than moral philosophy hello what be the matter now there be a wail of distress somewhere in the distance gerald turn she shapely head and listen a moment it be only olly she say composedly i recognize the cry he be not hurt oh you need not go mr halloway olly never come to any harm he be only quarrel with some one de forest raise himself on he elbow to listen while halloway walk off in the direction of the outburst there be possibility lurk in picnic you know he remark resume he recumbent position mad bull and rabbit trap and fine chance for a drown now and then but i suppose we need not trouble ourselves mr halloway 'll see to it besides olly bear the charmed life of the wicked miss master i hope you remember to give daily thanks that you have not any small brother i do devoutly give thanks that i have not any sister say bell with a unaffectionate glance toward gerald i should hate they and so the desultory talk ramble on the little group grow larger by degree as the approach luncheon hour bring back the straggler and with they olly trot contentedly along cling to halloway 's hand meek as any lamb what be you do when you cry out so a little while ago ask gerald go up to the child olly look at she with instant defiance in he eye i hurt my foot you know perfectly well you can not deceive I olly tell I the truth what mischief be you at i tell you i hurt my foot and it hurt like mischief and that be all the mischief there be i wish it have be _ you _ foot and i would not have cry a bit halloway be turn aside but gerald appeal to he be he tell the truth yes answer denham dryly he be race with the anthony boy and fall but as you see he be right enough now ya-ah say olly and leer into she face with brotherly disrespect i 'll tell you a lie next time if you would rather ya-ah gerald look as if she be go to shake he on the spot and to prevent any such catastrophe denham suddenly seize the little fellow and put he through a number of acrobatic feat in breathless succession till he be fairly hustle into good temper and everybody around be laugh even gerald jake dexter be instantly incite to display some marvellous limber-jointed power of he own and have just demonstrate to the assemble company to he and they entire satisfaction that the impossible be after all sometimes possible when luncheon be announce by the ringing of a cow-bell and a gay onslaught upon the usual picnic table rich in luxury and poor in necessity supersede for the nonce all less material form of amusement later in the afternoon halloway wander off from the rest for one of the solitary stroll that he prefer to companionship as be less lonely -- a feeling often experience when fate and not choice appoint one 's comrade -- and return leisurely along the bank of the lake he come upon a little group of picnicker and stop unperceived beyond they to enjoy for a while that comfortable sense of be in the world yet out of it which be the birthright of all spectatorship gerald and phebe be skip stone thoroughly absorb in energetic enjoyment of the simple game they two contrasting figure gerald dark and tall and slim and phebe so round and fair and supple make a pretty-enough picture for any artist olly little maggie dexter and a assortment of sturdy urchin know throughout joppa only as the anthony boy be dance and chatter aimlessly around and near by be draw up a clumsy old boat where phebe have make a comfortable niche for miss delano who every day at about this hour be afflict with a remarkable disorder which have grow upon she wholly of late year and whose symptom so far as she be willing to admit they consist of a painful heaviness of the eyelid a weakness in the nape of the neck and a irresistible tendency to retire for a brief season within herself a little farther off still have take fortune at the flood and secure de forest at last bell master be embark on another kind of craft a thorough-going fully-freighted flirtation all sail set and through the tree be glimpse of lazily move figure beyond generally in two and two follow some occult rule of common division peculiar to picnic by degree the child wander off up the bank and presently there come a shout follow by a evident squabble phebe look around uneasily gerald keep on with she sport one two three four five six seven time phebe now do better than that at this juncture little maggie run up she pretty brown eye wide and she red lip quiver oh miss vernor olly sha not do it shall he do say he sha not do what ask gerald pause in the act of search for another pebble put it in the water to swim like a duck it be not a duck it be a little little young bird he be find in a nest and it can not swim it can not hardly fly oh do not let he let he echo gerald sharply she spring toward the child with a bind almost lift olly off he foot as she draw he back from the water 's edge you cruel boy she cry give it to I directly i will not answer olly try to shake himself free from she grasp it be mine i find it but the small hand hold he in a grip as strong as a man 's and in another moment gerald have take the poor little half-feathered creature from he and bidden maggie restore it carefully to its nest it be mine it be mine i 'll have it back shout olly angrily after the little girl gerald take hold of he by the shoulder and turn he round toward she there be a great deal of hatred for the sin and not overmuch love for the sinner in she face as she look down at he if you dare touch that bird again olly i 'll find a punishment for you that you will not soon forget do you hear a hidden thought of revenge for the spoil sport come into olly 's mind he twist himself away from he sister with a little grunt and stand peevishly play a moment with a couple of marble then suddenly dart aside seize the boat in which miss delano be establish still struggle but more feebly with the mysterious trouble that hold she in thrall and with a strength with which one would hardly have credit he slight form he push it off into the water there be of course not a particle of real danger for miss delano even though this chance to be the only boat at that point and she be no oarswoman but the poor little old lady thus suddenly rouse from the strange hallucination -lrb- as she call they -rrb- which be the most marked feature of she complaint and finding herself afloat upon the unstable deep instantly suppose that she last hour be come she spring up too terrify to scream with a look of deadly horror in she face and then sink again all in a heap in the bottom of the boat olly give a fiendish laugh but before any one else could move to the rescue gerald with one fierce unutterable look at she brother and no thought but how soonest to end miss delano 's speechless agony quick as a flash catch hold of a overhang bough and swing herself on to a rock quite far out in the water and thence with a light bold spring land safely in the middle of the boat as it drift past all right miss delano she say briskly seat herself and lay hold of the oar with accustomed hand i be a bear sailor and we 'll have a little row first before we go back have a angel visibly descend from heaven to assume the helm miss delano could not have be more grateful and overcome oh my dear my dear she say and in the intensity of she relief begin to cry a little softly gerald pretend not to notice she emotion -lrb- she be very awkward as a comforter and as shy before tear as a man -rrb- and row around for a while in utter silence and then feel that conversation might aid in quiet she companion 's unnecessarily excited nerve she begin abruptly charge she with question as one load a gun with cartridge drop down one after another with cruel directness into the harmless vacancy of miss delano 's brain how many inhabitant have joppa in precise figure what be the height of those farther hill to the leave upon what system be the village-school govern what be the mineral nature of the soil what be the fastest time ever make by that bay mare of mr upjohn 's with the white hind foot etc etc etc on all which point poor miss delano could only assure she timidly : i do not know dear it would be well if i do and relapse into a alarmed and most uncharacteristic silence phebe stand watch the boat as gerald row off then as if recollect some neglect duty turn suddenly and find herself face to face with mr halloway no farther he say playfully bar she passage oh but i must i want to find olly and talk he into a better frame of mind before gerald come back leave olly to I please i be a perfect child-tamer and guarantee to exorcise he seven evil spirit in less than no time meanwhile sit you down and rest oh i do not need rest if you 'll undertake olly i 'll help put back the lunch thing picnic be quite like the biblical feast : five loaf and two fish somehow always make twelve basketful to take up and you be always a true disciple at the feast miss phebe intent only upon minister to other phebe laugh she own peculiarly light-hearted gay laugh that be a much prettier way of put it than gerald 's she say i make myself maid-of-all-work miss gerald of course do not approve of such service but you do so i need not mind she blame but i shall blame too miss phebe when you overdo yourself i do not see why other ' recreation need be all work for you let each take he share of both the pleasure and the toil but you see this _ be _ my share mr halloway because i can not help in any better way i do not know enough to entertain people 's guest just by talk to they as gerald do you forget how dull i be so i do say denham gravely i forget it all the time indeed the forgetfulness have quite become chronic now i 'll find olly and we 'll all go at the dish together and make a game of it certainly denham halloway must have possess some secret charm in he management of child for by the time gerald turn she boat to the shore he stand at the bank to meet they with olly by he side as amiable a little fellow as any sunday-school-book hero ever bear i be glad you sail turn out such a success miss delano say halloway cheerily as he lift the little old lady carefully out on to the pebble you have be envy of we all but here be a little boy come to tell you all the same how sorry he be that he give you such a fright olly my lad i think miss delano look as if she have forgive you through and through oh indeed indeed yes answer miss delano hurriedly it be only my silly way of be scared particularly when i be rouse up so sudden out of one of those turn of mine and it be all right my dear all right but i be sorry real and honest declare olly stoutly look squarely in miss delano 's kindly face and i do not mean to scare you you mean it for a revenge on I i suppose say gerald in a low harsh voice she take hold of he arm as she speak give I those marble of yours olly look at she hesitated and then reluctantly produce three very handsome agate from some outlying storehouse of he jacket i buy you six say gerald where be the rest i lose one answer olly sullenly it fall down a hole then give I the other two olly obey still more reluctantly fix great anxious eye upon he treasure as he lay they each one more slowly than the last in he sister 's hand there say gerald perhaps this will teach you to behave better another time i shall not buy you any more this summer she fling out she hand suddenly and the five pretty stone fall with a splash far out in the lake and disappear forever five little cruel set of circle instantly begin to widen and widen over they grave in a perfect mockery of roundness olly give one sharp cry and then stand stock-still a bitterly hard look come over he face those marble have be very very dear to he heart halloway put he arm tenderly around the little fellow and draw he close in a very sympathetic way olly he say gently you know you deserve some punishment but now that you sister have punish you i be sure she will forgive you too as miss delano have do if you only ask she olly bury he face in he friend 's coat and burst into a fit of heart-broken tear i do not want she to forgive I he sob i only want my agate -- my pretty pretty agate surely you will forgive he plead halloway look up at gerald over olly 's head and hold out one of the boy 's hand in he own he be really penitent when you come up let I ask for he gerald move a step away ignore the hand certainly if you wish it she say coldly halloway bent and kiss olly 's flush face do you hear my boy it be all right now and there be maggie call you to swing she do not forget you promise to make I a visit at the rectory to-morrow olly throw he arm around denham 's knee and give he a convulsive hug i like you though you _ be _ a minister he say through he tear i just wish you be my sister and then he go slowly off to maggie and denham and gerald stand silently where he have leave they gerald be the first to speak you think i be hard on olly i see it in you face i do think reply denham slowly with a faint smile curve he well-cut lip that perhaps it might be happier for olly if you would try to consider he less in the light of a boy and more as -- as only a little animal you be so tender-hearted and pitiful toward animal gerald flush angrily i like plain speaking best you think i be hard on he why do not you say so i will if you prefer it i do think so thanks be there any thing else you would like to say to I in you capacity as clergyman before we join the other yes if i may really venture so far you hat be quite crooked gerald straighten it without a smile thanks again anything else absolutely nothing he turn to escort she back but gerald stand still frown out at the lake you do not know olly she say curtly maybe not but i know childish nature pretty well perhaps because i love it ah i do not love it it be not lovable to I it be all nonsense to call it the age of innocence it be vice in embryo instead of in full leaf that be all but that be a inestimable gain of itself a little of a bad thing be surely much better than a great deal of it for my part i confess to a great partiality for child there be something pathetic to I in the little fault and temper that irritate we now chiefly because they clash against we own weakness and yet on the right guidance of which lie the whole making or marring of the child 's life do not guidance include punishment yes it include it but it do not consist of it gerald still stand half turn from he frown out over the placid blue water ah she say it chiefly consist of good example and that sort of thing i suppose i think it consist chiefly of love say halloway simply gerald make no answer at first then turn and look at he almost defiantly she changeable eye seem black as she raise they to he would you have throw olly 's marble into the lake no reply halloway look steadily back at she then you would have be very foolish say gerald haughtily it be the only way to touch he i be quite right to do it you should be the best judge of you action miss vernor gerald bow without answer and move past he like a offended duchess halloway stand look after she with a amuse sparkle in he eye miss geraldine vernor he say to himself with all you beauty and you reputed accomplishment and intellect you would yet do well to take a few lesson of my little friend phebe lane chapter vii try as by fire gerald what be you think of i be wonder how soon you would let we have the lamp i 'll get it immediately if you like but it be so pleasant talk in the twilight i could spend hour contentedly sit here so with you how reprehensibly idle no i should be learn something all the time you have always something to teach I or if you do not feel like talk i could just sit still and hold you hand and not need any thing more gerald put she hand instinctively out of reach i beg you will not try it i hate have my hand hold yes i know you do you hate be kiss too you hate be admire and make a fuss over i do not suppose any thing would induce you to let I call you a pet name o gerald i do wish you like be love but i do like it well enough of course every one like be care for and all that sort of thing it be only the gush and spoon and sentimentalize that i can not endure i never could even as a child phebe sit suddenly upright away from gerald perhaps even the mute caress of she attitude jar upon she friend to I the half of be love would be the be tell so she say i should never weary of hear it say over and over again bah ejaculate gerald it would make I sick she get up as if the very think be too much for she and go to the window stand still there look out phebe follow she with she eye i be afraid you be fate to be deadly sick all you life through gerald what _ will _ you do with you lover dismiss they all all but one what will you do with he marry he of course that be what he will be there for will not it i expect to marry some one some time marriage make a woman 's life fuller and freer though not necessarily happier i want to get all into my life that i can i wonder whom you will marry mused phebe where she sit curl up on the sofa i wonder what he could be like gerald how i should like to see you in love you will not see it reply gerald no one will ever see it it would not be my way to make a display of the insanity suppose that be that i have it i hope at least you will show it to _ he _ not overmuch even to _ he _ he 'll have to take it on faith i have not the faintest intention of inform any one of the state of my affection a dozen time a day once for all ought to be sufficient with the declaration as it be with the marriage vow phebe pucker up she forehead ah how different we be if i be ever engage to any one i shall want to keep tell he all the time how much i love he for fear he would not guess it you will bear he to death then i suppose i shall reply phebe dejectedly i do not suppose any one living want to be love so much as i would want to love he i could not be cool and deliberate and wise at loving as you would be i should have to do it with my whole heart and just give myself up to it for good and all that be the story-book way of loving say gerald i do not believe in it for real life blind adoration do not do either the lover or the loved any good there should be sense in one 's emotion as well as in one 's opinion phebe be silent a moment or two you be so self-possessed and so self-controlled gerald she say at last it must be very nice to have one 's self so perfectly in command as you have and yet i do not know i think it would be rather nice too to find one 's self suddenly under the power of some one a great deal better and stronger and wiser than one 's self who compel one to love he not because one would but just because one could not help it the girl be alone in the sitting-room mr lane have go out to a neighbor 's take olly with she and miss lydium not have yet appear for she usual hour downstair it be a few day after the picnic and be one of those suddenly cool August evening that sometimes drop down so unexpectedly upon the summer heat and a wood-fire lay upon the hearth ready to light at the invalid 's come phebe too spring from the sofa as she speak as if she word have evoke too vivid a picture and kneel down by the hearth apply a match the bright flame leap swiftly up and fill all the room with a flicker golden glow gerald turn in the window to watch it how quickly it have flush phebe 's cheek and how soft she eye look in its light it be downright cruelty to spoil we first cool evening with a fire phebe but i 'll forgive you it make you look so pretty she say quite unconscious of she beauty as she stand against the dark background of the curtain in picturesque stateliness she dress of soft cream-white cloth fall in cling fold about she and she clear pale face turn dreamily toward the light which gleam out in fitful reflection from the heavy gold ornament at she throat and wrist ah you do not see yourself murmur phebe look adoringly back at she no one else could look pretty to you if you do how foolish say gerald scornfully pray do not let we begin bandy compliment back and forth that be next worse to eternally discuss love why it be that two girl seem never able to talk together half a hour without lug in that threadbare subject as if it be the one most important thing in the world i do not understand well be not love the most important thing -- to woman ask phebe sit down on the floor to nurse the fire she thin muslin make a little ripple of pretty lightness around she no it be not reply gerald it may be to some few perhaps but certainly not to all woman it be not to I it be one thing not every thing and not even the best thing knowledge be better and goodness be better and to come down to purely personal blessing health be better and so be common-sense better and in the long run there be dozen of thing infinitely better worth have and better worth aim for it be a good enough thing to have in addition but as to its be the sum and substance the alpha and omega of any sensible woman 's life that be all foolishness let 's have do with it and order in the light i want to get at euclid again it will never do for that conceited yale brother of mine to get ahead of I shall i call to nancy no use the servant be out wait a moment till the fire be well start and i 'll bring in the lamp the servant be out repeat gerald both at the same time be that the way you keep house in joppa oh they like run out together and we never want any thing in the evening you know the front door always stand ajar and visitor let themselves in and you make you own fire and bring in you own oily lamp or do you evening guest assist you perhaps in lieu of the servant but we do not generally have fire laugh phebe greatly amuse at gerald 's disgust only to-night it would be too chilly for aunt lydium here without one i feel cool too i be not so sensible as you and put on too thin a dress be not it a pretty blaze wait just till i throw on another log how it snap and crackle take you time say gerald turn back to the window but what a way to manage why should you hire servant if you do they work for they phebe only laugh and a little shower of spark fly over she from the hearth as if the fire laugh too it be be needlessly indulgent pursued gerald one can give servant proper liberty without make one 's self a slave to they caprice if you yield to they in one instance because it chance to be convenient they 'll certainly exact it of you another time when it be not convenient gracious heaven phebe what be it there be a sudden outburst of light behind she and a sharp scream of mingled terror and pain and she turn to find phebe stand the center of a pillar of fire she light dress have ignite from the fly spark and the devour flame seem to burst forth in a hundred place at once and rush exultantly together phebe give another wild cry and start for the door in that blind agony of despair which seem to hasten people at such time to they doom as if by aimless flight they could escape the awful demon who possess they too horror-stricken to utter a sound gerald spring at she and seize she with fearless hand force the poor struggle girl by main strength down on to the floor no one near to help no water at hand not so much as a rug or a shawl to throw over she and stifle the flame yes there be the table-cover heavy and thick as if create for this very life-service gerald tear it off -- book box china cup and glass vase crash to the ground together -- and fling it over phebe throw herself on top of it press it close in every direction with hand and limb and smother the flame resolutely beneath it it be but a moment though a moment of lifetime horror and all be over there be only the fire on the hearth hissing and leap as if in anger at its defeat design phebe whisper gerald hoarsely phebe phebe have cease to struggle and lay perfectly motionless apparently scarcely breathing but she open she eye and smile faintly as gerald call she the fright and the pain have take she speech away she could not find it at once but the smile give new hope and energy to gerald never mind talk she exclaim spring briskly to she foot if you be only alive it be all right do not attempt to stir i 'll get some one aunt lydium -- do not let she know phebe manage to gasp no no of all people cry gerald she pause a instant not a servant in the house whom be she to summon a vague idea seize she of run into the street and catch hold of the

when she could command herself sufficiently to assume a supreme indifference of tone you believe in purely household remedy i see i believe always in do what i can with what mean i have one moment more please i be not quite through gerald hold out she hand again perhaps you have better try sandstone on it this time or a little burning oil halloway do not answer but hastily tear he handkerchief into strip bind the arm as closely as he could there he say survey the bandage critically and inwardly well pleased with he success at least that will do till you can see the doctor be you sure you be quite through now ask gerald in mock submission you do not think it necessary to put the arm in a splint or to fasten weight to it or to amputate the first joint of the thumb i be sorry to say that be all i know how to do for you miss vernor then i will go back to miss lydium by the way would you recommend soap also for hysteric apply with a close bandage over the mouth certainly it will be both effectual and immediate thank you good-night will you not shake hand with I gerald turn as she be move off and hold out she hand more as a queen might have extend it in motion of dismissal than as friend to friend denham take it between both he before you go i want to thank you in the name of all miss phebe 's friend he say earnestly you have save she life to-night and at the risk of you own the table-cloth be she savior not i return gerald lightly but with a softened voice and anyway be it not quite thanks enough only to know that phebe be safe now good-night in earnest chapter ix joppa 's ministration to the sick all news good bad and indifferent fly equally fast in joppa and have there be a town-crier depute for the purpose phebe 's accident could not have sooner become a household tale in even the most distant district of the place after a contradiction of the first rumor report she burn to a crisp and only recognizable by a ring of she mother 's on she left hand -- which ring by-the-way she never wear -- and after a contradiction in due course of the second rumor report gerald to be lie in the agony of death and phebe to have escape without a hair singe follow a period of dire uncertainty when nobody know what to believe and feel only a obstinate conviction that everybody else have get it entirely wrong but at last the story straighten itself out into something bear a family resemblance to actual fact and then joppa settle itself resolutely down to do its duty my duty toward my sick neighbor in joppa consist in call twice a day if not oftener at he house in inquire after he condition down to minutest and most sacred detail in know accurately how many hour he sleep last night and what he eat for breakfast and what be pay the sick-nurse and if it include she wash my second duty toward my sick neighbor be to bring he something to eat on the supposition that outside thing taste differently or something to look at or if nothing better at least something to refuse my third and last duty toward my neighbor -- the well neighbor who possess the sick one -- be to narrate every somewhat similar case on record with all its circumstance and the ultimate career of the sufferer to prescribe remedy as infallible as the pope to disapprove wholly and on the best grounds of those in actual use to offer every assistance in and out of my power and to say at leave that i _ hope _ it may all turn out well but that _ i _ should have call in the other doctor joppa have learn by heart its duty toward its neighbor from its earliest stammering infancy and it adhere strictly to the path therein mark out it inquire after phebe diligently it thoroughly master all possible intricacy of she case it make she gift digestible and indigestible and it say that by all odds it be dr harrison who should have attend she from the first dr denni take very good care of she nevertheless and it be not long before he pronounce that all she need be quiet and rest to complete the cure we shall have she out of bed in a few day now mr lane in a week or so perhaps he say as he pass out at the front door where mr lane be stand talk with mr hardcastle she be do very well as well as i could wish all she need be rest keep she perfectly quiet and the doctor bow himself off first politely inquire of mr hardcastle after she husband 's gout and she own dyspepsia he be a fair-spoken man

i think i should have die when i hear it say miss delano patting phebe 's cheek poor dear poor dear and they say you will not ever be able to walk again who say that ask phebe laughing i shall be a

finger and poke at it softly i 'll get a knife i hope you do not allow any such trash as that about miss vernor say mr upjohn sharply in the middle of she discussion of jane 's demerit phebe ought to be exceedingly careful what she eat for a great while to come it be doubtful indeed whether she stomach ever recover its tone after such a shock i know one woman who die just of the shock alone some two month after precisely such a accident as this when everybody think she have get well and phebe must be _ very _ careful she appetite be not to be tempt but guide well lady i must be go announce mr

profit by the general hubbub create by the entrance of two more lady to satisfactorily investigate the sponge-cake why quite a levee be not it phebe say one of the last arrival look in vain for a chair and force to seat herself on a low table accidentally upset phebe 's medicine as she do so yes altogether too much of one say gerald knit she brow as she rescue a bottle just in time and dart a angry glance around the crowded room phebe be not at all equal to it yet you be right miss vernor agree mr upjohn draw out she tatting from she pocket and settle herself at it with a answering frown there be quite too many here some people never know when to stay away oh there be bell i hear she voice call mattie run to look over the banister she be get both mr de forest and mr moulton with she there be a sound of many voice below a giggle a rush for the stair and a playful scuffle it be I -lrb- bell 's voice -rrb- dick will not let I pass I be bell -lrb- dick 's voice -rrb- she would not

shout up only that there be no ice-cream and a singular scarcity of girl it be a shame say mr upjohn severely in she chair while gerald hold she peace too wrathful to speak and conscious of she inability to mend matter i should think people might have sense enough not to crowd all the air out of a sick-room in this fashion it be exceedingly inconsiderate of they i be sure answer mr hardcastle draw a sofa cushion behind she back she ought to be so quiet phebe shout dick here be the parson he want to know if you be dead yet sha not i send he up it will be all right you know quite

follow dick 's sally mr halloway be not there at all cry olly he fine clear-voice pitch high above the rest he only ask about pheeb at the door and go right off well he leave this for she with he compliment and this and this call dick rummage in he pocket and toss up a apple and then a hickory nut and last a good-sized and dangerously ripe tomato olly catch they dexterously with a yell of delight and be immediately rush at by three of the nearest lady and order not to make a noise for phebe be to be keep perfectly quiet such doings would never be permit a moment if she have only be in dr harrison 's hand say mr upjohn in denunciatory tone he would have forbid she to see any one it be scandalous it be outrageous add mr hardcastle most inconsiderate ah i can not get over it that it be not you leg poor dear murmured miss delano still plaintively overcome and you will walk after all dr denni be a excellent physician say mr dexter somewhat defiantly it be impossible not to enter the list against mr upjohn this last lady be immediately up in arm and a heated discussion as to the respective skill of the two practitioner take place everybody gradually take side with one or the other of the leader and forget both poor exhaust phebe and the noise downstairs which finally culminate in a rousing lullaby lead by bell and lustily second by half a dozen other : slumber on phebe

breath be relief really come at last yes soeur angélique stand in the door-way will you excuse I lady she say in that soft irresistible voice of hers as she lay aside bonnet and shawl in a quiet business-like way i come to relieve miss vernor and play nurse for a while and i think phebe look as if she need a little sleep if you will kindly take leave of she i will darken the room at once she stand so evidently wait for they to go that in a few moment they all find themselves somehow or other outside the door with gerald politely escort they down-stair and olly dancing joyously ahead cry that mr halloway have send for he to the rectory leave mistress of the situation mr whittridge proceed to draw down the shades straighten the chair smooth the bedclothes and rearrange the pillow all

stop and she come toward he hold out she hand i want to thank you for you kindness of the other night i believe i be ungrateful and perhaps rude at the time and i have not see you since to apologize pray do not speak of it say denham flushing a little as he take she hand there be no occasion whatever for gratitude and therefore no possible lack of it i trust you be quite well now there _ be _ occasion for gratitude persist gerald or at least for a acknowledgment of you kindness and it be because i be ashamed of my remissness that i take this first opportunity to thank you you embarrass I say denham laughingly i be not at all accustom to have public restitution make I in this manner and especially for purely imaginary slight but may i not be permit now -- as a sort of reward if you will -- to inquire if you have quite recover at least i have sufficiently recover to retract my disbelief in kitchen soap and -- and in you skill she add with a little visible effort you honor we above we desert -- the soap and I answer denham playfully i do not know how deleteriously it may affect the soap but as for I i feel myself grow alarmingly conceit so good-night what a very elaborate apology say de forest as denham go out if the offence be at all proportionate i tremble to think of the enormity of you crime or be it because he be a reverend that you demean yourself so humbly before he halloway be still hunting for he hat in the hall and could scarcely help overhear de forest 's remark and gerald 's answer i demean myself before nobody in seek to make amends for a previous neglect the humiliation be in the misconduct not in the confession of it and whether i owe the apology to mr halloway or to a beggar in the street i should have make it quite the same not at all for sake of he pardon but simply for sake of clear my own conscience not at all for sake of my pardon say denham as he stride on toward the church with the uncomfortable sensation of have be a involuntary eavesdropper it be fortunate that my conceit be only veneer on the follow Sunday gerald be in church both morning and evening sit in phebe 's accustomed place she be one of those noticeable presence impossible to overlook and as denham mount into the pulpit he feel as if he be preach solely to she or rather as if hers be the only criticism he fear in all the friendly congregation he be annoy that he should feel so and quite conscious at the same time that he be far from do he best and once or twice he catch a flash in the serious eye fasten on he face that seem to say she know this last fact too and be impatient with he for it what excuse have any one in gerald 's eye for not do he best always de forest be with she in the evening and as halloway come out of the vestry after service he find himself directly behind they he be not a mighty orator de forest be say with he cynical drawl i doubt if he be destine to be one of the pillar or even one of the cushion of the church he be not do he best to-night answer gerald thank you say halloway come quickly to she side anxious to avoid further eavesdropping thank you -- i mean for think i might do better that be not much to be grateful for i be afraid reply gerald since it imply you know that you have not do well i hope you like uncompromise truth mr halloway say de forest lean forward to look at he across gerald it be the only kind miss vernor deal in i prefer it infinitely to the most flattering falsehood imaginable answer denham i believe clergyman be usually the last people to hear the truth about themselves continue gerald they position at the head of a community pre-suppose they capability for the office and naturally place they outside of the criticism of those under they immediate charge who be nevertheless just the one best qualify to judge they but of course scholar may not teach the teacher what a invaluable opening for you who be _ not _ one of mr halloway 's flock say de forest to undertake to remedy the deficiency and to be in yourself a whole critical public to he a licensed _ free press _ as it be point out all he error with the most unhesitating frankness and unsparing perspicuity do you think you love of truth would hold out long under such a crucial test ask gerald turn quite seriously to denham the moonlight shone full on she clear-cut cameo-like face she eye with they shadowy fringe look deeper and blacker than midnight it do not seem possible that truth speak by she could be any thing but beautiful too denham smile down at she seriousness try I well then it seem to I you do not often enough try to do you best you be contented to do well and not ambitious to do better you be quite satisfied so i think if you sermon be good enough to please generally instead of seek to raise you standard all the time by hard effort toward improvement and i doubt therefore if at the end of a year you sermon will show any marked change from what they be to-day be i too hard you be very just answer denham pleasantly though the blood mount to he face you have find out my weak spot i confess i be not ambitious i aspire to no greatness of any kind you have discover the secret of contentment say de forest with effusive approbation i be glad to have meet you mr halloway you be the one happy man i know the secret of contentment repeat gerald say rather the principle of all stagnation mental and spiritual not to aspire to become greater than one _ can _ be be to fall short of become all that one _ may _ be to be satisfy with one 's power be to dwarf they hopelessly a powerful argument against conceit reflect de forest still upon my word i think i would as lief be conceit in every pore as eternally in a state of dissatisfaction with myself about every thing it be well above all i think to have a just appreciation of one 's own power or lack of power say denham slowly ambition without the corresponding strength to gratify it be a cruel taskmaster how can you tell till you have try that there be no corresponding strength ask gerald turn full upon he again how marvellously expressive she face be with its earnest eye and mobile mouth if i be a man -- and great heaven how i wish i be one -- i would create the strength if it be not there of itself i would force myself upward i would never rest till i have become something more than nature originally make I then heaven be thank who have spare we the monstrosity you would have develop into under the harrowing circumstance of a reversal of you sex say de forest devoutly i be always glad you be a woman now i be positively aglow with gratitude for it denham be silent they have reach mr lane 's now and gerald and she cavalier pause i have not hurt you mr halloway have i say gerald more gently i know i sometimes speak strongly where i be least qualify to do so a very womanly trait put in de forest do not apologize for you one redeeming weakness no you have not hurt I say denham in a low voice i hope you have do I good and without add even a good-night or a message for phebe he lift he hat and cross over to the rectory he sister be not there as he enter she sitting-room and throw himself down on the sofa clasp he hand over he forehead and stare thoughtfully up at the ceiling she have be sit with phebe while the lane household go to its various church phebe be tire in consequence of the entire population of

my son dick do not come of age but once ' -lrb- as if we think it be a yearly occurrence -rrb- ` and we do not celebrate it but once ' but i get hold of dick privately and wheedle it out of he in less than no time with a piece of soft gingerbread it be to be something _ stunning _ he father want to do it up in english style dinner to the tenantry and all that sort of thing only unluckily there be not any tenantry and he have to abandon the benevolent role and take to a jollier one he will not show off as well but we 'll have a deal more fun it be to be a sort of royal picnic but in the evening mind -- be not that a brilliant idea for the old gentleman we be all to go up in boat and there be to be great raft with blaze torch and a supper in the wood grander than any of mr upjohn 's and bonfire and the band from galilee and bouquet for the lady and i do not know what not and best of all unlimited opportunity for flirt it be to be _ the _ affair of this and every other season past or future it be a cry shame you can not go oh how i wish i could sigh poor phebe i make pa give I a new dress for it continue bell lean forward to pick off the biggest grape from a bunch on the table i mean to look just too-too mr de forest be go to row I up i do not know exactly how i make he ask I but i do it be such a triumph to get he away from miss vernor for once though i suspect i 'll have to pay for it by do more than half the rowing myself i do not suppose he would exert he precious self to pull a oar more than five minute at a time amy try she best to get mr halloway and so do the dexter the way those girl run after he be a caution even to I but they do not get he he be monstrously clever in keep out of people 's clutch i give he up long ago as a bad job well good-by phebe

party which be never speak of by the way as mr hardcastle 's party though upon that good lady devolve the onus of the weighty preparation it seem purely mr hardcastle 's affair just as every thing do in which he be in any way concerned impromptu meeting be hold at every house in turn to discuss the come event and the latest bit of information regard it be retail with embellishment proportionate to the imagination of the accidental narrator not a soul in joppa but know every propose feature of the entertainment better than the host themselves the old people say it would be damp and rheumatic and would certainly be the death of they the young people say it would be divine and quite worth die for the people who be neither old nor young say nobody could tell how it would be till after it be over and they feel it they duty to go to look after the other the day come brilliantly clear and soft and warm : such a day in short as mr hardcastle have feel to be he due and have expect of the element all along as the one token of regard in they power to accord he and he accept he friend ' congratulation upon it with a grave bow which seem to say : i order it so pray do you suppose i have forget to attend to the weather the sun set in a cloudless heaven the evening star hang quiver over the green-topped hill the twilight drop noiseless and fragrant over earth and water and the long-dreamed-of moment have arrive at last just let I have one more look at you gerald before you start say phebe wistfully oh how beautiful you look nobody 's dress ever fit like yours and that great dark-red hat and feather -- i think i should not like it -- but it make a perfect picture of you for pity 's sake do stop begged gerald you know of all thing i hate compliment where 's that boy olly he be come to I later i promise to make up to he for he not go to the party poor little fellow phebe dear say gerald suddenly stoop to give she one of she rare kiss i can not bear to leave you all alone so that miserable miss lydium and olly be not any sort of company let I stay with you i have a great deal rather oh no no no cry phebe almost push she toward the door i do not mind a bit be leave and i would not have you stay for anything how lovely of you to propose it you be a angel gerald even though you do not like be tell so good-by and -- gerald -- she have follow she friend out into the hall and stand lean against the banister -- gerald dear will you tell mr halloway i be go down-stair to-morrow halloway be to be gerald 's escort that evening and stand wait for she now in the hall below and look up at sound of phebe 's voice he give a exclamation of surprise and pleasure and immediately spring up the stair miss phebe he say take both she hand in he how glad i be to see you once more phebe shrink back from he with a little cry of dismay ah when do ever any thing happen exactly as we plan it shall she have picture this meeting to herself over and over again during the long day of she seclusion -- just what he would say and what she would say and just how she would dress on that first day when she go down-stair she mean to look so particularly nice on that first day and now to be catch in she plain little gray flannel wrapper with its simple red trimming she hair all loose and mussy and even she very oldest slipper on -- and with gerald standing beside she in she rich dainty become attire as if to make the contrast all the more painfully striking poor little cinderellum phebe she look up at denham almost ready to cry and say never a word it have be such a long long time he say still hold she hand i do not know how we have make out to spare you we shall not have to spare she much longer say gerald she be come down-stair to-morrow and then halloway drop phebe 's hand and turn to gerald hold out a hand to she forgive I for not even notice you miss vernor at first i could only see miss phebe do not gerald look nice ask phebe try to choke back the uncomfortable lump rise so unreasonably in she throat halloway move back a little and look at gerald who stand fasten she long glove utterly unconscious or unheedful of he scrutiny the light in the niche at the head of the stair throw its full glow over both she and phebe yes he answer quietly after a imperceptible pause and as he turn back to phebe it seem to she that he eye glance over she with a suddenly awaken consciousness of the wrapper and the tumbled hair and even of the little worn-out slipper you look pale he say kindly i know i be wrong to keep you stand here just because it be so pleasant to see you again and it be easier to say good-by know i have only till to-morrow to wait now _ a demain _ good-night murmur phebe without look up good-night gerald and then she turn quickly into she room and close the door and stand stock-still behind it hold she breath and listen intently till she hear the front door close upon they and the last echo of they footstep die away in the street outside then she fling herself face downward upon the bed and cry miserably to herself out of sheer disappointment why do it have to be all so very very different from she dream chapter xi my son dick never have there be a more perfect night than that whereon dick hardcastle 's come of age be celebrate only enough wind stir to toy softly with the gay little pennon streaming from the many boat wind they way to the rendezvous and to throw dancing shadow of light upon the water from the torch at they prow all along the bank of the lake where high hill shut out the moonlight and bind the shore in a almost egyptian darkness raft be station at interval blaze with color light the sound of distant music float far down upon the air mingle with the swish of steady oar and laughter and happy voice as the occupant of the various boat call out merrily to each other across the water or here and there break into light-hearted song denham 's boat glide stilly along through all this carnival-like revelry gerald be not in a mood for talk and he feel little inclined to disturb she it be companionship enough merely to glance at she ever and anon as she sit silently in the stern the red rope of the tiller draw loosely around she slender waist like a silken girdle he wonder idly what she be think of she broad hat throw too deep a shadow for he to see she face save when they near one of the beacon raft then it be suddenly in brilliant illumination and it be impossible not to watch for these moment of revelation which light she up to such rare beauty he fancy he could almost see she thought as there flash across she face some new swift expression more speak than word -- now a noble thought he be sure now a odd fancy now a serious meditative mood that hold she every sense and faculty in thrall at once through all she revery she never forget she duty with the rudder though she quite forget she oarsman she make no effort whatever toward he entertainment and he feel sure that he could do no more toward hers than simply not to obtrude himself upon she be there many he wonder even among she choose friend -lrb- in whose rank he could not count himself -rrb- who would have enjoy this silent sail with she so much as he they near the destine spot all too soon for he and gerald at last rouse herself be we there now i have no idea it be so far it be not far enough answer denham rest a moment on he oar as he look around nothing surely can be devise even in this pleasure-ingenious society so enjoyable as i have find we evening sail why do you go to the party at all then ask gerald abruptly it be not compulsory be it after you land I be you not at liberty to row off if you prefer ah but i do not prefer halloway say gayly resume he oar i expect to be very greatly entertain there too there be almost always something to be get out of every thing and anyway i particularly like party i hate they yes because you do not care for people i like they just because i do care for people and party be but people collectively instead of individually you know by this time denham have shoot the boat up to the landing where the host of the evening stand ready to receive they dick be in a wild state of boyish hilarity profit by the novelty of he exalted position as hero of the evening boldly to take a kiss from every pretty girl in succession as he swing she to the shore it be my right to-night you know or if it be not i be major now and can make law for myself he explain complacently to any expostulatory subject and mr hardcastle rub he soft plump hand and add : never you mind never you mind my dear every dog must have he day and this be dick 's day and after all it be my son dick you know and that make it all right he do not need any other guaranty than that he be my son i be sure and see i be dick 's papa my dear why i 'll just make bold to follow suit but dick would as soon have think of offer to kiss the polar star as gerald and she be suffer to pass on unmolested to mr hardcastle who stand just beyond look fagged and jaded and as if she be heartily thankful that in all he life dick could never come of age again one of the next arrival be bell master very fine in she new dress but flush and overheate to a unbecoming degree she row up smartly ship she oar in true nautical fashion spring from the boat and hold out she hand to she companion with a hardly repress sneer : pray allow I to assist you mr de forest that gentleman get up leisurely from he cushion seat in the stern and come forward cool and comfortable to a enviable degree thanks he say with even a little more drawl than usual as he take she proffer hand this boat _ be _ a little teetery you be uncommonly kind and quite a champion oarswoman you ought to be a judge of my power by this time certainly say bell snappishly she have row the entire distance from joppa unaided yes i flatter myself that i be people can always judge best of what they do not do themselves and i will say that you do row well -- uncommonly well -- for a woman i do not know a girl except miss vernor fit to pull stroke oar to you ah mr hardcastle what a adorable evening you have provide for we mr dick hardcastle permit I to congratulate you upon attain you majority than which believe I there be but one greater blessing in the world -- that of minority i see you have not yet abandon all the privilege of the latter however he add as dick catch bell round the waist and give she a sound salute on the cheek that be a alleviation it seem unfair to monopolize bell laugh and box dick 's ear whereupon he speedily kiss she again and mr hardcastle chuckle and pull one of the long light braid hang over she back bell 's blonde hair with she black eye be she strong point and she invariably dress it à la kenwig when she wear a hat none of miss bell 's light run any danger of ever be hide under a bushel ha ha laugh mr hardcastle it be all right it be only dick you know my son dick and bless my heart the boy 's good taste too he inherit it take my arm or let I take yours muttered de forest to bell as mr hardcastle turn away and do let 's get through it with he good lady do you suppose she 'll kiss I get she to make it easy for I will not you where now ask bell undecidedly after the due politeness with the hostess have be exchange the wood be fairly ablaze with bonfire and hang lantern make a strangely brilliant and fantastic scene here and there rug be spread out on the grass for the older people to congregate upon in gossip group while the young one have speedily convert a large smooth spot of lawn into a impromptu dancing-ground and be whirling merrily away to the music of the band in the very face of the scandalize mr upjohn this last field of action be the first to attract bell 's quick eye oh come she say of course you dance de forest give a shudder my dear young lady no sane man ever dance but pray do not let I detain you where you heart be there would you foot be also he drop she arm as he speak bell shrug she shoulder and put she arm back in he ` tis not fair to abandon you so soon after bring you here there be janet mudge -lrb- hastily select as the plainest girl present and the farthest from gerald toward whom de forest 's step be manifestly direct themselves -rrb- let 's go and speak to she on the contrary let we avoid she by every means in we power say de forest imperturbably walk bell off in the opposite direction i never choose pearl when i may have diamond there be miss vernor we 'll go and speak with she but i do not want to object bell crossly i be not at all as fond of miss vernor as you be naturally not answer de forest pursue he way undisturbed man always like girl better than girl do i appreciate you feeling but she be get that good-looking young minister with she you like he all feminine soul incline to clergymen next to officer button first then surplice thirdly for -lrb- r -rrb- ester i suppose suggest bell saucily undoubtedly assent she companion miss vernor you humble servant he glance as it invaribly do when they meet seem to make swift approbative note of every smallest particular of she appearance mr halloway here be a young lady who have just openly inform I that she prefer you to I so i suppose i must resign she to you with what grace i can do not you think miss vernor you might try to divert my mind from dwelling too cruelly on miss master ' defalcation by show I what mr hardcastle 's grand intellect have devise for my entertainment that bonfire yonder have a sort of cannibalistic look about it suggestive of dance negro and unmentionable feast behind the flame shall we inspect it nearer and he march gerald deliberately away scarcely remember to bow to bell still to be leave with mr halloway be by no mean a unenviable fate and bell like the wise girl she be proceed to make the most of it without delay and parade she prey wherever she choose find he much more tractable than she last companion and not in the least dictatorial as to the direction he go in that out-door evening party be long remember as one of the most novel and successful entertainment ever give in joppa even mr upjohn admit it to be very well very well indeed all but the dancing for which however mr hardcastle apologize to she handsomely as a quite unexpected ebullition of youthful spirit which in he soul he be far from countenance and upon which she resolutely turn she back all the evening so at least not to be a eye-witness of the indecorum of course therefore she know nothing whatever about it when mr upjohn toward the end of the evening actually allow himself to be decoy into the gay whirl by one of the youngest and most daring of the girl and gallop clumsily around like a sportive and giddy elephant set free for the first time in its native jungle and find it very much to its like he daughter marium faithfully at she mother 's side sit with one ear grudgingly lend to the prosy heaviness of mr webb 's light talk and she whole face turn longingly toward the spot where the happy sinner be gyrate and see she father there she round eye grow rounder than ever as she watch in breathless alarm lest the earth should open under he foot in instant retribution gracious if ma should turn she head but there be some wrong it be best to ignore altogether where prevention be hopeless and mr upjohn like many another good woman always know when not to see so she persistently do not see now and mr upjohn spin away to he heart 's content -lrb- prudently keep in the remotest corner of the sward to be sure -rrb- wink at marium every now and then in the highest glee and once absolutely sign to she to sneak over to he and try a turn too and then come supper-time and such a supper set all confectioner and doctor at defiance at once mr upjohn red and perspire and remark how curiously hot the bonfire make the wood at night wait on he wife with gallant solicitude lest she should leave a single dish untasted mr bruce have leave town the day before and in the absence of any new admiration he always fall back with perfect content upon he old allegiance mr upjohn receive he devotion as calmly as he intermittent neglect and only raise she eyebrow when he stoop to whisper my love you be the most handsomely dress woman here which be strictly true as regard the material of she attire and unblushingly false as regard the blending of they dick have be in he element all the evening he have have a serio-comic flirtation with every girl in turn he have cut out jake dexter with nellie atterbury and make it up to he friend by offer he a lock of bell 's hair which he have surreptitiously cut from she hanging braid and which jake wear pin in he button hole as a trophy for the rest of the evening to the immense scandal of everybody but with the supper-hour dick 's spirit ebb he know poor fellow what fate hold in store he father intend make a few remark over he as a sort of substitute for he defraud speech to the non-existing tenantry stand by I jake there be a man whisper dick forlornly to he crony i will dick like a woman jake respond tenderly and the two stand together just at mr hardcastle 's elbow as that worthy advanced to a central spot between the bonfire clear he throat ominously and pirouett solemnly around hold up he hand to attract general attention my friend begin mr hardcastle swell with the importance of the moment to even more than he usual rotundity this have be a day of day to I all of you who be parent will appreciate my feeling of mingled pride and humility -- of pride and humility repeat mr hardcastle please with the antithesis and sway gently back and forth as i stand here before you with my son the boy whom i have watch over from he cradle up with a unsleeping eye and whose tender foot -- dick here stoop over to inspect those honest able member jake do the same with evident disapproval of they mr hardcastle raise he voice -- whose tender foot i have endeavor from he youth up so far as lay in my limited power to guide in the way that i hope he may never depart from this boy i now present to you friend a man -- this boy who have grow up among you whom you all know and whom i hope you all harbor some kindly feel for -- this boy -- he put out he hand to draw he forward dick give jake a gentle push toward the hand and vanish and mr hardcastle quite unconscious of the maneuver draw the grinning jake solemnly up to he and cast around a look of triumph which seem to say : do better than this friend if you can place he hand on jake 's shoulder with he grandest air and continue sonorously -- my son lady and gentleman -- my son dick there be a moment 's pause of consternation among the guest and a suppress scream from the defraud mother dexter mr hardcastle slowly turn he radiant face toward he supposed son and immediately drop he hand and exclaim in entirely altered and most natural tone of amazement : well i never how in the world do _ you _ get here jake dexter a shout instantly go up all round even mr hardcastle himself be overcome with the ludicrousness of the mistake and further solemnity be impossible a signal be give and from a barge far out on the water a score of rocket shoot hiss into the air announce the beginning of firework a brilliant display of these follow close the evening 's entertainment and immediately afterward a large raft be tow up to the landing and the whole merry party embark and return to joppa together the band follow on another boat and treat they to music all the way halloway stand near gerald in the crowd but he do not attempt to join she until the raft reach the pier and be make fast then he quietly go to she and offer he arm de forest step up at the same moment miss vernor will you condescend to accept of my valuable escort home i beg you pardon interrupted denham i be miss vernor 's escort to-night de forest stand still i do not know it be a return-ticket arrangement it be answer denham decidedly you can hardly expect I to relinquish my rights i should say you rights depend wholly on miss vernor 's choice fair lady two heart and four arm be at you immediate disposal if you could make up you volatile mind to determine between they -- there can be no question of choice say gerald quietly i accept mr halloway 's escort yesterday so good-night you leave I a blighted being say de forest for the peace of my soul let I ascribe you decision to a love of justice rather than of individual _ au revoir _ halloway draw gerald 's hand through he arm with a very comfortable feeling of possession and they walk on some time in silence be you tire he ask at last no -- yes party always tire I and life in joppa consist of party do you always go oh always you mental constitution must be robust to stand such a steady strain upon it the shepherd must keep by he sheep you know laugh denham i think the shepherd be to lead the sheep not to be lead by they do not you hope to inspire they with a love for better thing i fancy the province of a clergyman be to improve people -- not just to preach to they a shadow cross denham 's face there be many of they more fit to improve I than i they he say humbly how would you have I begin with make mr hardcastle less offensively pompous and mr hardcastle less tedious and mr upjohn less dogmatic and mrs anthony more sincere and miss delano less namby-pamby -- in short by take a little of the superficiality and narrow-mindedness and provinciality out of the place if possible denham toss back he head with a light laugh ah how you relieve my mind most of those whom you have so scathingly describe belong to other congregation and be therefore beyond my jurisdiction do you really feel so be you so like a physician ask gerald quickly do you seek to do good only to those who pay for the care you give they be not you mission with all with whom you be throw the day of single-handed combat against the world be over answer denham you cripple a man by give he too wide a field of action i would not take less than the widest be i a man exclaim gerald proudly would you be a clergyman no i have no talent for write i could not preach nay i think you a admirable preacher say denham gently without the faintest tinge of sarcasm in either tone or look gerald glance at he quickly and flush slightly i be too dogmatic myself she say bite she lip and turn away she head i should not be so hard on mr upjohn you do not intend to be hard on any one but to be just be to seem hard say gerald it be a divine prerogative to know just how far to temper justice with mercy denham answer i suppose none of we can hope to attain to perfect knowledge but if there must be error i would for myself rather err in excess of mercy than of justice in other word between two evil you would choose the least gerald reply that be the common way of get out of the difficulty but it seem to I like compromise with evil there ought to be always some third wholly right way out of every dilemma if only one seek earnestly enough she speak more as if to herself than to he then perhaps say denham pleasantly we may hope that you will in time light upon the very kindliest and rightest way combine of judge not only abstract subject but also the not altogether unworthy inhabitant of even this little place of joppa oh joppa cry gerald all the impatience instantly come back to she face and voice as instantly too she frown in self-conviction and turn almost contritely to denham you see mr halloway i shall have to bring my own character first to that future day of judgment and to be very careful that i do _ not _ err on you side -- in be too merciful chapter xii why do summer rose fade a few more day slip by easily and swiftly as all day do in joppa the famous party be discuss and re-discuss down to its minutest detail mr hardcastle recover from she subsequent attack of neuralgia mr hardcastle who go from house to house gathering compliment as a assessor levy tax complete the round of the village and begin again mrs upjohn ask for and obtain the recipe of a certain dish the like of which have never before be see in joppa and the joppite commend she boldness in ask and condemn mr hardcastle 's weakness in give the report that mr upjohn have apostatize from the

not sure -- that she tell he to change he boot lest he foot should be damp everybody have also find out beyond discussion or doubt that de forest be gerald 's escort home on that occasion but that the engagement between they be break off it be definitely know that he have say he be a blighted being and should shortly take a return ticket to new york everybody say it be a shame when they be so manifestly cut out for each other in fact every thing have be find out about every thing the evening have be talk threadbare and alas there be nothing else to talk about phebe 's reappearance downstairs unscarred and bonnie as ever be become a old story long since and dr denni ' treatment of the case be now admit to have be the very best possible next to what dr harrison 's treatment would have be though by all mean it be decide dr denni and _ not _ dr harrison should have be call in when mr brown the grocer fall ill of a fever poor joppa be indeed fairly talk out it have to settle down upon the fever and mr brown for lack of any thing else it be really almost a godsend when mr brown take the fever too for it give joppa just twice as much to talk about and everybody say it be somebody 's duty to see that the poor soul have right advice in the matter jabez brown jr carry on the business in he father 's stead and measure out he sugar and tea at so much advice the pound and do a thriving business but the poor old father die all the same he be a respectable honest man and all he customer attend he funeral in the most neighborly way in the world with a grim look upon they sympathetic countenance of i tell you so it should have be dr denni yes to all but phebe she illness and long imprisonment and she return to matter-of-fact life downstairs be a tame-enough story now but to she it be as the opening chapter of a new history life seem change and strange to she when she step back into it and take up again the duty and labor that she have lay by only so lately have she dream herself into another world or why be it so hard to put herself back into the place she have step out of everybody about she be the same nothing have really change in any way and certainly she have not neither have gerald neither have mr halloway what have she expect what be it she have vaguely look forward to what be it that be so different pray what be you think of denham ask suddenly one day turn to she with he bright sweet smile you have be quiet for very long so have you be quiet return phebe i do not think i have be any less talkative than you perhaps not say denham we be leave soeur angélique and miss vernor to have a regular tête-à-tête of it be we not but you evade my question in a very unbecoming way miss phebe tell I what be you thinking of i do not quite know answer phebe slowly but i think i be wish for impossibility -- for thing that can not possibly happen just because it would be so nice if they could ah say halloway dreamily that be a very bad habit a frightfully unsatisfactory delusive and indeed a altogether pernicious habit miss phebe it take the taste out of every thing solid and leave one a appetite only for indigestible sweet i must correct you of it i will just as soon that be as i have break myself of it will you wait till i have take myself in hand they be together sit in a little recess of the rectory parlor while mr whittridge and gerald be talk at the farther end of the room soeur angélique have invite the two girl to tea and halloway when he come in from he study seat himself at once by phebe though after he warm greet and self-congratulation upon have she back in she old haunt he have fall into quite a unusual silence phebe be look very sweet and fresh that afternoon all the care that she have mean to devote to she toilet upon the occasion of she first meeting with halloway she have expend in dress herself for this visit to the rectory never have she shine hair be braid so glossily or coax into wave more prettily about she forehead never have the simple etcetera of she dress be more studiously select and more carefully put together look in the glass when all be do she have be fain to confess that she really do look nice for once though she reproach herself immediately afterward in severest term for the unpardonable vanity of the thought and make a little grimace at she own image to effectually dispel the illusion what could it ever matter how she look and particularly how could it matter when gerald be by -- gerald who possess that rare and enviable gift of always look she best so phebe put the subject of she look entirely away from she mind and lean back on the sofa she hand fold idly in she lap feeling perfectly content with the pass moment and ask nothing from the future but that it might be always now what more could she want the room hold she three dearest friend in the world -- gerald soeur angélique and mr halloway -- of course one should always put lady before gentleman even only in think how handsome gerald look as she stand with she head slightly bent forward listen to mr whittridge if gerald do not choose to listen no one could ever force she to lend a ear but when she do so choose she listen with she whole mind and be lose to all else phebe smile with quiet amusement at she friend 's intensity in every thing and turn with the smile on she face to halloway he be not smile at all but he too be look fixedly at gerald it have be lovely have she here but how we shall miss she shall we not when she go say phebe softly go repeat halloway blankly it be scarcely September yet what have you not hear exclaimed phebe do you not know gerald have be send for she and olly go back next Thursday Thursday echo halloway in a sort of stunned way so soon go for good Thursday what closely guard secret do the loving gray eye fasten upon he read in the swift uncontrollable look that flash suddenly across he face like the lightning that leap out of the dark by night lay all earth bare in one brief vivid glimpse he be so take by surprise as to be completely off guard it be but a instant and with a start he recover himself i have not hear you news he say with perfect quiet reach out to the table for a uncut magazine and proceed leisurely to open its page i suppose it be a sign that summer be over when the bird begin to fly home phebe do not answer immediately in that one short moment all she face have change also as by the stroke of a wand its brightness and sweet content have give place to a expression of unutterable weariness she get up and go to the window standing with she back to halloway we have we first cold night that evening of my accident she say with a effort to speak very calmly i think the summer really end then chapter xiii joppa 's trial it be the night before gerald 's departure and a number of people stray into mr lane 's parlor to bid the fair traveller god-speed she have not be at all a popular guest but that be no reason why joppa should lack in any possible courtesy toward she little as she appreciate the magnanimity of its conduct very sorry to lose you very say mr hardcastle take she hand in the soft warm grasp that gerald so particularly detest but maybe it be as well you be go joppa be not the place it use to be here 's mr anthony 's get the fever to-night and there be a poor family down in the village as have all get it denni say and i notice that little nellie atterbury have monstrous red cheek when dick and i pass she to-night and indeed i cross the street to avoid she in case she might be go to have the fever too where one have a family one have duty one would never feel for one 's self so i say my dear it be as well you be go if only on account of that boy of yours we must all learn early to sacrifice ourselves for we child olly be not my child say gerald twist she handkerchief around she hand to efface the remembrance of mr hardcastle 's touch hey ah yes to be sure he be you brother but it be all one you stand in the light of a parent to he just now my dear he be actually go to pat gerald paternally on the shoulder but she move abruptly aside and he pull olly 's ear instead it be necessary to do something with he outstretched hand before draw it back olly be play cat 's - cradle with the good-natured mr upjohn and merely kick out at he caresser as a warning that he be not to be interrupted fine spirited boy mutter mr upjohn under he breath very fine will make a man some day not so big as you though i will not be when i be a man declare olly you be too fat now just hear he exclaim mr upjohn shake all over with corpulent mirth maybe you would rather be like mr webb then no i would not neither retort olly nothing deter by that gentleman 's presence from a frank exposure of he sentiment he be too lean he be leaner than any thing he be just like the blade of my pocket-knife with clothes on oh crickey it be conveniently discover at this crisis that it be olly 's bedtime and he be with some difficulty convey from the parlor follow by a angry glare from gerald and a severely truthful comment from mr upjohn de forest outstay the rest of the leave-taker phebe think it hard when she so want to have gerald all to herself on this last evening and she wonder too that halloway have not come to say good-by he come in however at last flushed and tired apologize for the lateness of he call say he have be send for by two of he parishioner who be also down with the fever it look something like a epidemic remark gerald i be really rather glad we be go you have no ambition to remain and turn florence nightingale then ask de forest not in the slightest it be a role i be eminently unfitted for i detest sick people not always i think gerald say phebe with a grateful glance which gerald return with one of real though undemonstrative tenderness you case be very different phebe i should think it would be extremely difficult to detest miss phebe under even the must aggravate circumstance say halloway smile frankly at she hallo who be this it be olly bootless and coatless whom the sound of halloway 's voice have bring down from the midst of he slow preparation for bed to bid he friend good-by and who spring upon he with a rush of suffocating affection what would mr upjohn say drawl de forest gerald rise at once to send off the child with a reprimand and remain standing after he have go de forest rise too and slowly come toward she i suppose i have better leave you to follow olly up-stair i wish you to be fresh to entertain I during to-morrow 's tedious journey what do you go back to-morrow too ask gerald in surprise i think you be to stay till next week i be afraid of the fever pronounce de forest with great gravity he handsome eye fasten on she face i be run away from it i do not think it safe to stay another day in the place gerald color a little -- not at he word but he look then i suppose i need not bid you good-by she say turn away she seem almost embarrassed good-night oh but gerald -- mr halloway you must say good-by to he you know say phebe distressed surely i forget reply gerald with uncomplimentary sincerity she turn back the faint shade of confusion quite disappear good-by mr halloway i wish you success in find all the nightingale that you may require thank you answer denham shortly good-by phebe glance up at he quickly she notice a shade of bitterness in he voice for the first time he say nothing more and drop gerald 's hand almost immediately de forest bent forward and raise it be i to be defraud of a good-night miss vernor simply because it be not my good-by _ au revoir _ it seem to phebe that he hold gerald 's hand a instant longer when she would have withdraw it and that she permit or at least do not resent it and before release it he stoop and touch she finger lightly with he lip _ au revoir _ he say again halloway turn abruptly to phebe good-night he speak almost brusquely and go directly away without offer he hand or look at any of they again phebe follow gerald into she room when the two girl go up-stair and sit watch she friend 's quick movement as she complete some last arrangement for the journey it be strangely unlike phebe not to offer to help she but somehow gerald look so strong and able and self-sufficient and she herself feel so tired and weak to-night how quiet you be say gerald folding a soft shawl smoothly over the top of a tray have not you any last message to give I be not there any thing you would like I to do for you in new york nothing thank you you be sure well now i be through and must not keep you up longer you have all be exceedingly kind phebe both to myself and that troublesome olly i appreciate it even though i do not say as much about it as perhaps some would have you really enjoy it here gerald have you be happy will you miss we a little -- just a little -- when you be go i shall miss _ you _ child of course you constitute joppa to I you know and indeed i have enjoy it here very much and it have do olly a world of good good-night dear phebe have she arm about she friend at once clasp she close o gerald gerald i think it be almost better to have no friend at all it be so hard -- so cruelly hard -- to part with they and -- and to lose they o gerald parting with they be not lose they you foolish sentimentalist return gerald gently unclasp phebe 's arm now go to bed you look wear out just tell I once first gerald that you love I i have not many to love I i need all you love of course i love you say gerald you know it without my say so and do not talk so foolishly i never know a girl with more friend now good-night phebe kiss she very quietly and then creep into olly 's room and sit down on he bed olly dear she murmur be you asleep the little fellow spring up and fling he arm closely around she neck embrace collar ruffle and ribbon in one all-comprehensive destruction do you love I do you love I do you love I whisper phebe half laughing and half cry as she strain he to she heart oh olly dear i do want some one just to say so i do i do i do and i do say olly with a bear 's hug at each assertion blest if i do not that be what mr upjohn say when i ask he if he do not want some taffy ` blest if i do not ' i guess it be a swear 'cause he say i must not tell mr upjohn he say so not to the longest day i live the longest day will not come now till next year the twenty-first of June that be the longest day be not it mr halloway teach I that my do not he know a lot i be go to be like he when i be a man that be who i be go to be like and i be go to love you always he love you too do not he pheeb no dear answer phebe still laugh and cry together and rock gently back and forth with the boy in she arm he do not at all there do not any body really love I i think but just you but you do do not you dear bet on it say olly with forcible vulgarity god bless you say phebe very softly as she put the boy back in the bed and lay she wet cheek on he god bless you now and always forever and ever amen whisper olly back with a impression that phebe be say she prayer over he and oh i say pheeb can not you let we have some of that jelly cake with raisin in it to take with we for luncheon to-morrow and phebe promise she would and laugh and go away feel somehow a little comfort and so gerald and olly and de forest all disappear from the scene together and shortly after the dexter go to morocco on a visit and the master adjourn to bethany to do they fall shopping and there be whispering around that something be wrong there be more and more talk of the fever of how it ought to be check and why it have not be check and what would be the dire consequence if it be not check the summer guest all slip quietly away leave joppa alone to its grow trouble every day bring some new case sometimes a death and people begin to look suspiciously at each other in the street and to avoid each other on the flimsiest pretext miss lydium cry helplessly in she room and say she be sure she should take it and die of it mr hardcastle find he be too busy at home to have time for neighborly visit and go around the block rather than pass a door where he see the doctor 's gig when one have a family one owe it duty that should not be neglect mr upjohn declare the panic to be ridiculous _ she _ should not be scare away by a red flag like a crow from a cornfield there have never be a case of typhoid know in joppa and place be like people they never break out with disease that be not already in they constitution it be all arrant nonsense however she be perfectly willing that marium should make that propose visit to she aunt in boston if she like and it be quite proper that mr upjohn in the character of gallant father should escort she there the girl could not go alone so every day see some new flight from the village the doctor begin to look overworked and very grave and mr hardcastle appear less and less outside he gate and take to walk always in the middle of the street whence he could wave a salutation to he pass friend without stop to speak to they dick say he would like to see the fever catch _ he _ and pursue the rough tenor of he way fearlessly as of old though he assure he anxious father that it be wholly because nellie atterbury live in the healthiest quarter of the town that he spend so much of he time at she house there be no use deny or qualify it a epidemic of typhoid fever have steal upon joppa as a thief in the night and there be no know what house it would not enter next to rob it of its dearest and best through all this slowly increase alarm phebe lane have be live as in a dream it be as if she find herself back in that old life before she know halloway when people bore she and when there seem nothing worth do or worth look forward to though the day be so full of duty she have be at the rectory but once since gerald leave and that be to the bible-class and when mr whittridge have try to detain she afterward she have plead some press business at home though chance to look out of she window a little later soeur angélique be almost sure that through the closed shutter in phebe 's room she see a dim shadow of the girl 's head lay down listlessly on she fold arm on the sill but when the epidemic reach its height phebe seem suddenly to awaken from she languor and rouse herself to action here be something worth do at last once more she soft sweet whistle sound bird-like through the house the spring come back to she step the brightness to she eye and more than the old tenderness to she voice as she go from one shun sick-room to another like a living sunbeam bring the freshness of a may morning with she and seem always to come solely for she own pure pleasure and when poor motherless janet mudge be strike down too with the dreaded disease and have no one but servant to care for she she own aunt who live in joppa be afraid to so much as go to the house to ask after she it seem perfectly natural to everybody that phebe lane who have no care at home and no one really dependent upon she should quietly install herself as janet 's nurse it be a very proper and natural thing for phebe to do everybody say and think no more about it it be so manifestly a duty send direct from heaven label for phebe lane i meet dr denni to-day say halloway one afternoon come into he sister 's room and throw himself wearily down on the sofa he say janet mudge be better -- be really go to get well soeur angélique put aside she work and come to sit by the sofa and stroke she boy 's head if the doctor be overworked and spend so too be he the hour of trial have not find he want he unambitious simple spirit that seek no wider duty than merely to fulfil the moment 's call as he best could meet and conquer a stress of work that would have dishearten many a bolder hero he never think of it in the light of duty at all there be nothing heroic or high-minded about it it be simply what in the nature of thing he be bind to do wherever he be want he go and because where he go he bring such sunny cheer and such sympathetic help and such bright kindly way he be wanted everywhere not only those of he own parish but those of the other church too come to look to mr halloway as the one whose visit help they the most in any season of trial among the poor he be hold a minister angel and supplement by soeur angélique as a unseen force often prove one in truth while he bright face do they more good they say than a power of sermon and no one ever think the less of he because he seem so much more the friend than the pastor and do no preaching at all so janet be better say soeur angélique toy caressingly with the wavy brown hair toss over he forehead now i hope we shall see more of we phebe again what a little heroine she be a perfectly unconscious one answer halloway lazily submit himself to the fondle hand she think it the most matter-of-fact thing in the world that she should play sister of charity to other people 's sick and never expect so much as a thank-you from they she be a lovely character say mr whittridge warmly she be indeed assent she brother a rare character she be one in a thousand i can not but compare she sometimes with she friend gerald vernor continue mr whittridge and despite miss vernor 's beauty and she power which make itself feel even by I still it be always to phebe 's advantage halloway get up and begin slowly pacing the room with a odd smile upon he lip always to phebe 's advantage he repeat yes she be by far the more amiable the more unselfish the more lovable the better worth loving of the two she be all heart she be brim over with affection and must speak it or die while gerald be colder than stone -- than ice she be so cold she burn she remind one of star in mid-winter of icicle in the moonlight of any thing eminently frigid and brilliant and remote i daresay despite all she beauty and she talent and even with she wealth throw in she will have comparatively few lover yet those few will be truer to she through all she coldness and she disfavor than the lover of many a sweeter girl do i say phebe be one in a thousand well miss vernor be one in nine hundred and ninety-nine -- or one in ten thousand -- i do not know which you say phebe be the better worth loving of the two say mr whittridge come to walk up and down the room with he and clasp she hand over he arm i use to think -- i fancied you care for the child -- that you would care for she denham stand still and face he sister very gravely i be grow to care for she soeur angélique he say i believe i would have love she if -- if gerald vernor have not come here when she do oh denham yes soeur angélique it be a humiliating confession be it not that one have wilfully throw away something that perhaps one might have have for something that one know one can never have it be sheerest folly and to do it with one 's eye open be the maddest folly of all gerald vernor be as indifferent to I as it be possible for one human creature to be to another i hold no more place in she thought than have i never exist and yet soeur angélique i be fool enough -- or helpless enough -- whichever you please to love she i love she not for what she be to I but for what she be in herself for what she really be rather than for what she seem -- for the strength and the heroism of she heart which i see through all the glaring commonplace fault which she be at no pain to hide or perhaps i only love she because it be mean that i should be it as it may i do love she and as passionately as entirely and as hopelessly as it be possible for man to love o denham denham my boy denham lay he hand lightly on he sister 's lip now we have have a sufficiency of heroics for once indeed for always he say with a wholly altered voice life have enough of solemnity in it and in spare without we add aught to it we will not speak of this again if you please folly be always best forget but soeur angélique if you imagine I to be a blighted be if you think i walk the floor in the dead of night tear my hair and call on all the star to witness the unearthly gloom in my rack bosom you be utterly mistaken i do nothing of the kind i be not blighted at all my damask cheek be not go to be prey upon nor shall i take to a excess of tobacco and poetry i have make a mistake but i mean to sing over it -- not weep over it -- and to become a stronger and better man if possible for have be so weak a one and phebe say soeur angélique great tear stand in she eye i hope -- denham place both hand on he sister 's shoulder soeur angélique you must bury those hope in the grave loving gerald vernor never now or in the future shall i have one word of love for any other woman but for she i should have come perhaps to love phebe with this same love perhaps -- who know -- phebe might so have love I as it be -- soeur angélique you know what i be you know if i be likely to deceive myself gerald vernor have change my life for always what might have be now can never be he stand still a moment look full at she it be wonderful how resolute and firm and yet brave and gentle too those merry brown eye of he could become soeur angélique sigh and shake she head softly he stoop and kiss she then turn away say : now that chapter have be read through to the end woe be to he who turn back the page and it be time i go to call on poor widow brown soeur angélique stand in the window as a moment later he pass by he kiss he hand to she with a gay smile and go on but she still stand there with the tear well and well in she eye till they fall gently over upon she cheek she do not heed they she be so busy with she thought poor phebe she say softly to herself my poor little phebe but perhaps -- with time -- chapter xiv phebe 's good-by when be it phebe first fall ill no one know mr hardcastle have keep cautiously out of she way this long time past but nobody else suspect that the brilliant cheek and eye which shine like star be telltale of a hidden fire burn she life away the fever be abate in the village the doctor declare the epidemic virtually over and mutually congratulate each other upon the success of they measure mr hardcastle return to the sidewalk mr upjohn bring back marium miss lydium say death have spare she this once but next time it would be she turn to go mr lane say she need not make she will yet for all that and everybody say how very much worse the fever would have be in any less peculiarly healthy spot than joppa how be it that at the very last when there be no reason at all when she have be apparently so perfectly well all along phebe lane should suddenly take to she bed not only one doctor be call in but both and when they see she they say the fever have be run a long time already and then they look very grave and shake they head she do not seem so ill most of they patient have have far more aggravate symptom yet still they shake they head as they look at she and murmur something about lack of vitality a general give way a complete want of will power etc people look at each other aghast be it possible that little phebe lane be really go to die nobody really believe it could be except only soeur angélique oh my darling my darling she cry out when she first hear of it and then she instantly go over and install herself in phebe 's room and there she sit the slow day through wait and wait with a breaking heart phebe suffer very little she lay generally perfectly still too weak to move too weak to care to speak people come and go noiselessly below but no one be admit to she room save she step-mother and mr whittridge mr lane watch she with grow anxiety the fever be so slight why do she not rally from it how be it credible she could fail so rapidly and so causelessly and mrs whittridge sit by with despair in she heart one day late in the afternoon as she sit so watch phebe suddenly open she eye will you call he please i hear he who denham ask soeur angélique with quick intuition a finer ear than hers have catch the light step and low voice in the narrow hall below yes denham say phebe softly denham i want to see he it please she to say he name so she say it to herself over and over beneath she breath while wait for he to come it be but a moment and he be kneel by the bedside hold both she hand in he she look up in he face and smile and say he name again lower still denham yes phebe -- yes dear he answer too move to say more i only want to say good-by she continue she eye full of a love unutterable that not even the shadow of come death could wholly darken will you kiss I good-by please this once good-by -- for always a faint soft flush creep up over she white face and he bent down and kiss she gently as one would kiss the madonna of a shrine phebe he whisper not for always only for a time dear -- good-by yes she say with a glad smile light up all she sweet pure face only for a time and they still hold she hand tightly clasp in he denham bent down he head upon they and pray the sunset come and fade and the twilight come and go give place to the solemn stillness of the enduring night the star shine clear and still not a breath stir in he study denham knelt alone pray for a dear and lovely life pray against hope against belief -- against all but faith he do not know what time it be -- it seem as if it might be morning -- when at last the door open and soeur angélique come in he get up and stand wait too agitate to speak what news could she bring he but the one she come slowly up to he then give a little gasp and fling she arm around he neck burst into tear o denham denham all be over phebe be dead chapter xv only a incident the morning sun be streaming brilliantly in through the richly curtained window of a handsome new york dwelling mr and mr de forest be about sit down to breakfast
