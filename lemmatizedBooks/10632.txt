fine wholemeal flour to 3\/4 pint water put the meal into a basin add the water gradually and mix with a clean cool hand -lrb- bread pastry etc mix with a spoon especially of metal will not be so light as that mixed with a light cool hand -rrb- knead lightly for 20 minute -lrb- a little more flour may be require while knead as some brand of meal do not absorb so much water as other but do not add more than be absolutely necessary to prevent the finger sticking -rrb- put the dough on to a floured board and divide into four round loave prick with a fork on top the colder the water use the lighter the bread and if the mix be do by a open window so much the better for unfermented bread be air-raised distil or clean boil rain-water make the lightest bread but it should be pour backwards and forwards from one jug to another several time in order to aerate it _ another method _ of mix be the following : -- put the water into the basin first and stir the meal quickly into it with a spatula or wooden spoon when it get too stiff to be stir add the rest of the meal knead for two minute and shape into loaf as above baking -- bake on the bare oven shelf floor if possible have a few hole bore in the shelf this be not absolutely necessary but any tinker or ironmonger will perforate you shelf for a few penny better still be wire shelf like sieve -lrb- this do not apply to gas oven -rrb- start with a hot oven but not too hot to test sprinkle a teaspoonful of flour in a patty pan and put in the oven for five minute at the end of that time if the flour be a light golden-brown color the oven be right now put in the bread and keep the heat of the oven well up for half a hour at the end of this time turn the loaf now bake for another hour but do not make up the fire again let the oven get slightly cooler the same result may perhaps be obtain by move to a cooler shelf it all depend on the oven but always start with a hot oven and after the first half hour let the oven get cooler always remember that the larger the loaf the slower must be the bake otherwise they will be overdo on the outside and underdone in the middle do not open the oven door oftener than absolutely necessary if a gas oven be use the bread must be baked on a baking sheet place on a sand tin a sand tin be the ordinary square or oblong baking tin generally supply with gas stove fill with silver sand a bake sheet be simply a piece of sheet-iron a size smaller than the oven shelf so that the heat may pass up and round it any ironmonger will cut one to size for a few penny do not forget to place a vessel of water -lrb- hot -rrb- in the bottom of the oven this be always necessary in a gas oven when bake bread cake or pastry it must not be forget that oven be like child they need understand the temperature of the kitchen and the oven 's nearness to a window or door will often make a difference of five or ten minute in the time need for bake one gas oven that i know never baked well in winter unless a screen be put before it to keep away draught roll -- if you desire to get you bread more quickly it be only a question of make smaller loaf little roll may be cut out with a large egg-cup or small pastry cutter and these take any time from twenty minute to half a hour 2 egg bread 9 oz fine wholemeal 1 egg a bare 1\/2 pint milk and water butter size of walnut put butter in

to be a little hard on first take out of the oven but when cool they should be soft light and spongy when properly make the uninitiated generally refuse to believe that they do not contain egg or baking-powder there be proper gem pan make of cast iron -lrb- from 1 -rrb- for bake this bread and the best result be obtain by use they but with a favourable oven i have get pretty good result from the ordinary baking-tin with depression the kind use for bake small cake but these be a thinner make and apt to produce a tough crust 4 hot water roll this bread have a very sweet taste it be make by stir boiling water into any quantity of meal require sufficient to form a stiff paste then take out of the basin on to a board and knead quickly with as much more flour as be need to make it workable cut it into small roll with a large egg-cup or small vegetable cutter the quicker this be do the better in order to retain the heat of the water bake from 20 to 30 minute 5 oatcake mix medium oatmeal to a stiff paste with cold water add enough fine oatmeal to make a dough roll out very thinly bake in sheet or cut into biscuit with a tumbler or biscuit cutter bake on the bare oven shelf sprinkle

than in front let it rise at least a hour but should it not have rise very much -- say double the size -- let it stand longer as the bread can not be light if the dough have not rise sufficiently now have a baking-board well floured and turn all the dough on to it have tin or earthenware pan or even pie-dish well greased divide the dough put enough to half fill the pan or tin put these on the

truly consistent the unfired feeder should live entirely on raw food -- fruit nut and salad but most unfired feeder utilise heat to a slight extent although they do not actually cook the food in addition most of they use various breadstuff and biscuit which of course be cook food unfired bread be sell by some health food store and be a preparation of wheat which have be treat and soften by a gentle heat cereal should never be eat with fruit but may be eat with salad and cheese the mid-day meal of the unfired feeder should consist of nut or cheese and a large plate of well-chopped salad with some kind of dress over it olive oil and lemon-juice or one of the nut-oils and lemon-juice orange-juice or raw carrot-juice may be use if prefer when extra nourishment be desire a well-beaten raw egg may be mix with the dress fresh cream may also be use as dress fruit be best take at the evening meal from 1-1\/2 to 2 lb nothing should be take with it except a little nut-cream or fresh cream and white of egg distilled water be a great asset to the unfired feeder because it soften dry fruit so much better than hard water it can be manufacture at home or the still salutaris buy through a chemist or grocer the still salutaris water be about 1\/3 per gallon jar if the water be distil at home a gem still will be need -lrb- the gem supply co ltd 67 southwark street london se -rrb- it be best to use this over a gas ring or primus oil stove the cost of the water come out at about one penny per gallon accord to the cost of the fuel use distilled water should never be put into metal saucepan or kettle as it be a very powerful solvent a small enamelled kettle or saucepan should be use for heating it and it should be store in glass or earthenware vessel only it should not be keep for more than a month and should always be keep carefully cover for salad it be not necessary to depend entirely upon the usual salad vegetable such as lettuce endive watercress mustard and cress the very finely shredded heart of raw brussel sprout be excellent and even the heart of a savoy cabbage then the finely chop inside stick of a tender head of celery be very good also young spinach leave dandelion leaf sorrel and young nasturtium leave the root vegetable should also be add in they season raw carrot turnip beet onion and leek all finely grate a taste for all the above-mentioned vegetable eat raw be not acquire all at once it be best to begin by make the salad of the ingredient usually prefer and mix in a small quantity of one or two of the new ingredient for those who find salad very difficult to digest it be best to begin with french or cabbage lettuce and skin tomato only or as a alternative a saucerful of watercress chop very finely as one chop parsley

as the staler the milk the less juice will be need _ too much _ juice will prevent curdling as effectually as too little this cheese be greatly improve by the addition of fresh cream allow two

include at least soup savoury and sweet dish the hardworking housewife can afford neither the time nor the material to serve up so many dish at one meal and the wise woman do not desire to spend any more time and material on the need of the body than will suffice to keep it strong and healthy lack of space will not allow I to include many menu i have only attempt to give the barest suggestion for two week but a study of the rest of the book will enable anyone to extend and elaborate they three meal a day be the most that be necessary and no woman desire to cook more than once a day if possible the cook meal should be the mid-day one late dinner may be fashionable but they be not wholesome if the exigency of work make the evening meal the principal one let it be take as early as possible warm up it often happen that while the father of a family need he dinner when he come home in the evening it be necessary to provide a mid-day dinner for the other especially if child be include many housewife thus go to the labor of prepare a hot dinner twice a day but this may be avoid if the follow direction be carefully carry out : -- prepare the mid-day meal as if the father be at home and serve he first put he portion -- savoury vegetable and gravy -- in one soup plate and cover it immediately with another do the same with the pudding and put both dish away in the pantry a good hour before they be want put into a warm oven -lrb- if a gas oven be use see that there be plenty of hot water in the floor pan -rrb- when quite hot the food should not be in the least dry up this be ensure by have the oven warm but not hot warm up the food slowly and in the first place cover closely with the soup plate while still hot so that the steam do not escape i have eat many dinner save

reheat in the tureen Sunday and Monday the cook need a day of rest once a week as well as other people and this should be on a Sunday if possible so that she may participate in the recreation of the
