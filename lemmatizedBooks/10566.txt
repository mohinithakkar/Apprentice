she eye upwards he will come he have leave he comfortable home just for my sake and i shall not forget it mr smithson coughed-a short dry cough mean to convey incredulity i shall not do anything to this house till he come back say mr phipp i expect he would like to have a voice in it he always use to admire it and say how comfortable it be well well we never know what be before we mr smithson repeat the substance of the interview to mr clarkson by letter and in the lengthy correspondence that follow keep he post as to the movement of mr phipp by dint of warning and entreaty he keep the bridegroom-elect in london for three month by that time little molton be begin to talk they be begin to see how the land lay say mr smithson on the evening of he friend 's return and if you keep quiet and do as i tell you she 'll begin to see it too as i say before she can not name the day till you ask she mr clarkson agree and the follow morning when he call upon mr phipp at she request he manner be so distant that she attribute it to ill-health follow business worry and the atmosphere of london in the front parlor mr digson a small builder and contractor be busy whitewashing i think we might

ought to be a good judge mr phipp after a faint protest give way and mr digson smile broadly mount he perch again mr clarkson 's first idea be to consult mr smithson then he resolve to wait upon event the idea be fantastic to begin with but if thing do take such a satisfactory turn he could not help reflect that it would not be due to any effort on the part of mr smithson and he would no longer be under any testamentary obligation to that enterprising gentleman by the end of a week he be jubilant a child could have tell mr digson 's intention -- and mr phipp be anything but a child mr clarkson admit cheerfully that mr digson be a younger and better - look man than himself -- a more suitable match in every way and so far as he could judge mr phipp seem to think so at any rate she have cease to make the faintest allusion to any tie between they he leave she one day painting a door while the attentive digson guide the brush and walk homewards smile morning say a voice behind he morning

the astonished mr clarkson he would not tell I be the reply but it be good enough for he what do you think he be after she and mind do not let on to a soul that i tell you he walk on leave mr clarkson standing in a dazed condition in the center of the foot-path recover himself by a effort he walk slowly away and after prowl about for some time in a aimless fashion make he way back to mr phipp 's house he emerge a hour later a engage man with the date of the wedding fix with jaunty step he walk round and put up the banns and then with the air of a man who have complete a successful stroke of business walk homewards little molton be a small town and news travels fast but it do not travel faster than mr smithson as soon as he have hear it he burst into mr clarkson 's room like the
