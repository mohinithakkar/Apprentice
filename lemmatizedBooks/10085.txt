have furnish the larger part but there be some of which there be no counterpart in european country half a cock for instance have travel into the various province of france ireland albanium among the southern slav and to portugal from whence it go to brazil but the arab do not know it nor do they know tom thumb which with the khabyle become h ` ab sliman in the actual state of we knowledge we can only say that there be a striking resemblance between a berber tale and such or such a version from thence come the presumption of borrow matter but for the best result to be gain one should be in possession of all the version when it relate to celebrated personage among the mussulman like solomon or the feature of a legend of which no trace remain of the name one can certainly conclude that it be borrow from the arab it be the same with the greater number of fairy tale whose first inventor the arab commence with the thousand and one night and present we with the language of the beast and also with funny story the principal personage of these last be si djeha whose name be borrow from a comic narrative exist as early as the eleventh century ad the contents be sometimes coarse and

of gotham in italy and even in albanium the name of djeha be preserve under the form of guifa and guicha and the turk who possess the richest literature on this person have make he a ghadjus sirius

like the man of ksour or the nomad of sahara in general there be little art in these story and in style they be far below other collection celebrate through the entire world a important place be give to the fable or story of animal but there be little that be not borrow from foreign land and the animal be only such as the berber be familiar with the adventure of the jackal do not differ from those of the fox in european story a african trait may be signal in the prominence which it offer the hare as in the story of _ ouslof _ and _ bantous _ also the hedgehog neglect so lamentably in we fable hold a important place and if the jackal manage to deceive the lion he be in spite of he astute nature dupe by the hedgehog when he try a fall with he as to the lion the serpent the cock the frog the turtle the hyena the jackal the rat they rôles offer little of the place they play in the arab tale or even the european if we pass from berber we find the arab tongue as speak among the magreb and will see that the literature be compose of the same element particularly in the tale and song there be few special publication concern the first but there be few traveller who have not gather some and

mahometan conqueror of northern africa and while they exhibit a blending of spanish earnestness and chivalry with the wild and dashing spirit of the arab they present a type of literature which be quite unparalleled in the latin and teutonic country of the mediterranean basin spain be especially rich in ballad literature infinitely richer than any other civilized nation these ballad take various form by cervante and he countryman they be style romance and the romance generally consist in a poem which describe the character suffering or exploit of a single individual the language be simple the versification often artless though melodious be seldom elaborate into complexity of rhyme but the heroic moor be set before we in the most vivid color the hue and material of he cloak he housing he caftan and he plume be give and quite a vocabulary be exhaust in depict the color sex and breed of he war-horse he weapon lance scimitar and corslet of steel be dwell upon with enthusiasm

high that it vanish in the cloud he be ready to strike down in he own house the christian who have take from he and wed the lady of he choice he be almost always in love with some lady who be unkind and cold and for she he wander at time in dark array express he sombre mood in the device and motto which he paint upon he shield some of the ballad picture love more fortunate in the most charming manner and the dark torture of jealousy be powerfully describe in other the devotion of the moor to he lady be scarcely caricature in the mock language of cervante and be not exceed by anything to be find in the history of french chivalry but the god of these ballad be allah and they sometimes reveal a trace of ferocity which seem to be derive from religious fanaticism nor can the reader fail to be strike by the profound pathos which many of they express so well the dirge be supremely beautiful they language simple and direct but perfect in descriptive touch and in the cadence of the reiterate burden beside the ballad of warlike and amorous adventure there be sea-songs song of captivity and song of the galley slave the spanish moor be seize by some african pirate and carry away to toil in the mill of he master on some foreign shore or he be chained to the rowing-bench of the berber galley thence to be take and sell when the voyage be over to some master who leave he to weep in solitary toil in the farm or garden sometimes he win the love of he mistress who release he and fly in he company all these ballad have vivid description of scenery the tower of baeza the wall of granada the green _ vega _ that spread outside every city the valley of the guadalquivir and the rush water of the tagus the high cliff of cadiz the pillar of hercule and the blue wave of the mediterranean make a life-like background to every incident in the city the lady throng the balcony of curl iron-work or crowd the plaza where the joust or bull-fight be to be witness or steal at nightfall to the edge of the _ vega _ to meet a lover and sometimes to die in he arm at the hand of bandit there be a dramatic power in these ballad which be one of they most remarkable feature they be sometimes mere sketch but oftener the story be tell with consummate art with strict economy of word and phrase and the _ dénouement _ come with a point and power which show that the moorish minstrel be a artist of no mean skill and address the author of the moorish romance song and ballad be unknown they have probably assume they present literary form after be part of the _ répertoire _ of successive minstrel and some of the incident appear in more than one version the most ancient of they be often the shortest but they belong to the period when southern spain under mahometan rule be at the height of its prosperity and arabian learn art and literature make she rank among the first country in europe the peninsula be conquer by the moor in the caliphate of walid i 705-715 ad and the independent dynasty of the ommiade be found by abderrhaman at granada in 755 ad it be from this latter date that the spanish moor begin to assume that special character in language manners and chivalric enthusiasm which be represent in the present ballad the spirit of christian knighthood be here see blended with arabian passion impetuosity and impulsiveness and the spanish language have supplant even among mahometan poet the oriental idiom we may roughly estimate the period in which the moorish romance flourish as comprise in the year between 1100 and 1600 ad the term moorish be somewhat indefinite and be use in spanish history as a synonym of saracen or mahometan it can not be call a national appellation though originally in the augustan age it be apply to the dweller in mauretanium with whom the roman have first come in contact when the war with hannibal be transfer from italy and spain to africa in the present day it may be apply to all the race of northwestern

all berber under different local name be mussulman in profession they be not so highly civilized as they co-religionist who people the coast of the mediterranean they live a tribal life and be

precious the gift to lonely heart all other gift above well mightest thou forget I though ` twere treachery to say the flame that fill thy royal heart as yet have pass away still though too oft do lover ' heart in absent hour repine i know if there be faithful vow then faithful will be thine ` tis hard indeed for lover to crush the doubt thought which to the brooding bosom some lonely hour have bring there be no safety for the love when languish out of sight the form the smile the flash eye that once be love 's delight nor can i i confess it feel certain of thy vow how many moorish lady be gather round thee now how many fairer brighter form be cluster at thy throne whose power might change to very wax the heart of steel or stone and if indeed there be a cause why i should blame thy heart ` tis the delay that thou hast show in take here my part why be not army send to break these prison bar and bring back to she home the moorish maid the favorite of the king a maid whose eye be change to spring whence flow the flood of tear for she think of thee and weep for thee through all these absent year believe I if ` twere thou who lay a captive in he chain my life of joy to rescue thee my heart of blood i would drain o king and master if indeed i be thy love one still as in those day when i be first upon alhambra 's hill send rescue for thy darling or fear she love may fade for love that need the sunlight must wither in the shade and yet i can not doubt thee if e'er suspicion 's breath should chill my heart that moment would be vindaraja 's death nor think should you forget I or spurn I from you arm that life for vindaraja could have no other charm it be thy boast thou once do love a princess now a slave i boast that to thy behest i full obedience give and from this prison should i come in freedom once again to sit and hear thy word of love on andalusium 's plain the brightest thought would be to I that thou the king have see 'twa right to free a wretched slave that she might be thy queen hard be the lot of bondage here and heavy be my chain and from my prison bar i gaze with lamentation vain but these be slight and idle thing -- my one my sole distress be that i can not see thy face and welcome thy caress this only be the passion that can my bosom rend ` tis this alone that make I long for death my suffering end the plague of life be naught to I life 's only joy be this -- to see thee and to hear thee and to blush beneath thy kiss alas perchance this evening or to-morrow morn may be the lord who hold I here a slave in sad captivity may since they think I wanton they treacherous measure take that i should be a christian and my former faith forsake but i tell they and i weep to tell that i will ne'er forego the creed my father fight for in century long ago and yet i might forswear it but that that creed divine ` tis vain i struggle to deny for ah that creed be thine king chico read he lady 's note and silent lay it down then to the window he draw nigh and gaze upon the town and lose in thought he ponder upon each tender line and sudden tear and a sigh of grief be he inward sorrow 's sign and he call for ink and paper that vindaraja 's heart might know that he remember she and seek to heal its smart he would tell she that the absence which cause to she those fear have only make she dearer still through all those mournful year he would tell she that he heart be sad because she be not near -- yes far more sad than moorish slave chained on the south frontier and then he write the letter to the darling moorish slave and this be the tender message that royal chico give : the letter of the king thy word have do I grievous wrong for lovely mooress couldst thou think that he who love thee more than life could e'er to such a treachery sink he life be naught without the thought that thou art happy in thy lot and while the red blood at he heart be beat thou art ne'er forget thou woundest I because thy heart mistrust I as a fickle fool thou dost not know when passion true have one apt pupil take to school oblivion could not could not cloud the image on he soul impressed unless dark treachery from the first have be the monarch of he breast and if perhaps some weary hour i think that vindaraja 's mind might in some happier cavalier the solace of she slavery find i check the thought i drive away the vision that with death be rife for e'er my trust in thee i lose in battle i would forego my life yet even the doubt that thou hast breathe give I no franchise to forget and be i willing that thy face should cease to fill my vision yet ` tis separation 's self that bind we closer though the century roll and forge that eternal chain that bind together soul and soul and even be this think no more than the wild vision of my mind yet in a thousand world no face to change for thine this heart could find thro ' life thro ' death ` twere all the same and when to heaven we glance we raise full in the very heart of bliss thine eye shall meet my ardent gaze for eye that have behold thy face full readily the truth will own that god exhaust when he make thee all the treasure of he throne and my trusting heart will answer while it fill my vein with fire that to hear of be to see thee and to see be to desire yet unless my vindaraja i could look upon awhile as some traveller in a desert i should perish for she smile for ` tis longing for she presence make the spring of life to I and allay the secret suffering none except she eye can see in this thought alone my spirit find refreshment and delight this be sweeter than the struggle than the glory of the fight and if e'er i could forget she heaving breast and laugh eye tender word and soft caress -- vindaraja i should die if the king should bid I hasten to release thee from thy chain oh believe I dearest lady he would never bid in vain naught he could demand be greater than the price that i would pay if in high alhambra 's hall i once again could see thee gay none can say i be remiss and heedless of thy dismal fate love come to prompt I every hour he will not let my zeal abate if occasion call i yield myself my soul to set thee free take this offering if thou wilt i wait thy word on bend knee dost thou suffer noble lady by these fancy overwrought ah my soul be fill with sorrow at the agonizing thought for to know that vindaraja languish oppress with care be enough to make death welcome if i could but rescue she yes the world shall know that i would die not only for the bliss of clasp thee in love 's embrace and kindling at thy tender kiss this indeed would be a prize for which the coward death would dare -- i would die to make thee happy tho ' thy lot i might not share then though i should fail to lift the burden on my darling lay though i could not prove my love by rescue my moorish maid yet my love would have this witness first thy confidence sublime then my death for thee record on the scroll of future time yes my death for should i perish it be comfort but to think thou couldst have henceforth on earth no blacker bitterer cup to drink sorrow 's shaft would be exhaust thou couldst laugh at fortune 's power tho ' i lose thee yet this thought would cheer I in my parting hour yet i believe that fate intend -lrb- oh bear this forecast in thy mind -rrb- that all the love my passion crave will soon a full fruition find fast my passion stronger grow and if of love there measure be believe it dearest that the whole can find its summary in I deem that thou art foully wrong whose grace have such power to bless if any of thy subject slave to thee they queen should offer less and accept this pledge assurance that oblivion can not roll o'er the image of thy beauty stamp on this enamored soul then dismiss thy anxious musing let they with the wind away as the gloomy cloud be scatter at the rising of the day think that he be now thy slave who when he woo thee be thy king think that not the brightest morning can to he contentment bring till the light of other moment in thy melting eye he trace and the gate of paradise be open in thy warm embrace since thou knowest that death to I and thee will strike a equal blow it be just that while we live we heart with equal hope should glow then no longer vex thy lover with complaint that he may change darling oft these bitter question can the fondest love estrange no i dream not of estrangement for thy chico evermore think upon he vindaraja 's image only to adore the infanta sevillum and peranzuelo upon toledo 's loftiest
