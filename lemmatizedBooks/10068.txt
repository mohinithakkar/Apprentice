high-hung valley in the remote fastness of the unakas where she be bear johnnie consadine be walk down to cottonville the factory town on the outskirts of watauga to find work sometimes the road wind a little upward for a quarter of a mile or so but the general tendency be persistently down in the gray dawn of Sunday morning she have step from the door of that room where the three bed occupy three corner and a rude table be rig in the fourth it might almost seem that the same hound be quarrel under the floor that have scramble there eighteen year before when she be bear at first the way be entirely familiar to she it pass few habitation and of those the dweller be not yet abroad since it be scarce day as time go on she get to the little settlement at the foot of the first mountain and

cool thread of water which trickle from the spring be a stately pink moccasin flower she kneel and gaze at it with fold hand as one before a shrine what be it in the sweeping dignity of these pointed oval parallel-veined leaf sheathe one within another the clean column of the bloom stalk rise a foot and a half perhaps above and at its tip the wonderful pink dream buddha of the forest that so command the heart it be not entirely the beauty of the softly glowing orchid that charm johnnie consadine 's eye it be the significance of the flower somehow the finding this rare shy thing deck she

face bent she eye brooding as though she pray when she have finish she dinner of corn pone and fry pork she rise and part with almost reverent finger the pink wonder from its stalk seek out a coarse clean handkerchief from she bundle and steep it in the icy water of the spring lap it around she treasure not often in she eighteen summer have she find so fine a specimen then she take up she journey comfort and strangely elated look like it be wait right there to tell I howdy she murmur to herself the keynote of johnnie consadine 's character be aspiration in she cabin home the wing of desire be clip because she must need put she passionate young soul into the longing for food to quiet the craving of a healthy stomach which generally clamour from one blackberry season to the other the longing for shoe when she foot be frostbitten the yet more urgent wish to feed the little one she love the press demand when the water-bucket give out and they have to pack water in a tin tomato can with a string bail the dull ache of mortification when she become old enough to understand they position as the borrowing passmore yet all human desire be sacred and of god to desire -- to want -- to aspire -- thus shall the individual be save and surely in this be the salvation of the race and johnnie feel vaguely that at last she be go out into a world where she should learn what to desire and how to desire it now as she tramp she be con over she present plan again she see the cabin at home in that pitchy black which precede the first leavening of dawn and herself get up to start early on the long

stand it the girl justified herself i have oblige to get out and go where money could be earn -- I that be big and stout and able and sighingly -- yet light-heartedly for with laurellum consadine and johnnie there be always the quaint suggestion of a little girl with a doll quite too big for she -- the mother let she go it have be just so when johnnie would have she time for every term of the old field hollerin ' school where she learn to read and write even when she persist in go to rainy gap where some charitably inclined northern church maintain a little school and push she education to dizzy height that to mountain vision appear plumb foolish that morning she have caution she mother to be careful lest they waken the child for if the little one rouse and begin as the mountain phrase have it takin ' on she scarcely know how she should find heart to leave they the child -- there be the thing that drive four small brother and sister there be with little deanie the youngest to make

double i could not she whisper back sister 's goin ' to earn money and deanie shall have plenty of good thing to eat next winter and some shoe she sha not be house up every time it snow si 's goin ' to -- she break off abruptly and kiss the small face with vehemence good-bye she manage to whisper as she set the baby down and turn to she mother the kindling touch of that farewell warm she resolution yet she be not go down to cottonville to work in the mill merely she be go into the storehouse of possibility to find and buy a chance in the world for these poor little soul who could never have it otherwise before she kiss she mother take up she bundle and trudge away in the chill gray dawn she declare a intention to come home and pay back every one to whom they be under obligation now she face dimple as she remember the shriek of dismay laurellum send after she good land johnnie consadine if you start in to pay off all the borryin 's of the passmore family since you be bear you 'll ruin we -- that be what you 'll do -- you 'll ruin we these thing act themselves over and over in johnnie 's mind as throughout the fresh April afternoon she long free rhythmic step its morning vigor undiminished swing the mile behind she still present in think when away down in render 's gap she settle herself on a rock by the wayside where a little stream cross the road to wash she foot and put on the shoe which she have up to this time carry with she bundle i reckon i must be near enough town to need 'em she say regretfully as she draw the big shapeless cowhide affair on she slim brown carefully wash and dry foot and with a leathern thong lace down a wide stiff tongue she have earn the money for these shoe pick blackberry at ten cent the gallon and uncle pro have buy they at the store at bledsoe accord to he own idea get 'em big enough and there will not be any fussin ' about the fit the old man explain he theory : and indeed the fit of those shoe on johnnie 's foot be not a thing to fuss over -- it be past consider the sun be wester the gap begin to be in shadow although the point at which she sit be well above the valley the girl be all at once aware that she be tired and a little timid of what lay before she she have write to shade buckheath a neighbor 's boy with whom she have go to school now employ as a mechanic or loom-fixer in one of the cotton mill and from whom she have receive a reply say that she could get work in cottonville if she would come down mavity bence who have give johnnie she first clothes be a weaver in the hardwick mill at cottonville watauga 's milling suburb she father gideon hime with whom shade buckheath learn he trade be a skilled mechanic and have work as a loom-fixer for a while at present he be keep a boarding-house for the hand and it be here johnnie be to find lodging shade himself be report to be do extremely well he have promise in he letter that if johnnie come on a Sunday evening he would walk up the road a piece and meet she she now begin to hope that he would come then wait for he she forget he and set herself to imagine what work in the cotton mill and life in town would be like to shade buckheath stroll up the road in the expansiveness of he holiday mood and the dignity of he Sunday suit the first sight of johnnie come with a little unwelcome shock he have leave she in the mountain a tall thin sandy-haired girl in the grow age he get he first sight of she profile relieve against the green of the wayside bank with a bunch of bloom azalea star its verdure behind she bright head he be not artist enough to appreciate the picture at its value he simply have the sudden resentful feeling of one who have ask for a hen and be offer a bird of paradise she be tall and lithe and strong she thick fair hair without be actually curly seem to be so vehemently alive that it ripple a bit in its length as a swift-flowing brook do over a stone it rise up around she brow in a roll that be almost the fashionable coiffure those among whom she have be breed laconically call the color red but in fact it be only too deep a gold to be quite yellow johnnie 's face even in repose be always potentially joyous the clear wide gray eye under they arch brow the mobile lip hold as it be the smile in solution when one address she it break swiftly into be the pink lip lift adorably above the white tooth the long fringed eye crinkle deliciously about the corner johnnie love to laugh and the heart of any reasonable being be instantly move to give she cause for himself the young man be a prevalent type among he people brown well build light on he foot with heavy black hair grow low on he forehead and long blackish-gray eye there be something latin in the grace of he movement and in he glance life run strong in shade buckheath he step with a independent stride that be almost a swagger and already feel himself a successful man but that one of the tribe of borrow passmore should presume to such opulence of charm strike he as well-nigh impudent the pure outline of johnnie 's feature they aristocratic mould the ruddy gold of she rich clustering hair those be thing it seem to he a good mill-hand might well have dispense with then the girl turn see he and flash he a swift smile of greet it be mighty kind of you to come up and meet I she say get to she foot a little awkwardly on account of the shoe and pick up she bundle i ` low you might get lose banter the young fellow not offer to carry the packet as they trudge away side by side how 's everybody back on unaka have you uncle pro find he silver mine yet no return johnnie seriously but he be lookin ' for it shade throw back he head and laugh so long and loud that it would have be embarrass to any one less sound and sweet-natured than this girl i reckon he be say buckheath i reckon pro passmore will be lookin ' for that silver mine when gabriel blow it run in the family do not it johnnie look at he and shake she head you have be learnin ' town way have not you she ask simply you mean my makin ' game of the passmore he inquire coolly no i never learn that in the settlement i learn it in the mountain i just forget you name be passmore that be all he add sarcastically be you goin ' to get mad about it johnnie have put on she slat sunbonnet and pull it down so he could not see she face no she return evenly i be not goin ' to get mad at anything and my name 's not passmore either my name be consadine and i aim to be call that uncle pro passmore be my mother 's uncle and one of the best man that ever live i reckon if all the folk he be nurse in sickness or lay out in death be number over it would be a-many a one and i never hear he take any credit to himself for anything he do why shade the last three year of you father 's life uncle pro do not dare hunt he silver mine much because you father be paralyse and have to have close waitin ' on and -- and there be not nobody but uncle pro since all he boy be go and -- oh say it speak out urge shade hardily you mean that all we chap have cut out and leave the old man and there be not a cent of money to pay anybody and no one but pro passmore would ` a ' be fool enough to do such hard work without pay well i reckon you be about right you and I come of a mighty poor nation of folk but i be goin ' to make my pile and have my share if lookin ' out for number one 'll do it johnnie turn and regard he curiously it be characteristic of the mountain girl and of she people that she have not on first meeting stare village fashion at he brave attire and she seem now concern only with the man himself i reckon you 'll get it she say meditatively i reckon you will sometimes i think we always get just what we deserve in this here world and that the only safe way be to try to deserve something good i hope i do not say too much for uncle pro but he be so easy and say-nothin ' himself that i just could not bear to hear you laughin ' at he and not answer you i declare you be plenty funny buckheath burst put boisterously no i be not mad at you i kind o ' like you for stickin ' up for the old man you and I 'll get along i reckon as they move forward the man and the girl fall into more general chat the feeling of irritation at johnnie 's beauty she superior air grow rather than diminish in the young fellow 's mind how dare pro passmore 's grandniece carry a bright head so high and flash such glance of liquid fire at she questioner shade look sidewise sometimes at he companion as he ask the news of they mutual friend and she answer yet when he get along with she mild response one of those glance he be himself strangely subdue by it and fain to prop he lean prejudice by contrast she scant print gown she slat sunbonnet and cowhide shoe with the apparel of the humblest in the village which they be approach chapter iii a peak in darien so walk and so desultorily talk they come out on a noble white highway that wind for mile along the bluffy edge of the upland overlook the valley upon the one side front by handsome residence on the other it be johnnie 's first view of a big valley a river or a city she have see the shoestring creek bottom between the endless mountain among which she be bear and breed the high-hung cup-like depression of they inner fastness she be use to the cool clear boulder-checked mountain creek that fight they way down those steep like a armed man beat off assailant at every turn she have be take a number of time to bledsoe the tiny settlement at the foot of unaka old bald where there be two store a blacksmith shop the post-office and the church below she now begin to glow in the evening light open out one of the finest valley of the southern appalachee lap in it far off shroud with rosy mist which she do not identify as transmute coal smoke a city lay fret with spire already sparkling with electric light set like a glittering boss of jewel in the broad curve of a shine river directly down the steep at they foot be the cotton-mill town a suburb cluster about a half-dozen great factory whose long row of light window define they black bulk there be a stream here too a small sluggish thing that flow from tank to tank among the factory span by numerous handrail bridge in one place for the wagon-road to cross mill valley town distant rimming mountain river and creek glow and pulsed dissolve and relimn themselves in the uprolling glory of sunset oh wait for I a minute shade plead the girl pull off she sunbonnet i want to look never in my life do i see anything so sightly good land laugh the man with a note of impatience in he voice you and I be raise on mountain scenery as a body may say i should think we would both have enough of it to last we but this -- this be different grope johnnie try to explain the emotion that possess she look at that big settlement over yon i reckon it be a city it must be watauga it look like the -- the mansion of the blest in the big bible that preacher drane have down at bledsoe i reckon they be bless -- they get plenty of money return shade with the cheap cynicism of he kind so many house the girl commune with herself there be bind to be a-many a person in all they house she go on one could read the loving outreach to all humanity in she tone there be put in shade caustically there be many a rogue you want to look out for they tricky town folk -- a girl like you have he be more kind he would have say a pretty girl like you but johnnie do not miss it she be use to such as he give or less come on he urge impatiently we will not get no supper if you do not hurry supper johnnie draw in she breath and shake she head with that scene unrolled there as though all the kingdom of earth be spread before they to look upon she be ask to remember supper sighing but submissively she move to follow she guide a reluctant glance across she shoulder when there come a cry something like that which the wild goose make when they come over in the spring and a thing with two shine fiery eye a thing that purr like a giant cat round a curve in the road and come to a sudden jolting halt beside they shade stop immediately for that johnnie do not fail to recognize the vehicle illustrate magazine go everywhere in these day in the automobile ride a man bare-headed dress in a suit of white flannel strange to johnnie 's eye beside he sit a woman in a long shimmering silken cloak a great misty silver-gray veil twine round head and hat and tie in a big bow under the chin johnnie have as yet see nothing more pretentious than the starched and ruffle flummery of a small mountain watering-place this beautiful peculiar look garb have something of the picturesque the poetic about it that appeal to she as the frock wear at chalybeate spring or bledsoe have never do she have not want they she want this the automobile be stop the young fellow in it call to shade : i wonder if you could

johnnie lean upon this and share she admiration between the valley below and these beautiful interesting newcomer she bonnet be push far back the wind ruffle the bright hair about she forehead the wonder and glory and delight of it all make she deep eye shine with a child 's curiosity and avid wishfulness she lip be part in unconscious smile white and red tremulous on tiptoe the eager soul look out of she face she be very beautiful the man in the automobile observe she kindly the woman 's feature she could not quite see though the veil be part neither johnnie nor the driver of the car see the quick resentful glance she companion shot at the city man as shade note the latter 's admire look at the girl buckheath display a awesome familiarity with the machine and its workings crawl under the body and tap it here and there with a wrench its driver supply they back it and move it a little and seem to be debate the short turn which would take they into the driveway lead up to a house on the slope above the road johnnie continue to watch with fascinate eye shade be on he foot now reach into the bowels of the machine to do mysterious thing it be a broken connection he announce briefly

steal to the one window which the long room afford it give upon the main street of the village honk honk honk she gaze toward the steep from which the sound seem to come there flash in and out of the greenery appear half a dozen pair of fiery eye a party of motorist be go in to watauga start from the country club on the ridge crest johnnie watch they fascinate as the foremost car sweep down the road and directly beneath she window its driver whom she recognize with a little shiver by the characteristic carriage of he head swerve the machine out and stop it at the curb below the other pass

be in watauga befo-o-ore they ' even as he speak he adjust he costume and johnnie see the car shoot forward like a living creature eager on the trail she sigh as she look after they foot -- of what use be foot to follow such a flight as that chapter v the moccasin flower johnnie be use to hardship and early rising but in a intermittent fashion for the passmore and consadine be a haggard lot that come to no lure but they own pleasure they might -- and often do -- go hungry ill-clad ill-housed they might sometimes -- in order to keep soul and body together -- have to labor desperately at rude task unsuited to they but these time be exception and between such season down to the least of the tribe they have always follow the vision pursue the fly skirt of whatever ideal be in they shapely head the little cabin in the gash of the hill own for domain a rocky ravine that be the standing jest of the mountain-side sure hit 's good land -- fine land the mountaineer would comment with they inveterate dry lazy humor nothing on earth to hender a man from raisin ' a crap off 'n it -- ef he could once git the leather on a good stout willin ' pa ' r o ' hawk or buzzard a ' a plough hitch to 'em and johnnie could remember the other child tease she and say that she folk have to load a gun with seed corn and shoot it into the sky to reach they field yet the unmended roof cover much joy and good feeling they be light foot that tread the unsecured puncheon the passmore be tender of each other 's eccentricity admire of each other 's virtue a wolf race nourish on the knee of purple king how should they ever come down to wear any man 's collar to slink at heel and retrieve for he one would have say that to the daughter of such the close cotton-mill room with its inhuman clamor its fetid air its long hour of enforced monotonous mechanical toil would be prison with the torture added but johnnie look forward to she present enterprise as a soldier go into a new country to conquer it she be buoyantly certain and determinedly delighted with everything when the next morning after she arrival mandy meacham shake she by the shoulder and bid she get up the room be hum with the roar of mill whistle and the gray dawn leak in at its one window in a churlish chary fashion remind she that they be under the shadow of a mountain instead of live upon its top i do not see what in the world could ` a ' make I sleep so johnnie deprecate as she make haste to dress herself look like i never have nothing to do yesterday except walk down i have be on foot that much many a time and never notice it the other girl in the room poor soul be all cross and sleepy nobody have time to converse with johnnie as they go down the stair another contingent begin to straggle up have eat a hasty meal after they night 's work and make now for certain of the just-vacated bed johnnie run into the kitchen to help mr bence get breakfast on the table for pap hime be bad off this morning with a misery somewhere and he daughter be send word to the cotton mill to put a substitute on she loom till dinner time almost as much to she own surprise as to that of everybody else mandy meacham propose to stay and take johnnie in to register for a job when the other be all seat at table the new girl from the mountain take she cup of coffee and a biscuit and drop upon the doorstep to eat she breakfast the back yard be unenclose a litter of tin can and ash run with its desert disorder into a similar one on either side but there be no house back of the hime place the ground fall away sharply to the rocky creek bed across the ravine half a dozen strap young fellow be lounge wait for breakfast loom-fixer and mechanic these whose hour be more favourable than those of the woman and child worker it be lot prettier out here than it be in the house she return smilingly when mavity bence offer to get she a chair i do love to be out-of-doors huh grunt mandy with she mouth full of biscuit i reckon a cotton mill 'll jest about kill you what make you work in one anyhow i would not if i could help it johnnie eye the tall girl gravely i have get to earn some money she say at length ma and the child have to be take care of i do not know of any better way than the mill a ' i do not know of any worse retort mandy sourly as they go out together johnnie begin to feel timid there have be a secret hope that she would meet shade on the way to the mill or that mr bence would finally get through in time to accompany she she be suddenly aware that there be not a soul within sound of she voice who have belong to she former world with a little gasp she look about she as they enter the office the hardwick mill to which they now come consist of a number of large red brick building join by covered passage-way abut on one of those sullen pool johnnie have note the night before the yard enclose by a tight board fence so high that the operative in the first-and second-floor room could not see the street this for the factory portion the office do not front on the shut-in yard but open out freely on to the street through a little grassy square of its own tree-shadowed with paved walk and flower bed as with all the mill in its district the suggestion be dangerously apt of a penitentiary with its high wooden barrier around all the build the only free approach from the world to its corridor through the seemly humanized office where abide the head the boss the free man who come and go at will the wall be already begin to wear that garment of green which the american ivy fling over so many factory building as the two girl come up johnnie look at the wide clear plate window the brass railing that guard the heavy granite approach the shine name hardwick deep-set in brazen letter on the step over which they enter inside the polished oak and metal of office fitting carry on the idea of splendor if not of luxury back of the crystal window be the temper shades all be spacious order with quiet dignity and there be no sense of hurry in the well-clad well-groomed figure of man that sit at the massive desk or move about the softly carpeted floor the corridor be long but cleanly sweep and at its upper portion cover with a material unfamiliar to johnnie but which she recognize as suit to its purpose down at the further end of that corridor something throb and moan and roar and growl -- the factory be awake there and work the contrast strike cold to the girl 's heart here yet more sharply define be the same difference she have note between the palace of pleasure on the height and the mill at the foot of the mountain would the people think she be good enough would they understand how hard she mean to try for a minute she have a desperate impulse to turn and run then she hear mandy 's thin flatted tone announce : this hyer girl want to git a job in the mill miz bence she cai not come down this morning -- you 'll have to git somebody to tend she loom till noon pap he be sick and she have oblige to wait on he -- so i brung the new gal all right say the man she address she can wait there you go on to you loom johnnie sit on the bench against the wall where newcomer apply for position be place the man she be to see have not yet come to he desk and she remain unnoticed and apparently forget for more than a hour the office be enter from the other side yet a doorway close by johnnie command a view of a room and desk to it presently come one who seat himself and begin open and read letter johnnie catch she breath and lean a little forward watch he she heart in she eye hand lock hard together in she lap it be the young man of the car he be not in white flannel now but he look almost as wonderful to the girl in he gray business suit with the air of easy command and the quiet half-smile only latent on he face shade buckheath have speak of gray stoddard as the boss of the boss down at cottonville indeed he position be unique inheritor of large holding in eastern cotton-mill stock he have return from abroad on the death of he father to look into this source of he very ample income the mill in which he be concern be not earn as they should so he be tell and there be discussion as to whether they be move south or a southern mill be establish which might be consider in the nature of a branch and where the coarser grade of sheet would be manufacture as well as all the spin do but stoddard be not of the blood that take opinion second-hand upon he mother 's side he be the grandson of one of the great anti-slavery agitator the sister of this man gray 's great-aunt have stand beside he on the platform when there be danger in it and after the negro be free and enfranchise she have devote a long life to the cause of woman suffrage the mother who bear he die young she leave he to the care of a conservative father but the blood that come through she do not make for conservatism perhaps it be some admixture of he father 's trait which set the young man to investigate the cotton-mill situation in he own fashion to do this as he conceive it should be do he have hire himself to the hardwick spin company in a office position which give he a fair outlook on the business and put he in complete touch with the practical side of it yet the fact of the case make the situation evident to those under he as well as he peer whatever conviction and opinion he be mature in this year with the hardwick he keep to himself but he be suppose to hold some socialistic idea and lydium session jame hardwick 's sister-in-law make she devoir to these by engage zealously in semi-charitable enterprise among the mill-girl he be a passionate individualist the word seem unduly fiery when one remember the smile insouciant manner of he divergence from the conventional type yet he be inveterately himself and not some schoolmaster 's or tailor 's or barber 's version of gray stoddard and in this though johnnie do not know it lay the strength of he charm for she the moment pass unheeded after he come into she field of vision and she watch he for some time busy at he morning 's work it take she breath when he raise he eye suddenly and they glance encounter he plainly recognize she at once and nod a cheerful greet after a while he get up and come out into the hall he hand full of papers evidently on he way to one of the other office he pause beside the bench and speak to she wait for the room boss be they go to put you on this morning he ask pleasantly yes i be a-going to get a chance to work right away she smile up at he be not it fine the smile that answer hers hold something pity yet it be a pity that do not hurt or offend yes -- i be sure it be fine if you think so say stoddard half reluctantly then he eye catch the broken pink blossom which johnnie have pin to the front of she bodice what be that he ask it look like a orchid he be instantly apologetic for the word but johnnie detach the flower from she dress and hold it toward he it be she assent it be a orchid and the little yellow flower that we-all call the whippoorwill shoe be a orchid too stoddard thrust he papers into he coat pocket and take the blossom in he hand that be the pink moccasin flower johnnie tell he they do not bloom in the valley at all and they be not very plenty in the mountain i pick this one six mile up on white oak ridge yesterday i reckon i have not see more than a dozen of these in my life and i have hunt flower all over unaka i never have the chance to analyze one observe stoddard i would like to get hold of a good specimen i be sorry this one 's broken johnnie deprecate then she clouded face clear suddenly with its luminous smile if it have not be for you i reckon it would have be knock over the edge of the road she add that be the flower i have in my handkerchief yesterday evening stoddard continue to examine the pink blossom with interest you say it grow up in the mountain -- and do not grow in the valley he remind she she nod of course i be not certain about that and while she speak he transfer he attention from the flower to the girl i really know mighty little about such thing and i have not be in the valley to exceed ten time in my life miss baird that teach the school i go to over at rainy gap have a herbarium and put all kind of press flower in it i gather a great many for she and she teach I to analyze they -- like you be speak of -- but i never do love to do that it seem like name over and call out the way of you friend to pull the flower all to piece and press it and paste it in a book and write down all its -- its -- way and fault again she smile up at he radiantly and the young man 's astonished glance go from she dusty cowhide shoe to the thick roll of fair hair on she graceful head what manner of mill-girl do the mountain send down to the valley but i -- begin stoddard deprecatingly when johnnie reddened and break in hastily oh i do not mean that for you miss baird teach I for three year and i love she as dearly as i ever could any one you may keep this flower if you want to and come Sunday i 'll get you another one that will not be break why Sunday ask stoddard well i would not have time to go after they till then and the one i know of would not be open before Sunday i see just three there by the spring that be the way they grow you know -- two or three in a place and not another for mile you see they grow repeat stoddard i should like to see one on its root and maybe make a little sketch of it could not you just as well show I the place Sunday for no reason that she could assign and very much against she will johnnie 's face flush deeply i reckon i could not she answer evasively hit 's a long way up -- and -- hit 's a long way up and yet you be go to walk it -- after a week 's work here in the mill persist stoddard you would better tell I where they grow and let I go up in my car i wish ' t i could say johnnie embarrassed but you would never find it in the world they be not one thing that i could tell you to know the place by : and you have to leave the road and walk a little piece -- oh it be no use -- and i do not mind i would just love to go up there and get the flower for you be you the new girl inquire a voice at johnnie 's shoulder they turn to find a squat middle-aged man regard they dubiously yes answer johnnie rise i have be wait quite a while well come this way direct the man and turn lead she away down the hall they go then up a flight of wooden stair which carry they to a covered bridge and so to the upper story of the factory that be a unusual-looking girl old andrew macpherson make the comment as he receive the papers from stoddard 's hand the one i be speak to in the hall inquire stoddard rather unnecessarily yes she seem to have a unusual mind as well these mountain people be peculiar they appear to have no idea of class and therefore be in a measure all aristocrat well that ought to square with you socialistic notion chaff macpherson sort the work on he desk and push a certain portion of it toward stoddard sit down here if you please and we 'll go over these now the girl look a good deal like a fairy princess i do not think she be a safe topic for susceptible young chap like you and I the grizzled old scotchman conclude with a chuckle you socialistic hullabaloo make you liable to foregather with all sort of impossible people gray shake he head laugh as he seat himself at the desk beside the other oh i be only a theoretical socialist he deprecate hum grunt the older man a theoretical socialist always seem to I about like a theoretical pickpocket -- neither of they stand to do much harm for example here you be one of the richest young fellow of my acquaintance live along very contentedly where every tenet you profess to hold be daily outraged you be not give away you money you take a healthy interest in a good car a good dinner the gal i be even tell you have a fad for old porcelain -- and yet you call yourself a socialist these economic condition be not a pin answer gray smile i do not have to jump and say ` ouch ' the minute i find they prick I worse condition have always be and no doubt bad one will survive for a time and pass away as mankind outgrow they i have not the colossal conceit to suppose that i can reform the world -- not even push it much faster toward the destination of good to which it be roll but i want to know -- i want to understand myself then if there be anything for I to do i shall do it it may be that the present condition be the best possible for the present moment it may be that if a lot of we get together and agree we could better they exceedingly it be not certain in my mind yet that any growth be of value to humanity which do not proceed from within this be true of the individual -- must it not be true of the class no doubt no doubt agree macpherson indifferently most of the man who be loud in the leadership of socialism have make a failure of they own life we 'll see what happen when a man who be a personal and economic success set up to teach if you mean that very complimentary description for I say gray with sudden seriousness i will say to you here and now that there be no preacher in I but when i be a little clearer in my own mind as to what i believe i shall practice the only real creed be a manner of life if you do not live it you do not really believe it chapter vi weaver and weft the hardwick mill be a large one to the mountain-bred girl it seem endless while its clamor and roar be a thing to daunt they pass through the spin department in which the long line of frame be tend by child and reach the weaving-rooms whose loom require the attention of woman with here and there a man who have fail to make a success of male occupation and sink to the ill-paid feminine activity in a corner of one of these johnnie 's guide stop before two silent motionless loom and throw on the power he begin to instruct she in they operation all communication be in dumb show for the clap thunder of the weaving-room instantly snatch the sound from one 's lip and batter it into shapelessness johnnie have be a expert weaver on the ancient foot-power loom of the mountain but the strangeness of the new machine the noise and she surroundings bewilder she when the man see that she be not likely to injure herself or the loom he turn away with a careless nod and leave she to she fate it be a blowy April day outside with a gay blue sky in which the white cloud race draw barge of shadow over the earth below but the necessity of keep dust out of the machinery the inconvenience of have fly end carry toward it close every window in the big factory and the operative gasp in the early heat the odour of oil the exhaust air there be a ventilate system in the hardwick mill and it be suppose to be exceptionally free from lint but the fagged child crowd to the casement with instinctive longing for the outdoor air which could not of course enter through the glass or plod they monotonous round to tend the frame and see that the thread be run properly to each spool and that the spool be remove when fill by noon every nerve in johnnie 's body quiver with excitement and overstrain yet when mandy come for she at the dinner hour she show she a face still resolute and ask that a snack be bring she to the mill i do not see why you will not come along home and eat you dinner the meacham woman comment the lord know you get time enough to stay in the mill work over they old loom say i see you in the hall -- do you know who you be talk to the red flood johnnie 's face as she kneel before she loom interrogate its workings with a dexterous hand even the white nape of she neck show pink to mandy 's examine eye but she manage to reply in a fairly even tone : yes that be mr stoddard i see he yesterday evening when i be come down the ridge with shade but do you know ` bout he say -- johnnie consadine -- turn yourself round from that old loom and answer I i be goin ' a-past the door and when i ketched sight o ' you and he settin ' there talkin ' as if you would know each other all you life why you could have -- could have knock I down with a feather johnnie sit up on she heel and turn a laughing face across she shoulder i do not see any reason to want to knock you down with anything she evade the direct issue go ` long mandy or you will not have time to eat you dinner tell aunt mavity to send I just a biscuit and a piece of meat good land johnnie consadine but you be quare exclaimed mandy stare with bulge light eye if it be I i would be all in a tremble yet -- and there you sit and talk about meat and bread johnnie do not think it necessary to explain that the tremor of that conversation with stoddard have indeed last through she entire morning there be nothing to tremble about she remark with surface calm he have never see a pink moccasin flower and i give he the one i have and tell he where it grow well he be not look at no moccasin flower when i seed he mandy persist he be lookin ' at you he jest eye you as if you be miss lydium session herself -- more so if anything johnnie inwardly rebuke the throb of joy which greet this statement i reckon he look be he own mandy she say soberly you and I have no call to notice they be not get no call to notice 'em well i jest wish ' t i could get you and he up in front of miss session and have she see they look of he 'n grumble mandy as she turn away i bet you there would be some noticin ' do then when in the evening mandy come for johnnie she find the new mill hand white about the mouth with exhaustion heavy-eyed choke and ready to weep uh-huh say the meacham woman i know just how you feel they all look that-a-way the first day or two -- then after that they look worse nervelessly johnnie find she way downstairs in the stream of tired girl and woman there be more than one kindly greet for the new hand and occasionally somebody clap she on the shoulder and assure she that a few day more would get she use to the work the mill yard be large fill with grass-plot and gravel walk but it be shut in by a board so tall that the street could not be see from the window of the lower floor to johnnie weary to the point where ache muscle and blood charge with uneliminated waste spell pessimism that high board fence seem to make of the pretty place a prison yard a man be prop open the big wooden gate and through they she see the street the sidewalk and a carriage draw up at the curb in this vehicle sit a lady and a gentleman hat in hand talk to she from the sidewalk come on hiss mandy seize she companion 's arm and drag she forward thar 's miss lydium session right now and that be mr stoddard a-talkin ' to she i 'll go straight up and give you a knockdown -- i want to anyway she be the one that run the uplift club if she take a shine to you it 'll be money in you pocket she turn over she shoulder to glance at johnnie who be pull vigorously back there be no hint of tiredness or depression in the girl 's face now she deep eye glow red be again in the fresh lip that part over the white tooth in a adorable tremulous smile mandy stare hurry up -- he 'll be gittin ' away she admonish oh no object the new girl wait till some other time i -- i do not want to -- but she remonstrance come too late mandy have yank she forward and be perform the introduction she so euphoniously describe gray stoddard turn and bow to both girl he carry the broken orchid in he hand and apparently have be speak of it to miss session mandy eye he narrowly to see if any of the look she have apprehend as offensive to miss session go in johnnie 's direction and she be not disappointed stoddard 's gaze linger long on the radiant countenance of the girl from unaka not so the young woman look after a few month of factory life he be get to know well the odd jail-bleach the cotton mill put on country cheek the curious dull yet resentful expression of the eye beget by continuous repetition of excessive hour of trivial monotonous toil would this girl come at last to that favor he be a little surprised at the strength of protest in he own heart then macpherson come down the office step call to he and with courteous adieu the two man depart in company johnnie be a bit grieve to find that the removal from miss session of the shroud misty veil reveal a countenance somewhat angular in outline with cheekbone a trifle hard and high and a lack of color she fancy too that miss session be slightly annoyed about something she wonder if it be because they have interrupt she conversation with mr stoddard and drive he away yet while she so question she be take in with swift appreciation the trim set of the drive coat miss lydium wear the appropriate texture of the heavy glove on the small hand that hold the line and a certain indefinable air of elegance hard to put into word but which all woman recognize be not she swell inquire mandy as they pass on she be after mr stoddard now -- it use to be the preacher that have the big church in watauga but he move away i wish i have she clothes yes return johnnie absently she have already forget she impression of miss session 's displeasure go be the leaden weariness of she day 's toil something intimate and kind in the glance stoddard have give she remain warm at she heart and set that heart singing meantime stoddard and macpherson be walk up the ridge toward the country club together intend to spend the night on the highland the scotchman return once more to the subject he have broach that morning this be a great country he open obliquely a very great country but you american will have to learn that generation of blood and breeding be not to be skip with impunity see the son and daughter of you rich man if the hope of the land lay in they it would be a bad outlook indeed be that peculiar to america asked stoddard mildly they be come under the tree now he take off he hat and run he finger through he hair to enjoy the coolness my impression be that the youthful aristocracy of every country often make of itself a spectacle unseemly the scotchman laugh then he look sidewise at he companion i be not deny he pursue again with that odd trick of enter he argument from the side that a young chap like yourself have my good word a man with money who will go to work to find out how that money be make and to live as he father do carry a old head on young shoulder i put aside you socialistic vapouring of course -- every fellow to he fad -- i see in you the makings of a canny business man it be stoddard 's turn to laugh and he do so unrestrainedly throw back he head and utter he mirth so boyishly that the other smile in sympathy you talk about what be in the blood gray say finally and then you make light of my socialistic vapouring as you call they my mother 's clan -- and it be from the spindle side that a man get he trait -- be all come-outer as far back as i know anything about they they fight with cromwell -- some of they they come over and rob the indian in true sanctimonious fashion and persecute the quaker and down the line a bit i get some quaker blood that stand for its belief in the stock and sacrifice its ear for what it think right i be afraid the socialistic vapouring be the true expression of the animal macpherson grunt incredulously i give you ten year to be do with it he say it be a disease of youth but do not let it mark you affair it be all right to foregather with these workingman and find out about they trades-union and that sort of thing -- such knowledge will be useful to you in you business but when it come to woman -- macpherson pause and shake he gray head -- to young pretty woman -- a man must stick to he own class you mean the girl in the corridor say stoddard with that directness which he friend be apt to find disconcerting i have not classify she yet she be rather a extraordinary specimen well she be not in you class and best leave she alone return macpherson doggedly it would not matter if the young thing be not so beautiful and with such a win look in she eye this america beat I that poor lass would make a model princess -- accord to common ideal of royalty -- and here you find she come out of some hut in the mountain and go to work in a factory miss lydium session be a well-bred young woman now she be be all over europe and profit by she advantage of travel i call she a exceedingly well-bred person she be agree stoddard without enthusiasm and i be sure you must admire she altruistic idea -- they would just fall in with yours i suppose now stoddard shake he head not at all he say briefly if you be enough interested in socialism to know what we folk be drive at i could explain to you why we object to charitable enterprise -- but it be not worth while indeed it be not assented macpherson hastily though no doubt we might have a fine argument over it some evening when we have nothing better to talk about i think you and miss session be fix up a match of it and it strike I as a very good thing too the holding of both of you be in cotton-mill property i judge that always make for harmony and stability in a matrimonial alliance stoddard smile he be aware that miss lydium 's holding consist of a complaisant brother-in-law in whose house she be welcome till she could marry but he say nothing on this head macpherson he begin very seriously i wonder a little at you i know you old-world people regard these thing differently but could you look at mr hardwick 's child and seriously recommend mr hardwick 's sister as a wife for a friend old macpherson stop in the way thrust he hand deep in he pocket and stare at the younger man well he ejaculate at last that be a great speech for a hot-headed young fellow you foresight be worthy of a scotchman gray stoddard smile i be not a hot-headed person he observe nobody but you ever accuse I of such a thing marriage concern the race and a man 's whole future if the child of the marriage be likely to be unsatisfactory the marriage will certainly be so we modern bedeck and bedrape we in all sort of meretricious toga till a pair of fine eye and a dash manner pass for beauty but when life try the metal -- when nature apply she inevitable test -- the degenerate or neurotic type go to the wall again macpherson grunt no doubt you be sound enough but it be rather uncanny to hear a young fellow talk like he grandfather the scotchman say finally be there many of you sort in this astonishing land a good many stoddard tell he the modern young man of education and wealth be do one of two thing -- burn up he money and go to the dog as fast as he can or put in a power of thinking and try while he save he own soul to do he part in the regeneration of the world yes well it be a big job it be be on hand a long time the young man of america have they work cut out for they say macpherson drily no doubt return stoddard with undisturbed cheerfulness but when every man save he own soul the salvation of the world will come to pass chapter vii above the valley all week in johnnie the white flame of purpose burn out every consciousness of weariness of bodily or mental distaste the preposterously long hour the ill-ventilated room the savage monotony of she toil none of these reach the girl through the glow of hope and ambition physically the finger of the factory be already lay upon she vigorous young frame but when Sunday morning come though there be no bellow whistle to break in on she slumber she wake early and while nerve and muscle beg achingly for more sleep she rise with a sense of exhilaration which nothing could dampen she have see a small mountain church over the ridge by the spring where she moccasin flower grow and if there be preach in it to-day the boy and girl scour the surround wood during the intermission would surely find and carry away the orchid there be no safety but to take the road early the room be dark mandy sleep noisily beside she all the bed be full because the night-turn worker be in she mean to be very careful to waken nobody poor soul they need this one day of rest when they could all lie late search for something she cautiously strike a match and in the flare up of its small flame get a glimpse of mandy 's face open-mouthed pallid unbeautiful against the tumbled pillow a great rush of pity fill she eye with tear but then she be in a mood to compassionate any creature who have not the prospect of a twelve-mile walk to get a flower for gray stoddard it be in that black hour before dawn that johnnie let herself out the front door find the direction by instinct rather than any assistance from sight since fence tree house be but vague blot of deeper shadow in the black she be well on she way before a light here and there in a cabin window show that Sunday morning as it be the earliest riser be begin to stir she face be set to the east and after a time a pallid line show itself above the great bulk of mountain which in this quarter back up the rampart of the circle ridge about watauga the furthest line be big unaka but this passionate lover of she native highland give it neither think nor glance as she tramp steadily with lift face follow unconsciously the beckon finger of fate it be a dripping-sweet spring morning dew-drenched and with the air so full of moisture that it gather and patter from the scant leafage she be two mile up swing along at that steady pace she mountain-bred youth have give she when the sky begin to flush faintly and the first hint of dawn rest on she upraised countenance rain-laden mist sweep down upon she from the height and she walk through they unnote the pale light from the eastern sky shine on a aspect introverted rapt away from knowledge of its surroundings she be go to get something for he she have promise he the flower and he would be please with they he would smile when he thank she for they and look at she as he have when she give he the broken blossom a look like that be to the girl in she present mood as the sword 's touch on the shoulder of the lad who be be knight by he king -- it make she want to rise up and be all that such a man could ever demand of she twelve mile of walk after a week 's toil in the mill be a very small offer to put before so worshipful a divinity she seek vaguely to conjecture just what he word would be when next they speak together she lip form themselves into tender reminiscent half-smile as she go over the few and brief moment of she three interview with stoddard johnnie be not inexperienced in matter of the heart mating time come early in the mountain have she dream be of shade buckheath or any of the boy of she own kind and class she would have be instantly full of self-consciousness but gray stoddard appear to she a creature so apart from she sphere that this overwhelming attraction he hold for she seem no more than the admiration she might have give to miss lydium session and so the dream lay undisturbed under she eyelash and she breast the slope of the big mountain with a buoyant step oblivious of fatigue she reach the little wayside spring before even the early-rising mountain folk be abroad find three pink blossom in full perfection pluck they and wrap they carefully in damp cloth dispose in a little hickory basket that uncle pro have make for she year ago it be a tiny thing design to hold a child 's play-pretty or a young girl 's sewing but shaped and fashion after the manner of mountain basket and weave of stout white hickory withe shave down to daintier size and pliancy by the old man 's jack-knife life be very sweet to johnnie consadine as she straighten up basket in hand and turn toward the home journey it be nearly nine o'clock when she reach the gap above cottonville she be sing a little softly to herself as she foot it down the road and wish that she might see gray 's face when he get she flower she plan to put they in a glass on he desk Monday morning and of course she would be at she loom long before he should reach the office she be glad they be such fine specimen -- all perfect lovingly she pull aside the wet cloth and look in at they she begin to meet people on the road and the cabin she pass be open and throng with morning life the next turn in the road would bring she to the spring where she have rest that evening just a week ago and where shade have meet she suddenly she catch the sheen of something down the road between the scant greenery it be a carriage or a automobile now it be more likely to be the former than the latter also there be a half-dozen car in cottonville yet from the first she know and be prepare for it when the shine vehicle come nearer and show she gray stoddard drive it they look at each other in silence stoddard bring the machine to a halt beside she she come mutely forward a hesitate hand at she basket cover she eye raise to he with the mountaineer 's deathless instinct for greet she be first to speak howdy she breathe softly i -- i be look for -- i get you -- she fall silent again still regard he and fumble blindly at the cover of the basket well -- be not you lose inquire stoddard with a rather futile assumption of surprise he be strangely move by the direct gaze of those clear wide-set gray eye under the white brow and the ruffle coronet of bright hair no return johnnie gently literally you know i say i would come up here and get those moccasin flower for you this morning this be my road home anyhow i be not as near lose on it as i be at a loom down in the factory stoddard continue to stare at the hand she have lay on the car it 'll be a awfully long walk for you he say at last choose he word with some difficulty will not you get in and let I take you up to the spring johnnie laugh softly exultantly oh i pick you flower before day break i 'll bet there have be a dozen boy over from sunday-school to drink out of that spring before this time you would not have have any bloom if i have not get up early again she laugh and uncover the orchid hold they up to he these be beauty he exclaim with due enthusiasm yet with a certain uneasy preoccupation in he manner be you up before day do you tell I to get these that seem too bad you need you sleep johnnie flush and smile i love to do it she say simply it be mighty sweet out on the road this morning and you do not know how pretty the bloom do look standing there wait for I i ` most hate to pick they stoddard 's troubled eye raise themselves to she face here be a royal nature that would always be in the attitude of the giver he want to offer she something and as the nearest thing in reach spring down from the automobile and lay a hand on she arm say almost brusquely : get in come let I help you i want to go up and see the spring where these grow i 'll get you back to cottonville in time for church if that be what you be debate about both of they know that johnnie 's reluctance have nothing to do with the question of church-time stoddard himself be well aware that a factory girl could not with propriety accept a seat in he car yet when once they be settle side by side and the car resume that swift tireless climb which be the wonder and delight of the mechanical vehicle it be characteristic that both put aside definitely and completely all hesitation and doubt the girl be freely innocently exultantly blissful stoddard notice she intent examination of the machine and begin explain its workings to she be that what you be do she ask allude to some small item of the operating when you stop by the side of the road Sunday night when miss lydium be with you he look he astonishment you be right under my window when you stop johnnie explain to he i watch you-all when you start away i be sure you would beat we do stoddard assure she but we come near miss it that connection buckheath put in for I the evening you be with he on the ridge work loose but i discover the trouble in time to fix it remembrance of that evening and of the swift flight of the motor through the dusk moonlight make johnnie wonder at herself and she present position she be rouse by stoddard 's voice asking : be you interested in machinery i love it return johnnie sincerely i never do get enough of tinkerin ' around machine if i be ever so fortunate as to own a sewing machine i could take it all apart and clean it and put it together again i do that to the minister 's wife 's sew machine down at bledsoe when it get out of order she say i know more about it than the man that sell it to she would you like to run the car come the next query would she like to the countenance of simple rapture that she turn to he be reply sufficient well look at my hand here on the steering-wheel get the position and when i raise one put yours in its place there no a little more this way now you can hold it better the other one 's right smilingly he watch she like a grow person amusing a child you see what the wheel do of course -- guide now when they have run ahead for some minute do you want to go faster johnnie laugh up at he through thick fair lash look like anybody would be hard to suit that want to go faster than this she apologize but if the machine can make a higher speed there would not be any harm in just run that way for a spell would there it be stoddard 's turn to laugh no manner of harm he agree readily well you advance you spark and open the throttle -- that speed she up this be the spark and this the gas here then you shove you shift lever -- see here it be -- over to the next speed remember that any time you shift the gear you 'll have to pull the clutch the machine have to gain headway on one speed before it can take the next johnnie nod soberly she intent gaze study the mechanism before she intelligently we be go a heap faster now she suggest in a moment can i move that -- whatever it be -- over to the third speed yes agree stoddard here be a good long straight stretch of road for we to take it on i 'll attend to the horn when we come to the turn up there we must not make anybody 's horse run away so the lesson proceed he show she brake and clutch he give she some theoretical knowledge of crank up because she seem to enjoy it as a child enjoy exploit the possibility of a new toy up and up they go the sky widening and brighten above they hen begin to lead forth they brood overhead a hawk wheel high in the blue utter he querulous cry i be mighty glad i come the girl say more to herself than to the man at she side this be the most like flying of anything that ever chance to I from time to time stoddard have send swift sidelong glance at he companion note the bright bent head the purity of line in the profile above the steering-wheel the intelligent beauty of the intent down-dropped eye with long lash almost on the flush cheek he wonder at she bear amid these wide cool space how have she endure for a week the fetid atmosphere of the factory room how have test it could she look forward to a life like that something in she innocent trust choke he he begin some carefully word inquiry as to she experience in the mill and she opinion of the work the answer partook of that charm which always cling about johnnie she tell he of mandy and miss no shade of the humor there be in the meacham girl manage to make the description pathetic she describe pap hime and he boarding-house aptly deftly and leave it funny though a sympathetic listener could feel the tragedy beneath presently they meet the first farm-wagon with its load of worshipper for the little mountain church beyond as these come out of a small side road and catch sight of the car the bony old horse jib and shy and take all the driver 's skill and a large portion of he vocabulary to carry they safely past the child stare the woman pull they sunbonnet about they face and look down something in the sight bring home to johnnie the incongruity of she present position on the instant a drop of rain splash upon the back of she hand there she cry in a contrite voice i know mighty well and good that it be go to rain and i ought to have name it to you because you town folk do not understand the weather as well as we do i ought not to have let you come on up here we 'll have to turn and run for it say stoddard laugh a little i wish i would have the hood put on this morning as he survey the narrow way in which he have to turn be it wider beyond here do you remember there be a bluff up about a quarter of a mile that you could run under and be as dry as if you be in the shed at home say johnnie this will not last long do you want to try it you be the pilot stoddard declare promptly resign the wheel once more to she hand if it be a bad place you might let I take the car in rain in the mountain have a trick of come with the suddenness of a overturn bucket johnnie send the car ahead at what she consider a rapid pace till stoddard unceremoniously take the wheel from she and shove the speed clutch over to the third speed i be mighty sorry i be so careless and do not warn you about the rain she declare with shine eye as she hair blow back and she color rise at the rapid motion but this be fine i believe that if i should ever be so fortunate as to own a automobile i would want to fly like this every minute of the time i be in it as she speak they sweep beneath the overhang rock and a great curtain of virginium creeper and trumpet-vine fall behind they half screen they from the road and from the deluge which now break more fiercely for five minute the world be blot out in rain with these two watch its gray swirl and listen to its insistent drum safe and dry in they cave nothing ripen intimacy so rapidly as a common mishap also two people seem much to each other as they await alone the ceasing of the rain or the come of the delay boat this will not last long johnnie repeat we will not dare to start out when it first stop but there 'll come a little clearing-up shower after that and then i think we 'll have a fair day do not you know the say ` rain before seven quit before eleven ' well it shower twice just as day be break and i have to wait under a tree till it be over the big drop lengthen themselves as they come down into tiny javelin and strike upon the rock with a splash the roar and drum in the forest make a soft blur undertone of sound the first rain last longer than johnnie have count on and the clearing-up shower be slow in make its appearance the two talk with ever-growing interest strangely enough johnnie consadine who have no knowledge of any other life except through a few well-conned book appreciate the value of this mountain existence with almost the detach view of a outsider she knowledge of it be therefore more assorted and available and stoddard listen to she eagerly but what make you think you would like to work in a cotton mill he ask suddenly after all be not you maybe better off up in these mountain and then and there johnnie strive to put into exact and intelligent word what she have possess and what she have lack in the home of she childhood unconsciously she tell he more than be in the mere word he get the situation as to the visionary kindly father with a turn for book learning and a liking for enterprise that appeal to he imagination uncle pro and the silver mine be always touch upon with the tender kindness johnnie feel for the old man and he life-long quest but the little mother and the child -- ah it be here that the listener find johnnie 's incentive mr stoddard she conclude there be not a bit of hope of schooling for the child unless i could get out and work in the factory i think it be a splendid chance for a girl i think any girl that would not take such a chance would be mighty mean and poor-spirited gray stoddard revolve this conception of a chance in the world in he mind for some time i do get some schooling she tell he you would not think it to hear I talk because i be careless but i have be teach and i can do better yet if i do not see to it how be i to know that the child will have as much even as i have have mountain air be mighty pure and healthy and the water up here be the finest you ever drink but that be only for the body of course there be beauty all about you -- there be never anything more sightly than big unaka and the ridge that run from it and the sky and the big wood -- and all and yet human being have get to have more than that i aim to make a chance for the child be you go to bring they down and let they work in the mill with you stoddard ask in a perfectly colourless tone johnnie look embarrassed she week in the cotton mill have fix indelibly on she mind the picture of the mill child straggle to work in the gray dawn sleepy shiver unkempt of the young thing creep up and down the aisle between the endlessly turn spool dully regard the frame to see that the thread be not foul or break of the tired little group as they press close to the shut window neglect they work to stare out into a world of blue sky and blow air -- a world they could see but not enter and no breath of which could come in to they and so she look embarrassed she be afraid that memory of those tired little face would show in she own countenance she hand on the steering-wheel tremble she remember that mr stoddard be as shade have say one of the boss in the hardwick mill it seem too terrible to offend he he certainly think no ill of have child employ she must not seem to criticize he she answer evasively : well of course they might do that i do think of it -- before i go down there before you go to work in the mill yourself supply stoddard again in that colourless tone ye -- yes hesitate johnnie but you must not get the idea that i do not love my work -- because i do you see the child have not have any schooling yet and -- well i be a great big stout somebody and it look like i be the one to work in the mill she turn to he fleetingly a countenance of appeal and perplexity it seem indeed anything but certain that she be one to work in the mill there be something almost grotesque in the idea which make stoddard smile a little at she earnestness i would like to talk it over with you when you have be at work there longer he find himself say you see i be study mill condition from one side and you be study they from the opposite -- perhaps we could help each other i sure will tell you what i find out agree johnnie heartily i reckon you 'll want to know how the work seem to I at the side of such as i be use to in the mountain but i hope you will not inquire how long it take I to learn for i be afraid i be go to make a poor record if you be to ask I how much i be able to earn there and how much back on unaka i could make a good report for the mill on that because that be all that be the matter with the mountain -- they be a beautiful place to live but a body can not hardly earn a cent work as they may johnnie forget herself -- she be always do that -- and she talk freely and well it be as inevitable that she should be draw to gray stoddard as that she should desire the clothing and culture miss lydium possess for the present one aspiration strike she as quite as innocent as the other stoddard have not yet emerge from the starry constellation among which she set he to take form as a young man a person who might indeed return she regard she emotion be in that nebulous formative stage when but a touch would be need to show she whither the regard tend yet till that touch should come she as unashamedly adore gray as any child of five could have do it be not till they be well down the road to cottonville that she realize the bald fact that she a mill girl be ride in a automobile with one of the mill owner she be cast about for some reasonable phrase in which to clothe the statement that it would be better he should stop the car and let she out she have part she lip to ask he to take the wheel when they round a turn and come upon a company of loom-fixer from the village below behind they in a giggle group stroll a dozen mill girl in they Sunday best johnnie have sight of mandy meacham fix eye of terrify admiration upon she then she nod in reply to shade buckheath 's angry stare and a rattle of wheel apprize she that a carriage be pass on the other side this vehicle contain the entire hardwick family with lydium session turn long to look she incredulous amazement back at they from she seat beside she brother-in-law it be all over in a moment the loom-fixer have debouch upon the long wooden bridge which cross the ravine to they quarter the girl be go on mandy meacham hang back and stare a tree finally shut out miss session 's accuse countenance please stop and let I out here say johnnie in a scarcely audible voice when stoddard would have remonstrate or ask why he lip be close by sight of she daunted miserable face he know as well as she the mad imprudence of the thing which they have do and blame himself roundly with it all i 'll not forget to bring the book we be talk of he make haste to say he pick up the little basket from the floor of the car you would better keep the flower in that johnnie tell he lifelessly she innocent dream be break into by a cruel reality she be struggle blindly under the weight of all she little world 's disapprobation you 'll let I return the basket when i bring you the book gray suggest helplessly i do not know johnnie hesitate then as a sudden inspiration come to she mandy meacham say she would try to get I into a club for girl that miss session have she say miss session would lend I book maybe you might just leave they with she i be sure i should be mighty proud to have they i know i 'll love to read they but -- well you might just leave they with she a little satiric sparkle leap to life in stoddard 's eye he look at the innocent upraised face in wonder the most experienced manoeuverer of society 's legion could not have handle a difficult situation more deftly the very thing he say cheerily i 'll talk to miss session about it to-morrow chapter viii of the use of wing i tell you i would speak a good word for you shout mandy meacham put she lip down close to johnnie 's ear where she struggle and fight with she loom amid the deafening clamor of the weave room the girl look up flush tired but eagerly receptive yes she red lip shape the word to the other 's eye though no sound could make itself hear above that din except such eldritch shriek as mandy 's i do it i get you a invite to some doin 's at the uplift club a-wednesday again johnnie nod and shape yes with she lip she add something which might have be thank you the adorable smile that accompany it say as much mandy watch she fascinate as the lithe strong young figure bent and strained to correct a crease in the web where it turn the roll they never see anything like you in they bear day i 'll bet she yell i never do you be awful quare -- but somehow i sorter like ye and she scuttle back to she loom as the room boss come in a weaver work by the piece but mandy have be reprove too often for slovenly method not to know that she might be fine for neglect she loom stand where she could continually get the newcomer 's figure against the light with its swift motion its supple curve and the brave carriage of the well-formed head the sight give mandy a curious satisfaction as though it utter what she would fain have say to the class above she hers be something the feeling which the private in the rank have for the standard-bearer who carry the color aloft or the dash officer who lead the charge johnnie be the challenge she would have fling in the face of the enemy i 'll bet if you would put one of miss lyddy 's dress on she she would look nobby mandy ruminate address she loom that be what she would she would have 'em all f -- fa -- fade away as the feller say and so it come about that the next day johnnie consadine do not go to the mill at all but spend the morning wash and iron she one light print dress it be as coarse almost as flour-sacking and the blue dot on it have pale till they make a suspicious speckle not unlike mildew yet when she have comb she thick fair hair roll it back from the white brow and braid it to a coronet round she head as she have see that of the lady on the porch at the palace of pleasure when cleanse and smooth she put the frock on one forget the dress in the youth of she the hope the glorious expectation there be in that eager face the lady assist in miss lydium session 's uplift club for work among the mill girl be almost all young and youngish woman the mother in israel attack the more serious problem of orphanage winter 's supplies of coal and clothing for the destitute but they soul must be feed too miss lydium assert as she recruit she helper for the uplift work they soul must be feed and who can reach the soul of these young girl so well as we who be near they own age and who have have time for culture and spiritual growth it be a good theory perhaps one may say that it remain a good theory the manner of uplift be to select a certain number of mill girl whom it be deem well to help approach they on the subject and if they appear amenable pay a substitute to take charge of they loom while those in process of be uplift attend a meeting of the club the gathering to which johnnie be bid be hold in honor of a lady from london who have write a book on some subject which it be think ought to appeal to workingwomen this lady intend to address the company and to mingle with they and get they view most of those present be quite unfurnished with any view whatever on the problem she discuss she position be something that of a pick-pocket in a moneyless crowd but of this she be fortunately and happily unaware mandy meacham regard johnnie 's preparation for the function with some disfavor ef you fix up like that she remonstrate you be bind to look too nice to suit miss lyddy they will not be no man thar i be goin ' to wear my workin ' dress and tell she i have not nary minute nor nary cent to do other johnnie laugh a little at this as though it be intend for a joke but i do have time she object miss session would pay a substitute for the whole day though i tell she i would only need the afternoon for the party i think it be mighty good of she and it be as little as i can do to make myself look as nice as i can you be not get the sense you be bear with fret mandy they thar kind lady be not a-carin ' for you to look so fine they 'll attend to all the fine lookin ' theirselve what they want be to know how bad off you air a ' to have you say how much what they have do or give have help you such interchange of view bring the two girl to the door of the little frame chapel give over for the day to uplift work within it rise a bustle and clatter a hum of voice that speak a frilling of nervous shrill laughter to edge the sound and back of that the clink of dish from a rear room where refreshment be be prepared miss session near the door have a receive line quite in the manner of any reception she herself in a blouse of marvellous daintiness and sweeping skirt stand beside the visitor from london to present she to this day johnnie be uncertain as to where the wonderful blue silk frock of that lady from abroad be fasten though she give the undivided effort of sharp young eye and a inquire mind to the problem a good portion of the time while it be within she view the englishwoman be call mr archbold and on she other hand stand a tall slim lady with long gray-green eye prematurely gray hair which have plainly be red and a odd little twist to she smile this be mrs hexter wife of the owner of the big woollen mill across the creek and only bidden in to assist the uplift work because the position of she husband give she much power these with the miss burchard daughter of the rector form the reception committee i be so charm to see you here to-day miss lydium smile as they enter it be part of she theory to treat the mill girl exactly as she would member of she own circle mandy be old at the business possess herself of the high-held hand present but johnnie only look at it in astonishment uncertain whether miss lydium mean to shake hand or pat she on the head yet when she do finally divine what be intend the quality of she apologetic smile ought to have atone for she lapse i be sure proud to be here with you-all she say look like to I you be mighty kind to stranger the ineradicable dignity of the true mountaineer who have always be as good as the best in he environment preserve johnnie from any embarrassment any tendency to shrink or cringe she beauty in the fresh-washed print gown be like a thing release and as miss session might have put it rampant gray stoddard have go directly to lydium session with he proffer of book and he suggestion for johnnie the explanation of how the girl come to be ride in he car that Sunday morning be neither as full nor as penitent as miss lydium could have wish yet it do recognize the impropriety of the act and be in so far satisfactory miss session make haste to form a alliance with the young man for the special upliftment of johnnie consadine she would have greatly prefer to interest he in mandy meacham but beggar can not be chooser and she take what she could get whom have we here demand the lady from london lean across and peer at johnnie with friendly near-sighted eye why what a bloom girl to be sure you have not be long from the country i 'll venture to guess my dear johnnie blush and dimple at be so kindly welcome the mountain people be undemonstrative in speech and action and that my dear seem wonderful i come from away up in the mountain she say softly from away up in the mountain repeat the englishwoman she smile gaze dwelling on johnnie 's radiant face why yes -- so one would conceive well you must not lose all those pretty rose in the mill down here she be a visitor remember resident of cottonville never admit that rose or anything else desirable could be lose in the mill i 'll not say johnnie sturdily i be goin ' to earn my way and send for mother and the child if hard work 'll do it but i be a mighty big stout healthy somebody and i aim to keep so mrs archbold pat the tall young shoulder as she turn to mandy meacham whom miss lydium be eager to put through she pace for the benefit of the lady from london be not that the girl mr stoddard be speak to I about she inquire in a whisper as johnnie move away i think it must be he say she be such a beauty and i scarcely believe there could be two like she in one town such a type ' be mr stoddard 's exact word i believe return miss session a little frostily yes john consadine be quite a marked type of the mountaineer she be as she say to you a stout healthy creature and i understand very industrious i approve of john she approve of john but she address herself to exploit mandy and the lady in the blue silk frock learn how poor and helpless the meacham woman have be before she get in to the mill work how greatly the uplift club have benefit she with many interesting detail yet as the english lady go from group to group in company with miss lydium and th hexter 's wife she quick eye wander across the room to where a bright head rise a little taller than its fellow and occasional burst of laughter tell that johnnie be in a merry mood the threadbare attempt at a reception be get through laboriously the girl be finally settle in orderly row and mr archbold lead to the platform the talk she have prepare for they be upon aspiration it be a essay in fact and she have deliver it successfully before many woman 's club she be not to be blame that the language be as absolutely above the comprehension of she hearer as though it have be greek she be a busy woman with other aim and activity than those of work among the mass miss lydium have hear she present talk fancy it and think it would be the very thing for the uplift club for thirty minute johnnie sit concentrate desperately on every sentence that fall from the lip of the lady from london try harder to understand than she have ever try to do anything in she life she put all she quick young mind and avid soul into the struggle to receive though piercingly aware every instant of the difference between she attire and that of the woman who have bid she there note acutely variation between they language and hers they voice they gesture and hers these be the woman of gray stoddard 's world such be he feminine associate here then must be she model mandy and she likes get from the talk perhaps nothing at all except that rich people might have what they like if they want it -- that at least be miss meacham 's sum up of the matter when she go home that night but to johnnie some of the sentence remain you struggle and climb and strive say mr archbold earnestly when if you only know it you have wing and what be the wing of the soul the wing of the soul be aspiration oh that we would spread they and fly to the height we longing eye behold the height we dream of when we can not see they the height we foolishly and mistakenly expect to climb some day again johnnie see herself come down the ridge at shade 's side descend into the shadow step closer to the drone mill while above she the palace of pleasure swam in its golden glory and these who be privileged to do so go out and in and laugh and be happy be such height as that what this woman mean johnnie have let it typify to she the height to which she intend to climb be it indeed possible to fly to they instead the talk end she sit so long with bent head that miss session finally come round and take the unoccupied chair beside she be you think it over john she inquire with that odd little note of hostility which she could never quite keep out of she voice when she address this girl yes be reply johnnie meekly several who be talk together in the vicinity relinquish they conversation to listen to the two mr hexter shoot one of she quaint crooked smile at the lady from london and with a silent gesture bid she hearken i think these thing be most important for you girl who have to earn you daily bread miss session condescend daily bread echo johnnie softly she love fine phrase as she love fine clothes i know where that come from it be in the prayer about ` daily bread ' and ` the kingdom and the power and the glory ' do not you think those be beautiful word miss lydium -- the ` power and the glory ' miss session 's lip suck in with that singular half-reluctant expression of condemnation which be become fairly familiar to johnnie oh john she say reprovingly ` daily bread ' be all we have anything to do with do not you remember that it say ` thine be the kingdom and the power and the glory ' thine john -- thine yes be return johnnie submissively but it be in she heart that certain upon this earth have they share of kingdom and power and the glory and although she utter that submissive yes be she high-couraged young heart register a vow to achieve its own slice of these thing as well as of daily bread do not you enjoy mr archbold 's talk i think it very fine miss session pursue it sure be that sigh johnnie i do not know as i understand it all -- every word i try to but maybe i get some of it wrong what be it you do not understand john inquire miss lydium patronizingly ask I i 'll explain anything you care to know about johnnie turn to she too desperately in earnest to note the other listener to the conversation why that about stretch out the wing of you spirit and fly do you believe that i certainly do miss session say brightly as delighted at johnnie 's remember part of the visitor 's word as a small boy when he have teach he terrier to walk on its hind leg then if a body want a thing bad enough and keep on a-want it -- oh just awful -- be that aspiration will the thing you want that-a-way come to pass we-e-ell miss session deem it necessary to qualify she statement to this fiery and exact young questioner you have to want the right thing of course john you have to want the right thing yes be agreed johnnie heartily and i would ` low it be certainly the right thing if it be what good folk -- like you -- want miss session flush yet she look pleased aware if johnnie be not of the number of listener here be she work of uplift among the mill girl be justified i -- oh really i could not set myself up as a pattern she say modestly but you be johnnie assure she warmly there be not anybody in this room i would rather go by as by you the fine gray eye have be travel from neck to belt from shoulder to wrist of the lady who be enlighten she i think i never in all my life see anything more sightly than that dress-body you be a-wearin ' she murmur softly where -- how might a person come by such a one if you think that my wish and -- aspire -- would ever bring I such as that i would sure try there rise a titter about the two it spread and swell till the whole assembly be in a gale of laughter miss session 's become blush deepen to the tint of angry mortification she look about and assume the air of a schoolmistress with a room full of noisy pupil but johnnie she cheek pink too first sweep they all with a astonished gaze which fling the long lash up in such a wide curve of innocence as make she eye bewitching then join it and laugh as loud as any of they at she know not what it be the one touch to put she with the majority and leave she mentor strand in a bleak minority miss session object to the position oh john she say severely so soon as she could be hear above the giggle how you have misunderstand I and mr archbold and all we intend to bring to you what be a mere blouse like this to the uplift the outlook the development we be strive to offer i confess i be deeply disappoint in you this sober johnnie instantly i be sorry she say bend forward to lay a wistful penitent hand on that of miss session i 'll try to understand better i reckon i be right dumb and you 'll have to have a lot of patience with I i do not rightly know what to aspire after the amende be so sweetly make that even lydia session still exceedingly employ at be pictorially chagrin over the depravity of she neophyte could but be appease i 'll try to furnish you more suitable object for you ambition she murmur virtuously but the lady with the gray hair and the odd little twist to she smile now lean forward and take a hand in the conversation see here lydium mr hexter remonstrate in crisp tone what be the matter with the girl 's aspire after a blouse like yours you take a lot of trouble and spend a lot of money to get that one i notice you be careful to tell I it be import because i could not see the neck-band and find out that detail for myself that blouse be a dream -- it be a dream if it be good enough aspiration for you or I why not for this girl oh but mr hexter murmur the mortified miss session glance uneasily toward the mill-girl contingent which be listen eagerly and then at the speaker of the day i be sure mr archbold will agree with I that it would be a gross material idea to aspire after blouse and such-like when the poor child need -- er -- other thing so much more yes be i do that concede johnnie dutifully those changeful eye of hers full of pensive deny desire as they sweep the dainty gown of the woman before she i do -- you be right i would not think of spending my money for a dress-body like that when i be mighty near as barefoot as a rabbit this minute and the little ` un back home have to have every cent i can save i just think that if beautiful wish be ever really come true -- if it be right and proper for a person to have beautiful wish -- i would like -- she voice falter into discourage silence tear gather and hang thick on she lash miss session send a beseech look toward the lady from london mrs archbold step accommodatingly into the breach all aspiration be good she say gently i should not be discourage because it take a rather concrete form johnnie 's eye be upon she face try to understand a concrete form she imagine might allude to the fact that miss session have a better figure than she mr hexter glad of a ally toss that incorrigible gray head of hers and dash into the conversation once more if i be you johnnie i would just aspire as hard as i could in that direction she say recklessly she mischievous glance upon the flow line of johnnie 's young shoulder and throat a blouse like that would be awfully fetch on you you would look lovely in it why should not you aspire to it maybe you 'll have one just as pretty before the style change i be sure you be nice enough and good-looking enough for the best in the way of purple and fine linen to come to you by the law of attraction -- do not you believe in the law of attraction mr archbold lydium session get up and move away in shocked silence mr hexter be a good deal of a thorn in she flesh and she only tolerate she because of mr hexter and he position after the retreat and disaffected hostess come mr archbold 's voice with a thread of laughter in it i believe in the law of such attraction as this girl have she say kindly what be it you walt whitman say about the fluid and attach character that all heart yearn toward it that old and young must give it love that be my dear turn explainingly to johnnie the character which give much love take much interest in those about it make itself one with other people and they affair -- do you get my meaning i think i understand half whisper johnnie glowing eye on the face of the speaker do you mean that i be anything like that i do love everybody -- most but how could i help it when everybody be so good and kind to I the glance of the older woman meet across the bright head she will not have much use for foot to climb with mr hexter sum it up take she figure from the talk earlier in the afternoon she be get wing and puzzle johnnie could only smile from one to the other wing whisper mandy meacham to herself mandy be not only restricted to the use of spiritual foot she be lame in the soul as well poor creature wing -- air they callin ' she a angel chapter ix a bit of metal in the valley of tennessee spring have a trick of drop down on the world like a steam wet blanket the season that johnnie consadine go to work in the mill at cottonville may come in with warm rain stifle night follow sultry drenching day till vegetation everywhere sprout unwholesomely and the mountain slope have almost the reek of tropic jungle yet the girl perform the labor of a factory weaver with almost passionate enthusiasm and devotion always and always she be look beyond the mere present moment if tend loom be the road which lead to the power and the glory what need to complain that it -- the mere road -- be but dull earth she try conscientiously to do and be exactly what lydium session seem to want gray stoddard 's occasional speak word or the more lengthy write message he have take to put in the book he send she seem to demand of she nothing but always inspire to much for all he disposition to keep hand off the personal development of he friend perhaps on account of it gray make a excellent teacher and these writings -- the garner grain the gist of he own wide culture -- be the very sinew for the race johnnie be set out on she begin to intelligently guard she speech she manner she very thought conform they to what she know of he ideal miss session 's strive to build up a imitation lady on the sincere foundation johnnie offer appeal less to the girl and have therefore less effect but she immediately respond to stoddard 's method tuck in to the book she return write query or record of perplexity which gradually expand into note expression of she own awaken thought and even fancy which hold from the first a quaint charm and individuality the long hot day at the foot of the hill do seem to the mountain-bred creature interminable and stifle perspiration drip from white face as the operative stand listlessly at they loom or the child straggle back and forth in the narrow lane between the frame tend the endlessly turn spool the hardwick mill have both spin and weave department administrative ability be as much a native gift as the poet 's voice or the actor 's grace and the manager of any large business be always on the lookout for it before johnnie consadine have be two month in the factory she be give charge of a spinning room but the dignity of the new position -- even the increase of pay -- have a cloud upon it she be begin to understand the enmity there be between the soulless factory and the human tide that feed its life she know now that the task of the little spinner which seem less than child 's play be deadly in they monotony they long indoor hour and the vibrant clamor amid which they be perform she own vigorous young frame resist valiantly yet the Saturday half-holiday the Sunday of rest could scarcely renew she for the exorbitant hour of mechanical toil as she leave the mill those sultry evening with the heat mist still tremulous over the valley and heat lightning bicker in the west she go with a lagging step up the village street not look as have be she wont first toward the far blue mountain and then at the glorious state of the big valley the house of the operative be set up haphazard and the village be deny all beauty most of the yard be unfenced and here and there a row of shanty would be crowd so close together that speech in one could be hear in the other and then if any ketchin ' disease do break out like the dipthery do last year mavity bence say one evening as she walk home with johnnie hit 's sartin shore to go through 'em like it would go through a family johnnie look curiously at the dirty yard with they debris of lard bucket and tin can space -- air earth and sky -- be cheap and plentiful in the mountain it seem strange to be spare of it down here where people be so rich what make 'em build so close aunt mavity she ask hit 's the company return mr bence lifelessly they do not want to spend any more than they have to for land besides they want everything to be nigh to the mill lord -- hit do not make no differ only when a fire start in a row of 'em hit clean up the company 's property same as it do the plunder of the folk that live in 'em you just get to be thankful if there do not chance to be one or more baby child lock up in the house and burn along with the other stuff i have know that to happen more than oncet johnnie 's face whiten miss lydium say she be go to persuade she brother-in-law to furnish a kindergarten and a day nursery for the hardwick mill she offer hastily they have one at some other mill down in georgium and she say it be fine the way they take care of the child while the mother be at work in the factory uh-uh put in mandy meacham slowly speak over the shoulder of the two but i would a heap ruther take care of my own child -- ef i have one a ' ef the mill can afford to pay for it the one way they can afford to pay for it t ` other way miss liddy 's scheme be all for the showin ' off of the swell and the rich folk i reckon that with she hit 'll end in talk anyhow -- hit always do aunt mavity pursue johnnie timidly do you reckon the water 's unhealthy down here in cottonville look like all the child in the mill have the same white puny look i think maybe the water do not agree with they mavity bence laugh out mirthlessly the water she echo in a tone of amuse contempt johnnie you be mighty smart about some thing cai not you see that a cotton mill be bind to either kill or cripple a child they that do not die sort o ' drag along and grow up to be mis ` able undersized sickly somebody hit 's true the hardwick mill will not run night turn hit 's true they show mo ' good will about hirin ' older child but if you can make a cotton mill healthy for young-un you can do more than god a ` mighty she wipe she eye furtively lou be well grow before ever she go in the mill i know in reason hit never hurt she i mean these here mammy that i see puttin ' little trick to work that ort to be runnin ' out o ' door gettin ' they strength and growth -- well po ' soul i reckon they do not know no better god forgive 'em but if they get sick or anything there be always the hospital johnnie speak up hopefully as they pass the clean white building stand high on its green slope the hospital echo mandy with a half-terrified glance over she shoulder yes ef you want to be ship out of town in a box for the student doctor to cut up i reckon the hospital be a good place it be just like everything else the rich swell do -- it be for they profit not for we 'n they be a lot of big talk when they build that thar hospital and every one of we be ax to give something for bed and such we be tell that if we get hurt in the mill we could go thar free and if we fall sick they would doctor we for little or nothin ' they can afford it -- considerin ' the price they git for dead body i reckon now mandy you do not believe any such as that remonstrate johnnie with a half-smile believe it -- i know it to be true mandy stick to she point stubbornly thar be lura dawson she folk be comin ' down to git the body and bury hit and when they get here the hospital folk could not tell 'em whar to look -- no they could not atla dawson ` low he 'll git even with 'em if it take he the rest of he natural life he wife be a bushare and she whole tribe be out agin the hospital folk and the mill folk down here i reckon you live too far up in the mountain to hear the talk but some of these swell have better look out as the long hot day follow each other johnnie notice how mandy fail she hand be forever at she side where she have a stitch-like pain that she call a jumpin ' misery even broad seasoned mavity bence grow pallid and gaunt only pap hime thrive he trouble be rheumatism and the hot day be he best of evening he would sit on the porch in he broad rush-bottomed chair the big yellow cat on he knee and smoke he pipe and if he care to do so banter unkindly with the girl on the step early in the season as it be the upstairs room be terribly hot and sometimes the poor creature sit or lay on the porch till well past midnight across the gulch be song and the strumming of banjo or guitar where the young fellow at the inn wake late the rich people on top of the hill be begin to make they preparation to flit to the seashore or mountain lydium session leave for two week promise to return in June and the uplift work droop neglect there seem to be a understanding that people do not need uplift so much during hot weather gray stoddard be faithful in the matter of book he carry they to lydium session and discuss with that young lady a complete course of read for johnnie lydium be in the position of one take bad medicine for good result she could not but delight in any enterprise which bring stoddard intimately to she yet the discussion of johnnie consadine the admiration he express for the girl 's character and work be as so much quinine johnnie herself be dumb and abashed now in he presence she seek vainly for the poise and composure which be she natural birthright in most of the situation of life yet she perturbation be not that of distress the sight of he the sound of he voice even if he be not say good morning to she would cheer she heart for one whole long hot day : and if he speak to she if he look at she nothing could touch she with sadness for hour afterward she ask no question why this be so she meet it with a sort of desperate bravery accept the joy refuse to see the sorrow there might be in it and she rob herself of necessary sleep to read stoddard 's book to study they to wring from they the last precious crumb of help or information that they might have for she the mountain dweller be a mental creature a environment which build lean vigorous body be apt to nourish keen alert mind johnnie crowd into she few month of night read a world of ripening culture ever since the Sunday morning of the automobile ride shade buckheath have be make elaborate pretense of have forget that such a person as johnnie consadine exist if he see she approach he turn he back and when force to recognize she barely growl some unintelligible greet then one evening she come suddenly into the machine room she walk slowly down the long aisle between piece of whir machinery carry all eye with she it be a offence to buckheath to note how the other young fellow turn from they task to look after she she have no business down here where the man be that be just like a fool girl always run after -- she pause at he bench shade she say bend close so that he might hear the word i get leave to come in and ask you to make I a thing like this -- see show a pattern for a peculiarly slotted strip of metal buckheath return to the surly indifference of demeanor which be natural to he yet he smile covertly as he examine the draw she have make of the thing she want he divine in this movement of johnnie 's but a attempt to approach himself and as she explain with some particularity he pay more attention to the girl than to she word i want a big enough hole here to put a bolt through she repeat shade -- do you understand you be not listen to one word i say buckheath turn and grin broadly at she what be the use of this foolishness johnnie he inquire clink the strip of metal between he finger look like you and I could find a chance to visit without go to so much trouble johnnie open she gray eye wide and stare at he foolishness she echo mr stoddard do not call it foolishness when i name it to he he say i be to have anything i want make and that one of the loom-fixer could attend to it mr stoddard -- what be he get to do with it demand shade he have not anything but that i speak to he about it and he tell I to try any plan i want to well the less you talk to the boss -- a girl like you work here in the mill -- the better name you 'll bear shade tell she twist the drawing in he hand and regard she from under lowered brow do not tear that caution johnnie impatiently i have to speak to some of the people in authority sometimes -- the same as you do what be the matter with you shade buckheath there be nothing the matter with I buckheath declare wag he head portentously and avoid she eye then the wrath the sense of personal injury which have be simmer in he ever since he see she sit beside stoddard in the young mill owner 's car break forth when i see a girl ride in a automobile with one of these young boss he growl close to she ear i know what to think -- and so do everybody else it be out he have say it at last he stare at she fiercely the red dye she face and neck at he word and look for a desperate moment she take counsel with herself then she lift she head and look squarely in buckheath 's face oh _ that be _ what have be the matter with you all this time be it she inquire well i be glad you speak and relieve you mind then she go on evenly mr stoddard have be up in the mountain that Sunday to get a flower that he want like the one you step on and break the day i come down i be up there and show he where the thing grow then it rain and he bring I down in he car that be all there be to it mighty poor excuse grunt shade turn he shoulder to she it be not a excuse at all say johnnie you have no right to ask excuse for what i do -- or explanation either for that matter i have tell you the truth about it because we be old friend and you name it to I but i be sorry now that i speak at all give I that draw and those pattern back some of the other loom-fixer can make what i want you get mad quick do not you buckheath ask turn to she with a half-taunting half-relenting smile on he face red-headed people always do no i be not mad johnnie tell he as she have tell he long ago but i 'll thank you not to name mr stoddard to I again if i have not the right to speak to anybody i need to why it certainly be not you place to tell I of it go ` long say buckheath surlily i 'll fix 'em for you and without another word the girl leave he after johnnie be go buckheath chew for some time the bitter cud of chagrin he be wholly mistaken then in the object of she visit to the mechanical department yet he be a cool-headed fellow always alert for that which might bring he gain push aspire he subscribe for and faithfully study a mechanic ' journal which continually urge upon its reader the profit of patent small improvement on machinery already in use indeed everybody these day in the factory be on the lookout for patentable improvement why might not johnnie have stumble on to something worth while that passmore and consadine tribe be all smart fool he make the slotted strip she want and deliver they to she the next day with civil word when after she have they in use on the spin jenny upstairs for a week she come down bring they for certain minute alteration he attitude be one of friendly helpfulness you say you use 'em on the frame what for how do they work he ask she examine the little contrivance lingeringly they be work pretty well she tell he even the way they be -- a good deal too long and with that slot not cut deep enough i be right proud of myself when i look at they any boy or girl tend a frame can go to the end of it and see if anything 's the matter without walk plumb down when you get they fix the way i want they i tell you they 'll be fine the next afternoon see shade buckheath in the spooling room watch the operation of johnnie consadine 's simple device for notify the frame-tender if a thread foul or break let I take 'em all down to the basement he say finally when he have study they from every point of view for fifteen minute they be not as well polish as i would like to have 'em and i think they might be a little longer in the shank there ought to be a ring of babbit metal around that slot too -- i reckon i could get it in watauga if you 'll let I take 'em now i 'll fix 'em up for you soon as i can so that they 'll do fine johnnie remonstrate half-heartedly as he gather the crude little invention from the frame but he proposition wear a plausible face and she suffer he to take they they be not but five here he say to she sharply i know i make you six where 's the other one he look so startled he speak so anxiously that she laugh i think that must be the one i carry home she say carelessly i have a file and be try to fix it myself one evening and i reckon i never bring it back johnnie say shade come close and speak in a low confidential tone that be almost affectionate if i be you i would not name this business to anybody wait till we get it all fix right he pursue as he see the rise wonder in she face no need to tell every feller all you know -- so he 'll be jest as smart as you be be not that so and you git I that other strip i do not want it layin ' round for somebody to get hold of and -- you find I that other strip hunt it up will not you well you sure talk curious to-day johnnie tell he i do not see anything to be ashamed of in my loving to fool with machinery if i _ be _ a girl but i 'll get you the strip if i can find it i be mighty proud of be a room boss and i aim to make my room the best one in the mill shade do you know that i get eight dollar a week i have be send money home to mother and i have get a room to myself down at pap hime 's and mr session say they 'll raise I again soon i want 'em to see this thing work well look here break in shade swiftly do not you say anything to the boss about this -- he shake the strip in he hand -- not till i have have a chance to talk to you again you know i be you friend do not you johnnie i reckon so return truthful johnnie with unflattering moderation you get I those thing do as quick as you can please shade after this the matter drop two or three time johnnie remind shade of he promise to bring the little strip back and always he have a excuse ready for she : he have be very busy -- the metal he want be out of stock -- he would fix they for she just as soon as he could with every interview he manner toward herself grow kinder -- more distinctly that of a lover the loom-fixer and mechanic belong be it remember to a trades-union be out of all the mill by five o'clock it be a significant point for any student of economic condition to note these strap young male sit at ease upon the porch of they home or board house when the sweating fagged woman weaver and childish spinner troop across the bridge a hour after johnnie be surprised therefore one evening nearly two week later to find shade wait for she at the door of the mill i wish ' t you would walk a piece up the gap road with I i want to have speech with you the young fellow tell she i can not go far i ` most always try to be home in time to help aunt mavity put supper on the table or anyway to wash up the dish for she the girl reply to he all right agreed buckheath briefly wait here a minute and let I get some thing i want to take along he stop at a little shed back of the office sometimes call the garage because stoddard 's car stand in it johnnie drop down on a box at the door and the young fellow go inside and begin search the pocket of a coat hang on a peg he speak over he shoulder to she what be the matter with you here lately since you get you raise ` pear like you will not look at a body have not i seem friendly johnnie return with a deprecate smile i reckon i be just tired seem like i be tired every minute of the day -- and i could not tell you why i sure do not have anything hard to do i think sometimes i need the good hard work i use to have back in the mountain to get rest on she laugh up at he and buckheath 's emotional nature answer with a dull anger which be he only reply to she attraction i be go to invite you to go to a dance in at watauga Saturday night he say sullenly but i reckon if you be tire all the time you do not want to go he have hope and expect that she would say she be not too tired to go anywhere that he wish she to he disappointment be disproportionate when she sighingly agree : yes i reckon i have not better go to any dance i would not for the world break down at my work when i have just begin to earn so much and be send money home to mother inside the office lydium session stand near she brother 's desk she have go down as she sometimes do to take he home in the carriage oh here you be miss session say gray stoddard come in i have bring those book for johnnie there be a lot of they here for she to make selection from as you be drive perhaps you would not mind let I set they in the carriage then i will not go up past you house miss session glance uneasily at the volume he carry do you think it be wise to give a ignorant untrained girl like that the choice of she own reading she say at length stoddard laugh it be as far as my wisdom go he reply promptly i would as soon think of get up a form of prayer for a fellow creature as lay out a course of read for he well then suggest miss session why not let she take up a chatauqua course i be sure many of they be excellent she would be properly guide and -- and encroach less on you time my time echo stoddard never mind that feature i be immensely interested it be fascinating to watch the development of so fine a mind which have lie almost entirely fallow to the culture of school i quite enjoy look out a bunch of book for she and watch to see which one will most appeal to she she instinct have prove wholly trustworthy so far indeed if it do not seem exaggerated i should say she taste be faultless miss session flush and set she lip together faultless she repeat with a attempt at a smile i fancy johnnie find out what you admire most and make favorite of you favorite stoddard look a bit blank for a instant then well -- perhaps -- she do he allow hesitatingly he usual tolerant smile hold a hint of indulgent tenderness and there be a vibration in he voice which strike to lydium session 's heart like a knife no you be mistaken he add after a moment 's reflection you do not realize how little i have talk to the child about book -- or anything else for that matter it do chance that she taste be mine in very many case but you underrate we protg when you speak of she as ignorant and uncultured she know a good deal more about some thing than either of we it be she fund of nature lore that make thoreau and white of selborne appeal to she now i love they because i know so little about what they write of lydium session instantly fasten upon the one point she protest almost anxiously but surely you would not call she culture -- a factory girl who have live in a hut in the mountain all she life she be try hard i admit but she speech be -- well it certainly be rather uncivilized stoddard look as though he might debate that matter a bit then he question instead : do you ever get a letter from she she do not carry she quaint little archaism of pronunciation and wording into she write she letter be delicious miss session turn hastily to the window and look out apparently to observe whether she brother be ready to leave or not johnnie consadine 's letter -- she letter what -- when -- of course she could not baldly question he in such a matter and the simple explanation of a little note of thanks with a return book or the leaf which report impression from its reading tuck in between the page occur to she perturb mind you quite astonish I she say finally well -- that _ be _ good hearing mr stoddard with sudden decision do not you believe that it would be well worth while in view of all this to raise the money and send john consadine away to a good school there be several fine one in new england where she might partially work she way and really from what you say it seem to I she be worthy of such a chance stoddard glance at she in surprise why miss session do not this look like go squarely back on you most cherish theory if it be only to bestow a little money and send she away to some half-charity school what become of you argument that people who have have advantage should give of themselves and they comradeship to those they wish to help there be a boyish eagerness in he manner he changeful gray-brown eye be alight he come close and lay a hand on she arm -- quite a unusual demonstration with gray stoddard you must not discourage I he say winningly i be such a hopeful disciple i have never enjoy anything more in my life than this enterprise you and i have undertake together provide the right food for so bright and so responsive a mind miss lydium look at he in a sort of despair yes -- oh yes i quite understand that she agree almost mechanically i do not mean to go back on my principle but what john need be a good sound education from the beginning do not you think so no say stoddard promptly indeed i do not development must come from within to give it a chance -- to lend it stimulus -- that be all a friend can do a ready-made education plaster on the outside cultivate nobody moreover johnnie be in no cry need of mere schooling you do not seem to know how well provide she have be in that respect but the thing that settle the matter be that she would not accept any such charitable arrangement unless you be tire of we present method i vote to continue it lydium session have be for some moment watch johnnie consadine who sit on she box at the door of the little garage she have refrain from mention this fact to she companion but now shade buckheath step out to join johnnie and instantly lydium turn and motion stoddard to she look there she whisper do not they make a perfect couple you and i may do what we choose about cultivate the girl 's mind -- she 'll marry a man of she own class and there it will end why should you say that ask stoddard abruptly those two do not belong to the same class they -- oh mr stoddard they grow up side by side they go to school together and i imagine be sweetheart long before they come to cottonville do you think that make they of the same class ask stoddard impatiently i should say the presumption be still greater the other way i be not allude to social class you be so odd murmured lydium session these mountaineer be all alike \* \* \* \* \* the village road be a smother of white dust the weed beside it droop powdered head evil odour reek through the little place but when shade and johnnie have pass its confines the air from the mountain greet they sweetly the dusty white road give place to springy leaf-mould mix with tiny sharp stone a young moon ride low in the west the tank-a-tank of cowbell sound from homing animal up in the dusky gap whip-poor-will be begin to call i be glad i come say johnnie push the hair off she hot forehead she be speak to herself aware that buckheath pay little attention but walk in silence a step ahead twist a little branch of sassafras in he finger the spicy odour of the bark be afterward associate in johnnie 's mind with what he have then to say johnnie he begin face around and bar she way when they be finally alone together between the tree do you remember the last time you and I be on this piece of road here -- do you he have intend to remind she of the evening she come to cottonville : but instead recollection build for she once more the picture of that slope bath in sabbath sunshine there be the fork where the hardwick carriage have turn off to this side go shade and he fellow with mandy and the girl follow and down the middle of the road she herself come seat in the car beside stoddard for a moment memory choke and blind johnnie she could neither see the path before they nor find the voice to answer she questioner the bleak pathos of she situation come home to she and tear of rare self-pity fill she eye why be it a disgrace that stoddard should treat she kindly why must she be ashamed of she feeling for he shade 's voice break in harshly do you remember you be not forget have you ever since that time i have intend to speak to you -- to tell you -- well you need not do it she interrupt he passionately i will not hear a word against mr stoddard if that be what you be aim at buckheath fall back a pace and stare with angry eye stoddard -- gray stoddard he repeat what be a swell like that get to do with you and I johnnie consadine you want to let gray stoddard and he kind alone -- yes and make they let you alone if you and I be go to marry it be johnnie 's turn to stare if we be go to marry she echo blankly -- go to marry the girl have have she lover despite hard work and the stigma of belong to the borrowing passmore family johnnie have command the homage of more than one heart she be not without a healthy young woman 's relish for this sort of admiration but shade buckheath 's proposal come with so little grace in such almost sinister form that she scarcely recognize it yes if we be go to wed reiterate buckheath sullenly i be willin ' to have you johnnie 's tense almost tragic manner relax she laugh suddenly i do not know you be joke shade she say good-humouredly i take you to be in earnest you 'll have to excuse I i be in earnest buckheath tell she almost fiercely i reckon i be a fool but i want you any day -- he speak with a curious half-savage reluctance -- any day you 'll say the word i 'll take you he eye like he voice be resentful yet eager he take off he hat and wipe the perspiration from he brow look away from she now toward the road by which they have climb johnnie regard he through she thick eyelash the smile still linger bright in she eye after all it be only a rather unusual kind of sweethearting and not a case of it to touch she feeling i be mighty sorry she say soberly but i be not aimin ' to wed any man fix like i be mother and the child have to be look after and i can not ask a man to do for 'em so i have it to do myself of course i can not take you mother and the child buckheath object querulously as though she have ask he to do so but you i 'll take and you would do well to think it over you will not get such a chance soon again and i be apt to change my mind if you put on air with I this way johnnie shake she head i know it be a fine chance shade she say in the kindest tone but i be hope you will change you mind and that soon for it be just like i tell you she turn with evident intention of go back and terminate they interview buckheath step beside she in helpless fury he know she would have other opportunity and better he be aware how futile be this threat of withdraw he proposition hot tired angry the dust of the way prickle on he face and neck he be persistently conscious of a letter in the pocket of he striped shirt over he heavily beat heart warm and moist like the shirt itself with the sweat of he body good lord that letter which have come from washington this morning inform he that the device this girl have invent be patentable fill she hand with gold it be necessary that he should have control of she and at once he put from he the knowledge of how she charm work upon he -- bind he the faster every time he speak to she cold calculate sluggishly selfish he have not reckon with she radiant personality nor have the instinct to know that approach closely it must inevitably light in he unwelcome and inextinguishable fire johnnie he say finally you be not say no to I be you you take time to think it over -- but not so very long -- i 'll name it to you again please do not shade remonstrate the girl walk on fast despite the oppressive heat of the evening i wish you would not speak of it to I any more and i can not go walk with you this way i have oblige to help aunt mavity and every minute of time i get from that and my work i be put in on my book and read she step ahead of he now and buckheath regard she back with sullen sombre eye what be he to do how come nearer she when she thus hold herself aloof johnnie consadine the girl check she step a bit at a new sound in he voice i 'll tell you just one thing and you would better never forget it neither i be not no fool i know mighty well a ' good you reason for treat I this-a-way you reason 's get a name hit 's call mr gray stoddard you behave yo ` self a ' listen to reason or i 'll get even with he for it damn he -- i 'll fix he chapter x the sandal of joy come in here johnnie mavity bence call one day as johnnie be pass a strange little cluttered cubbyhole under the garret stair and out over the roof of the lean-to kitchen it be a hybrid apartment between a large closet and a small room one four-paned window give scant light and ventilation all the broken or disused plunder about the house be pitch into it and in the middle sit a tumbled bed it be the woman 's sleep place and she dead daughter have share it with she during she lifetime johnnie stop at the door with a hand on each side of its frame reddin ' up thing aunt mavity she ask add if i have time i would come in and help you i be just puttin ' away what i have get leave that belong to lou say the woman sit suddenly down on the bed and gaze up into the bright face above she with a sort of appeal johnnie notice then that mr bence have a pair of cheap slipper in she lap it come back vividly to the girl how the newspaper have say that louvanium bence have take off she slipper and leave they on the bridge that she might climb the net more easily to throw herself into the water the mother stare down at these dry-eyed she never have 'em on but the once mavity bence breathe and i -- and i r ` are out on she for buyin ' of 'em i say that with pap so old and all we have not money to spend for slipper lord god -- she shiver -- we have to find money for the undertaker when he come to lay she out she turn to johnnie feverishly like a thing that writhe on the rack and seek a easier position i have the best for she then -- i jest would do it -- there be white shoe and stockin 's and a reg ` lar shroud like they make at watauga we never put a stitch on she that she would wear -- hit be all new-bought for once i say my say to pap and make he take money out of the bank to do it he be get some in thar for to bury all of we -- he say -- but he never want to use any of it for lou johnnie come in and sit down on the bed beside she hostess she lay a loving hand over mavity 's that hold the slipper what pretty little foot she must have have she say softly do not she echo the mother with a tremulous half-smile i could not more 'n get these here on my hand but they be a loose fit for she they be as good as new johnnie ef you ever get a invite to a dance i 'll lend 'em to you hit would pleasure I to think some gal 's foot be dancin ' in they thar slipper lou she never learn to dance -- look like she could never find time louvanium be it remember have find time in which to die so johnnie thank poor mavity and hurry away because the warning whistle be blow the very next Wednesday miss session give a dance to the member of she uplift club these gaiety be rather singular and ingenious affair sterilize dance mr hexter irreverently dub they miss lydium do not invite the young man employ about the mill not have as yet undertake they uplifting and feeling quite inadequate to cope with the relation between they and the mill girl which would be something vital and genuine and as such quite foreign -- if not inimical -- to she enterprise she contented herself with bring in a few well-trained young male of she own class who be expect to be attentive to the girl treat they as equal just as miss lydium do for the rest the member be encourage to dance with each other and find such joy as they might in the supper and the fact that miss session pay for a half-day 's work for they on the morrow that they might lie late in bed after a night 's pleasure johnnie consadine have begin to earn money in such quantity as seem to she economic experience extremely large she pay she board send a little home to she mother and have still wherewith to buy a frock for the dance she treat herself to a trolley ride in to watauga to select this dress go on the Saturday half-holiday which the mill give they worker lest the labor law regulate the hour per week which woman and child may be employ be infringe upon there be grave debate in johnnie 's mind as to what she should buy color would fade -- in cheap goods anyhow -- white soil easily but then i could wash and iron it myself any evening i want to wear it she argue to mandy meacham who accompany she i would be proud to do it for you return mandy loyally ordinarily the meacham woman be selfish but have find a object upon which she could center she thin watery affection she proceed to be selfish for johnnie instead of toward she a spiritual juggle which some mother perform in regard to they child the store reach johnnie show good judgment in she choice there be a great sale on at the biggest shopping place in watauga and the ready-made summer wear be to be have at bargain rate not for she be the flare coarse scant garment whose lack of seemliness be suppose to be atone for by a profusion of cheap sleazy trim after long and somewhat painful inspection since most of the thing she want be hopelessly beyond she johnnie carry home a fairly fine white lawn simply tuck and fitting to perfection but you have get a shape that set off anything say the saleswoman carelessly deal out the compliment she keep in stock with she goods for purchaser you be mighty right she have rejoin mandy sharply as who should say my back be not a true expression of my desire concern back look at this other -- she have the spine of my dream the saleswoman chew gum while they wait for change and parcel and in the interval she have time to inspect johnnie more closely work in the cotton mill be you she ask as she sort up she stock jingle the bracelet on she wrist and pat into shape she big frizzy pompadour that be awful hard work be not it i should think a girl like you would try for a place in a store i 'll bet you could get one she add encouragingly as she hand the parcel across the counter but already johnnie know that the spurious elegance of this young person 's appearance be not what she wish to emulate the night of the dance johnnie adjust she costume with the nice skill and care which seem native to so many of the daughter of america mandy dress at the same bureau scraggle the parting of she own hair furtively watch the deft arrange of johnnie 's let I do it for you and part it straight johnnie remonstrate aw hit 'll never be see on a gallopin ' hoss return mandy carelessly everybody 'll be so tuck up a-watchin ' you that they will not have time to notice be my hair part straight nohow but you be not a gallop horse object johnnie laughing and clutch the comb away from she you have get mighty pretty hair mandy if you would give it a chance why it be curly let I do it up right for you once so the thin gray ringlet be loosen around the meager forehead and indeed mandy 's appearance be considerably ameliorate there -- be not that nice inquire johnnie turn she companion around to the glass and force she to gaze in it -- a thing mandy always instinctively avoid i reckon i have look worse agree the tall woman unenthusiastically but miss lyddy be not carin ' to have ye fix up much i get sort of feisty and want to dav-il she by makin ' you look pretty wish ' t you would wear that brea ' - pin o ' mine a ' they ring a ' bead i borried from lizzie for ye you might just as well and then nobody would know you from one o ' the swell johnnie shake she fair head decidedly talk of borrow thing bring a reminiscent flush to she cheek i be just as much oblige she say sweetly i 'll wear nothing but what be my own after a while i 'll be able to afford jewellery and that 'll be the time for I to put it on presently come mavity bence bring the treasured footwear i expect they 'll be a little tight for I johnnie remark somewhat doubtfully the slipper though cheap ill-cut thing look so much smaller than she heavy country-made shoe but they go readily upon the arched foot of the mountain girl mandy and the poor mother look on with deep interest i

have -- er -- disability and affliction that make it difficult for she to get along she be a very worthy case the young man from watauga who have not regard johnnie as a case at all but have consider she purely as a exceptionally attractive young woman look a trifle bewildered then gray take he arm and lead he across to where the attempt at two-stepping have break up in laugh disorder with that absolutely natural manner which miss session could never quite achieve good as she intention be he perform the introduction and then say pleasantly : mr baker want to ask you to dance miss johnnie i 'll carry on miss amanda 's teaching or we 'll sit down here and talk if she would rather no more two-steppin ' for I agree miss meacham seat herself decidedly i 'll take my step one at a time from

instruction as johnnie get the step and time and then move away smoothly gray take the seat beside mandy be not she a wonder inquire the big woman stare fondly after the flutter white skirt she be indeed agree gray quietly and then mandy be thus launch on the congenial theme -- the one theme upon which she be ever loquacious -- out come the story of the purchase of the dress the compliment of the saleswoman the refusal of the borrow jewellery johnnie 's quare -- she be that -- i 'll never deny it but i cai not no more help likin ' she than as if she be my own bear sister that be because she be fond of you too suggest gray thinking of the girl 's laborious attempt to teach poor mandy to dance do you reckon she be ask the tall woman flush look like johnnie consadine love every livin ' thing on the top side of this earth i be not never see the human yet that she be not get a good word for but i do not know as she care ` specially ` bout _ I _ stoddard could not refuse the assurance for which mandy so naively angled you would not be so fond of she if she be not fond of you he assert confidently mebbe i would not mandy debate but i do not know let johnnie put they two eye o ' hern on you and laugh in you face and you feel just like you would follow she to the end of the earth -- or i know i do why she do up my hair this evening and -- the voice sink to a half-shamed whisper -- she say it be pretty gray turn and look into the flush tremulous face beside he with a sudden tightening in he throat how cruel humanity be when it behold only the grotesque in the mandy of this world she hair be pretty -- and johnnie have the eye of love to see it he stare down the long light room with unseeing gaze old andrew macpherson 's counsel that he let johnnie consadine alone appeal to he at that moment as cruel good sense he be recall from he musing by mandy 's voice oh look thar whisper he companion excitedly the other town feller have ask for a knock-down to johnnie too look at he passin ' he bow with she just like she be one of the swell stoddard look charlie conroy be relieve baker of he partner johnnie have evidently be ask if she be tire for they see she laughingly shake she head and the new couple finish what be leave of the two-step and seat themselves a moment at the other side of the room to wait for the next dance to begin these affair be great fun be not they inquire conroy fan he late partner vigorously i love to dance better than anything else in the world i believe return johnnie dreamily oh a dance -- i should suppose so you move as though you enjoy it but i mean a performance like this the girl be great fun do not you think but then you would not get quite we point of view on that he glance again at she dress it be plain and simple but good style and become she wear no jewellery but lot of girl be rather affect that now especially the athletic type to which this young beauty seem to belong surely he be not mistake in guess she to be one of miss session 's friend of course he be not she have dress herself in this simple fashion for a mill-girl 's dance that she might not embarrass the work people who attend yes by george that be it and it be a long ways-better taste than the frock miss session and mr hexter be wear johnnie consider he last remark she gaze still follow the movement of the negro fiddler at the head of the room understand he to mean that be a mill-hand herself she could not get a detach view of the matter and thus see the humor of this attempt to make society woman of working-girl johnnie be yet not affront she clear eye come back from watch uncle zeke 's maneuver and look frankly into the eye of the man beside she i reckon we be right funny she assent but of course as you say i would not see that as quick as you would sometimes i have to laugh a little at mandy -- the girl i be dance with first this evening -- but -- but she be so good-natured it never hurt she feeling i do not mind be laugh at myself either laugh at -- you inquire conroy throw a immense amount of expression into he glance he be rather a lady 's man and fancy he have make pretty fair headway with this beautiful girl whom he still suppose to be of the circle of factory owner oh you mean you work among the mill girl here indeed i should not laugh at that i think it be noble for those more fortunate to stretch a hand to help they brother and sister that have not so good a chance that be what bring I over here to-night gray stoddard explain the plan to I he do not seem to think much of it -- but then gray 's a socialist at heart and you know those socialist never believe in organize charity i tell he he be a anarchist mr stoddard be a mighty good man agree johnnie with sudden pensiveness they have all be mighty good to I ever since i have be here but i believe mr stoddard have do more for I than any one else he not only lend I book but he take time to explain thing to I conroy smile covertly at the simplicity of this young beauty he debate in he mind whether indeed it be not a affect simplicity of course gray be devote himself to she and lend she book of course he would be glad to assume the position of mentor to a girl who bid fair to be such a pronounced social success and who be herself so charming how long have you be in cottonville miss consadine he ask do tell I who you be visit -- or be you visit here oh no johnnie correct he i believe you have not understand from the first that i be one of the mill girl i board at -- well everybody call it pap hime 's boarding-house there be a moment 's silence but conroy manage not to look quite as deeply surprise as he feel i -- of course i know it he begin at length after have sort and discard half a dozen explanation there -- why there be we dance and he stand up in relief as the fiddler begin on a old-fashioned quadrille johnnie respond with alacrity not aware of have either rise or fall in she companion 's estimation she dance through the set with smile enjoyment prompt she partner who know only modern dance on he part conroy study she covertly try to adjust he slow mind to this astonishing new state of thing and to decide what a man 's proper attitude might be toward such a girl in the end he find himself with no conclusion they say they be go to try a plain waltz he begin as he lead she back to a seat he hesitate glance about he and finally place himself uneasily in the chair beside she good lord the situation be impossible what should he say if anybody -- gray stoddard for instance -- chaff he about be smite in this quarter a waltz echo johnnie helpfully when he do not go on i believe i could dance that -- i try it once then you 'll dance it with I conroy find himself say baldly awkwardly but unable for the life of he to keep the eagerness out of he voice upon the instant the music strike up the two rise and make ready for the dance conroy place johnnie in waltz position and instruct she solicitously gray stoddard look on be amaze at the naf simple jealousy that sweep over he at the sight she have dance with conroy twice already -- he ought to be more considerate than to bring the girl into notice that way -- a chump like charlie conroy what would he understand of such a nature as johnnie consadine 's before he fully realize he own intention he have pause in front of the two and be speak i think miss johnnie promise I a dance this evening i 'll have to go back to the office in twenty minute and -- i hate to interrupt you but i guess i 'll have to claim my own he become suddenly aware that conroy be signalling he across johnnie 's unconscious head with masonic twisting of the feature stoddard meet these recklessly inconsiderate grimacing with a impassive stare then look away i want to see you before you go the man from watauga remark as he reluctantly resign he partner do not you forget that there be a waltz come to I miss johnnie i be go to have it if we make the band play special for we alone lydia session pass on the arm of young baker glance at johnnie star-eyed pink-cheeked and smile with a pair of tall cavalier contend for she favor and suck she lip in to that thin sharp line of reprobation johnnie know so well dismiss she escort graciously she hurry to the little supper room and find another member of the committee come here mrs hexter just look at that will you she call attention in a carefully suppress but fairly tragic tone to stoddard and johnnie dancing together the only couple on the floor none of the girl know how to waltz i be not sure that it would be suitable if they do when i come past just now there be two of the man -- two -- talk to john consadine and they be all three laugh i can not think how it be that girl of that sort manage to stir thing up so and get all the man around they neither can i say mr hexter wickedly if i do know how i believe i would do it sometimes myself what be it you want of I miss session i must run back and see to supper if you do not need I but i do fret lydium i want you help this waltzing and -- and such thing -- ought to be stop all right rejoin practical mr hexter the quickest way to do it be to stop the music she have mean the speech as a jeer but literal-minded lydium session welcome its suggestion hurry down the long room she speak to the leader of they small orchestra the negro raise to she a brown face full of astonishment he fiddle-bow falter -- stop he turn to he two fellow and give hasty direction the waltz measure die away and a quadrille be announce that be too bad say stoddard as they come to a halt you be just get the step beautifully the girl flash a swift sweet look up at he i do love to dance she breathe john would you be so kind as to come and help in the supper room miss session 's hasty tone break in she be lean on charlie conroy 's arm and when she depart to hide johnnie safely away in the depths of they impromptu kitchen it leave the two man alone together conroy promptly fasten upon the other charlie conroy be a young man who have make up he mind to get on socially such figure be rarer in america than in the old world yet charlie conroy with he petty ambition do not stand entirely alone he seriously regard marriage as a stepping-stone to a circle which should include the best people that this term do not indicate the noblest or most selfless need hardly be explain it mean only that bit of froth which in each community ride high on the top of the cup and which in watauga be augment by the mill owner of its suburb of cottonville conroy have be grateful for the opportunity to make a entry into this circle by means of assist miss session in she charitable work that lady herself as sister-in-law of jerome hardwick and a descendant of a excellent new england family he regard with absolute veneration quite too serious and profound for anything so assure as mere admiration i try to warn you he begin : but you be bind to get sting i beg you pardon return stoddard in that civil colourless interrogation which should always check over-familiar speech even from the dullest but conroy be not sensitive that big red-headed girl you know he say lean close and speaking in a confidential tone i mistook she for a lady i be go my full length -- tell she what fun the mill girl be and try to do the agreeable -- when i find out find out what inquire stoddard that she be not a lady aw come off laugh conroy you make a joke of everything i know that she be a weaver in the mill say stoddard quietly conroy glance half wistfully over he shoulder in the direction where johnnie have vanish she be a good-looker all right he say thoughtfully and smile -- when that girl smile and turn those eye on you -- by george if she be take to new york and put through one of those finish school she would make a sensation in the swagger set stoddard nod gravely he have not conroy 's faith in the fashionable finishing school but what he lack there he make up in conviction as to johnnie 's desert and ability there she come now say conroy as the door swing open to admit a couple of girl with tray of coffee cup she walk mighty well i wonder where a girl like that learn to carry herself so finely by george she _ be _ a good-looker she be get 'em all beat if she be only -- queer about the accident of birth be not it now what would you say in she heredity make a common girl like that step and look like a queen gray stoddard 's face relax a hint of he quizzical inscrutable smile be upon it as he answer nature do not make mistake i do not call johnnie consadine a common girl -- it strike I that she be rather uncommon and outside a young fellow in the Sunday suit of a workingman be walk up and down stare at the light window catch a glimpse now and again of one girl or another and cursing under he breath when he see johnnie consadine would not go with I to the dance at watauga -- oh no but she be not too tired to dance with the

with a possible fracture of the skull yes -- oh yes agree johnnie promptly if i could nurse he myself i would like to -- or help but of course he be get to go to the hospital first of everything stoddard motion the hardwick driver to wait and call down to the carriage load i want you people to drive round by the hospital and send the ambulance if you 'll be so kind there be a man hurt in here lydium session make this a immediate pretext for get down and come in do you say they do not want to send he to the hospital she inquire sharply and openly in she tactless fashion as she cross the

well they have go for the ambulance and the surgeon will soon be here now i do not know nothin ' about veterinarian and surgeon growl pap still alternately mop he bald head and shake it contemptuously but i know that millsap be not a-goin ' to box up any dead body and send 'em to the medical college and i know he make as pretty a job of doctoring old spotty have ever i see to be shore the cow die but he get the medicine down she when it do not look as if human hand could do it -- that be the kind of doctor he be i aim to give mr passmore a teaspoonful of lamp oil -- karosene say the cow doctor

cold lifeless fashion very much she friend inert slow he have one qualification for he position : he could choose a assistant or delegate authority with good judgment and he find in johnnie consadine a adjutant so reliable so apt and of such ability that he continually push more work upon she if pay and honor do not always follow in adequate measure for a time much as she dislike to approach shade with any request johnnie continue to urge he whenever they meet to finish up the indicator and let she have they back again then hartley session promote she to a better position in the weave

such a upstand dark-complected feller as he be he be get the look in the eye too johnnie gasp as she remember that the grandfather of whom she mother speak be virgil passmore and call to mind the story of the borrow wedding coat chapter xv the foot of the child the mountain people be use only to one class never find themselves consciously in the society of they superior johnnie consadine have be unembarrassed and completely mistress of the situation in the presence of charlie conroy who do not fail after the uplift dance to make some further effort to meet the big red-headed girl as he call she she be aware that social overture from such a person be not to be receive by she and she put they aside quite as though she have be accord to she own opinion above rather than beneath they the lover-like pretension of shade buckheath a man dangerous remorseless as careless of the rights of other as any tiger in the jungle she regard with negligent composure but gray stoddard -- ah there she treacherous heart give way and tremble in terror the air of perfect equality he maintain between they he attitude of intimacy flattering almost affectionate this it be which she feel she must not recognize the beloved book which have seem so many step upon which to climb to a world where she dare acknowledge she own liking and admiration for stoddard be now lay aside it take all of she heart and mind and time to visit uncle pro at the hospital keep the child out of pap 's way in the house and do justice to she work in the factory she tell gray haltingly reluctantly that she think she must give up the reading and study for a time not for long i hope stoddard receive she decision with a puzzle air turn in he finger the copy of walden which she be bring back to he perhaps now that you have you mother and the child with you there will be less time for this sort of thing for a while but you have not a mind that can enjoy be inactive you may think you 'll give it up but study -- once you have taste it -- will never let you alone johnnie look up at he with a weak and pitiful version of she usual beam smile i reckon you be right she hesitate finally in a very low voice but sometimes i think the less we know the happier we be how 's this how 's this cry stoddard almost startle why johnnie -- i never expect to hear that sort of thing from you i think you optimism be as deep as a well and as wide as a church poor johnnie surely have need of such optimism as stoddard have ascribe to she they be weary evening when she come home now with the November rain blow in the street and the early-falling dusk almost upon she it be on a Saturday night and she have be to the hospital when she get in to find mandy seat in the darkest corner of the sit room with a red flannel cloth around she neck -- a sure sign that something unfortunate have occur since the tall woman always have sore throat when trouble loom large what be the matter ask johnnie come close and lay a hand on the bent shoulder to peer into the droop countenance do not come too nigh I -- you 'll ketch it warn mandy gloomily a so ' th ` oat be as ketchin ' as smallpox and i know it so to be though they be

nobody cai not outdo I with fowl but the mill -- she break off and sit stare dully at the floor pap hime have stump into the room during the latter part of this conversation lose you job hey he

unless 'n you have get some kind friend that 'll stand for you mandy 's lip part but no sound come the gaze of absolute terror with which she follow the old man 's waddle bulk as he go and seat himself in front of the air-tight stove be more than johnnie could endure i 'll stand for she board pap she say quietly oh you will will ye pap receive she remark with disfavor well a fool and he money do not stay together long and who 'll stand for you johnnie consadine yo ' wages be not a-goin ' to pay for yo ' livin ' and mandy 's too ye need not lay back on bein ' my stepdaughter you be

stand for she hime snort mandy catch at johnnie 's hand and draw it to she fondle it she round eye be still full of tear i do know you be the sweetest thing god ever make she whisper as johnnie look down at she you and deanie and the two go out into the dining room together thar mutter hime to buckheath as the latter pass through on he way to supper you see whether it would do to give johnnie the handlin ' o ' all that thar money from the patent why she would hand it out to the first feller that put up a poor mouth and ask she for it you hear anything buck shade nod come down to the work with I after supper i have get something to show you he say briefly and hime understand that the desire letter have arrive at first laurellum consadine bloom like a late rose in the town atmosphere she delight in the village street she be as wildly exhilarate as a child when she be take on the trolley to watauga with strange inherent deftness she copy the garb the hair dress even the manner and speech of such worthy model as come within she range of vision -- like she daughter she have a eye for fitness and beauty that which be merely fashionable though truly inelegant do not appeal to she she be swift to appreciate the change in johnnie you look a heap prettier and act and speak a heap prettier than you use to up in the mountain she tell the tall girl look like it be a mighty sensible thing for you to come down here to the settlement and if it be good for you i do not see why it be not good for I -- and will not be for the rest of the child no need for you to be so solemn over it the entire household be aghast at the bride 's attitude toward she old husband they watch she with the fascinate gaze we give to a petted child encroach upon the rights of a cross dog or the pretty lady with she little ride whip in the cage of the lion she treat he with a kindly tolerant yet overbearing familiarity that appal she know not to be frighten when he click he tooth but draw up she pretty brow and fret at he that she wish he would not make that noise -- it worry she she tip the sacred yellow cat out of the rocking-chair where it always sleep in state take the chair herself and send that astonished feline from the room it be in laurellum 's evident influence that johnnie put she trust when one evening they all sit in Sunday leisure in the front room -- most of the girl be go to church or out stroll with company -- pap hime broach the question of the child go to work in the mill they be too young pap johnnie say to he mildly they ought to be in school this winter they have every one down to deanie have mo ' than the six week schoolin ' that the law call for snarl hime you be not thinking of put deanie in the mill -- not _ deanie _ -- be you ask johnnie breathlessly why not inquire hime she 'll get no good runnin ' the street here in cottonville and she can earn a little somethin' in the mill i be a old man a sickly and i be not long for this world if they chap be a-goin ' to do anything for I they would better be puttin ' in they lick johnnie look from the little girl 's pink-and-white infantile beauty -- she sit with the child in she lap -- to the old man 's hulk powerful useless frame what would deanie naturally be expect to do for she stepfather nobody 's ask my opinion observe shade buckheath who make one of the family group but as far as i can see there be not a thing to hurt young ` un about mill work and there surely be not any good reason why they should not earn they way same as we all do i reckon they have to work back on unaka goin ' to set 'em up now a make swell of 'em johnnie look bitterly at he but make no reply they will not take they at the hardwick mill she say finally mr stoddard have enforce the rule that they have to have a affidavit with any child the mill employ that it be of legal age and there be nobody go to swear that deanie 's even as much as twelve year old -- nor lissy -- nor pony -- nor milo the oldest be but eleven laurellum have buy a long chain of red glass bead with a heart-shaped pendant this trinket occupy she attention entirely while she daughter and husband discuss the matter of the child 's future johnnie she begin now apparently not have hear one word that have be say do you ever in you life see anything so cheap as this here string of bead for a dime i vow i could live and die in that five-and-ten-cent store at watauga there be more pretty in it than i could have look at in a week i be go right back thar Monday and git I they green garter that the gal show I i do not know what i be thinkin ' about to come away without 'em they be but a nickel pap hime look at she at the bead and give the fierce inarticulate ludicrously futile growl of a thwart perplexed animal mother appeal johnnie desperately do you want the child to go into the mill i do not know but they might as well -- for a spell say laurellum hime vainly endeavor to look grown-up and to pretend that she be really the head of the family they want to go and you have do mighty well in the mill if it be not for my health i reckon i might go in and try to learn to weave myself but there -- i come a-past with mandy t ` other evenin ' when she be out and the noise of that there factory be enough for I from the outside -- i never could stand to be in it look like such a racket would drive I plumb crazy pap stare at he bride and click he tooth with the gnash sound that overawe the other he draw he shaggy brow in a attempt to look masterful well ef you cai not tend loom i reckon you can take mavity 's place in the house here and let she keep to the weavin ' stiddier she 'll just about lose she job if she have to be out and in so much as she have have to be with I here of late i will when i can say laurellum patronizingly sometimes i get to feel just kind of restless and no-account and can not do a stroke of work when i be that-a-way i go to bed and sleep it off or get out and go somewhere that 'll take my mind from my trouble hit 's by far the best way once more pap look at she and open and shut he mouth helplessly then he turn sullenly to he stepdaughter grumble you hear that she will not work and you will not give I you money the child have oblige to bring in a little something -- that be the way it look to I if the mill on the tennessee side be too choicy to take 'em -- and i know well as you johnnie that they air they man connor tell I so -- i can hire 'em over at the victory on the georgy side the victory a mill notorious in the district for its ancient unsanitary building its poor management its bad treatment of its hand yes it be true that at the victory you could hire out anything that could walk and talk johnnie catch she breath and hug the small pliant body to she breast feeling with a mighty throb of fierce mother-tenderness the poor little rib yet cartilagenous the delicate soft frame for which god and nature demand time and chance to grow and strengthen yet she know if she give up she wages to pap she would be no better off -- indeed she would be helpless in he hand and the sum of they would not cover what the child all together could earn oh lord to work in the victory she groan now johnnie object she mother do not you get meddlesome just because you be a old maid you great-aunt betsy be meddlesome disposed that-a-way i reckon single woman as they get on in year be apt so to be every one of these child have be promise that they should be let to work in the mill they have be jest honin ' to do it ever since you come down and get you place deanie be scare to death for fear they would not take she do not you be meddlesome yes and i be goin ' to buy I a gun and a nag with my money what i earn put in pony explosively ` course i 'll take you-all to ride he add the saving clause under milo 's reprove eye si ' johnnie do not you want I to earn money and buy a hawse and a gun and a -- and most ever ` thing else johnnie look down into the blue eye of the little lad who have creep close to she chair what he would earn in the factory she know well -- blow curse evil knowledge if they should go to the victory i would be mighty proud to do all i could to look after 'em johnnie speak mandy from the shadow where she sit on the floor at laurellum consadine 's foot work away with a shoe-brush and cloth at the cleaning and polishing of the little woman 's tan footwear ye know i be a-gittin ' loom thar to-morrow mornin ' yes i be in answer to johnnie 's deprecate look i would ruther do it as to run round a week -- or a month -- ` mongst the better one huntin ' a job and you here standin ' for my board till late that night johnnie labor with she mother and stepfather try to show they that the mill be no fit place for the child milo be all too apt for such a situation the very material out of which a cotton mill mould its best hand and its worst citizen pony restless emotional gifted and ambitious craving he share of the joy of life and its opportunity would never make a mill hand but under the pressure of factory life he sister apprehend that he would make a criminal uh-huh agree pap drily when she try to put something of this into word i spot that feller for a rogue and a shirk the minute i lay eye on he the mill 'll tame he the mill 'll make he git down and pull in the collar i reckon woman be not fitten to bring up chillen a widder 's boy aller go to ruin why johnnie consadine every one of they chap be plumb crazy to work in the mill -- just like you be -- and you be workin ' in the mill yourself what make you talk so foolish about it laurellum nod a agreement look more than usually like a little girl play doll i reckon mr hime know best johnnie honey be she reiterate comment cautiously johnnie approach the subject of pay she stepfather have already demand she wages and express unbounded surprise that she be not willing to pass over the Saturday pay-envelope to he and let he put the money in the bank along with he other savings careful calculation show that the four child could after a few week of learn probably earn a little more than she could and in any case hime put it as a disciplinary measure a way of life select largely for the good of the little one if you just as soon let I she say to he at last i believe i 'll take they over to the victory myself to-morrow morning she have hope of tell they age bluntly to the mill superintendent and have they refuse pap agree negligently he have no liking for early rising and thus it be that johnnie find herself at eight o'clock make she way in the midst of the little group toward the georgium line and the old victory plant which all good worker in the district shun if possible as she set she foot on the first plank of the bridge she hear a little rumble of sound and down the road come a light two-seated vehicle with color driver and miss lydium session take she sister 's child out for a early morning drive there be a frail long-visaged boy of ten sit beside he aunt in the back with a girl of eight tuck between they the nurse on the front seat hold the youngest child a little girl about deanie 's age as they come nearer the driver draw up evidently in obedience to miss session 's command and she lean forward graciously to speak to johnnie good morning john say miss session as the carriage stop whose child be those they be my little sister and brother respond johnnie look down with a very pale face and busy herself with deanie 's hair and you be take they over to the mill so that they can learn to be useful how nice that be lydium smile brightly at the little one -- she best charity-worker 's smile no return johnnie goad past endurance i be go over to see if i can get they to refuse to take this one and she bent and pick deanie up hold she the child 's head drop shyly against she breast the small flower-like face turn a bit so that one blue eye might investigate the carriage and those in it deanie 's too little to work in the mill johnnie go on they have night turn over there at the victory now and it 'll just about make she sick miss lydium frown oh john i think you be mistaken she say coldly the work be very light -- you know that young people work a great deal harder race about in they play than at anything they have to do in a spooling room -- i be sure my niece and nephew do and in you case it be necessary and right that the younger member of the family should help i think you will find that it will not hurt they individual who work in cotton mill and be not adult be never allude to as child it be a offense to mention they so they be always speak of -- even those scarcely more than three foot high -- as young people miss session have smile upon the piteous little group with a judicious mixture of patronage and mild reproof and she driver have shake the line over the back of the fat horse preparatory to move on when stoddard 's car turn into the street from the corner above wait junius dick be afraid of auto caution miss lydium nervously junius grinned respectfully while bay dick doze and regard the approach car philosophically as they stand they block the way so that gray be oblige to slow down and finally to stop he raise he hat ceremoniously to both group he pained eye go past lydium session as though she have be but the paint representation of a woman to fasten themselves on johnnie where she stand she tall deep-bosomed figure relieve against the shine water the flaxen-haired child on she breast the little one huddle about she that johnnie consadine should have fall away all at once from that higher course she have so eagerly choose and so resolutely maintain have be to gray a disappointment whose depth and bitterness somewhat surprise he in vain he recall the fact that all he theory of life be against force a culture where none be desire he go back to it with grief -- he have be so sure that johnnie do love the real thing that hers be a nature which not only wish but must have spiritual and mental food she attitude toward himself upon they few meeting of late have confirm a certain distrust of she if one may use so strong a word she seem afraid almost ashamed to face he what be it she be do he wonder that she know so perfectly he would disapprove and then with the return of the book the drop of johnnie 's education come the abrupt end of those informal letter not till they cease do he realize how large a figure they have come to cut in he life only this morning he have take they out and read they over and decide that the girl who write they be worth at least a attempt toward a explanation and better footing he have decide not to give she up now she confirm he worst apprehension at he glance she face be suffuse with a swift distressed red she wonder if he yet know of she mother 's marriage she dread the time when she must tell he with a inarticulate murmur she speak to the little one turn she back and hurry across the bridge be johnnie put those child in the mill ask stoddard half doubtfully as he gaze follow they toward the entrance of the victory i believe so return lydium smile we be just speaking of how good it be that the cotton mill give a opportunity for even the smaller one to help at work which be within they capacity johnnie consadine say that inquire gray startle why be she take they over to the victory and then he answer he own question she know very well they be below the legal age in tennessee lydium session trim instantly that must be it she say i wonder a little that she seem not to want they in the same factory that she be in but i remember brother hartley say that we be very particular at we mill to hire no young people below the legal age that must be it stoddard look with reprehend yet still incredulous eye to where johnnie and she small follow disappear within the mill door johnnie -- the girl who have write he that pathetic little letter about the child in she room and she grow doubt as to the wholesomeness of they work the girl who have read the book he give she and feed she understanding on they till she express herself logically and lucidly on the economic problem of the day -- that for the sake of the few cent they could earn she should put the child whom he know she love into slavery seem to he monstrous beyond belief why if this be true what a hypocrite the girl be as coarse and unfeeling as the rest of they yet she have some shame leave she have blush to be catch in the act by he it show she worse than those who justify this thing the enormity of which she have seem to understand well you must not blame she too much come lydium session 's smooth voice john 's mother be a widow and girl of that age like pretty clothes and a good time some people consider john very handsome and of course with a ignorant young woman of that class flattery be likely to turn the head i think she do as well as could be expect chapter xvi bitter water johnnie have a set of small volume of english verse extensively annotated by he own hand which stoddard have bring to she early in they acquaintance leave it with she more as a gift than as a loan she keep these little book after all the other have go back she have read and reread they -- culling from chaucer from spenser from the elizabethan lyrist the border balladry fierce tender oh so human -- till she know page of they by heart and they vocabulary influence she own they imagery tinge all she leisure thought it seem to she whenever she debate return they that she could not bear it she would get they out and sit with one of they open in she hand not read but stare at the page with unseeing eye pass she finger over it as one stroke a beloved hand or turn through each book only to find the pencilled word in the margin she would be give up part of herself when she take these back yet it have to be do and one miserable morning she make they all into a neat package intend to carry they to the mill and place they on stoddard 's desk thus early when nobody would be in the office then the child come in deanie be half sick and in the distress of get the ail child comfortably into she own bed johnnie forget the book take they in at noon she meet stoddard himself i have bring you back you -- those little book of old english poetry she say with a sudden constriction in she throat and a quick burning flush that suffuse brow cheek and neck stoddard look at she she be thinner than she have be and otherwise show the mark of misery and of factory life the sight be almost intolerable to he poor girl she herself be suffer cruelly enough beneath the same yoke she have help to lay on the child be you really give up you study entirely he ask in what he try to make a very kindly voice he lay he hand on the package of book i wonder if you be not make a mistake johnnie you look as though you be work too hard some thing be worth more than money and get on in the world johnnie shake she head for the moment word be beyond she then she manage to say in a fairly compose tone there be not any other way for I i think some time mr stoddard when a body be bear to a hard life all the struggle and try just make it that much harder maybe when the child get a little older i 'll have more chance the statement be wistfully timidly make yet to gray stoddard it seem a brazen defense of she present course it pierce he that she on whose nobility of nature he could have stake he life should justify such action yes he say with quick bitterness they might be able to earn more of course as time go on it be a cruel speech between two people who have discuss this feature of industrial life as these have even stoddard have no idea how cruel for a dizzy moment the girl stare at he then though she flushed cheek have whiten pitifully and she lip tremble she answer with bravely lift head i thank you very much for all the help you have be to I mr stoddard what i say just now do not look as though i appreciate it i ask you pardon for that i aim to do the best i can for the child and i -- thank you she turn and be go leave he puzzle and with a sore ache at heart winter come on wet dark cheerless in the shackle half-built little village and johnnie see for the first time what the distress of the poor in city be a temperature which would have be agreeable in a drier climate bit to the bone in the mist-haunted valley of that mountain region the house be mostly mere board shanty tighten by paste newspaper over the crack inside where the woman of the family have time for such work and the heating apparatus be generally a wood-burning cook-stove with possibly a additional coal heater in the front room which could be fire on sunday or when the family be at home to tend it all through the bright autumn day laurellum hime have hurry from one new and charming sensation or discovery to another she be like the butterfly that haunt the bank of little stream or wayside pool at this season disport themselves more gaily even than the insect of spring in what must be at best a briefer glory when the weather begin to be chilly she complain of a pain in she side hit hurt I right there she would say piteously take johnnie 's hand and lay it over the left side of she chest my foot have not be good and warm since the weather turn i jest cai not stand these here old black box of stove they have in the settlement if i could oncet lay down on the big hearth at home and get my foot warm i jest know my misery would leave I at first pap merely grunt over these homesick repining but after a time he begin to hang about she and offer counsel which be often enough peevishly receive no i be not et anything that disagree with I laurellum pettishly reply to he well-meant inquiry you be thinkin ' about yo ` se ' f i never eat more than be good for I nor anything that be not jest right hit be not my stomach hit 's right there in my side look like hit be my heart a ' i believe in my soul it be oh law if i could oncet lay down befo ' a nice good hickory fire and get my foot warm and so it come to pass that while everybody in the boarding-house look on amaze almost aghast gideon hime withdraw from the bank such money as be necessary and have a chimney build at the side of the fore room and a broad hearth lay he beg almost tearfully for a small grate which should burn the soft bituminous coal of the region and be much cheaper to install and maintain but laurellum turn away from these suggestion with the hopeless pliable obstinacy of the weak i would not give the rappin ' o ' my finger for a nasty little smudgy smoky grate fire she declare rebelliously thanklessly a hickory log-heap be what i want and if i cai not have that i reckon i can jest die without it now laurelly -- now laurelly pap quaver in tone none other have ever hear from he do not you talk about dyin ' you look as young as johnnie this minute i 'll git you what you want lord i 'll have dawson build the chimbley big enough for you to keep house in if they 's yo ' ruther it be almost large enough for that and the great load of hickory log which hime haul into the yard from the neighbouring mountain-side be cut to length fire be kindle in the new chimney it draw perfectly and pap himself carry laurellum in he arm and lay she on some quilt beside the hearthstone demand eagerly thar now --

she stare in at the beautiful light room the well-dressed happy people suddenly she catch sight of gray stoddard standing near the girl who be play a watchful eye upon she music to turn it for she she clutch the window-sill and stand choke and blind fight with a crowd of daunt recollection and miserable apprehension the young violinist be play schubert 's serenade from the violin come the cry of hungry human love demand its mate questing pray half despairing and yet woo seek again johnnie 's piteous gaze rove over the well-beloved lineament she note with a passion of tenderness the turn of head and hand that be so familiar to she and so dear oh she could never hate he for it but it be hard -- hard -- to be a wave in the ocean of toil that support the galley of such as these it begin to rain again softly as she stand there scatter drop fall on she bright hair and she gather she dress about she and press close to the window where the eaves of the building sheltered she forcing herself to look in and take note of the difference between those people in there and she own lot of life this be not usually johnnie 's way she unfailing optimism prompt she always to measure the distance below she and be glad of have climb so far rather than to dim she eye with strain they toward what be above but now she mark mercilessly the light yet subdue movement the deference express when one of these people address another and gray stoddard at the upper end of the room be easily the most marked figure in it who be she to think she might be he friend when all this beautiful world of ease and luxury and fair speech be open to he like a sword flash back to she memory of the child they be be kill in the mill while she waste she thought and longing on people who would laugh if they know of she presumptuous devotion she turn with a low exclamation of astonishment when somebody touch she on the shoulder be you de gal miss lyddy sont for inquire the yellow waitress a bit sharply no -- yes -- i do not know whether miss session send for I or not johnnie halt out but eagerly i must see she i have -- cassy i have get to speak to she right now cassy regard the newcomer rather scornfully yet everybody like johnnie and the servant eventually put off she design of be impressive and say in a fairly friendly manner : you could not noway see she now i could not disturb she whilst she be get company -- without you want to put on this here cap and apron and come he ' p I sarve the refreshment dey be a gal comin ' to resist I but she be not put in she disappearance yet be not no time for foolin ' dis be not johnnie debate a moment a servant 's livery -- but deanie be sick and -- with a sudden impulsive movement and somewhat to cassy 's surprise johnnie follow into the pantry seize the proffer cap and apron and proceed to put they on i have get to see miss session she repeat more to herself than to the negress maybe what i have to say will only take a minute i reckon she will not mind even if she have get company it -- well i have get to see she some way and take the tray of frail dainty cup and saucer cassy bring she she start with it to the parlor the music be just die down to its last wail when gray look up and catch sight of she come he mind have be full of she to he certain piece of music always mean certain people and the serenade could bring he nothing but johnnie consadine 's face he startled eye encounter with distaste the cap pin to she hair descend to the white apron that cover she black skirt and rest in astonishment on the tray that hold the coffee cream and sugar begin here cassie prompt she assistant and johnnie stop offer she tray of cup gray 's indignant glance go from the girl herself to he hostess what foolery be this why should johnnie consadine dress herself as a servant and wait on lydium session 's guest before the two reach he he turn abruptly and go into the library where miss session stand for a moment quite alone she face brighten he have seek she society very much less of late she look hopefully for a renewal of that earlier companionship which seem by contrast almost intimate have you hire johnnie consadine as a waitress stoddard ask she in a non-committal voice i should have suppose that she place in the mill would pay she more and offer better prospects no -- oh no say miss session startle and considerably disappoint at the subject he have select to converse upon how do she come to be here with a cap and apron on to-night pursued stoddard with a edge to he tone which he could not wholly subdue i really do not understand that myself lydia session tell he i make no arrangement with she i expect to have a couple of negress -- they be much better servant you know of course when a girl like john get a little taste of social contact and recognition she may go to considerable length to gratify she desire for it no doubt she feel proud of force herself in this evening and then of course she know she will be well pay she seem to be do nicely glance between the portiere where johnnie bent before one guest or another offer she tray of cup i really have not the heart to reprove she then i think i shall say stoddard with sudden resolution if you do not mind miss session would you let she come in and talk to I a little while as soon as she have finish pass the coffee i -- really it seem to I that this be outrageous johnnie be a girl of brain and ability and we who have she true welfare at heart should see that she do not -- in she youth and ignorance -- fall into such error as this oh if you like i 'll talk to she myself say miss lydium smoothly the conversation be not so different from other that she and stoddard have hold concern this girl 's desert and welfare she add after a instant 's pause speaking quickly with heighten color and a little nervous catch in she voice i 'll do my best i -- i do not want to speak harshly of john but i must in truth say that she be the one among my uplift club girl that have be least satisfactory to I in what way inquire stoddard in a even quiet tone well i should be a little puzzle to put it into word miss session answer he with a deprecate smile and yet it be there -- the feeling that john consadine be -- i hate to say it -- ungrateful ungrateful repeat she companion he eye steadily on miss session 's face to leave johnnie consadine out of the matter entirely what else do you expect from any of you protges what else can any one expect who go into what the modern world call charitable work miss session study he face in some bewilderment be he arraign she or sympathize with she he say no more he leave upon she the onus of further speech she must try for the right note i know it she fumble desperately and be not it disappointing you do everything you possibly can for people and they seem to dislike you for it they do not merely seem to say stoddard almost brusquely they do dislike and despise you and that most heartily it be as certain a result as that two and two make four you have pauperize and degrade they and they hate you for it lydium session shrink back on the seat and stare at he she hand before she open mouth why mr stoddard she ejaculate finally i think you be fully in sympathy with my uplift work you -- you certainly let I think so if you despise it as you now say why do you help I and -- and all that stoddard shake he head no he demur a little wearily i do not despise you nor you work as for help you -- i dislike lobster and yet i conscientiously provide you with it whenever we be where the comestible be serve because i know you like it mr stoddard break in lydium tragically that be frivolous these be grave matter and i think -- oh i think certainly -- that i be deserving you good opinion in this charitable work if ever i deserve such a thing in my life oh -- deserve repeat stoddard almost impatiently no doubt you deserve a great deal more than my praise but you know -- do you not -- that people who believe as i do regard that sort of philanthropy as a barrier to progress and really now i think you ought to admit that under such circumstance i have behave with great friendliness and self-control the word be speak with something of the old teasing intonation that have once deluded lydium session into the faith that she hold a relation of some intimacy to this man she glance at he fleetingly then though she feel utterly at sea make one more desperate effort but i always go first to you when i be raise money for my uplift work and you give to I more liberally than anybody else jerome never approve of it hartley grumble or laugh at I and come reluctantly to my little dance and reception i sometimes feel that i be go against all my world -- except you i depend upon you approval i feel that you be in full sympathy with I here if nowhere else she look so disproportionately move by the matter that stoddard smile a little i be sorry he say at last i see now that i have be take it for grant all along that you understand the reservation i hold in regard to this matter you -- you should have tell I plainly say lydium drearily it -- it give I a strange feeling to have depend so entirely on you and then to find out that you be think of I all the while as jerome do have i be inquire stoddard as jerome do what a passion it seem to be with folk to classify they friend people call I a socialist because i be try to find out what i really do think on certain economic and social subject i doubt that i shall ever bring up underneath any precise label and yet some people would think it egotistical that i insist upon be a class to myself i very much doubt that i hold mr hardwick 's opinion exactly in any particular he look at the girl with a sort of urgency which she scarcely comprehend miss session he say i wear my hair longer than most man and the barber be always deeply grieve at my obstinacy i never eat potato and many well-meaning person be greatly concern over it -- they regard the exclusion of potato from one 's dietary as almost criminal but you -- i expect in you more tolerance concern my peculiarity why must you care at all what i think or what my view be in this matter oh i do not understand you at all lydium say distressfully no agree stoddard with a interrogative note in he voice but after all there be no need for people to be so determine to understand each other be there lydium look at he with swim eye why do not you tell I not to do those thing she manage finally to say with some composure tell you not to do thing that you have think out for yourself and decide on ask stoddard oh no miss session what of you own development i have no business to interfere like that you might be exactly right about it and i wrong so far as you yourself be concerned and even if i be right and you wrong the only chance of growth for you be to exploit the matter and find it out for yourself i do not understand a word you say lydium session repeat dully that be the kind of thing you use always to talk when you and i be plan for john consadine development be not what a woman want she want -- she need -- to understand how to please those she -- approve if she fail anywhere and those she -- well if somebody that she have -- confidence -- in tell she why then she 'll know better next time you should have tell I she eye overflow as she make a end but stoddard adopt a tone of determine lightness dear I he say gently what reactionary view you be out of temper with I this evening -- i get on you nerve with my theorize forgive I and forget all about it lydium session smile kindly on she guest without speak but one thing remain to she out of it all gray stoddard think ill of she work -- it carry she further from he instead of nearer so many month of effort worse than waste at that instant she have sight of shade buckheath 's dark face in the entry she get to she foot i beg you pardon she say wanly i think there be some one out there that i ought to speak to chapter xvii a victim in the spinning room at the victory mill with its tall frame and endlessly turn bobbin where the languid thread run

to where he could leave he work in the basement climb painfully the many stair to the spinning room and meet she close to where the big belt rise up to the great shaft that give power to every machine in that department the loving master of the big yellow cat have always cherish a somewhat clumsily conceal dislike and hostility to deanie perhaps there linger in this a touch of half-jealousy of he wife 's baby perhaps he know instinctively that johnnie 's rebellion against he tyranny be always strongest where deanie be concerned why be not you on you job he inquire threateningly as the child

sensation that be be kindly bring into the midst of they monotonous toilsome hour and lissy who be creep up anxiously yet keep out of the range of hime 's eye crouch as though the hammer have be raise over she own head johnnie say -- begin the little girl desperately but the old man sting to greater fury spring at she she stumble back and back fall against the slowly move belt she frock catch in the rivet which be just pass and she be instantly jerk from she foot if any one of the three man look on have take prompt action the child might have be rescue at once but stupid terror hold they

away from it all be do anything rational to avert the catastrophe the child hang on the slowly move belt inert a tiny rag of life with she mop of tangled yellow curl she white little face its blue eye close when she reach the top where the pulley be close against the ceiling she brain would be dash out and the small body drag to piece between beam and ceiling those who look at she realize this numbed by the inevitable they make no effort save milo who at imminent risk of he own life be climb on a frame near at hand but pony fly at hime beat the old man with hard-clenched inadequate fist and scream you git she down from thar -- git she down this minute she 'll be kill i tell ye she 'll be kill i tell ye poor mandy make inarticulate moaning and reach up she arm shade buckheath curse softly under he breath the woman and child stare eager to lose no detail i always have say and i always shall say that chap as young as that be not get no business around whar machinery 's at bob conley keep shout over and over in a high strange mechanical voice plainly quite unconscious that he speak at all the child be so near the ceiling now that a universal groan proceed from the watcher then all at once the belt cease to move and the clash and tumult be still johnnie who have fly to the little control wheel to throw off the power come run back cry out in the sudden quiet shade -- quick -- get a ladder hold something under there she might -- oh my god for deanie 's frock have pull free and the little form hurl down before johnnie could reach they but the devoted mandy be there she futile inadequate skirt uphold into they the small body drop and together the two come to the floor with a dull sort of crunch when johnnie reach the prostrate pair mandy be struggle to she knee gasp but deanie lay twisted just as she have fall the little face sunken and deathly a tiny trickle of blood come from a corner of she parted lip oh my baby oh my baby they have kill my baby deanie -- deanie -- deanie -- wail mandy johnnie be on she knee beside the child feel she over with tremulous hand she face be bleached chalk-white and she eye stare fearfully at the motionless lip of the little one

-- johnnie 's flaming glance silence he and he voice die away a sort of a rasp in he throat mechanically he glance up to the point on the great belt from which the child have fall and measure the distance to the floor he scratch he bald head dubiously and edge back from the tragedy he have make everybody know i never hit she he mutter as he go chapter xviii light gray stoddard 's eye have follow lydium session when she go into the hall to speak to shade buckheath he have a glimpse of johnnie too in the passage he note that she later leave the house with buckheath -lrb- mandy meacham be beyond he range of vision -rrb- and the pang that go through he at the sight be a strangely mingled one the talk between he and he hostess have be enlighten to both of they it show lydium session not only where she stand with gray but it bring home to she startlingly and as nothing have yet do the strength of johnnie 's hold upon he while it force gray himself to realize that ever since that morning when he meet the girl on the bridge go to put she little brother and sister in the victory mill he have behave more like a sulky disappointed lover than a staunch friend he confess frankly to himself that have johnnie be a boy a young man instead of a beautiful and appealing woman he would have be prompt to go to she and remonstrate -- he would have make no bone of have the matter out clearly and fully he blame himself much for the estrangement which he have allow to grow between they he know instinctively about what shade buckheath be -- certainly no fit mate for johnnie consadine and for the better to desert she -- poor helpless unschooled girl -- could only operate to push she toward the worse these thought keep stoddard wakeful company till almost morning dawn come with a soft wind out of the west all the odour of spring on its breath and a penitent warmth to apologize for last night 's storm stoddard face he day and decide that he would begin it with a early-morning horseback ride he call up he stable boy over the telephone and when jim bring round roan sultan saddle there be a pause as of custom for conversation hear about the accident over to the victory mr stoddard jim inquire no say gray wheeling sharply anybody hurt one o ' pap hime 's stepchild mighty near kill they say the boy tell he i see miss johnnie consadine when they be bring the little gal down it seem they send for she over to mr hardwicks where she be at gray mount quickly settle himself in the saddle and glance down the street which would lead he past hime 's place for month now he have be instinctively avoid that part of town poor johnnie she might be a disappointing character but he know well that she be full of love he remember she eye when nearly a year ago up in the mist and sweetness of April on the unakas she have tell he of the baby sister and the other little one she must be suffer now almost without reflection he turn he horse 's head and ride toward the forlorn hime boarding-house as he draw near he notice a huddle figure at the head of the step and come up make it out to be hime himself sit elbow on knee stare straight ahead of he pap have not undressed at all but he have take out he false tooth to rest he jaw a spell as he be in the habit of do and the result be startling he cheek be fall in to such a extent that the blinking red eye above look larger it be as though the old rascal 's crime of callous selfishness and greed have suddenly aged he stoddard pull in he horse at the foot of the step i hear one of the little girl be hurt in the mill last night be she badly injured which one be it he ask abruptly hit 's deanie she be all right mumble pap get the whole house uptore and laurelly miscallin ' I till i do not know which way to look and now the little dickens be a-goin ' to git well all right chap be tough i tell ye ye cai not kill 'em you people must have think so say stoddard or you would not have bring these little one down and hire they to the cotton mill johnnie know what that mean the word have come almost involuntarily the old man stare at the speaker breathing hard what be johnnie consadine get to do with it he inquire finally i be the stepdaddy of the child -- and johnnie 's stepdaddy too for the matter of that -- and what i say go do you hire the child at the victory inquire stoddard swiftly back across he memory come the picture of johnnie with she poor little sheep for the shambles cluster about she on the bridge before the victory mill do you hire the child to the factory he repeat now mr stoddard begin the old man between bluster and whine i talk about they chap to the superintendent of yo ' mill a ' you-all say you do not want none of that size and one o ' yo ' man -- he be a room boss i reckon -- speak up right sassy to I -- as sassy as johnnie consadine herself and god know she be not get no respect for they that be set over she i have oblige to let 'em go to the victory but i do not think you have any call to hold it ag ` in I -- johnnie be plumb impident about it -- plumb impident stoddard glance up at the window and make as though to dismount all night at he pillow have stand the accusation that he have be cruel to johnnie now as hime 's revelation go on and he see what she futile effort have be as he guess a part of she suffering it seem he must hurry to she and brush away the tangle of misunderstanding which he have allow to grow up between they they have work over that thar chap off a ' on all night the old man say look like if they keep hit up she 'll begin to think somethin 's the matter of she gray realize that he visit at this moment would be ill-timed he would ride on through the gap now and call as he come back i have oblige to find I a place whar i could hire out they chap the miserable old man before he go on garrulously they 's nothin ' like mill work to take the davilment out o ' young ` un some of they chap 'll call you name and make face at you even whilst you ' goin ' through the mill yard -- and think what they would be ef they _ be not _ work i be a old man and when i married laurelly and take the keepin ' o ' she passel o ' chap on my back i aim to make it pay laurelly she will not work he look helplessly at stoddard like a child about to cry she tell I up and down that she never have work in no mill and she be too old to l'arn she say the noise of the thing from the outside be enough to show she that she do not want to go inside -- and go she would not but she let she child go -- she and johnnie mutter stoddard settle himself in he saddle well i would like to see either of 'em he ' p theirselve return pap hime with a reminiscence of he former manner johnnie be not have the decency to give I she wages not once since i have be she pappy the onliest money i ever have from she -- ` ceptin ' to pay she board -- be when she try to buy they chap out o ' workin ' in the mill but when i put my foot down a ' tell she that the chillen could work in the mill without a beatin ' or with one jest as she might see and choose she have a little sense and take 'em over and hire 'em herself baylor tell I afterward that she try to make he say he do not want 'em but baylor and I stand together a ' miss johnnie fail up on that trick pap feel a altogether misplace confidence in the view that stoddard as a male be likely to take of the matter a man be oblige to be boss of he own family -- be not that so mr stoddard he demand i say the chillen have to go into the mill and into the mill they go they all want to go at the start and laurelly agree with I that hit be the right thing then just because deanie happen to a accident and johnnie take up for she laurelly have to go off into hy-strike and say she 'll quit I soon as she can put foot to the ground stoddard make no response to this but touch sultan with he heel and move on he have stop at the post-office as he come past take from he personal box one letter this he open and read as he ride slowly away halfway up the first rise pap see he rein in and turn the old man be still stare when gray stop once more at the gate see here hime he speak abruptly this concern you -- this letter that have just reach I pap look at the younger man with mere curiosity when johnnie be first give a spinning room to look after say gray she come to mr session and myself and ask permission to have a small device of she own contrivance use on the frame as a indicator pap shuffle he foot uneasily i think no more about the matter in fact i have not be in the spin department for -- for some time stoddard look down at the hand which hold he bridle and remember that he have absent himself from every place that threaten he with the sight of johnnie pap be breathe audibly through he open mouth she -- she never have nothin ' make he whisper out the ready lie hurriedly scramble to he foot and down the step press close to roan sultan 's shoulder lay a wheedle hand on the bridle look up anxiously into the stern young face above he oh yes she do stoddard return i remember now hear some of the child from the room say that she have a device which work well from the description they give of it i judge that it be the same which this letter tell I you and buckheath be offer to the alabama mill mr trumbull the superintendent say that you and buckheath hold the patent for this indicator jointly as soon as i can consult with johnnie we will see about the matter hime let go the roan 's bridle and stagger back a pace or two open-mouthed stare the sky have fall he heavy mind turn slowly toward resentment against buckheath he wish the younger conspirator be here to take he share then the door open and shade himself come out wipe he mouth he be fresh from the breakfast table but not on he way to the mill since it be still too early he give stoddard a surly nod as he pass through the gate and on down the street in the direction of the inn hime in a turmoil of stupid uncertainty once or twice make as though to detain he he slow wit refuse he any available counsel dazedly he fumble for something convincing to say then on a sudden inspiration he once more lay hold of the bridle and begin to speak volubly in a hoarse undertone : w ' y name o ' god mr stoddard who should have a better right to that thar patent than buck and I i be the gal 's stepdaddy a ' he be the man she be goin ' to wed some peculiar quality in the silence of gray stoddard seem finally to penetrate the old fellow 's understanding he look up to find the man on horseback regard he square-jawed pale and with eye angrily bright he glance over he shoulder at the window of the house behind he moisten he lip once again gulp and finally resume in a manner both whining and aggressive now mr stoddard i want to talk to you mighty plain the whole o ' cottonville be full o ' tale about you and johnnie yes -- that be the truth he stand stare down at he big shuffling foot laboriously sort in he own mind such phrase as it might do to use the difficulty of what he have to say block speech for so long that stoddard in a curiously quiet voice finally prompt he tale he repeat what tale mr hime why they be not a old woman in town nor a young one neither -- i believe in my soul that the young one be the worst -- that be not be talkin ' -- talkin ' bad -- ever since you take johnnie to ride in you otty-mobile again there come a long pause stoddard stare down on gideon hime and hime stare at he own foot well stoddard 's quiet voice once more urge he accuser forward pap roll he head between he shoulder with a negative motion which intimate that it be not well and lend she book and all sich he pursue doggedly that kind o ' carryin ' on be not decent and you know it be not buck know it be not -- but he be willin ' to have she he tell she he be willin ' to have she and the fool gal let on like she do not want he he come here to board at my house because she would not scarcely so much as speak to he elsewhere by the light of these statement stoddard read what poor johnnie 's persecution have be the detail of it he could not of course know yet he see in that moment largely how she have be harry at the instant of see come that swift and mighty revulsion that follow surely when we have misprize and misunderstand those dear to we what be it you want of I he inquire of hime why just this here pap tell he you let johnnie consadine alone he lean even closer and speak in a yet lower tone because a number of girl be emerge from the house and start down the step a big rich feller like you do not mean any good by a girl fix the way johnnie be you would not marry she -- then let she alone thing be not get so bad but what buck be still willin ' to have she you would not marry she stoddard look down at the shameful old man with eye that be indecipherable if the impulse be strong in he to twist the unclean old throat against any further ill-speaking it give no heat to the tone in which he answer : it be you and you kind that say i mean harm to johnnie and that i would not marry she why should i intend ill toward she why should not i marry she i would -- i would marry she as he make this to he the only possible defense of the poor girl pap falter slowly back utter a gurgling expression of astonishment with a sense of surprise stoddard see in he face only dismay and chagrin hit -- hit 's a lie hime mumble half-heartedly ye would never do it in the world stoddard gather up he bridle rein preparatory to move on you be a old man mr hime he say coldly and you be excited but you do not want to say any more -- that be quite enough of that sort of thing then he loosen the rein on roan sultan and move away down the street gideon hime stand and gaze after he with bulge eye gray stoddard marry to johnnie he try to adjust he dull wit to the new position of affair try to cipher the problem with this amazing new element introduce last night 's scene of violence when the injured child be bring home go dismally before he eye laurellum have say she would leave he so soon as she could put foot to the floor he have expect to coax she with gift and money with concession in regard to the child if it must be but with a rich man for a son-in-law of course she would go he would never see she face again and suddenly he fling up a arm like a beaten schoolboy and begin to blubbler noisily in the crook of he elbow a ungentle hand on he shoulder recall he to time and place for god 's sake what be the matter with you inquire shade buckheath 's voice harshly the old man gulp down he grief and make he communication in a few hurry sentence a ' he 'll do it pap conclude he be jest big enough fool for anything be not you hear of he scheme for have the hand make the money in the mill -lrb- thus he describe a profit-sharing plan -rrb- do not you know he be give ten thousand dollar to start up some sort o ' school for the boy and gal to learn they trade in a man like that 'll do anything and if he marry johnnie laurelly 'll leave I sure leave you echo buckheath darkly she will not have to if gray stoddard marry johnnie consadine you and I will just about roost in the penitentiary for the rest of we day the patent echo pap blankly he turn fiercely on he fellow conspirator now see what ye do with yer foolishness he exclaim nothin ' would do ye but to be offerin ' the contraption for sale and tellin ' each and every that hit would be use in the hardwick mill look what a mess ye have make i be sorry i ever hitch up with ye boy o ' yo ' age have get no sense how be i to know they would write to stoddard growl shade sulkily no harm do if hit be not for he we have get the patent all right and johnnie cai not help herself but he -- with all he money -- he can help she -- damn he yes and he 'll take a holt and hunt up about pro 's silver mine too say hime i have always mistrust the way he be be hangin ' round pro passmore like enough he be hearn of that silver mine and that be the reason he be after johnnie the old man pause to ruminate on this feature of the case he be please with he own shrewdness in fathom gray stoddard 's mysterious motive buck he say finally with a swift drop to friendliness hit 's get to be stop can you stop it do not you tell I that johnnie promise last night to wed you do not you say she promise it when you be goin ' up to the victory with she shade nod she promise she would if i would get you to let the child stay out of the mill deanie 's hurt now and you be afraid to make the other go back in the mill anyhow ` count of laurelly 's tongue i can not hold johnnie to that promise but -- but there be one person i want to talk to about this business and then i 'll be ready to do something chapter xix a pact while hime and buckheath yet stand thus talk the warning whistle of the various mill begin to blow group of girl come down the step and stare at the two man confer with head close together mavity bence put she face out at the front door and call pap yo ' breakfast be gettin ' stone cold do you have to go to the mill right now inquire the older man timorously he be already under the domination of this swifter bolder more fiery spirit no i do not have to go anywhere that i do not want to i have get business with a certain party up this-a-way and when i git to the mill i 'll be there he turn and hurry swiftly up the minor slope that lead to the big hardwick home pap 's fascinate eye follow he as long as he be in sight as the young fellow stride along he be turn in he mind lydium session 's promise to talk to he this morning about johnnie but she 'll be in bed and asleep i reckon at this time of day he ruminate the good lord know i would if i have the chance like she have as he come in sight of the hardwick house he check momentarily stand at the gate a astonishing figure still in she evening frock look haggard and old in the gray disillusioning light of early morning be lydia session upstairs she white bed be smooth its pillow spread fair and prim unpressed by any head since the maid have settle they trimly in place the morning before but the long rug which run from she dress table to the window might have tell a tale of pacing foot that pass restlessly from midnight till dawn the mirror could have disclose the picture of a white anxious and often angry face that have stare into it as the woman pause now and again to commune with the real lydium session she be thirty and penniless she belong to a circle where everybody have money she sister have marry well and harriet be no better-looking than she all lydium session 's considerable force be by heredity and training turn into one narrow channel -- the effort to make a creditable if not a brilliant match and she have think she be succeed gray stoddard have seem seriously interested in those long night watch while the light flare on either side of she mirror and the luxurious room of a modern young lady lay disclose with all its sumptuous fitting of beauty and inutility lydium go over she plan of campaign she be a suitable match for he -- anybody would say so he have like she -- he have like she well enough -- till he get interested in this mill girl they have never agree on anything concern johnnie consadine if that element be eliminate to-morrow she know she could go back and pick up the thread of they intimacy which have promise so well and she doubt not at all twist it safely into a marriage-knot if johnnie be only out of the way if she would leave cottonville if she would marry that good-looking mechanic who plainly want she how silly of she not to take he toward dawn she snatch a little cape from the garment hang in the closet fling it over she shoulder and run downstairs she must have a breath of fresh air so in the manner of helpless creature who can not go out in the highway to accost fate she be stand at the gate when she catch sight of shade buckheath approach here be she opportunity she must be do something and the nearest enterprise at hand be to foster and encourage this young fellow 's pursuit of johnnie i want to talk to you about a very particular matter she break out nervously as soon as buckheath be near enough to be address in the carefully lowered tone which she use throughout the interview she continually huddle the light cape together at the neck with tremulous unsteady finger and it be characteristic of these two that although the woman have hear of the calamity at the victory mill the night before and know that shade come directly from the hime home she make no inquiry as to the welfare of deanie and he offer no information he give no reply in word to she accost and she go on with increase agitation i -- this matter ought to be attend to at once something 's get to be do i have attempt to improve the social and spiritual condition of these girl in the mill and if i have only work harm by bring they in contact with -- in contact with -- she hesitate and stand look into the man 's face buckheath know exactly what she wish to say he be impatient of the flummery she find it necessary to wind around she simple proposition but he be use to woman he understand they and to he a woman of miss session 's class be no different from a woman of he own i reckon you want to name it to I about johnnie consadine he say bluntly yes -- yes that be it breathe lydium session glance back toward the house with a frightened air john be -- she be a good girl mr buckheath i beg of you to believe I when i assure you that john be a good honest upright girl i would not think anything else for a minute but it seem to I that somebody have to do something or -- or -- shade raise he hand to he mouth to conceal the swift sarcastic smile on he lip he spit toward the pathside before agree seriously with miss lydium she and I be promise before she come down here and get all this foolishness into she head he say finally she mother never could do anything with johnnie look like johnnie 's get more authority -- she mother 's more like a little girl to she than the other way round she uncle pro have be crazy in the hospital and pap hime she stepfather -- well i reckon she be the only human that ever have to mind pap and do not do it this somewhat ambiguous statement of the case fail to bring any smile to he hearer 's lip there be no use talk to john herself miss lydium take up the tale feverishly i have do that and it have no effect on -- well of course she would say that she do not encourage he to the thing i saw afterward but i know that a man of he sort do not do thing without encouragement and -- mr buckheath do not you think you ought to go right to mr stoddard and tell he that john be you promise wife and show he the folly and -- and the wickedness of he course -- or what would be wickedness if he persist in it do not you think you ought to do that shade hold down he head and appear to be give this matter some consideration the weak point of such a argument lay in the fact that johnnie be not he promise wife and gray stoddard be very likely to know it indeed lydia session herself only believe the statement because she so wish i reckon i ort he say finally if i could ever get a chance of private speech with he mebbe i would -- there come a sound of light hoof down the road and stoddard on roan sultan ride barehead come toward they under the tree miss session clutch the gate and stand stare buckheath draw a little closer set he shoulder against the fence and try to look unconcerned the rise sun behind the mountain throw long slant ray across into the bare tree top so that the shimmer of it dappled horse and man gray 's face be pale he brow look anxious but he ride head up and alert and glance with surprise at the two at the session gate he have no hat to raise but he salute lydium session with a sweeping gesture of the hand and pass on a blithe gallant figure canter along the suburban road out toward the gap and the mountain beyond gray stoddard ride into the dip of the ridge and -- so far as cottonville be concern -- vanish utterly buckheath draw a long breath and straighten up i be but a poor man he begin truculently yit there be not nobody can marry the gal i set out to wed and I stand by and say nothing oh mr buckheath cry miss lydium mr stoddard have no idea of _ marry _ john -- a mill girl there be no possibility of any such thing as that i want you to understand that there be not -- to feel assure once for all i have reason to know and i urge you to put that out of you mind shade look at she narrowly up to the time pap give he definite information from headquarters he have never for a instant suppose that there be a possibility of stoddard desire to marry johnnie but the flurry eagerness of miss session convinced he that such a possibility be a very present dread with she and he send a venomous glance after the disappear horseman you go and talk to he right now mr buckheath insist lydium anxiously tell he just as you have tell I how long you and john have be engage and how devoted she be to you before she come down to the mill you appeal to he that way you can overtake he -- i mean you can intercept he -- if you start right on now -- cut across the turn and go through the tunnel if i go after he to talk to he and we -- uh -- we have a interruption -- be you go to tell everybody you see about it demand shade sharply stare down at the woman she crouch a little still cling to the picket of the gate the word interruption only convey to she mind the suggestion that they might be interfere with in they conversation she do not recollect the mountain use of it to describe a quarrel a outbreak or a affray no she whisper oh certainly not -- i 'll never tell anything that you do not want I to all right return buckheath hardily if you will not i will not if you name to people that i be the last one saw with mr stoddard i shall have oblige to tell 'em of what you and I be talkin ' about when he pass we you see that do not you she nod silently she frightened eye on he face and without another word he set off at that long swinging pace which belong to he people lydium turn and run swiftly into the house and up the stair to she own room chapter xx miss when stoddard do not come to he desk that morning the matter remain for a time unnoticed except by mcpherson who fret a bit at so unusual a happen truth to tell the old scotchman have dread have this rich young man for a associate and have put a rod in pickle for he chastisement when stoddard turn out to be a regular worker punctual amenable to discipline he congratulate himself and praise he assistant but warily now come the first delinquency

glow like swarm of firefly catch in a invisible net that be watauga the string of brilliant that lead from it be arc light at switch crossing where the great railway line ray out near at hand be cottonville with its vast bulk of light mill whose hum come faintly up to he even at this distance macpherson stand uncertainly in the middle of the road supper and bed be behind he but he have not the heart to turn back to either somewhere down in that abyss of night there be a clue -- or there be many clue -- to this strange absence of gray stoddard perhaps gray himself be there and the

would be alarm i understand about she and stoddard it make I hesitate a while before come up to you folk with the thing well by the lord you do well not to hesitate too long mac ejaculate hardwick i should not feel the anxiety i do if we have not be have trouble with those mountain people up toward flat rock over that girl that die at the hospital he laugh a little ruefully try to do thing for folk be ticklish business there be not a man in the crowd that interview I whom i could convince that we hospital be not a factory for the making of stiff which we sell to the northern medical college oh it be gruesome i tell they the girl have have every attention and that she die of pernicious anemia they call it ' a big dic word ' and ask I point blank if the girl have not be kill in the mill i tell they that we could not keep the body indefinitely and they say they ` aim to come and haul it away as soon as they could get a horse and wagon ' i call they attention to the fact that i could not know this unless they write and tell I so in answer to my letter but between you and I mac i do not believe there be a man in the crowd who could read or write for god 's sake exclaim the scotchman you do not think _ those _ people be up to do a mischief to stoddard do you i do not know what to think protest hardwick yes they be mediaeval -- half savage the fact be i have no idea what they would or what they would not do macpherson give a whistle of dismay gad it sound like the maneuver of one of we highland clan three hundred year ago he say would not it be the irony of fate that stoddard -- poor fellow -- a friend of the people a socialist ready to call every man he brother -- should be sacrifice in such a way the word bring they to stoddard 's little home silent and desert now down the street the lamp flare gustily it be after eleven o'clock where do that boy live that take care of the horse -- black jim hardwick inquire after they have ring the bell thump on the door and call to make sure the master have not return during macpherson 's absence i do not know -- really i do not know he might have a room over the stable macpherson suggest but the stable prove to be a one-story affair and they be just turn to leave when a stamp sound within arrest they notice good god -- what be that ejaculate macpherson whose nerve be quiver it be the horse answer hardwick in a relieved tone stoddard 's get back -- of course break in old macpherson quickly and go over to mr gandish 's for some supper that be why he be not in the house to make assurance doubly sure they open the unlock stable door and macpherson strike a match the roan turn and whinny hungrily at sight of they that be funny say hardwick scarcely above he breath it look to I as though that animal have not be feed in the flare of the match macpherson have descry the stable lantern hang on the wall they light this and examine the stall there be no feed in the box no hay in the manger the saddle be on gray stoddard 's horse the bit in he mouth he be tie by the rein to he stall ring the two man look at each other with lengthen face stoddard 's too good a horseman to have do that speak hardwick slowly and too kind a man supply macpherson loyally he would have see to the beast 's hunger before he satisfy he own as the scotchman speak he be pick up the horse 's hoof and digging at they with a bit of stick they be as clean as if they would just be wash he say as he straighten up by heaven i have it hardwick -- that fellow come into town with he hoof muffle the younger man look also and assent mutely then suggest : he have not come far there be not a hair turn on he the scotchman shake he head i be not sure of that he debate likely he be be lead and that slowly god -- this be horrible mechanically hardwick get some hay down for the horse while macpherson pull off the saddle and bridle examine both in the process grain be pour into the box and then water offer he will not drink murmur the scotchman d'ye see hardwick he will not drink you can not come into cottonville without cross a stream this fellow 's hoof have be wet within a hour -- yes within the half-hour as they eye encounter hardwick catch he breath sharply both feel that chill of the cuticle that stir at the root of the hair that mark the pass close to we of some sinister thing -- stark murder or man 's naked hatred walk in the dark beside we cheerful commonplace path by one consent they turn back from the stable and go together to mr gandish 's the house be dark of course you know i do not expect to find he here say hardwick i do not suppose they know anything about the matter but we have get to wake they and ask they do so and set tremble the first wave of that widen ring of horror which finally inform the remotest boundary of the little village that a man from they midst be mysteriously miss the morning find the telegraph in active requisition flash up and down all line by which a man might have leave cottonville or watauga the police of the latter place be notify furnished with information and set to find out if possible whether anybody in the city have see stoddard since he ride away

day before to be clean and press be ready for delivery he laundry come home he mail arrive punctually the postmaster state that he have no instruction for a change of address all the little accessory of gray stoddard 's life offer themselves mute impressive witness that he have intend to go on with it in cottonville but stoddard himself have drop as completely out of the knowledge of man as though he have be whisk off the planet chapter xxi the search the fruitless search be vigorously prosecute on Saturday the hardwick mill run short-handed while nearly half its male employee make some effort to solve the mystery party comb again and again the nearer mountain Sunday all the mill operative be free and then group of woman and child add themselves to the man dinner be take along lend a grotesque suggestion of picnic to the work a suggestion contradict by the anxious face the strained timbre of the voice that call from group to group but night bring the amateur searcher straggle home

she she step out into the dancing sunlight of a early spring morning the leafless vine on mavity bence 's porch rattle dry stem against the lattice work in a gay march wind take counsel with herself for a moment she start swiftly down the street in the direction of the mill in the office they tell she that mr hardwick have go to nashville to see about get bloodhound macpherson be follow he own plan of search in watauga she be permit to go down into the mechanical department and ask the head of it about shade buckheath no he be not here mr ramsey tell she promptly we be run so short-handed

car so as to get further up into the unakas johnnie feel as though the blood recede from she face and gather all about a heart which beat to suffocation for a wild moment she have a impulse to denounce buckheath and she stepfather but almost instantly she realize that she would weaken she cause and lose all chance of assistance by do so she standing in the mill be excellent and as she run up the stair she be go over in she mind the person to whom she might take she story she find no one from whom she dare expect credence and help out in the street again she catch sight of charlie conroy and she thought be turn by a natural association of idea to lydium session that be it why have it not occur to she before she hurry up the long hill to the hardwick home and try first the bell at the front where she get no reply skirt the house and rap long and loudly at the side door harriet hardwick when thing begin to wear a tragic complexion have promptly pack she wardrobe and she child and flit to watauga this hegira be undertake mainly to get she sister away from the scene of gray stoddard 's disappearance yet when the move come to be make miss session refuse to accompany she

session have be as it be a woman at war with herself she first impulse be of decorum -- to jerk she skirt about she in seemly fashion and be certain that no smirch adhere to they then she begin to wonder if she could find shade buckheath and discover from he the truth of the matter whenever she would have make a movement toward this she wince away from what she know he would say to she she flinch even from find out that she fear be well ground as matter begin to wear a more serious face she debate now and again tell she brother-in-law of she suspicion that buckheath have a grudge against stoddard but if she say this how account for the knowledge how explain to jerome why she have deny see stoddard Friday morning jerome be so terribly practical -- he would ask such search question back of it all there be truly much remorse and terrible anxiety for stoddard himself but this be continually swallow up in she concern for she own welfare she own good name always after she have agonize so much there would come with a revulsion -- a gust of anger stoddard have never care for she he have be cruel in he attitude of kindness let he take what follow cottonville be a town distraught and the hardwick servant have seize the occasion to run out for a bit of delectable gossip in which the least of the horror include gray stoddard 's murder and mutilate body wash down in some mountain stream to the sight of he friend johnnie be too urgent to long delay get no answer at the side door she push it open and venture through silent room after room until she come to the stairway and so on up to miss session 's bedroom door she have be there before and fear to alarm by knock she finally call out in what she try to make a normal reassuring tone it be only I -- johnnie consadine -- miss lydium the answer be a hasty muffle outcry somebody who have be kneel by the bed on the further side of the room spring up and come forward show a face so disfigured by tear and anxiety by loss of sleep and lack of food as to be scarcely recognizable that ravage visage tell plainly the battle-ground that lydium session 's narrow soul have become in these dreadful day she know now that she have set shade buckheath to quarrel with gray stoddard -- and gray have never be see since the hour she send the dangerous unscrupulous man after he to that quarrel with this knowledge wrestle and fight the instinct we strive to develop in we girl child the fear we brand shamefully into they nature -- she name must not be connect with such a affair -- she must not be talk about have they find he lydium gasp be he alive johnnie generous soul even in the intense preoccupation of she own pain could pity the woman who look and speak thus no she answer they have not find he -- and some that be look for he never will find he oh miss lydium i want you to help I make they send somebody that we can trust up the gap road and on to the unakas miss session flinch plainly what do you

the midnight train for boston this look around in the mountain be folly who would want to harm he in the mountain for a moment johnnie stand thwart and non-plussed the insult direct toward herself make almost no impression on she strangely as they come from lydium session 's lip she be too intent on she own purpose to care greatly shade buckheath -- she begin cautiously intend only to state that shade have take stoddard 's car but lydium session draw back with a scream it be a lie she cry there be not a word of truth in what you say john consadine oh you be the plague of my life -- you have be from the first you follow I about and torment I shade buckheath have nothing to do with gray stoddard 's disappearance i tell you nothing -- nothing -- nothing she thrust forward she face and

for the unaka to she left be the white highway that run along above the valley and that palace of pleasure which have seem a wonder and a mystery to she one year go to-day she give no thought to the sight of river and valley and town except to look back once at the roof and reflect that among all the people house there in sight of she there be surely those who know the secret of gray stoddard 's disappearance -- who could tell she if they would where to search for he somehow the thought make she feel very small and alone and unfriended with its discouragement come that dogged persistence that

in a mountain vendetta if the spirit of feud be arouse against the mill owner if the groner and dawson have be able to enlist they kin and clan she be well aware that the man or woman who give she smile information as to way and mean might the hour before have look on gray stoddard lie dead or sit in the council which plan to kill he thus she walk warily and dare ask from none direction or help she be not yet in she own region these lower ridge lie between two line of railway which from the mountaineer 's point of view contaminate they and give they a tincture of the valley and the settlement noon come and pass she be very weary factory life have tell on she physically and the recent distress of mind add its devitalizing influence there be a desperate flagging of the muscle weaken by disuse and a unhealthy indoor life i wonder can i ever make it she question herself then swiftly i have get to -- i have get to she eye rove toward a cabin on the slope above there live a man by the name of straley but he be a cousin to lura dawson the girl who have die in the hospital johnnie know he to be one of the bitterest enemy of the cottonville mill owner and realize that he would be the last one to whom she should apply mutely doggedly she press on and round a bend in a long lonely stretch of road see before she the tall lithe form of a man trousers tuck into boot a tall staff in hand make swift progress up the road the sound of foot evidently arrest the attention of the wayfarer he turn and wait for she to come up the figure be so congruous with its surroundings that she see with surprise a face totally strange to she the turned-down collar of the rumpled shirt be unbuttoned at a brown throat the face above seem to she eye neither old nor young though the light spring gait when he walk the supple easeful attitude now that he rest one hand fling high on the curious tall staff be those of a youth the eye of a warm laughing hazel have the direct fearlessness of a child and a slouch hat carry in the hand show a fair crop of slightly grizzled curl hair a stranger -- at first the think frightened and then attract she this man look not unlike johnnie 's own people and there be something in he face that lead she to entertain the idea of appeal to he for help he settle the question of whether or no she should enter into conversation by accost she at once brusquely and genially mornin ' si ' you look tired he say you ought to have a stick like I hold on -- i 'll cut you one before the girl could respond beyond a answer smile and good morning the new friend have put he own alpenstock into she hand and go to the roadside where with unerring judgment he select a long straight taper shoot of ash and hew it deftly with a monster jack-knife draw from he trousers pocket there -- try that he say as he return trim off the last of the leaf and branch johnnie take the staff with she sweet smile of thanks for a few moment the two walk on silently side by side she desperately absorb in she anxiety she companion apparently return to some world apart in he own mind suddenly : can i get to the railroad down this side the man ask she in that odd incidental voice of he which suggest that what he say be merely a small portion of what he think why -- yes i reckon so hesitated johnnie it be a pretty far way and there do not many folk travel on it it be a old indian trail a heap of we road here be that but it 'll take you right to the railroad -- the w and a she companion chuckle seemingly with some inner satisfaction yes that be just what i suppose i soldiered all over this country and i think it be about as pretty scenery as god ever make i promise myself then that if i ever come back into this part of the world i would do some tramp through here they be go to have a great big banquet at atlanta and they have I cage up take I down there to make a speech i give they the slip at watauga i know i would strike the railroad if i footed it through the mountain here johnnie examine she companion with attention would it do to ask he if he have see a automobile on the road -- a dark green car dare she make inquiry as to whether he have hear of gray stoddard 's disappearance or meet any of the searcher she decide on a conservative course i wish i have time to set you in the right road she hesitate but my poor old uncle be out here somewhere among these ridge and ravine he be not in he right mind and i have get to find he if i can crazy do you mean ask she companion with a quick yet easy smile attention i would like to see he if he be crazy i take a great interest in crazy folk some of 'em have a lot of sense leave johnnie nod he do not know any of we she say pitifully they have have he in the hospital three month try to do something for he but the doctor say he 'll never be well that be right hopeful observe the man with a plainly intentional dry ludicrousness i always think there be some chance when the doctor give 'em up -- and begin to let 'em alone how be he hurt si ' johnnie do not pause to reflect that she have not say uncle pro be hurt at all for some reason which she would herself have be at a loss to explain she hasten to detail to this chance-met stranger the exact appearance and nature of pro passmore 's injury she listener nod he head at this or that point make some comment or inquiry at another the doctor say that they would suppose it be a fractured skull or concussion of the brain or something like that but they have examine he and there be nothing to see on the outside and they trephine and it do not do any good so they just let he stay about the hospital no say she new friend softly almost absently it do not do any good to trephine -- but it might have do a lot of harm i would like to see the back of you uncle 's neck i be not in any hurry to get to that banquet at atlanta -- a man can always overeat and make himself sick without go so far to do it so like a idle schoolboy the unknown forsake he own course turn from the road when johnnie turn and go with she up the steep rocky gulch where the door of a desert cabin fling to and fro on its hinge at sight of the smokeless chimney the gaping doorway and empty inhospitable interior johnnie look blank have you get anything to eat she ask she companion hesitatingly i come off in such a hurry that i forget all about it some people that i know use to live in that cabin and i hope to get my dinner there and ask after my uncle but i see they have move sit right down here say the stranger indicate the broad door-stone around which the grass grow tall we 'll soon make that all right he seek in the pocket of the coat he carry slung across he shoulder and bring out a packet of food i lay in some fuel when i think i might get the chance to run my own engine across the mountain he tell the girl open he bundle and divide evenly he utter a few musical word in a unknown tongue that be indian he comment carelessly without look at she it mean you be to eat you dinner i be with the shawnee when i be a boy i learn a lot of they language and i 'll never forget it they teach I more thing than talk johnnie study the man beside she as they eat they bit of lunch my name be johnnie consadine sir she tell he what shall i call you thus directly question the unknown smile quizzically he hazel eye crinkle at the corner and overflow with good humor well you might say ` pap ' he observe consideringly lot of boy and girl do call I pap -- more than a thousand of 'em now i guess and i be eighty -- mighty near old enough to have a girl of nineteen she look at he in astonishment eighty year old as lithe as a lad and with a lad 's clear laughing eye yet there be a look of power of that knowledge which be power in he face that make she say to he : do you think that uncle pro can ever be cure -- have he right mind back again i mean of course the cut on he head be heal up long ago the cut on he head do not make he crazy say she companion murmuringly of course it be not that or he would have be rave when he come down from the mountain something happen to he afterward yes there do johnnie assent wonderingly -- falteringly i do not know how you come to guess it but the woman who tell I that she be hide in the front room when they be quarrel and see uncle pro fall down the step say he land almost square on he head she think at first he neck be break -- that he be kill uh-huh nod the newcomer you see i be a good guesser i make my live guess thing he fling she a whimsical sidelong glance as have finish they lunch they rise and move on i wish i have my hand on the process of that atla vertebra he say on -- on what inquire johnnie in a slightly startle tone never mind si ' if we find he and i can handle he i 'll know where to look nobody can touch he but I when he get out this way johnnie say he act sort of scared and sort of fierce and just run and hide from people maybe if you 'll tell I what you want do i could do it maybe you could -- and then again maybe you could not return the other with a great show of give she proposition serious consideration a good many folk think they can do just what i can -- if i would only tell 'em how -- and sometimes they find out they can not upon the word they top a little rise and johnnie lay a swift detain hand upon she companion 's arm at the roadside in a little open grassy space where once evidently a cabin have stand kneel the figure of a gaunt old man at first he seem to the approach pair to be gesticulate and point but a moment 's observation give they the gleam of a knife in he hand -- he be play mumblety-peg as they stand draw back near some roadside bush watch he the long lean old arm go up the knife flash against the knuckle of the clenched fist and with a whirl of the wrist reverse swiftly in air to bury its blade in the soil before the player hi hi hi i th ` owe it that count two for I the crack old falsetto shrill out there on that grassy plot that might have be a familiar dooryard of he early day he be play alone go back to childhood johnnie gaze and she eye swim with unshed tear you better not go up there -- and he with the knife and all she murmur finally the man beside she look around into she face and laugh i be not very bad scared he say advance softly in line with he proposed patient motion the girl not to make herself know or startle she uncle johnnie steal after he fill with anxiety when the newcomer stand directly behind the kneel man he bent and he arm shoot out with surprising quickness the finger of one hand drop as though predestine upon the back of the neck the other catch skilfully beneath the chin there be a sharp wrench a odd crack a grunt from uncle pro and then the mountaineer spring to he full and very considerable height with a roar whirling upon he adversary he grapple he in he long arm hug like a grizzly and shouting : you gid hime wha ` r 's my specimen he shake the stranger savagely you a ' shade buckheath -- you p ` ar o ' scoundrel -- give I back my silver specimen give I back my silver ore that show about the mine for my little gal uncle pro uncle pro scream johnnie

plunge down the steep chapter xxiii a clue they stand together watch as the tall form retreat around the sharp curve of the red clay road or leap lightly and hardily down the cut-off they wave back to they late companion when climb into the wait buggy below he be finally drive away johnnie turn and look long at she uncle with swimming eye as he stand gaze where the vehicle have disappear she

dawson be a hard nation o ' folk johnnie i talk to 'em for a spell and try to make 'em see that the hardwick folk have not never sell no dead body to the student doctor but they be all mad and out o ' theirselve i seed that they want to get up a feud ` well ' say rudd ` they have get one of the dawson and before we be do we 'll get one o ' they ' ` uh-huh ' i say ` you-all air a-goin ' to get one o

carefully away from she this here kidnappin ' business a tryin ' to get money out of a feller 's friend most generally do wind up in a killin ' he say the folk git to huntin ' pretty hot then they that be do the trick get scared and -- they would not have no good place to put he they dawson and -- and reluctantly a dead body 's easier hide than a live man truth be hit look mighty bad for the young feller honey girl to my mind hit 's really a question of time the sooner he friend get to he the better that be my belief johnnie 's pale haggard face take on tragic line as she listen to this

should not carry news of they approach after this they meet no one but swing on at they best pace and for the most part in silence husband strength and breath twelve o'clock see they enter that gash of the hill where the little cabin crouch against the great mountain wall the ground become so rocky that the track of the automobile be lose at first it would be visible now and again on a bit of sandy loam chain mark show where the tire leave no impression but within a mile or so of the consadine home it seem to have leave the trail when this point arrive johnnie differ from she uncle in choose to hold to the road honey this end the cyar-tracks look like they would turn out i think they take off into the bush here and where that cyar go we ought to go pro argue but johnnie hurry on ahead look about she eagerly suddenly she stoop with a cry and pick up from the path a small object they have carry he past this way she pant oh uncle pro he be right here not so very long ago she scrutinize the sparse growth the leafless bush about the spot look for sign of a struggle and the question in she heart be my god be he alive or dead the thing she hold in she hand be a blossom of the pink moccasin flower carefully press as though for the page of a herbarium the bit of paper to which it be attach be crumple and discolor look like it have lay out in the dew last night breathe johnnie or for a week supply pro he scan the little brown thing then she face all right he say dubiously if that there tell you that he come a-past here we 'll foller this road -- though it ` pear to I like we ought to stick to the cyar it be not far to we house urge johnnie let 's go there first anyhow for a few minute they press ahead in silence then some subtle excitement make they break into a run thus they round the turn the cabin come in sight its door swing wide on complain hinge the last of the rickety fence have fall the desolation and decay of a desert house be over all there be be folk here -- lately pant pro look thar and he point to a huddle of basket and garment on the porch mind out go careful they may be thar now they go careful steal up the step and enter with caution but they find nothing more alarming than the four bare wall the ash-strewn fireless hearth the musty smell of a long-unoccupied house near the back door at a spot where the dust be thick uncle pro bent to examine a foot-print when a exclamation from johnnie call he through to the rear of the cabin see the door she cry run up the steep way toward the cave spring-house hold on honey go easy caution she uncle follow as fast as he could he note the whittle where the sapling bar that hold the stout oaken door in place have be recently shape to its present purpose then a soft rhythmic sound like a giant breathing in he sleep catch the old hunter 's keen ear watch out johnnie he call catch she arm what be that listen she finger be almost on the bar they could hear the soft lip-lip of the water as it well out beneath the threshold mingle with the tinkle and fall of the spring branch below johnnie turn in she uncle 's grasp and clutch he stare down something shine and dark brave with brass and flash lamp stand on the rocky way beneath and purr like a great cat in the broad sunlight of noon -- gray stoddard 's motor car the two cling to each other on the steep above it gaze half incredulous now that they have find the thing they seek it look so unbelievably adequate and modern and alive standing there draw its perfectly measure breath it be so eloquent of power and the work of man 's hand that there seem to yawn a gap of half a thousand year between it and the raid in which it be be make a factor that this pet toy of the modern millionaire should be set to work out the crude vengeance of wild man in these primitive surroundings crowd up on a little rocky path of these savage mountain at the door of a cave spring-house -- such a food-cache as a nomad indian might have utilize in the gray bluff against the sky-line -- it take the breath with its sinister strangeness they turn to the bar door the cave be a sizable opening run far back into the mountain indeed the end of it have never be explore but the vestibule contain the spring be fit with rude bench and shelf for hold pan of milk and jar of buttermilk as johnnie 's hand go out to the newly cut bar she uncle once more lay a restrain grasp upon it a dozen man might be on the other side of the oaken door and there might be nobody hello he call guardedly no answer come but within there be a sound of clinking and then a shuffling movement the pant motor speak loud of those who have bring it there who must be expect to return to it very shortly johnnie 's nerve give way hello be there anybody inside she demand fearfully who be there who be it come a muffle hail from the cave in a voice that send the blood to johnnie 's heart with a sudden shock uncle pro we have find he she scream push the old man aside and tug at the bar which hold the door in place as she work there come a curious clinking sound and then the dull impact of a heavy fall and when she drag the bar loose swing the door wide and peer into the gloom there be nothing but the silvery reach of the great spring and beyond it a prone figure in russet riding-clothes uncle pro -- he be hurt oh help I she cry the prostrate man struggle to turn he face to they be that you johnnie gray stoddard 's voice ask no i be not hurt these thing trip I up the two get to he simultaneously they find he in heavy shackle they note how

over he cot or sit across the checker-board from he for long hour while they talk or play together that face be pale now the brown hair a little longer than other people wear it toss helplessly in stoddard 's eye because he scarcely could raise he shackled hand to put it right he russet-brown clothing be tear and grime as though with more than one struggle though it may have be nothing worse than such mishap as he recent fall yet the man 's soul look out of he eye with the same composure the same kindness that always be he he be eat by neither terror nor rage though he be alert for every possibility of help or of advantage you johnnie -- you whisper gray struggle to he knee with they assistance and catch a fold of she dress in those manacled hand i have dream about you here in the dark it be you -- it be really johnnie he be pale dishevelled with a long mark of black leaf-mould across he cheek from he recent fall and johnnie bent speechlessly to wipe the stain away and put back

run on down and see if that contraption will go i can git he thar now johnnie instantly loose the arm she hold spring through the doorway and headlong down the bluffy steep stone rattle about she she leap into the car would she memory serve she would she forget some detail that she must know there be two lever under the steering-wheel she advance she spark and partly open the throttle from the steady comfortable purr which have underton all sound in the tiny glen the machine burst at once into a deep-toned roar the narrow depression vibrate with its joyous clamor suddenly above the sound johnnie be aware of a distant hail which finally resolve itself into word hi hoo -- ee you let that car alone whoever you be she glance over she shoulder passmore have get gray to the top of the declivity and be attempt to help he down both man evidently hear the challenge but she scream to they again and again hurry oh hurry they be come -- they be come stoddard have be step as best he could

out stay thar -- johnnie -- i can fetch he with a strain heave he hoist gray 's helpless body into he arm the car tremble like a great eager monster growl in leash johnnie 's agonize eye search first its mechanism and then go to the descend figure where she uncle plunge desperately down the slope fall struggle rolled but rise and come gallantly on half drag half carry gray in he arm let that car alone a new voice take up the hail a little nearer this time and after it come the sound of a shot high up on the mountain 's brow against the sky johnnie catch a glimpse of the head and shoulder of man with the slanting bar of a gun barrel over one oh hurry uncle pro she sob let I come back and help you but passmore stumble across the remain space mutely with draw face and loud labor breath he lift gray and thrust he any fashion into the tonneau climb blindly after the pursuit on the hill above break into the open johnnie move the lever as gray have show she how to do and with a bind of the great machine they be off stoddard dazed bruise abrade be back in the tonneau struggle up with uncle pro 's assistance he could not help she she must know for herself and do the right thing the track

down the hill at a tremendous pace yet those yell voice be behind and she push finger carry the lever through second to the third speed without pause under this tremendous pressure the car jump like a nervous horse lurch drunkenly down the short way but reel successfully around the turn at the bottom johnnie know this be go too fast she debate the possibility of slacken the speed a bit as they strike the highway such as it be uncle pro yet gasp be try to help gray into the seat but with he hamper manacle and the jerking of the car the younger man be still on he knee when the chase burst through the bush scarcely more than three hundred foot behind they there be a hoarse baying of man 's voice there be four of they run hard and two carry gun the noise of the machine of course prevent its occupant from distinguish any word but the menace of the open pursuit be apparent johnnie cry gray oh this will not do for god 's sake mr passmore help I over there they would not want to hurt she

be a bellow detonation and a spatter of shot fall about the fly car that be not goin ' to hurt nobody comment pro philosophically it be no more than buck-shot anyhow -lrb- illustration : the car be already leap down the hill at a tremendous pace -rrb- but on the word follow a more ominous crack and there be the whine of a bullet above they my god i can not let she do this gray protest but johnnie turn over she shoulder a shine face from which all weariness have suddenly be erase a glorified countenance that fling he the fleeting smile she have time to spare from the machine you be in worse danger right now from my driving than you be from they gun she pant as she speak there sound once more the rip crack of a rifle the singing of a bullet past they and with it the flatter louder noise of the shot-gun be repeat she eye in the act of turn to she task catch the silhouette of old gideon hime 's uncouth figure relieve against the noonday sky as he spring high both arm fling up the hand empty and clutch and pitch headlong to he face but she mind scarcely register the impression for a rifle ball strike the shaly edge of a bluff under which the road at this point run and tear loose a piece of the slate-like rock which glance whirling into the tonneau and graze gray stoddard 's temple he fall forward crumple down into the bottom of the vehicle on -- go on honey yell pro motion vehemently to the girl do not look back here -- i 'll tend to he and he stoop over the motionless form then come the roar impression of speed of rush bush that gather themselves and run back past the car while work under full power it stand stationary as it seem to johnnie in the middle of a long dusty gray ribbon that be the road the cry of the man behind they all sound of pursuit be soon leave so far in the distance that they be unheard be not this rather fast shout uncle pro who have lift stoddard 's bleeding head to he knee and crouch on the bottom of the tonneau be shield the younger man from further injury as the motor lurch and pitch yes it be too fast johnnie scream back to he i be try to go slower but the foot-brake will not hold uncle pro be he hurt be he hurt bad i do not think so honey roar the old man stoutly guard gray 's inert body with he arm then stretch up as he kneel and lean forward as close to she ear as he could get : but you git he to cottonville

work over she machine wildly gray have tell she of the foot-brake only but she hand encounter the lever of the emergency brake she grasp it at a hazard and shove it forward as the god of luck have order just short of a zigzag in the steep mountain road which at the speed they have be make would have pile they a mass of wreckage beneath the cliff the sudden violent check -- shoot along at the speed they be it amount almost to a stoppage -- give the girl a sense of power if she could do that they be fairly safe with the relief she brain clear she be able to study the machine with some calmness gray could not help she -- out of the side of she eye she could see where he lay inert and senseless in passmore 's hold the life of all three depend on she cool head at this moment she remember now all that stoddard have say the morning he teach she to run the car with one movement she throw off the switch thus stop the engine entirely they must make it to cottonville running by gravity wherever they could since she have no means of know that there be sufficient gasoline in the tank and it would not do to be overtake or waylay on and on they fly around quick turn along narrow way that skirt tall bluff over stretch of comparatively level road where johnnie again switch on the engine and speed up they be skim down from the upper unaka like a great bird whose powerful wing make nothing of distance but johnnie 's heart be as lead when she glance back at the motionless figure in the tonneau the white blood-streaked face that lay on she uncle 's arm she turn doggedly to she steering-wheel and lever and take greater chance than ever with the go for speed 's sake the boy they have talk with two hour before at the chip pile meet they afoot he leap into the bush to let they pass and stare after they with dilate eye johnnie never know what he shout they only see he mouth open and work mercifully so far they have meet no vehicle but now the higher wilder mountain be behind they there be a occasional horseman as they near cottonville and team be numerous on the road johnnie jealously unwilling to slacken speed keep the horn go almost continuously people in wagon and buggy or on foot draw out along the roadside cup hand to lip and yell startle inquiry johnnie bent above the steering-wheel and pay no attention uncle pro try to answer with gesticulation or a

start down to the mill what do you think i have find out about we mine certainly the old man look very tall and dignified in he new splendor but now he be all boy lean eagerly forward to half whisper : i do not know -- what stoddard 's face be scarcely less animated as he search hastily in the pigeon-hole of he desk the patent might have a company to manage its affair but the mine on big unaka be sacred to these two in whom the immortal urchin sufficiently survive to make mine-hunting and exploit delectable employment why uncle pro it be not silver at all it be -- gray look up and catch the woeful drop of the face before he and hasten on to add it be better than silver -- it be nickel the price of silver fluctuate but the world supply of nickel be limited and nickel 's a sure thing pro passmore lean back in he chair digest this new bit of information luxuriously nickel he say reflectively and again he repeat the word to himself nickel well i do not know but what that be finer leastway it be likelier to say a silver mine always seem just like take money out of the ground but then nickel be money too -- and enough of 'em be all a body need these people say the ore be exceptionally fine stoddard have get out the letter now and be glance over it they be send down a expert and you and i will go up with he as soon as he get here there be likely to be other valuable mineral as by-product in a nickel mine and we want to build a ideal mining village as well as model cotton mill oh we have get the work cut out for we and lay right to hand if we do not do we little share toward solve some problem it will be strange cur ` we how thing turn out in this world the old man ruminate ever sence i be a little chap settin ' on my granddaddy 's knee by the hearth -- big hickory fire a-roarin ' up the chimbly wind a-goin ' ` whooh ' overhead a ' I with my eye like saucer a-listenin ' to he tale of the silver mine that the injun have -- ever sence that time i have hunt that thar mine he laugh chucklingly deep in he throat thar be not a wild-catter that could have a hideout safe from I they just have to trust I i crawl into every hole i come mighty near seein ' the end of every cave -- but one and that cave be the one whar my mammy keep she milk and butter -- the springhouse whar they put you in prison somehow i never do think about goin ' to the end of that look like it be too near home to have a silver mine in it and thar the stuff lay and wait for the day when i should take a notion to find a pretty rock for deanie and crawl back in thar and keep a crawlin ' till i just fall over it all croppin ' out in the biggest kind of vein gray have hear uncle pro tell the story many time but it have a perennial charm then i lose six month -- plumb lose 'em you know and time i come to myself johnnie a ' I be a-huntin ' for you and there we find you shut in that thar same cave and i be so tuck up with that matter that i never once think till i get you home to wonder do buckheath and the rest of 'em know that they would pen you in the silver mine i be not never ask you but you would have know if they have i should have know anything that rudd dawson or groner or venter know gray say but i be not sure about buckheath or hime however hime be dead and buckheath -- i do not suppose anybody in cottonville will ever see he again pro 's face change instantly he lean abruptly forward and lay a hand on the other 's knee that be exactly what i come down here to speak with you about gray he say they have fetch shade buckheath in -- now what do you make out of that stoddard shove the letter from the eastern mining man back in its pigeon-hole well he say slowly i do not expect that i thought of course shade be safely out of the country i -- passmore i be sorry they have get he after a little silence he speak again what do i make of it why that there be some folk up on big unaka who need pretty badly to appear as very law-abiding citizen i 'll wager anything that groner and rudd dawson bring shade in uncle pro nod seriously they be the very fellers he say reckon they have talk pretty free to you i never ax ye gray -- how do they treat ye dawson be the best friend i have stoddard return promptly when i get to the big turn on sultan -- come home that Friday morning -- buckheath meet I and ask I to go down to burnt cabin and help he with a man that have fall and hurt himself on the rock dawson tell I afterward that he and jesse groner be post at the roadside to stop I and hem I in before i get to the bluff i have describe to you how buckheath try to back sultan over the edge and i get off on the side where the two be not notice they till they tie I hand and foot they almost come to a clinch with buckheath then and there you ought to have hear groner swear it be like pray go wrong uh-huh agree pro jess be a terrible wicked man -- in speech that-a-way -- but he be good-hearted that first scrimmage show I just what the man be after stoddard say buckheath plainly want I put out of the way but the other have some vague idea of hold I for a ransom and get money out of the hardwick dawson complain always that he think the mill owe he money he say they must have sell he girl 's body for as much as a hundred dollar and he feel that he would be cheat oh it be all crazy stuff but he and the other have justify themselves and they have no notion of stand for what buckheath be after i be one of the cotton-mill man to they they have no personal malice through the long evening when groner or dawson or will venter be guard I -- or maybe all three of they -- we use to talk and it surprise I to find how simple and childish those fellow be they be as kind to I as though i have be a brother and treat I courteously always little by little i get at the whole thing from they it seem that buckheath take advantage of the feeling there be in the mountain against the mill man on account of the hospital and some other matter he go up there and interview anybody that he think might join he in a vendetta i imagine he find plenty of they that be ready to talk and some that be willing to do but it chance that dawson and jesse groner be come down to cottonville that morning i pass buckheath at the hardwick gate and he must have cut across the turn and follow I intend to pick a quarrel then he meet dawson and groner and frame up this other plan with they assistance uncle pro i want you to help I out if buckheath have to stand trial how be we -- any of we -- go to testify without make it hard on the dawson crowd i expect to live here the rest of my day here be this mine of ours and right here i mean to build a big mill and work out my plan i think you know that i hope to marry a mountain wife and i can not afford to quarrel with those folk uncle pro 's chin drop to he breast he eye half close as he sit think intently well he say finally they will not have nothing worse than manslaughter against shade it
