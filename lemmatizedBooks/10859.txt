which might cheat the day of calamity of they weary length society have vanish and amidst the minute vexation of jacobinical despotism which while it murder in _ mass _ persecute in detail the resource of write and even reading be encompass with danger the research of domiciliary visit have already compel I to commit to the flame a manuscript volume where i have trace the political scene of which i have be a witness with the coloring of they first impression on my mind with those fresh tint that fade from recollection and since my pen accustom to follow the impulse of my feeling could only have draw at that fatal period those image of desolation and despair which haunt my imagination and dwelt upon my heart writing be forbid employment even read have its peril for book have sometimes aristocratical insignia and sometimes counter revolutionary allusion and when the administrator of police happen to think the writer a conspirator they punish the reader as he accomplice in this situation i give myself the task of employ a few hour every day in translate the charming little novel of bernardin st pierre entitle paul and virginium and i find the most soothing relief in wander from my own gloomy reflection to those enchanting scene of the mauritius which he have so admirably describe i also compose a few sonnet adapt to the peculiar production of that part of the globe which be intersperse in the work some indeed be lose as well as a part of the translation which i have since supply have be send to the municipality of pari in order to be examine as english papers where they still remain mingled with revolutionary placard motion and harangue and be not likely to be restore to my possession with respect to the translation i can only hope to deserve the humble merit of not have deform the beauty of the original i have indeed take one liberty with my author which it be fit i should acknowledge that of omit several page of general observation which however excellent in themselves would be pass over with impatience by the english reader when they interrupt the pathetic narrative in this respect the two nation seem to change character and while the serious and reflect englishman require in novel write as well as on the theater a rapid succession of incident much bustle and stage effect without suffer the author to appear himself and stop the progress of the story the gay and restless frenchman listen attentively to long philosophical reflection while the catastrophe of the drama hang in suspense my last poetical production -lrb- the sonnet which be intersperse in this work -rrb- may perhaps be find even more imperfect than my earlier composition since after a long exile from england i can scarcely flatter myself that my ear be become more attuned to the harmony of a language with the sound of which it be seldom gladden or that my poetical taste be improve by live in a country where art have give place to arm but the public will perhaps receive with indulgence a work write under such peculiar circumstance not compose in the calm of literary leisure or in pursuit of literary fame but amidst the turbulence of the most cruel sensation and in order to escape awhile from overwhelming misery hmw paul and virginium on the eastern coast of the mountain which rise above port loui in the mauritius upon a piece of land bear

upon the flood at the entrance of the valley which present those various object the echo of the mountain incessantly repeat the hollow murmur of the wind that shake the neighbouring forest and the tumultuous dashing of the wave which break at a distance upon the cliff but near the ruin cottage all be calm and still and the only object which there meet the eye be rude steep rock that rise like a surround rampart large clump of tree grow at they base on they rifted side and even on they majestic top where the cloud seem to repose the shower which they bold point attract often paint the vivid color of the rainbow on they green and brown declivity and swell the source of the little river which flow at they foot call the river of fan-palm within this enclosure reign the most profound silence

the attempt of the european nation to form establishment on that fatal soil he effect be seize upon by the rapacity of stranger and he wife who be pregnant find herself a widow in a country where she have neither credit nor recommendation and no earthly possession or rather support save one negro woman too delicate to solicit protection or relief from any other man after the death of he whom alone she love misfortune armed she with courage and she resolve to cultivate with she slave a little spot of ground and procure for herself the means of subsistence in a island almost a desert and where the ground be leave to the choice of the settler she avoid those spot which be most fertile and most favourable to commerce and seek some nook of the mountain some secret asylum where she might live solitary and unknown she bent she way from the town towards those rock where she wish to shelter herself as in a nest all suffer creature from a sort of common instinct fly for refuge amidst they pain to haunt the most wild and desolate as if rock could form a rampart against misfortune as if the calm of nature could hush the tumult of the soul that providence which lend its support when we ask but the supply of we necessary want have a blessing in reserve for madame de la tour which neither riches nor greatness can purchase this blessing be a friend the spot to which madame de la tour flee have already be inhabit a year by a young woman of a lively good natured and affectionate disposition margaret -lrb- for that be she name -rrb- be bear in britany of a family of peasant by whom she be cherish and beloved and with whom she might have pass life in simple rustic happiness if mislead by the weakness of a tender heart she have not listen to the passion of a gentleman in the neighborhood who promise she marriage he soon abandon she and add inhumanity to seduction refuse to ensure a provision for the child of which she be pregnant margaret then determine to leave for ever she native village and go where she fault might be conceal to some colony distant from that country where she have lose the only portion of a poor peasant girl -- she reputation with some borrow money she purchase a old negro slave with whom she cultivate a little spot of this canton here madame de la tour follow by she negro woman find margaret suckle she child soothe by the sight of a person in a situation somewhat similar to she own madame de la tour related in a few word she past condition and she present want margaret be deeply affect by the recital and more anxious to excite confidence than esteem she confess without disguise the error of which she have be guilty ` as for I ' say she ' i deserve my fate : but you madam -- you at once virtuous and unhappy -- ' and sob she offer madame de la tour both she hut and she friendship that lady affect by this tender reception press she in she arm and exclaim ` ah surely heaven will put a end to my misfortune since it inspire you to whom i be a stranger with more goodness towards I than i have ever experience from my own relation ' i know margaret and although my habitation be a league and a half from hence in the wood behind that sloping mountain i consider myself as she neighbor in the city of europe a street sometimes even a less distance separate family whom nature have unite but in new colony we consider those person as neighbor from whom we be divide only by wood and mountain and above all at that period when this island have little intercourse with the indy neighborhood alone give a claim to friendship and hospitality toward stranger seem less a duty than a pleasure no sooner be i inform that margaret have find a companion than i hasten thither in hope of be useful to my neighbor and she guest madame de la tour possess all those melancholy grace which give beauty additional power by blend sympathy with admiration she figure be interesting and she countenance express at once dignity and dejection she appear to be in the last stage of she pregnancy i tell they that for the future interest of they child and to prevent the intrusion of any other settler it be necessary they should divide between they the property of this wild sequestered valley which be nearly twenty acre in extent they confide that task to I and i mark out two equal portion of land one include the higher part of this enclosure from the peak of that rock bury in cloud whence spring the rapid river of fan-palm to that wide cleft which you see on the summit of the mountain and which be call the cannon 's mouth from the resemblance in its form it be difficult to find a path along this wild portion of enclosure the soil of which be encumber with fragment of rock or worn into channel form by torrent yet it produce noble tree and innumerable fountain and rivulet the other portion of land be comprise in the plain extend along the bank of the river of fan-palm to the opening where we be now seat from whence the river take its course between those two hill until it fall into the sea you may still trace the vestige of some meadow-land and this part of the common be less rugged but not more valuable than the other since in the rainy season it become marshy and in dry weather be so hard and unbending that it will yield only to the stroke of the hatchet when i have thus divide the property i persuade my neighbor to draw lot for they separate possession the higher portion of land become the property of madame de la tour the lower of margaret and each seem satisfy with she respective share they entreat I to place they habitation together that they might at all time enjoy the soothing intercourse of friendship and the consolation of mutual kind office margaret 's cottage be situate near the center of the valley and just on the boundary of she own plantation close to that spot i build another cottage for the dwelling of madame de la tour : and thus the two friend while they possess all the advantage of neighborhood live on they own property i myself cut palisade from the mountain and bring leaf of fan-palm from the seashore in order to construct those two cottage of which you can now discern neither the entrance nor the roof yet alas there still remain but too many trace for my remembrance time which so rapidly destroy the proud monument of empire seem in this desert to spare those of friendship as if to perpetuate my regret to the last hour of my existence scarcely be she cottage finish when madame de la tour be deliver of a girl i have be the godfather of margaret 's child who be christen by the name of paul madame de la tour desire I to perform the same office for she child also together with she friend who give she the name of virginium ` she will be virtuous ' cry margaret ` and she will be happy i have only known misfortune by wander from virtue ' at the time madame de la tour recover those two little territory have already begin to yield some produce perhaps in a small degree owe to the care which i occasionally bestow on they improvement but far more to the indefatigable labor of the two slave margaret 's slave who be call domingo be still healthy and robust although advance in year : he possess some knowledge and a good natural understanding he cultivate indiscriminately on both settlement such spot of ground as be most fertile and sow whatever grain he think most congenial to each particular soil where the ground be poor he strew maize where it be most fruitful he plant wheat and rice in such spot as be marshy he throw the seed of gourd and cucumber at the foot of the rock which they love to climb and decorate with they luxuriant foliage in dry spot he cultivate the sweet potato the cotton-tree flourish upon the height and the sugar-cane grow in the clayey soil he rear some plant of coffee on the hill where the grain although small be excellent the plantain-tree which spread they grateful shade on the bank of the river and encircle the cottage yield fruit throughout the year and lastly domingo cultivate a few plant of tobacco to charm away he own care sometimes he be employ in cut wood for firing from the mountain sometimes in hew piece of rock within the enclosure in order to level the path he be much attach to margaret and not less to madame de la tour whose negro-woman mary he have marry at the time of virginium 's birth and he be passionately fond of he wife mary be bear at madagascar from whence she have bring a few art of industry she could weave basket and a sort of stuff with long grass that grow in the wood she be active cleanly and above all faithful it be she care to prepare they meal to rear the poultry and go sometimes to port loui and sell the superfluity of these little plantation which be not very considerable if you add to the personage i have already mention two goat who be bring up with the child and a great dog who keep watch at night you will have a complete idea of the household as well as of the revenue of those two farm madame de la tour and she friend be employ from the morning till the evening in spin cotton for the use of they family destitute of all those thing which they own industry could not supply they walk about they habitation with they foot bare and shoe be a convenience reserve for Sunday when at a early hour they attend mass at the church of the shaddock grove which you see yonder that church be far more distant than port loui yet they seldom visit the town lest they should be treat with contempt because they be dress in the coarse blue linen of bengal which be usually worn by slave but be there in that external deference which fortune command a compensation for domestic happiness if they have something to suffer from the world this serve but to endear they humble home no sooner do mary and domingo perceive they from this elevated spot on the road of the shaddock grove than they fly to the foot of the mountain in order to help they to ascend they discern in the look of they domestic that joy which they return inspire they find in they retreat neatness independence all those blessing which be the recompense of toil and receive those service which have they source in affection -- unite by the tie of similar want and the sympathy of similar misfortune they give each other the tender name of companion friend sister -- they have but one will one interest one table all they possession be in common and if sometimes a passion more ardent than friendship awaken in they heart the pang of unavailing anguish a pure religion unite with chaste manners draw they affection towards another life as the tremble flame rise towards heaven when it no longer find any aliment on earth madame de la tour sometimes leave the household care to margaret wander out alone and amidst the sublime scenery indulge that luxury of pensive sadness which be so soothing to the mind after the first emotion of turbulent sorrow have subside sometimes she pour forth the effusion of melancholy in the language of verse and although she composition have little poetical merit they appear to I to bear the mark of genuine sensibility many of she poem be lose but some still remain in my possession and a few still hang on my memory i will repeat to you a sonnet address to love sonnet to love ah love ere yet i know thy fatal power bright glow have the color of my youthful day as on the sultry zone the torrid ray that paint the broad-leaved plantain 's glossy bower calm be my bosom as this silent hour when o'er the deep scarce hear the zephyr stray ` midst the cool tam ` rind indolently play nor from the orange shake its od ` rous flower : but ah since love have all my heart possess would that desolate heart what sorrow tear disturb would and wild as ocean 's troubled breast when the hoarse tempest of the night be there yet my complain spirit ask no rest this bleeding bosom cherish despair the tender and sacred duty which nature impose become a source of additional happiness to those affectionate mother whose mutual friendship acquire new strength at the sight of they child alike the offspring of unhappy love they delight to place they infant together in the same bath to nurse they in the same cradle and sometimes change the maternal bosom at which they receive nourishment as if to blend with the tie of friendship that instinctive affection which this act produce ` my friend ' cry madame de la tour ` we shall each of we have two child and each of we child will have two mother ' as two bud which remain on two tree of the same kind after the tempest have break all they branch produce more delicious fruit if each separate from the maternal stem be graft on the neighbouring tree so those two child deprive of all other support imbibe sentiment more tender than those of son and daughter brother and sister when exchange at the breast of those who have give they birth while they be yet in they cradle they mother talk of they marriage and this prospect of conjugal felicity with which they soothe they own care often call forth the tear of bitter regret the misfortune of one mother have arise from have neglect marriage those of the other from have submit to its law : one have be make unhappy by attempt to raise herself above she humble condition of life the other by descend from she rank but they find consolation in reflect that they more fortunate child far from the cruel prejudice of europe those prejudice which poison the most precious source of we happiness would enjoy at once the pleasure of love and the blessing of equality nothing could exceed that attachment which those infant already display for each other if paul complain he mother point to virginium and at that sight he smile and be appease if any accident befel virginium the cry of paul give notice of the disaster and then virginium would suppress she complaint when she find that paul be unhappy when i come hither i usually find they quite naked which be the custom of this country totter in they walk and hold each other by the hand and under the arm as we represent the constellation of the twin at night these infant often refuse to be separate and be find lie in the same cradle they cheek they bosom press close together they hand throw round each other 's neck and sleep lock in one another 's arm when they begin to speak the first name they learn to give each other be those of brother and sister and childhood know no softer appellation they education serve to augment they early friendship by direct it to the supply of they reciprocal want in a short time all that regard the household economy the care of prepare the rural repast become the task of virginium whose labor be always crown with the praise and kiss of she brother as for paul always in motion he dig the garden with domingo or follow he with a little hatchet into the wood where if in he ramble he espy a beautiful flower fine fruit or a nest of bird even at the top of a tree he climb up and bring it home to he sister when you meet with one of these child you might be sure the other be not distant one day come down that mountain i see virginium at the end of the garden run toward the house with she petticoat throw over she head in order to screen herself from a shower of rain at a distance i think she be alone but as i hasten towards she in order to help she on i perceive that she hold paul by the arm who be almost entirely envelop in the same cavity and both be laugh heartily at be sheltered together under a umbrella of they own invention those two charming face place within the petticoat swell by the wind recall to my mind the child of leda enclose within the same shell they sole study be how to please and assist each other for of all other thing they be ignorant and know neither how to read nor write they be never disturb by research into past time nor do they curiosity extend beyond the bound of that mountain they believe the world end at the shore of they own island and all they idea and affection be confine within its limit they mutual tenderness and that of they mother employ all the activity of they soul they tear have never be call forth by long application to useless science they mind have never be weary by lesson of morality superfluous to bosom unconscious of ill they have never be teach that they must not steal because every thing with they be in common or be intemperate because they simple food be leave to they own discretion or false because they have no truth to conceal they young imagination have never be terrify by the idea that god have punishment in store for ungrateful child since with they filial affection arise naturally from maternal fondness all they have be teach of religion be to love it and if they do not offer up long prayer in the church wherever they be in the house in the field in the wood they raise towards heaven they innocent hand and they heart purify by virtuous affection thus pass they early childhood like a beautiful dawn the prelude of a bright day already they partake with they mother the care of the household as soon as the cry of the wakeful cock announce the first beam of the morning virginium arise and hasten to draw water from a neighbouring spring then return to the house she prepare the breakfast when the rise sun light up the point of those rock which overhang this enclosure margaret and she child go to the dwelling of madame de la tour and they offer up together they morning prayer this sacrifice of thanksgive always precede they first repast which they often partake before the door of the cottage seat upon the grass under a canopy of plantain and while the branch of that delightful tree afford a grateful shade its solid fruit furnished food ready prepare by nature and its long glossy leaf spread upon the table supply the want of linen plentiful and wholesome nourishment give early growth and vigor to the person of those child and they countenance express the purity and peace of they soul at twelve year of age the figure of virginium be in some degree form : a profusion of light hair shaded she face to which she blue eye and coral lip give the most charming brilliancy she eye sparkle with vivacity when she speak but when she be silent she look have a cast upward which give it a expression of extreme sensibility or rather of tender melancholy already the figure of paul display the grace of manly beauty he be taller than virginia he skin be of a darker tint he nose more aquiline and he black eye would have be too pierce if the long eyelash by which be shaded have not give they a look of softness he be constantly in motion except when he sister appear and then place at she side he become quiet they meal often pass in silence and from the grace of they attitude the beautiful proportion of they figure and they naked foot you might have fancy you behold a antique group of white marble represent some of the child of niobe if those eye which seek to meet those smile which be answer by smile of the most tender softness have not rather give you the idea of those happy celestial spirit whose nature be love and who be not oblige to have recourse to word for the expression of that intuitive sentiment in the mean time madame de la tour perceive every day some unfold grace some new beauty in she daughter feel she maternal anxiety increase with she tenderness she often say to I ` if i should die what will become of virginium without fortune ' madame de la tour have a aunt in france who be a woman of quality rich old and a great bigot she have behave towards she niece with so much cruelty upon she marriage that madame de la tour have determine that no distress or misfortune should ever compel she to have recourse to she hard-hearted relation but when she become a mother the pride of resentment be still in the stronger feeling of maternal tenderness she write to she aunt inform she of the sudden death of she husband the birth of she daughter and the difficulty in which she be involve at a distance from she own country without support and burthen with a child she receive no answer but notwithstanding that high spirit which be natural to she character she no longer fear expose herself to mortification and reproach and although she know she relation would never pardon she for have marry a man of merit but not of noble birth she continue to write to she by every opportunity in the hope of awaken she compassion for virginia many year however pass during which she receive not the smallest testimony of she remembrance at length in 1738 three year after the arrival of monsieur de la bourdonnais in this island madame de la tour be inform that the governor have a letter to give she from she aunt she fly to port loui careless on this occasion of appear in she homely garment maternal hope and joy subdue all those little consideration which be lose when the mind be absorb by any powerful sentiment monsieur de la bourdonnais deliver to she a letter from she aunt who inform she that she deserve she fate for have marry a adventurer and a libertine that misplace passion bring along with they they own punishment and that the sudden death of she husband must be consider as a visitation from heaven that she have do well in go to a distant island rather than dishonor she family by remain in france : and that after all in the colony where she have take refuge every person grow rich except the idle have thus lavish sufficient censure upon the conduct of she niece she finish by a eulogium on herself to avoid she say the almost inevitable evil of marriage she have determine to remain in a single state in truth being of a very ambitious temper she have resolve only to unite herself to a man of high rank and although she be very rich she fortune be not find a sufficient bribe even at court to counterbalance the malignant disposition of she mind and the disagreeable quality of she person she add in a postscript that after mature deliberation she have strongly recommend she niece to monsieur de la bourdonnais this she have indeed do but in a manner of late too common and which render a patron perhaps even more formidable than a declare enemy : for in order to justify herself she have cruelly slander she niece while she affect to pity she misfortune madame de la tour whom no unprejudiced person could have see without feel sympathy and respect be receive with the utmost coolness by monsieur de la bourdonnais and when she paint to he she own situation and that of she child he reply ` we will see what can be do -- there be so many to relieve -- why do you affront so respectable a relation -- you have be much to blame ' madame de la tour return to she cottage she bosom throb with all the bitterness of disappointment when she arrive she throw herself on a chair and then fling she aunt 's letter on the table exclaim to she friend ` this be the recompense of eleven year of patient expectation ' as madame de la tour be the only person in the little circle who could read she again take up the letter which she read aloud scarcely have she finish when margaret exclaim ` what have we to do with you relation have god then forsake we he only be we father have we not hitherto be happy why then this regret you have no courage ' see madame de la tour in tear she throw herself upon she neck and press she in she arm ` my dear friend ' cry she ` my dear friend ' but she emotion choke she utterance at this sight virginium burst into tear and press she mother 's hand and margaret 's alternately to she lip and to she heart : while paul with he eye inflamed with anger cry clasped he hand together and stamp with he foot not know whom to blame for this scene of misery the noise soon lead domingo and mary to the spot and the little habitation resound with the cry of distress ah madame -- my good mistress -- my dear mother -- do not weep ' those tender proof of affection at length dispel madame de la tour 's sorrow she take paul and virginium in she arm and embrace they cry ` you be the cause of my affliction and yet my only source of delight yes my dear child misfortune have reach I from a distance but surely i be surround by happiness ' paul and virginium do not understand this reflection but when they see that she be calm they smile and continue to caress she thus tranquillity be restore and what have pass proved but a transient storm which serve to give fresh verdure to a beautiful spring although madame de la tour appear calm in the presence of she family she sometimes communicate to I the feeling that prey upon she mind and soon after this period give I the follow sonnet : -- sonnet to disappointment pale disappointment at thy freezing name chill fear in every shiver vein i prove my sink pulse almost forget to move and life almost forsake my languid frame : yet thee relentless nymph no more i blame : why do my thought ` midst vain illusion reeve why gild the charm of friendship and of love with the warm glow of fancy 's purple flame when ruffle wind have some bright fane o'erthrown which shine on paint cloud or seem would to shine shall the fond gazer dream for he alone those cloud be stable and at fate repine i feel alas the fault be all my own and ah the cruel punishment be mine the amiable disposition of those child unfold itself daily on a Sunday they mother have go at break of day to mass at the church of the shaddock grove the child perceive a negro woman beneath the plantain which shaded they habitation she appear almost waste to a skeleton and have no other garment than a shred of coarse cloth throw across she loin she fling

let I go and ask forgiveness for you of you master surely the sight of you will touch he with pity -- will you show I the way ' -- ` angel of heaven ' answer the poor negro woman ' i will follow you where you please ' virginium call she brother and beg he to accompany she the slave lead the way by wind and difficult path through the wood over mountain which they climb with difficulty and across river through which they be oblige to wade at length they reach the foot of a precipice upon the border of the black river there they perceive a well-built house surround by extensive plantation and a great number of slave employ at they various labor they master be walk amongst they with a pipe in he mouth and a switch in he hand he be a tall thin figure of a brown complexion he eye be sink in he head and he dark eyebrow be join together virginia hold paul by the hand draw near and with much emotion beg he for the love of god to pardon he poor slave who stand tremble a few pace behind the man at first pay little attention to the child who he see be meanly dress but when he observe the elegance of virginium 's form and the profusion of she beautiful light tress which have escape from beneath she blue cap when he hear the soft tone of she voice which tremble as well as she own frame while she implore he compassion he take the pipe from he mouth and lift up he stick swear with a terrible oath that he pardon he slave not for the love of heaven but of she who ask he forgiveness virginium make a sign to the slave to approach she master and instantly spring away follow by paul they climb up the precipice they have descend and have gain the summit seat themselves at the foot of a tree overcome with fatigue hunger and thirst they have leave they cottage fasting and have walk five league since break of day paul say to virginia ` my dear sister it be past noon and i be sure you be thirsty and hungry we shall find no dinner here let we go down the mountain again and ask the master of the poor slave for some food ' -- ` oh no ' answer virginium ` he frighten I too much remember what mamma sometimes say the bread of the wicked be like stone in the mouth ' -- ` what shall we do then ' say paul : ` these tree produce no fruit and i shall not be able to find even a tamarind or a lemon to refresh you ' scarcely have he pronounce these word when they hear the dashing of water which fall from a neighbouring rock they run thither and have quench they thirst at this crystal spring they gather a few cress which grow on the border of the stream while they be wander in the wood in search of more solid nourishment virginium spy a young palm tree the kind of cabbage which be find at the top of this tree enfold within its leaf form a excellent sustenance but although the stalk of the tree be not thicker than a man 's leg it be above sixty foot in height the wood of this tree be compose of fine filament but the bark be so hard that it turn the edge of the hatchet and paul be not even furnish with a knife at length he think of set fire to the palm tree but a new difficulty occur he have no steel with which to strike fire and although the whole island be cover with rock i do not believe it be possible to find a flint necessity however be fertile in expedient and the most useful invention have arise from man place in the most destitute situation paul determine to kindle a fire in the manner of the negro with the sharp end of a stone he make a small hole in the branch of a tree that be quite dry which he hold between he foot he then sharpen another dry branch of a different sort of wood and afterwards place the piece of pointed wood in the small hole of the branch which he hold with he foot and turn it rapidly between he hand in a few minute smoke and spark of fire issue from the point of contact paul then heap together dry grass and branch and set fire to the palm tree which soon fall to the ground the fire be useful to he in strip off the long thick and pointed leaf within which the cabbage be enclose paul and virginium eat part of the cabbage raw and part dress upon the ash which they find equally palatable they make this frugal repast with delight from the remembrance of the benevolent action they have perform in the morning : yet they joy be embittered by the thought of that uneasiness which they long absence would give they mother virginium often recur to this subject : but paul who feel he strength renew by they meal assure she that it would not be long before they reach home after dinner they recollect that they have no guide and that they be ignorant of the way paul whose spirit be not subdue by difficulty say to virginia ` the sun shine full upon we hut at noon : we must pass as we do this morning over that mountain with its three point which you see yonder come let we go ' this mountain be call the three peak paul and virginium descend the precipice of the black river on the northern side and arrive after a hour 's walk on the bank of a large stream great part of this island be so little known even now that many of its river and mountain have not yet receive a name the river on the bank of which we traveller stand roll foam over a bed of rock the noise of the water frightened virginium and she dare not wade through the stream : paul therefore take she up in he arm and go thus load over the slippery rock which form the bed of the river careless of the tumultuous noise of its water ` do not be afraid ' cry he to virginium ' i feel very strong with you if the inhabitant of the black river have refuse you the pardon of he slave i would have fight with he ' -- ` what ' answer virginium ` with that great wicked man to what have i expose you gracious heaven how difficult it be to do good and it be so easy to do wrong ' when paul have cross the river he wish to continue he journey carry he sister and believe he be able to climb in that way the mountain of the three peak which be still at the distance of half a league but he strength soon fail and he be oblige to set down he burden and to rest himself by she side virginium then say to he ` my dear brother the sun be go down : you have still some strength leave but mine have quite fail : do leave I here and return home alone to ease the fear of we mother ' -- ` oh no ' say paul ' i will not leave you if night surprise we in this wood i will light a fire and bring down another palm-tree : you shall eat the cabbage and i will form a covering of the leaf to shelter you ' in the mean time virginium be a little rest pull from the trunk of a old tree which hang over the bank of the river some long leaf of hart 's tongue which grow near its root with those leaf she make a sort of buskin with which she cover she foot that be bleed from the sharpness of the stony path for in she eager desire to do good she have forget to put on she shoe feel she foot cool by the freshness of the leaf she break off a branch of bamboo and continue she walk lean with one hand on the staff and with the other on paul they walk on slowly through the wood but from the height of the tree and the thickness of they foliage they soon lose sight of the mountain of the tree peak by which they have direct they course and even of the sun which be now set at length they wander without perceive it from the beaten path in which they have hitherto walk and find themselves in a labyrinth of tree and rock which appear to have no opening paul make virginia sit down while he run backwards and forwards half frantic in search of a path which might lead they out of this thick wood but all he research be in vain he climb to the top of a tree from whence he hope at least to discern the mountain of the three peak but all he could perceive around he be the top of tree some of which be gilded by the last beam of the setting sun already the shadow of the mountain be spread over the forest in the valley the wind cease as it usually do at the evening hour the most profound silence reign in those awful solitude which be only interrupt by the cry of the stag who come to repose in that unfrequented spot paul in the hope that some hunter would hear he voice call out as loud as he be able ` come come to the help of virginium ' but the echo of the forest alone answer he call and repeat again and again ` virginia -- virginium ' paul at length descend from the tree overcome with fatigue and vexation and reflect how they might best contrive to pass the night in that desert but he could find neither a fountain a palm-tree nor even a branch of dry wood to kindle a fire he then feel by experience the sense of he own weakness and begin to weep virginium say to he ` do not weep my dear brother or i shall die with grief i be the cause of all you sorrow and of all that we mother suffer at this moment i find we ought to do nothing not even good without consult we parent oh i have be very imprudent ' and she begin to shed tear she then say to paul ` let we pray to god my dear brother and he will hear we ' scarcely have they finish they prayer when they hear the bark of a dog ` it be the dog of some hunter ' say paul ` who come here at night to lay in wait for the stag ' soon after the dog bark again with more violence ` surely ' say virginia ` it be fidele we own dog yes i know he voice be we then so near home at the foot of we own mountain a moment after fidele be at they foot bark howling cry and devour they with he caress before they have recover they surprise they see domingo run towards they at the sight of this good old negro who weep with joy they begin to weep too without be able to utter one word when domingo have recover himself a little ` oh my dear child ' cry he ` how miserable have you make you mother how much be they astonish when they return from mass where i go with they and not find you mary who be at work at a little distance could not tell we where you be go i run backwards and forwards about the

foot chained to a block of wood and a iron collar with three hook fasten round she neck ` from thence fidele still on the scent lead I up the precipice of the black river where he again stop and bark with all he might this be on the brink of a spring near a fall palm tree and close to a fire which be still smoking at last he lead I to this very spot we be at the foot of the mountain of the three peak and still four league from home come eat and gather strength ' he then present they with cake fruit and a very large gourd fill with a liquor compose of wine water lemon juice sugar and nutmeg which they mother have prepare virginium sigh at the recollection of the poor slave and at the uneasiness which they have give they mother she repeat several time ` oh how difficult it be to do good ' while she and paul be take refreshment domingo kindle a fire and have seek among the rock for a particular kind of crooked wood which burn when quite green throw out a great blaze he make a torch which he light it be already night but when they prepare to continue they journey a new difficulty occur paul and virginium could no longer walk they foot be violently swell and inflamed domingo know not whether it be best to leave they and go in search of help or remain and pass the night with they on that spot ` what be become of the time ' say he ` when i use to carry you both together in my arm but now you be grow big and i be grow old ' while he be in this perplexity a troop of maroon negro appear at the distance of twenty pace the chief of the band approach paul and virginium say to they ` good little white people do not be afraid we see you pass this morning with a negro woman of the black river you go to ask pardon for she of she wicked master and we in return for this will carry you home upon we shoulder ' he then make a sign and four of the strongest negro immediately form a sort of litter with the branch of tree and liana in which have seat paul and virginium they place it upon they shoulder domingo march in front carry he light torch and they proceed amidst the rejoicing of the whole troop and overwhelm with they benediction virginium affect by this scene say to paul with emotion ' o my dear brother god never leave a good action without reward ' it be midnight when they arrive at the foot of the mountain on the ridge of which several fire be light scarcely have they begin to ascend when they hear voice cry out ` be it you my child ' they answer together with the negro ` yes it be we ' and soon after perceive they mother and mary come towards they with

interweave with liana no object could be discern even at noon while the point of the neighbouring rock which project from the mountain command a few of the whole enclosure and of the distant ocean where sometimes we spy a vessel come from europe or return thither on this rock the two family assemble in the evening and enjoy in silence the freshness of the air the fragrance of the flower the murmur of the fountain and the last blended harmony of light and shade nothing could be more agreeable than the name which be bestow upon some of the charming retreat of this labyrinth that rock of which i be speak and from which my approach be discern at a considerable distance be call the discovery of friendship paul and virginium amidst they sport have plant a bamboo on that spot and whenever they see I come they hoist a little white handkerchief by way of signal of my approach as they have see a flag hoist on the neighbouring mountain at the sight of a vessel at sea the idea strike I of engrave a inscription upon the stalk of this reed whatever pleasure i have feel during my travels at the sight of a statue or monument of antiquity i have feel still more in reading of well write

expanse when dress would in limpid clearness or when tempest blow when the smooth current on its placid breast flow calm as my past moment we would to flow or when its troubled wave refuse to rest and seem the symbol of my present will we repast be succeed by the song and dance of the two young people virginia sing the happiness of pastoral life and the misery of those who be impel by avarice to cross the furious ocean rather than cultivate the earth and enjoy its peaceful bounty sometimes she perform a pantomime with paul in the manner of the negro the first language of man be pantomime it

representation the scene be generally place in a opening of the forest where such part of the wood as be penetrable form around we numerous arcade of foliage beneath which we be sheltered from the heat during the whole day but when the sun descend towards the horizon its ray break upon the trunk of the tree diverge amongst the shadow of the forest in strong line of light which produce the most sublime effect sometimes the whole of its broad disk appear at the end of a avenue spread one dazzling mass of brightness the foliage of the tree illuminate from beneath by its saffron beam glow with the lustre of the topaz and the emerald they brown and mossy trunk appear transform into column of antique bronze and the bird which have retire in silence to they leafy shades to pass the night surprise to see the radiance of a second morning hail the star of day with innumerable carol night soon overtake we during those rural entertainment but the purity of the air and the mildness of the climate admit of we sleep in the wood secure from the injury of the weather and no less secure from the molestation of robber at we return the follow day to we respective habitation we find they

hope that the storm be pass away accordingly in the evening the rain cease the trade-wind of the south pursue they ordinary course the tempestuous cloud be throw towards the north-east and the setting sun appear in the horizon virginium 's first wish be to visit the spot call she _ repose _ paul approach she with a timid air and offer she the assistance of he arm which she accept smile and they leave the cottage together the air be fresh and clear white vapor arise from the ridge of the mountain furrow here and there by the foam of the torrent which be now become dry the garden be altogether

the sentiment most dear to she at the end in a postscript virginium recommend particularly to paul 's care two kind of seed those of the violet and scabious she give he some instruction upon the nature of those plant and the spot most proper for they cultivation ` the first ' say she ` produce a little flower of a deep violet which love to hide itself beneath the bush but be soon discover by its delightful odour ' she desire those seed might be sow along the border of the fountain at the foot of she cocoa tree ` the scabious ' she add ` produce a beautiful flower of a pale blue and a black ground spot with white you might fancy it be in mourning and for this reason it be call the widow 's flower it delight in bleak spot beat by the wind ' she beg this might be sow upon the rock where she have speak to he for the last time and that for she sake he would henceforth give it the name of the farewell rock she have put those seed into a little purse the tissue of which be extremely simple but which appear above all price to paul when he perceive a p and a v intwine together and know that the beautiful hair which form the cipher be the hair of virginium the whole family listen with tear to the letter of that amiable and virtuous young woman she mother answer it in the name of the little society and desire she to remain or return as she think proper assure she that happiness have flee from they dwelling since she departure and that as for herself she be inconsolable paul also send she a long letter in which he assure she that he would arrange the garden in a manner agreeable to she taste and blend the plant of europe with those of africa he send she some fruit cull from the cocoa tree of the mountain which be now arrive at maturity : tell she that he would not add any more of the other seed of the island that the desire of see those production again might hasten she return he conjure she to comply without delay with the ardent wish of she family and above all with he own since he be unable to endure the pain of they separation with a careful hand paul sow the european seed particularly the violet and the scabious the flower of which seem to bear some analogy to the character and situation of virginium by whom they have be recommend : but whether they be injure by the voyage or whether the soil of this part of africa be unfavourable to they growth a very small number of they blow and none come to perfection meanwhile that envy which pursue human happiness spread report over the island which give great uneasiness to paul the person who have bring virginia 's letter assert that she be upon the point of be marry and name the nobleman of the court with whom she be go to be unite some even declare that she be already marry of which they be witness paul at first despise this report bring by one of those trade ship which often spread erroneous intelligence in they passage but some ill-natured person by they insulting pity lead he to give some degree of credit to this cruel intelligence besides he have see in the novel which he have lately read that perfidy be treat as a subject of pleasantry and know that those book be faithful representation of european manners he fear that the heart of virginium be corrupt and have forget its former engagement thus he acquirement only serve to render he miserable and what increase he apprehension be that several ship arrive from europe during the space of six month and not one bring any tiding of virginium this unfortunate young man with a heart tear by the most cruel agitation come often to visit I that i might confirm or banish he inquietude by my experience of the world i live as i have already tell you a league and a half from hence upon the bank of a little river which glide along the sloping mountain : there i lead a solitary life without wife child or slave after have enjoy and lose the rare felicity of live with a congenial mind the state of life which appear the least wretched be that of solitude it be remarkable that all those nation which have be render unhappy by they political opinion they manners or they form of government have produce numerous class of citizen altogether devote to solitude and celibacy such be the egyptian in they decline the greek of the lower empire and such in we day be the indian the chinese the modern greek the italian and most part of the eastern and southern nation of europe thus i pass my day far from mankind whom i wish to serve and by whom i have be persecute after have travel over many country of europe and some part of america and africa i at length pitch my tent in this thinly-peopled island allure by its mild temperature and its solitude a cottage which i build in the wood at the foot of a tree a little field which i cultivate with my own hand a river which glide before my door suffice for my want and for my pleasure i blend with those enjoyment that of some choose book which teach I to become better they make that world which i have abandon still contribute to my satisfaction they place before I picture of those passion which render its inhabitant so miserable and the comparison which i make between they destiny and my own lead I to feel a sort of negative happiness like a man whom shipwreck have throw upon a rock i contemplate from my solitude the storm which roll over the rest of the world and my repose seem more profound from the distant sound of the tempest i suffer myself to be lead calmly down the stream of time to the ocean of futurity which have no boundary while in the contemplation of the present harmony of nature i raise my soul towards its supreme author and hope for a more happy destiny in another state of existence although you do not descry my hermitage which be situate in the midst of a forest among that immense variety of object which this elevated spot present the grounds be dispose with particular beauty at least to one who like I love rather the seclusion of a home scene than great and extensive prospects the river which glide before my door pass in a straight line across the wood and appear like a long canal shaded by tree of all kind there be black date plum tree what we here call the narrow-leaved dodonea olive wood gum tree and the cinnamon tree while in some part the cabbage tree raise they naked column more than a hundred foot high crown at they summit with clustering leave and tower above the wood like one forest pile upon another liana of various foliage intertwine among the wood form arcade of flower and verdant canopy those tree for the most part shed aromatic odour of a nature so powerful that the garment of a traveller who have pass through the forest retain for several hour the delicious fragrance in the season when those tree produce they lavish blossom they appear as if cover with snow one of the principal ornament of we wood be the calbassium a tree not only distinguish for its beautiful tint of verdure but for other property which madame de la tour have describe in the follow sonnet write at one of she first visit to my hermitage : sonnet to the calbassium tree sublime calbassium luxuriant tree how soft the gloom thy bright-lined foliage throw while from thy pulp a healing balsam flow whose power the suffering wretch from pain can free my pensive footstep ever turn to thee since oft while muse on my lasting woe beneath thy flowery white bell i repose symbol of friendship dost thou seem to I for thus have friendship cast she soothing shade o'er my unsheltered bosom 's keen distress : thus seek to heal the wound which love have make and temper bleeding sorrow 's sharp excess ah not in vain she lend she balmy aid : the agony she can not cure be less towards the end of summer various kind of foreign bird hasten impel by a inexplicable instinct from unknown region and across immense ocean to gather the profuse grain of this island and the brilliancy of they expand plumage form a contrast to the tree embrown by the sun such among other be various kind of paroquet the blue pigeon call here the pigeon of holland and the wander and majestic white bird of the tropic which madame de la tour thus apostrophise : -- sonnet to the white bird of the tropic bird of the tropic thou who lov ` st to stray where thy long pinion sweep the sultry line or mark ` st the bound which torrid beam confine by thy avert course that shun the ray oblique enamor would of sublimer day : oft on yon cliff thy fold plume recline and drop those snowy feather indian twine to crown the warrior 's brow with honor gay

spring but i my long lose home no more shall hail the domestic inhabitant of we forest monkey sport upon the dark branch of the tree from which they be distinguish by they gray and greenish skin and they black visage some hang suspend by the tail and balance themselves in air other leap from branch to branch bear they young in they arm the murderous gun have never affright those peaceful child of nature you sometimes hear the warbling of unknown bird from the southern country repeat at a distance by the echo of the forest the river which run in foam cataract over a bed of rock reflect here and there upon its limpid water venerable mass of woody shade together with the sport of its happy inhabitant about a thousand pace from thence the river precipitate itself over several pile of rock and form in its fall a sheet of water smooth as crystal but which break at the bottom into frothy surge innumerable confused sound issue from those tumultuous water which scatter by the wind of the forest sometimes sink sometimes swell and send forth a hollow tone like the deep bell of a cathedral the air for ever renew by the circulation of the water fan the bank of that river with freshness and leave a degree of verdure notwithstanding the summer heat rarely find in this island even upon the summit of the mountain at some distance be a rock place far enough from the cascade to prevent the ear from be deafen by the noise of its water and sufficiently near for the enjoyment of they view they coolness and they murmur thither amidst the heat of summer madame de la tour margaret virginium paul and myself sometimes repair and dine beneath the shadow of the rock virginium who always direct she most ordinary action to the good of other never eat of any fruit without plant the seed or kernel in the ground ` from this ' say she ` tree will come which will give they fruit to some traveller or at least to some bird ' one day have eat of the papaw fruit at the foot of that rock she plant the seed soon after several papaw spring up amongst which be one that yield fruit this tree have rise but a little from the ground at the time of virginium 's departure but its growth be rapid in the space of two year it have gain twenty foot of height and the upper part of its stem be encircle with several layer of ripe fruit paul have wander to that spot be delighted to see that this lofty tree have arise from the small seed plant by he beloved friend but that emotion instantly give place to a deep melancholy at this evidence of she long absence the object which we see habitually do not remind we of the rapidity of life they decline insensibly with ourselves but those which we behold again after have for some year lose sight of they impress we powerfully with the idea of that swiftness with which the tide of we day flow on paul be no less overwhelmed and affect at the sight of this great papaw tree load with fruit than be the traveller when after a long absence from he own country he find not he contemporary but they child whom he leave at the breast and whom he see be become father of family paul sometimes think of hew down the tree which recall too sensibly the distract image of that length of time which have clasp since the departure of virginium sometimes contemplate it as a monument of she benevolence he kiss its trunk and apostrophise it in term of the most passionate regret and indeed i have myself gaze upon it with more emotion and more veneration than upon the triumphal arch of rome at the foot of this papaw i be always sure to meet with paul when he come into we neighborhood one day when i find he absorb in melancholy we have a conversation which i will relate to you if i do not weary you by my long digression perhaps pardonable to my age and my last friendship paul say to I ' i be very unhappy mademoiselle de la tour have now be go two year and two month and we have hear no tiding of she for eight month and two week she be rich and i be poor she have forget I i have a great mind to follow she i will go to france i will serve the king make a fortune and then mademoiselle de la tour 's aunt will bestow she niece upon I when i shall have become a great lord ` but my dear friend ' i answer ` have you not tell I that you be not of noble birth ' ` my mother have tell I so ' say paul ` as for myself i know not what noble birth mean ' ` obscure birth ' i reply ` in france shut out all access to great employment nor can you even be receive among any distinguished body of man ' ` how unfortunate i be ' resume paul ` every thing repulse I i be condemn to waste my wretched life in labor far from virginium ' and he heave a deep sigh ` since she relation ' he add ` will only give she in marriage to some one with a great name by the aid of study we become wise and celebrated i will fly then to study i will acquire science i will serve my country usefully by my attainment i shall be independent i shall become renowned and my glory will belong only to myself ' ` my son talent be still more rare than birth or riches and be undoubtedly a inestimable good of which nothing can deprive we and which every where conciliate public esteem but they cost dear : they be generally ally to exquisite sensibility which render they possessor miserable but you tell I that you would serve mankind he who from the soil which he cultivate draw forth one additional sheaf of corn serve mankind more than he who present they with a book ' ` oh she then ' exclaim paul ` who plant this papaw tree make a present to the inhabitant of the forest more dear and more useful than if she have give they a library ' and seize the tree in he arm he kiss it with transport ` ah i desire glory only ' he resume ` to confer it upon virginium and render she dear to the whole universe but you who know so much tell I if we shall ever be marry i wish i be at least learn enough to look into futurity virginium must come back what need have she of a rich relation she be so happy in those hut so beautiful and so well dress with a red handkerchief or flower round she head return virginium leave you palace you splendor return to these rock to the shade of we wood and we cocoa tree alas you be perhaps unhappy ' and he begin to weep ` my father conceal nothing from I if you can not tell I whether i shall marry virginium or no tell I at least if she still love I amidst those great lord who speak to the king and go to see she ' ` oh my dear friend ' i answer ' i be sure that she love you for several reason but above all because she be virtuous ' at those word he throw himself upon my neck in a transport of joy ` but what ' say he ` do you understand by virtue ' ` my son to you who support you family by you labor it need not be define virtue be a effort which we make for the good of other and with the intention of please god ' ` oh how virtuous then ' cry he ` be virginia virtue make she seek for riches that she might practice benevolence virtue lead she to forsake this island and virtue will bring she back ' the idea of she near return fire he imagination and he inquietude suddenly vanish virginium he be persuade have not write because she would soon arrive it take so little time to come from europe with a fair wind then he enumerate the vessel which have make a passage of four thousand five hundred league in less than three month and perhaps the vessel in which virginium have embark might not be longer than two ship builder be now so ingenious and sailor so expert he then tell I of the arrangement he would make for she reception of the new habitation he would build for she of the pleasure and surprise which each day should bring along with it when she be he wife he wife that hope be ecstasy ` at least my dear father ' say he ` you shall then do nothing more than you please virginium be rich we shall have a number of negro who will labor for you you shall always live with we and have no other care than to amuse and rejoice

virtue every thing overwhelm and distract I ' ` equal constant and invariable virtue ' i reply ` belong not to man ' in the midst of so many passion by which we be agitate we reason be disorder and

stretch out a friendly hand towards we and invite we to join they society when every thing else abandon we a good book be a good friend ' ` ah ' cry paul ' i stand in no need of book when virginium be here and she have study as little as I : but when she look at I and call I she friend it be impossible for I to be unhappy ' ` undoubtedly ' say i ` there be no friend so agreeable as a mistress by whom we be beloved there be in the gay grace of a woman a charm that dispel the dark phantom of reflection upon she face sit soft attraction and tender confidence what joy be not heighten in which she share what brow be not unbent by she smile what anger can resist she tear virginia will return with more philosophy than you and will be surprise not to find the garden finish : she who think of its establishment amidst the persecution of she aunt and far from she mother and from you ' the idea of virginium 's speedy return reanimate she lover 's courage and he resume he pastoral occupation happy amidst he toil in the reflection that they would find a termination so dear to the wish of he heart the 24th of December 1774 at break of day paul when he arise perceive a white flag hoist upon the mountain of discovery which be the signal of a vessel descry at sea he fly to the town in order to learn if this vessel bring any tiding of virginium and wait till the return of the pilot who have go as usual to visit the ship the pilot bring the governor information that the vessel be the saint geran of seven hundred ton command by a captain of the name of aubin that the ship be now four league out at sea and would anchor at port loui the following afternoon if the wind be favourable : at present there be a calm the pilot then remit to the governor a number of letter from france amongst which be one address to madame de la tour in the hand-writing of virginium paul seize upon the letter kiss it with transport place it in he bosom and fly to the plantation no sooner do he perceive from a distance the family who be wait he return upon the farewell rock than he wave the letter in the air without have the power to speak and instantly the whole family crowd round madame de la tour to hear it read virginium inform she mother that she have suffer much ill treatment from she aunt who after have in vain urge she to marry against she inclination have disinherit she and at length send she back at such a season of the year that she must probably reach the mauritius at the very period of the hurricane in vain she add she have endeavor to soften she aunt by represent what she owe to she mother and to the habit of she early year : she have be treat as a romantic girl whose head be turn by novel at present she say she could think of nothing but the transport of again see and embrace she beloved family and that she would have satisfy this dearest wish of she heart that very day if the captain would have permit she to embark in the pilot 's boat but that he have oppose she go on account of the distance from the shore and of a swell in the ocean notwithstanding it be a calm scarcely be the letter finish when the whole family transport with joy repeat ` virginium be arrive ' and mistress and servant embrace each other madame de la tour say to paul ` my son go and inform we neighbor of virginium 's arrival ' domingo immediately light a torch and he and paul bent they way towards my plantation it be about ten at night and i be go to extinguish my lamp when i perceive through the palisade of my hut a light in the wood i arise and have just dress myself when paul half wild and panting for breath spring on my neck cry ` come along come along virginium be arrive let we go to the port : the vessel will anchor at break of day ' we instantly set off as we be traverse the wood of the sloping mountain and be already on the road which lead from the shaddock grove to the port i hear some one walk behind we when the person who be a negro and who advance with hasty step have reach we i inquire from whence he come and whither he be go with such expedition he answer ' i come from that part of the island call golden dust and be send to the port to inform the governor that a ship from france have anchor upon the island of amber and fire gun of distress for the sea be very stormy ' have say this the man leave we and pursue he journey ` let we go ' say i to paul ` towards that part of the island and meet virginium it be only three league from hence ' accordingly we bent we course thither the heat be suffocate the moon have rise and it be encompass by three large black circle a dismal darkness shroud the sky but the frequent flake of lightning discover long chain of thick cloud gloomy low hung and heap together over the middle of the island after have roll with great rapidity from the ocean although we feel not a breath of wind upon the land as we walk along we think we hear peal of thunder but after listen more attentively we find they be the sound of distant cannon repeat by the echo those sound join to the tempestuous aspect of the heaven make I shudder i have little doubt that they be signal of distress from a ship in danger in half a hour the firing cease and i feel the silence more appalling than the dismal sound which have precede we hasten on without utter a word or daring to communicate we apprehension at midnight we arrive on the sea shore at that part of the island the billow break against the beach with a horrible noise cover the rock and the strand with they foam of a dazzling whiteness and blended with spark of fire by they phosphoric gleam we distinguish notwithstanding the darkness the canoe of the fisherman which they have draw far upon the sand near the shore at the entrance of a wood we see a fire round which several of the inhabitant be assemble thither we repair in order to repose ourselves till morning one of the circle related that in the afternoon he have see a vessel drive towards the island by the current that the night have hide it from he view and that two hour after sun-set he have hear the firing of gun in distress but that the sea be so tempestuous no boat could venture out that a short time after he think he perceive the glimmering of the watch-light on board the vessel which he fear by its have approach so near the coast have steer between the main land and the little island of amber mistake it for the point of endeavor near which the vessel pass in order to gain port loui if this be the case which however he could not affirm the ship he apprehend be in great danger another islander then inform we that he have frequently cross the channel which separate the isle of amber from the coast and which he have sound that the anchorage be good and that the ship would there be in as great security as if it be in harbor a third islander declare it be impossible for the ship to enter that channel which be scarcely navigable for a boat he assert that he have see the vessel at anchor beyond the isle of amber so that if the wind arise in the morning it could either put to sea or gain the harbor different opinion be state upon this subject which while those indolent creole calmly discuss paul and i observe a profound silence we remain on this spot till break of day when the weather be too hazy to admit of we distinguish any object at sea which be cover with fog all we could descry be a dark cloud which they tell we be the isle of amber at the distance of a quarter of a league from the coast we could only discern on this gloomy day the point of the beach where we stand and the peak of some mountain in the interior part of the island rise occasionally from amidst the cloud which hang around they at seven in the morning we hear the beat of drum in the wood and soon after the governor monsieur de la bourdonnais arrive on horseback follow by a detachment of soldier arm with musket and a great number of islander and black he range he soldier upon the beach and order they to make a general discharge which be no sooner do than we perceive a glimmering light upon the water which be instantly succeed by the sound of a gun we judge that the ship be at no great distance and run towards that part where we have see the light we now discern through the fog the hull and tackle of a large vessel and notwithstanding the noise of the wave we be near enough to hear the whistle of the boatswain at the helm and the shout of the mariner as soon as the saint geran perceive that we be enough to give she succor she continue to fire gun regularly at the interval of three minute monsieur de la bourdonnais cause great fire to be light at certain distance upon the strand and send to all the inhabitant of that neighborhood in search of provision plank cable and empty barrel a crowd of people soon arrive accompany by they negro load with provision and rig one of the most aged of the planter approach the governor say to he ` we have hear all night hoarse noise in the mountain and in the forest : the leaf of the tree be shake although there be no wind : the sea bird seek refuge upon the land : it be certain that all those sign announce a hurricane ' ` well my friend ' answer the governor ` we be prepare for it : and no doubt the vessel be also ' every thing indeed presage the near approach of the hurricane the center of the cloud in the zenith be of a dismal black while they skirt be fringe with a copper hue the air resound with the cry of the frigate bird the cur water and a multitude of other sea bird who notwithstanding the obscurity of the atmosphere hasten from all point of the horizon to seek for shelter in the island towards nine in the morning we hear on the side of the ocean the most terrific noise as if torrent of water mingle with thunder be roll down the steep of the mountain a general cry be hear of ` there be the hurricane ' and in one moment a frightful whirlwind scatter the fog which have cover the isle of amber and its channel the saint geran then present itself to we view she gallery crowd with people she yard and main topmast lay upon the deck she flag shiver with four cable at she head and one by which she be

surgeon to the governor who have show the most humane attention to paul and the whole family tell we that in order to cure that deep melancholy which have take possession of he mind we must allow he to do whatever he please without contradiction as the only means of conquer he inflexible silence i resolve to follow this advice the first use which paul make of he return strength be to absent himself from the plantation be determine not to lose sight of he i set out immediately and desire domingo to take some provision and accompany we paul 's strength and spirit seem renew as he descend the mountain he take the road of the shaddock grove and when he be near the church in the alley of bamboo he walk directly to the spot where he see some new-laid earth and there kneel down and raise up he eye to heaven he offer up a long prayer which appear to I a symptom of return reason since this mark of confidence in the supreme be show that he mind begin to resume its natural function domingo and i follow he example fall upon we knee and mingle we prayer with he when he arise he bent he way pay little attention to we towards the northern part of the island as we know that he be not only ignorant of the spot where the body of virginium be lay but even whether it have be snatch from the wave i ask he why he have offer up he prayer at the foot of those bamboo he answer ` we have be there so often ' he continue he course until we reach the border of the forest when night come on i prevail with he to take some nourishment and we sleep upon the grass at the foot of a tree the next day i think he seem disposed to trace back he step for after have gaze a considerable time upon the church of the shaddock grove with its avenue of bamboo stretch along the plain he make a motion as if he would return but suddenly plunge into the forest he direct he course to the north i judge what be he design from which i endeavor to dissuade he in vain at noon he arrive at that part of the island call the gold dust he rush to the seashore opposite to the spot where the saint geran perish at the sight of the isle of amber and its channel then smooth as a mirror he cry ` virginia oh my dear virginia ' and fall senseless domingo and myself carry he into the wood where we recover he with some difficulty he make a effort to return to the seashore but have conjure he not to renew he own anguish and ours by those cruel remembrance he take another direction during eight day he seek every spot where he have once wander with the companion of he childhood he trace the path by which she have go to intercede for the slave of the black river he gaze again upon the bank of the three peak where she have repose herself when unable to walk further and upon that part of the wood where they lose they way all those haunt which recall the inquietude the sport the repast the benevolence of she he love the river of the sloping mountain my house the neighbouring cascade the papaw tree she have plant the mossy downs where she love to run the opening of the forest where she use to sing call forth successively the tear of hopeless passion and those very echo which have so often resound they mutual shout of joy now only repeat those accent of despair ` virginia oh my dear virginia ' while he lead this savage and wander life he eye become sink and hollow he skin assume a yellow tint and he health rapidly decay convinced that present suffering be render more acute by the bitter recollection of past pleasure and that the passion gather strength in solitude i resolve to tear my unfortunate friend from those scene which recall the remembrance of he loss and to lead he to a more busy part of the island with this view i conduct he to the inhabit height of william which he have never visit and where agriculture and commerce ever occasion much bustle and variety a crowd of carpenter be employ in hew down the tree while other be saw plank carriage be pass and repass on the road numerous herd of ox and troops of horse be feed on those ample meadow over which a number of habitation be scatter on many spot the elevation of the soil be favourable to the culture of european tree : ripe corn wave its yellow sheaf upon the plain : strawberry plant flourish in the opening of the wood and hedge of rise bush along the road the freshness of the air by give a tension to the nerve be favourable to the european from those height situate near the middle of the island and surround by extensive forest you could neither discern port loui the church of the shaddock grove nor any other object which could recall to paul the remembrance of virginium even the mountain which appear of various shape on the side of port loui present nothing to the eye from those plain but a long promontory stretch itself in a straight and perpendicular line from whence arise lofty pyramid of rock on the summit of which the cloud repose to those scene i conduct paul and keep he continually in action walk with he in rain and sunshine night and day and contrive that he should lose himself in the depths of forest lead he over untilled grounds and endeavor by violent fatigue to divert he mind from its gloomy meditation and change the course of he reflection by he ignorance of the path where we wander but the soul of a lover find everywhere the trace of the object beloved the night and the day the calm of solitude and the tumult of crowd time itself while it cast the shade of oblivion over so many other remembrance in vain would tear that tender and sacred recollection from the heart which like the needle when touch by the loadstone however it may have be force into agitation it be no sooner leave to repose than it turn to the pole by which it be attract when i inquire of paul while we wander amidst the plain of william ` where be we now go ' he point to the north and say ` yonder be we mountain let we return ' upon the whole i find that every means i take to divert he melancholy be fruitless and that no resource be leave but a attempt to combat he passion by the argument which reason suggest i answer he ` yes there be the mountain where once dwell you beloved virginium and this be the picture you give she and which she hold when die to she heart that heart which even in she last moment only beat for you ' i then give paul the little picture which he have give virginium at the border of the cocoa tree fountain at this sight a gloomy joy overspread he look he eagerly seize the picture with he feeble hand and hold it to he lip he oppressed bosom seem ready to burst with emotion and he eye be fill with tear which have no power to flow ` my son ' say i ` listen to he who be you friend who be the friend of virginium and who in the bloom of you hope endeavor to fortify you mind against the unforeseen accident of life what do you deplore with so much bitterness you own misfortune or those of virginium you own misfortune be indeed severe you have lose the most amiable of woman : she who sacrifice she own interest to yours who prefer you to all that fortune could bestow and consider you as the only recompense worthy of she virtue but might not this very object from whom you expect the purest happiness have prove to you a source of the most cruel distress she have return poor disinherited and all you could henceforth have partake with she be you labor : while render more delicate by she education and more courageous by she misfortune you would have behold she every day sink beneath she effort to share and soften you fatigue have she bring you child this would only have serve to increase she inquietude and you own from the difficulty of sustain you aged parent and you infant family you will tell I there would have be reserve to you a happiness independent of fortune that of protect a beloved object which attach itself to we in proportion to its helplessness that you pain and suffering would have serve to endear you to each other and that you passion would have gather strength from you mutual misfortune undoubtedly virtuous love can shed a charm over pleasure which be thus mingle with bitterness but virginium be no more yet those person still live whom next to yourself she hold most dear she mother and you own whom you inconsolable affliction be bend with sorrow to the grave place you happiness as she do hers in afford they succor and why deplore the fate of virginium virginium still exist there be he assure a region in which virtue receive its reward virginium now be happy ah if from the abode of angel she could tell you as she do when she bid you farewell ' o paul life be but a trial i be faithful to the law of nature love and virtue heaven find i have fulfil my duty and have snatch I for ever from all the misery i might have endure myself and all i might have feel for the misery of other i be place above the reach of all human evil and you pity I i be become pure and unchangeable as a particle of light and you would recall I to the darkness of human life o paul o my beloved friend recollect those day of happiness when in the morning we feel the delightful sensation excite by the unfold beauty of nature when we gaze upon the sun gilding the peak of those rock and then spread he ray over the bosom of the forest ` how exquisite be we emotion while we enjoy the glowing color of the opening day the odour of we shrub the concert of we bird now at the source of beauty from which flow all that be delightful upon earth my soul intuitively see taste hear touch what before she could only be make sensible of through the medium of we weak organ ah what language can describe those shore of eternal bliss which i inhabit for ever all that infinite power and celestial bounty can confer that harmony which result from friendship with numberless being exult in the same felicity we enjoy in unmixed perfection support then the trial which be allot you that you may heighten the happiness of you virginium by love which will know no termination by hymeneal which will be immortal there i will calm you regret i will wipe away you tear oh my beloved friend my husband raise you thought towards infinite duration and bear the evil of a moment ' my own emotion choke my utterance paul look 's at I stedfastly cry ` she be no more she be no more ' and a long fainting fit succeed that melancholy exclamation when restore to himself he say ` since death be a good and since virginium be happy i would die too and be unite to virginium ' thus the motive of consolation i have offer only serve to nourish he despair i be like a man who attempt to save a friend sinking in the midst of a flood and refuse to swim sorrow have overwhelm he soul alas the misfortune of early year prepare man for the struggle of life : but paul have never know adversity i lead he back to he own dwelling where i find he mother and madame de la tour in a state of increase languor but margaret droop most those lively character upon which light affliction make a small impression be least capable of resist great calamity ' o my good friend ' say margaret ` me-thought last night i see virginium dress in white amidst delicious bower and garden she say to I ' i enjoy the most perfect happiness ' and then approach paul with a smile air she bear he away while i struggle to retain my son i feel that i myself be quit the earth and that i follow he with inexpressible delight i then wish to bid my friend farewell when i see she be hasten after I with mary and domingo but what seem most strange be that madame de la tour have this very night have a dream attend with the same circumstance ' ` my dear friend ' i reply ` nothing i believe happen in this world without the permission of god dream sometimes foretell the truth ' madame de la tour related to I she dream which be exactly similar and as i have never observe in either of those person any propensity to superstition i be strike with the singular coincidence of they dream which i have little doubt would soon be realize what i expect take place paul die two month after the death of virginium whose name dwelt upon he lip even in he expire moment eight day after the death of she son margaret see she last hour approach with that serenity which virtue only can feel she bid madame de la tour the most tender farewell ` in the hope ' she say ` of a sweet and eternal reunion death be the most precious good ' add she ` and we ought to desire it if life be a punishment we should wish for its termination if it be a trial we should be thankful that it be short ' the governor take care of domingo and mary who be no longer able to labor and who survive they mistress but a short time as for poor fidele he pine to death at the period he lose he master i conduct madame de la tour to my dwelling and she bear she calamity with elevated fortitude she have endeavor to comfort paul and margaret till they last moment as if she herself have no agony to bear when they be no more she use to talk of they as of beloved friend from whom she be not distant she survive they but one month far from reproach she aunt for those affliction she have cause she benign spirit pray to god to pardon she and to appease that remorse which the consequence of she cruelty would probably awaken in she breast i hear by successive vessel which arrive from europe that this unnatural relation haunt by a troubled conscience accuse herself continually of the untimely fate of she lovely niece and the death of she mother and become at interval bereft of she reason she relation whom she hate take the direction of she fortune after shut she up as a lunatic though she possess sufficient use of she reason to feel all the pang of she dreadful situation and die at length in agony of despair the body of paul be place by the side of he virginium at the foot of the same shrub and on that hallowed spot the remains of they tender mother and they faithful servant be lay no marble cover the turf no inscription record they virtue but they memory be engraven upon we heart in character which be indelible and surely if those pure spirit still take a interest in what pass upon earth they love to wander beneath the roof of these dwelling which be inhabit by industrious virtue to console the poor who complain of they destiny to cherish in the heart of lover the sacred flame of fidelity to inspire a taste for the blessing of nature the love of labor and the dread of riches the voice of the people which be often silent with regard to those monument raise to flatter the pride of king have give to some part of this island name which will immortalize the loss of virginium near the isle of amber in the midst of sandbank be a spot call the pass of saint geran from the name of the vessel which there perish the extremity of that point of land which be three league distant and half cover by the wave and which the saint geran could not double on the night precede the huricane be call the cape of misfortune and before we at the end of the valley be the bay of the tomb where virginium be find bury in the sand as if the wave have seek to restore she corpse to she family that they might render it the last sad duty on those shore of which she innocence have be the ornament ye faithful lover who be so tenderly unite unfortunate mother beloved family those wood which sheltered you with they foliage those fountain which flow for you those hillock upon which you repose still deplore you loss no one have since presume to cultivate that desolate ground or repair those fall hut you goat be become wild you orchard be destroy you bird be flee and nothing be hear but the cry of the sparrowhawk who skim around the valley of rock as for myself since i behold you no
