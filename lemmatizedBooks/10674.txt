produce by juliet sutherland daniel ray and pg distribute proofreader how to use you mind a psychology of study be a manual for the use of student and teacher in the administration of supervised study by harry d kitson phd professor of psychology indiana university 1921 preface to the second edition the kindly reception accord to the first edition of this book have confirm the author in he conviction that such a book be need and have tempt he to bestow additional labor upon it the chief change consist in the addition of two new chapter active imagination and how to develop interest in a subject the division into two part of the unwieldy chapter on memory the addition of reading and exercise at the end of each chapter the preparation of a analytical table of contents the correction of the bibliography to date the addition of a index and some recasting of phraseology in the interest of clearness and emphasis the author gratefully acknowledge the constructive suggestion of reviewer and other who have use the book and hope that he have profit by they in this revision hdk April 1 1921 preface to the first edition educational leader be see with increase clearness the necessity of teaching student not only the subject-matter of study but also method of study teacher be begin to see that student waste a vast amount of time and form many harmful habit because they do not know how to use they mind the recognition of this condition be take the form of the movement toward supervised study which attempt to acquaint the student with principle of economy and directness in use he mind it be generally agree that there be certain trick which make for mental efficiency consist of method of apperceive fact method of review device for arrange work some be the fruit of psychological experimentation other be derive from experience many of they can be impart by instruction and it be for the purpose of systematize these and make they available for student that this book be prepare the evil of unintelligent and unsupervised study be evident to all who have any connection with modern education they pervade the entire educational structure from kindergarten through college in college they be especially apparent in the case of freshman who in addition to the numerous difficulty incident to entrance into the college world suffer peculiarly because they do not know how to attack the difficult subject of the curriculum in recognition of these condition special attention be give at the university of chicago toward supervision of study all freshman in the school of commerce and administration of the university be give a course in method of study in which practical discussion and demonstration be give regard the way of study the freshman subject in addition to the group-work case present special feature be give individual attention for it must be admit that while certain difficulty be common to all student there be individual case that present peculiar phase and these can be serve only by personal consultation these personal consultation be expensive both in time and patience for it frequently happen that the mental habit of a student must be thoroughly reconstruct and this require much time and attention but the result well repay the effort a valuable accessory to such individual supervision over student have be find in the use of psychological test which have be describe by the author in a monograph entitle the scientific study of the college student -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : princeton university press -rrb- but the college be not the most strategic point at which to administer guidance in method of study such training be even more acceptably give in the high school and grade here habit of mental application be largely set and it be of the utmost importance that they be set right for the sake of the welfare of the individual and of the institution of higher education that receive they later another reason for incorporate training in method of study into secondary and elementary school be that more individual will be help inasmuch as the eliminative process have not yet reach its culmination in high school where systematic supervision of study be a feature class be usually conduct in method of study and it be hope that this book will meet the demand for a text-book for such class the material be well within the reach of high school student in high school where instruction in method of study be give as part of a course in elementary psychology the book should also prove useful inasmuch as it give a summary of psychological principle relate to the cognitive process in the grade the book can not be put into the hand of the pupil but it should be master by the teacher and apply in she supervise and teach activity embody as it do the result of research in educational psychology it should prove especially suitable for use in teacher ' reading circle where a concise presentation of the fact regard the psychology of the learning process be desire there be another group of student who need training in method of study brain worker in business and industry feel deeply the need of greater mental efficiency and seek eagerly for means to attain it they earnestness in this search be evidence by the success of various system for the training of memory will and other mental trait further evidence be find in the effort of many corporation to maintain school and class for the intellectual improvement of they employee to all such the author offer the work with the hope that it may be useful in direct they toward greater mental efficiency in course in method of study in which the book be use as a class-text the instructor should lay emphasis not upon memorization of the fact in the book but upon the application of they in study he should expect to see parallel with progress through the book improvement in the mental ability of the student specific problem may well be arrange on the basis of the subject of the curriculum and student should be urge to utilize the suggestion immediately the subject treat in the book be those which the author have find in he experience with college student to constitute the most frequent source of difficulty and under these condition the sequence of topic follow in the book have seem most favorable for presentation with other group of student however another sequence of topic may be find desirable if so the order of topic may be change for example in case the chapter on brain action be find to presuppose more physiological knowledge than that possess by the student it may be omit or may be use merely for reference when enlightenment be desire upon some of the physiological description in later chapter likewise the chapter deal with intellectual difficulty of college student may be omit with non-collegiate group the heavy obligation of the author to a number of writer will be apparent to one familiar with the literature of theoretical and educational psychology no attempt be make to render specific acknowledgment but special mention should be make of the large draught make upon the two book by professor stile which treat so helpfully of the bodily relation of the student these book contain so much good sense and scientific information that they should receive a prominent place among the book recommend to student thanks be due to professor edgar jame swift and charle scribner 's son for permission to use a figure from mind in the making and to jb lippincott company for adaptation of cut from villiger 's brain and spinal cord the author gratefully acknowledge helpful suggestion from professor jame r angell charle h judd and c judson herrick who have read the greater part of the manuscript and have comment upon it to its betterment the obligation refer however not only to the immediate preparation of this work but also to the encouragement which for several year the author have receive from these scientist first as student later as colleague the author chicago September 25 1916 contents chapter i intellectual problem of the college freshman number variety lecture method

college course you be take a step that may completely revolutionize you life you be face new situation vastly different from any you have previously meet they be also of great variety such as find a place to eat and sleep regulate you own finances inaugurate a new social life form new friendship and develop in body and mind the problem connect with mental development will engage you chief attention you be now go to use you mind more actively than ever before and should survey some of the intellectual difficulty before plunge into the fight perhaps the first difficulty you will encounter be the substitution of the lecture for the class recitation to which you be accustom in high school this substitution require that you develop a new technic of learn for the mental process involve in a oral recitation be different from those use in listen to a lecture the lecture system imply that the lecturer have a fund of knowledge about a certain field and have organize this knowledge in a form that be not duplicated in the literature of the subject the manner of presentation then be unique and be the only means of secure the knowledge in just that form as soon as the word have leave the mouth of the lecturer they cease to be accessible to you such condition require a unique mental attitude and unique mental habit you will be oblige in the first place to maintain sustained attention over long period of time the situation be not like that in reading in which a temporary lapse of attention may be remedy by turn back and reread in listen to a lecture you be oblige to catch the word on the fly accordingly you must develop new habit of pay attention you will also need to develop a new technic for memorize especially for memorize thing hear as a partial aid in this and also for purpose of organize material receive in lecture you will need to develop ability to take note this be a process with which you have heretofore have little to do it be a most important phase of college life however and will repay earnest study another characteristic of college study be the vast amount of reading require instead of use a single text-book for each course you may use several they may cover great historical period and represent the idea of many man in view of the amount of read assign you will also be oblige to learn to read faster no longer will you have time to dawdle sleepily through the page of easy text you will have to cover perhaps fifty or a hundred page of knotty reading every day accordingly you must learn to handle book expeditiously and to comprehend quickly in fact economy must be you watchword throughout a german lesson in high school may cover thirty or forty line a day require a hour 's preparation a german assignment in college however may cover four or five or a dozen page require hard work for two or three hour you should be warn also that college demand not only a greater quantity but also a higher quality of work when you be a high school student the world expect only a high school student 's accomplishment of you now you be a college student however and you intellectual responsibility have increase the world regard you now as a person of considerable scholastic attainment and expect more of you than before in academic term this mean that in order to attain a grade of 95 in college you will have to work much harder than you do for that grade in high school for here you have not only more difficult subject-matter but also keener competition for the first place in high school you may have be the brightest student in you class in college however you encounter the brightest student from many school if you merit be go to stand out prominently therefore you must work much harder you work from now on must be of better quality not the least of the perplexity of you life as a college student will arise from the fact that no daily schedule be arrange for you the only time definitely assign for you work be the fifteen hour a week more or less spend in the class-room the rest of you schedule must be arrange by yourself this be a real task and will require care and think if you work be to be do with greatest economy of time and effort this brief survey complete the catalogue of problem of mental development that will vex you most in adjust you method of study to college condition in order to make this adjustment you will be oblige to form a number of new habit indeed as you become more and more expert as a student you will see that the whole process resolve itself into one of habit-formation for while a college education have two phase -- the acquisition of fact and the formation of habit -- it be the latter which be the more important many of the fact that you learn will be forget many will be outlaw by time but the habit of study you form will be permanent possession they will consist of such thing as method of grasp fact method of reasoning about fact and of concentrate attention in acquire these habit you must have some material upon which you may concentrate you attention and it will be supply by the subject of the curriculum you will be ask for instance to write innumerable theme in course in english composition not for the purpose of enrich the world 's literature nor for the delectation of you english instructor but for the sake of help you to form habit of forceful expression you will be ask to enter the laboratory and perform numerous experiment not to discover hitherto unknown fact but to obtain practice in scientific procedure and to learn how to seek knowledge by yourself the curriculum and the faculty be the means but you yourself be the agent in the educational process no matter how good the curriculum or how renowned the faculty you can not be educate without the most vigorous effort on you part banish the thought that you be here to have knowledge pump into you to acquire a education you must establish and maintain not a passive attitude but a active attitude when you go to the gymnasium to build up a good physique the physical director do not tell you to hold yourself limp and passive while he pump you arm and leg up and down rather he urge you to put forth effort to exert yourself until you be tire only by so do can you develop physical power this principle hold true of mental development learning be not a process of passive soaking-in it be a matter of vigorous effort and the harder you work the more powerful you become in secure a college education you be you own master in the development of physical prowess you be well aware of the importance of do everything in good form in such sport as swimming and hurdle speed and grace depend primarily upon it the same principle hold true in the development of the mind the most serviceable mind be that which accomplish result in the shortest time and with least waste motion take every precaution therefore to rid yourself of all superfluous and impede method strive for the development of good form in study especially be this necessary at the start now be the time when you be lay the foundation for you mental achievement in college keep a sharp lookout then at every point to see that you build into the foundation only those material and that workmanship which will support a masterly structure reading and exercise note -- number in parenthesis refer to complete citation in bibliography at end of book reading : fulton -lrb- 5 -rrb- lockwood -lrb- 11 -rrb- exercise 1 list concrete problem that have newly come to you since you arrival upon the campus exercise 2 list in order the difficulty that confront you in prepare you daily lesson exercise 3 prepare a work schedule similar to that provide by the form in chart i specify the subject with which you will be occupy at each period exercise 4 try to devise some way of register the effectiveness with which you carry out you schedule suggestion be contain in the summary : disposition of -lrb- 1 -rrb- as plan -lrb- 2 -rrb- as spend to divide the number of hour waste by 24 will give a partial index of efficiency chapter ii note-taking most educate people find occasion at some time or other to take note although this be especially true of college student they have little success as any college instructor will testify student as a rule do not realize that there be any skill involve in take note not until examination time arrive and they try vainly to labor through a maze of scribble do they realize that there must be some system in note-taking a careful examination of note-taking show that there be rule or principle which when follow have much to do with increase ability in study one criterion that should guide in the preparation of note be the use to which they will be put if this be keep in mind many blunder will be save note may be use in three way : as material for direct each day 's study for cram and for permanent professional use thus a note-book may be a thing of far-reaching value note you take now as a student may be valuable year hence in professional life recognition of this will help you in the preparation of you note and will determine many time how they should be prepare the chief situation in college which require note-taking be lecture library reading and laboratory work accordingly the subject will be consider under these three head lecture note -- when take note on a lecture there be two extreme that present themselves to take exceedingly full note or to take almost no note one can err in either direction true on first thought entire stenographic report of lecture appear desirable but second thought will show that they may be dispense with not only without loss but with much gain the most obvious objection be that too much time would be consume in transcribe short-hand note another be that much of the material in a lecture be undesirable for permanent possession the instructor repeat much for the sake of emphasis he multiply illustration not important in themselves but important for the sake of stress he point you do not need these illustration in written form however for once the point be make you rarely need to depend upon the illustration for its retention a still more cogent objection be that if you occupy you attention with the task of copy the lecture verbatim you do not have time to think but become merely a automatic recording machine experience stenographer say that they form the habit of record so automatically that they fail utterly to comprehend the meaning of what be say you as a student can not afford to have you attention so distract from the meaning of the lecture therefore reduce you classroom write to a minimum probably the chief reason why student be so eager to secure full lecture note be that they fear to trust they memory such fear should be put at rest for you mind will retain fact if you pay close attention and make logical association during the time of impression keep you mind free then to work upon the subject-matter of the lecture debate mentally with the speaker question he statement compare they with you own experience or with the result of you study ask yourself frequently be that true the essential thing be to maintain a attitude of mental activity and to avoid anything that will reduce this and make you passive do not think of yourself as a vat into which the instructor pump knowledge regard yourself rather as a active force quick to perceive and to comprehend mean deliberate in acceptance and firm in retention after observe the stress lay throughout this book upon the necessity for logical association you will readily see that the key-note to note-taking be let you note represent the logical progression of think in the lecture strive above all else to secure the skeleton -- the framework upon which the lecture be hang a lecture be a logical structure and the form in which it be present be the outline this outline then be you chief concern in the case of some lecture it be a easy matter the lecturer may place the outline in you hand beforehand may present it on the black-board or may give it orally some lecturer too present they material in such clear-cut division that the outline be easily follow other however be very difficult to follow in this regard in arrange a outline you will find it wise to adopt some device by which the part will stand out prominently and the progression of thought will be indicate with proper subordination of title adopt some system at the beginning of you college course and use it in all you note the system here give may serve as a model use first the roman numeral then capital then arabic numeral : i ii a b 1 2 a b -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- b -rrb- in conclude this discussion of lecture note you should be urge to make good use of you note after they be take first glance over they as soon as possible after the lecture inasmuch as they will then be fresh in you mind you will be able to recall almost the entire lecture you will also be able to supply miss part from memory some student make it a rule to reduce all class-note to typewritten form soon after the lecture this be a excellent practice but be rather expensive in time in addition to this after-class review you should make a second review of you note as the first step in the preparation of the next day 's lesson this will connect up the lesson with each other and will make the course a unified whole instead of a series of disconnect part too often a course exist in a student 's mind as a series of separate discussion and he see only the horizon of a single day this condition might be represent by a series of disconnect link : o o o o o a summary of each day 's lesson however precede the preparation for the next day forge new link and weld they all together into a unbroken chain : oooooooooo a method that have be find helpful be to use a double-page system of notetake use the left-hand page for the bare outline with largest division and the right-hand page for the detail this device make the note-book readily available for hasty review or for more extended study reading note -- the question of full or scanty note arise in read note as in lecture note in general you note should represent a summary in you own word of the author 's discussion not a duplication of it student sometimes acquire the habit of read single sentence at a time then of write they down think that by make a exact copy of the book they be play safe this be a pernicious practice it spoil continuity of thought and application furthermore isolate sentence mean little and fail grossly to represent the real thought of the author a better way be to read through a entire paragraph or section then close the book and reproduce in you own word what you have read next take you summary and compare with the original text to see that you have really grasp the point this procedure will be beneficial in several way it will encourage continuous concentration of attention to a entire argument it will help you to preserve relative emphasis of part it will lead you to regard thought and not word -lrb- you be undoubtedly familiar with the state of mind wherein you find yourself read merely word and not follow the thought -rrb- lastly material study in this way be remembered longer than material read scrappily in short such a method of read make not only for good memory but for good mental habit of all kind in all you reading hold to the conception of yourself as a thinker not a sponge remember you do not need to accept unqualifiedly everything you read a worthy ideal for every student to follow be express in the motto carve on the wall of the great reading-room of the harper memorial library at the university of chicago : read not to contradict nor to believe but to weigh and consider ibsen bluntly state the same thought : do not read to swallow read to choose for ` tis but to see what one have use for ask yourself when begin a print discussion what be i look for what be the author go to talk about often this will be indicate in topical heading keep it in the background of you mind while reading and search for the answer then when you have read the necessary portion close the book and summarize to see if the author furnish what you seek in short always read for a purpose formulate problem and seek they solution in this way will there be direction in you reading and you thought this discussion of read note have turn into a essay on how to read and you must be convince by this time that there be much to learn in this respect so much that we may profitably spend more time in discuss it every book you take up should be open with some preliminary ceremony this do not refer to the physical operation of open a new book but to the mental operation in general take the follow step : 1 observe the title see exactly what field the book attempt to cover 2 observe the author 's name if you be to use he book frequently discover he position in the field remember you be go to accept he as authority and you should know he status you may be tell this on the title-page or you may have to consult who be who or the biographical dictionary 3 glance over the preface under some circumstance you should read it carefully if you be go to refer to the book very often make friend with the author let he introduce himself to you this he will do in the preface observe the date of publication also in order to get a idea as to the recency of the material 4 glance over the table of contents if you be very familiar with the field and the table of contents be outline in detail you might advantageously study it and dispense with read the book on the other hand if you be go to consult the book only briefly you might find it necessary to study the table of contents in order to see the relation of the part you read to the entire work 5 use the index intelligently it may save you much time you will have much to do throughout you college course with the making of bibliography that be with the compilation of list of book bear upon special topic you may have bibliography give you in some of you course or you may be ask to compile you own under all circumstance prepare they with the greatest care be scrupulous in give reference there be a standard form for refer to book and periodical as follow : cr henderson industrial insurance -lrb- 2d ed chicago : the university of chicago press 1912 -rrb- p 321 si curti the place of sacrifice biblical world vol xxi -lrb- 1902 -rrb- p 248 _ ff _ laboratory note -- the form for laboratory note vary with the science and be usually prescribe by the instructor report of experiment be usually write up in the order : object apparatus method result conclusion when detail instruction be give by the instructor follow they accurately pay special attention to neatness instructor say that the greatest fault with laboratory note-book be lack of neatness this react upon the instructor cause he much trouble in correct the note-book the result annoyance frequently prejudice he against he will against the student it be safe to assert that you will materially increase you chance of a good grade in a laboratory course by the preparation of a neat note-book the key-note of the twentieth century be economy the tendency in all line be toward the elimination of waste college student should adopt this aim in the regulation of they study affair and there be much opportunity for apply it in note-taking so far the discussion have have to do with the _ content _ of the note-book but _ its form _ be equally important much may be do by utilization of mechanical device to save time and energy first write in ink pencil mark blur badly and become illegible in a few month remember you may be use the notebook twenty year hence therefore make it durable second write plainly this injunction ought to be superfluous for common sense tell we that write which be illegible can not be read even by the writer once it have grow cold third take care in form sentence do not make you note consist simply of separate scrappy jotting true it be difficult under stress to form complete sentence the great temptation be to jot down a word here and there and trust to luck or a indulgent memory to supply the context at some later time a little experience however will quickly demonstrate the futility of such hope therefore strive to form sensible phrase and to make the part of the outline cohere apply the principle of english composition to the preparation of you note-book a fourth question concern size and shape of the note-book these feature depend partly upon the nature of the course and partly upon individual taste it be often convenient and practicable to keep the note for all course in a single note-book man find it advantageous to use a small note-book of a size that can be carry in the coat pocket and study at odd moment a fifth question of a mechanical nature be which be preferable bind or loose-leaf note-book generally the latter will be find more desirable leaf be easily insert and the section be easily file on completion of a course it go without say that the manner in which note be to be take will be determine by many factor such as the nature of individual course the wish of instructor personal taste and habit nevertheless there be certain principle and practice which be adaptable to nearly all condition and it be these that we have discuss remember note-taking be one of the habit you be to form in college see that the habit be start rightly adopt a good plan at the start and adhere to it you may be encourage too with the thought that facility in note-taking will come with practice note-taking be a art and as you practice you will develop skill we have note some of the most obvious and immediate benefit derive from well-prepared note consist of economy of time ease of review ease of permanent retention there be other benefit however which though less obvious be of far greater importance these be the permanent effect upon the mind habit of correct thinking be the chief result of correct note-taking as you develop in this particular ability you will find corresponding improvement in you ability to comprehend and assimilate idea to retain and reproduce fact and to reason with thoroughness and independence reading and exercise reading : adam -lrb- 1 -rrb- chapter viii dearborn -lrb- 2 -rrb- chapter ii kerfoot -lrb- 10 -rrb- seward -lrb- 17 -rrb- exercise 1 contrast the taking of note from reading and from lecture exercise 2 make a outline of this chapter exercise 3 make a outline of some lecture chapter iii brain action during study though most people understand more or less vaguely that the brain act in some way during study exact knowledge of the nature of this action be not general as you will be greatly assist in understand mental process by such knowledge we shall briefly examine the brain and its connection it will be manifestly impossible to inquire into its nature very minutely but by means of a description you will be able to secure some conception of it and thus will be able better to control the mental process which it underlie to the naked eye the brain be a large jelly-like mass enclose in a bony cover about one-fourth of a inch thick call the skull inside the skull it be protect by a thick membrane at its base emerge the spinal cord a long strand of nerve fiber extend down the spine for most of its length the cord be about as large around as you little finger but it taper at the lower end from it at right angle throughout its length branch out thirty-one pair of fibrous nerve which radiate to all part of the body the brain and spinal cord with all its ramification be know as the nervous system you see now that though we start with the statement that the mind be intimately connect with the brain we must now enlarge we statement and say it be connect with the entire nervous system it be therefore to the nervous system that we must turn we attention although to the naked eye the nervous system be apparently make up of a number of different kind of material still we see when we turn we microscope upon it that its part be structurally the same reduce to lowest term the nervous system be find to be compose of minute unit of structure call nerve-cell or neurone each of these look like a string fray out at both end with a bulge somewhere along its length the nervous system be make up of million of these little cell pack together in various combination and distribute throughout the body some of the neurone be as long as three foot other measure but a fraction of a inch in length we do not know exactly how the mind that part of we which feel reason and will be connect with this mass of cell call the nervous system we do know however that every time anything occur in the mind there be a change in some part of the nervous system apply this fact to study it be obvious that when you be perform any of the operation of study memorize foreign vocabulary make arithmetical calculation reasoning out problem in geometry you be make change in you nervous system the question before we then be what be the nature of these change accord to present knowledge the action of the nervous system be best conceive as a form of chemical change that spread among the nerve-cell we call this commotion the nervous current it be very rapid move faster than one hundred foot a second and run along the cell in much the same way as a spark run along a train of gunpowder it be important to note that neurone never act singly they always act in group the nervous current passing from neurone to neurone it be think that the most important change in the nervous system do not occur within the individual neurone but at the point where they join with each other this point of connection be call the synapse and although we do not understand its exact nature it may well be picture as a valve that govern the passage of the nervous current from neurone to neurone at time of birth most of the valve be close only a few be open mainly those connect with the vegetative process such as breathing and digestion but as the individual be play upon by the object of the environment the valve open to the passage of the nervous current with increase use they become more and more permeable and thus learn be the process of make easier the passage of the nervous current from one neurone to another we shall secure further light upon the action of the nervous system if we examine some of the property belong to nerve-cell the first one be _ impressibility _ nerve-cell be very sensitive to impression from the outside if you have ever have the dentist touch a expose nerve you know how extreme this sensitivity be naturally such a property be very important in education for have we not the power to receive impression from the outside world we should not be able to acquire knowledge we should not even be able to perceive danger and remove ourselves from harm if we compare a man 's body to a building call the steel frame-work he skeleton and the furnace and power station he digestive organ and lung the nervous system would include with other thing the thermometer heat regulator electric button door-bell valve-opener -- the part of the building in short which be specifically design to respond to influence of the environment the second property of nerve-cell which be important in study be _ conductivity _ as soon as a neurone be stimulate at one end it communicate its excitement by means of the nervous current to the next neurone or to neighbor neurone just as a electric current might pass along one wire thence to another and along it to a third so the nervous current pass from neurone to neurone as might be expect the two function of impressibility and conductivity be aid by such a arrangement of the nerve-cell that the nervous current may pass over definitely lay pathway these system of pathway will be describe in a later paragraph the third property of nerve-cell which be important in study be _ modifiability _ that be impression make upon the nerve-cell be retain most living tissue be modifiable to some extent the feature of the face be modifiable and if one habitually assume a peevish expression it become after a time permanently fix the nervous system however possess the power of modifiability to a marked degree even a single impression sufficing to make striking modification this be very important in study be the basis for the retentive power of the mind have examine the action of the nervous system in its simplicity we have now to examine the way in which the part of the nervous system be combine we shall be help if we keep to the conception of it as a aggregation of system or group of pathway some of these we shall attempt to trace out begin with those at the outermost part of the body we find they located in the sense-organ not only within the traditional five but also within the muscle tendon joint and internal organ of the body such as the heart and digestive organ in all these place we find end of neurone which converge at the spinal cord and travel to the brain they be call sensory neurone and they function be to carry message inward to the brain thus the brain represent in great part a central receive station for impression from the outside world the nerve-cell carry message from the various part of the body terminate in particular area thus a area in the back part of the brain receive message from the eye another area near the top of the brain receive message from the skin these area be quite clearly mark out and may be study in detail by means of the accompany diagram there be another large group of nerve-cell which when trace out be find to have one terminal in the brain and the other in the muscle throughout the body the area in the brain where these neurone emerge be near the top of the brain in the area marked _ motor _ on the diagram from here the fiber travel down through the spinal cord and out to the muscle the nerve-cell in this group be call motor neurone and they function be to carry message from the brain out to the muscle for a muscle ordinarily do not act without a nervous current to set it off so far we have see that the brain have the two function of receive impression from the sense-organ and of send out order to the muscle there be a further mechanism that must now be describe when message be receive in the sensory area it be necessary that there be some means within the brain of transmit they over to the motor area so that they may be act upon such a arrangement be provide by another group of nerve-cell in the brain have as they function the transmission of the nervous current from one area to another they be call association neurone and transmit the nervous current from sensory area to motor area or from one sensory area to another for example suppose you see a brick fall from above and you dodge quickly back the neural action accompany this occurrence consist of a impression upon the nerve-cell in the eye the conduction of the nervous current back to the visual area of the brain the transmission of the current over association neurone to the motor area then its transmission over the motor neurone down the spinal cord to the muscle that enable you to dodge the missile the association neurone have the further function of connect one sensory area in the brain with another for example when you see smell taste and touch a orange the corresponding area in the brain act in conjunction and be associate by means of the association neurone connect they the association neurone play a large part in the secure and organize of knowledge they be very important in study for all learn consist in build up association from the foregoing description we see that the nervous system consist merely of a mechanism for the reception and transmission of incoming message and they transformation into outgoing message which produce movement the brain be the center where such transformation be make be a sort of central switchboard which permit the sense-organ to come into communication with muscle it be also the instrument by means of which the impression from the various sens can be unite and experience can be unify the brain serve further as the medium whereby impression once make can be retain that be it be the great organ of memory hence we see that it be to this organ we must look for the performance of the activity necessary to study everything that enter it produce some modification within it education consist in a process of undergo a select group of experience of such a nature as to leave beneficial result in the brain by means of the change make there the individual be able better to adjust himself to new situation for when the individual enter the world he be not prepare to meet many situation only a few of the neural connection be make and he be able to perform only a meager number of simple act such as breathing cry digestion the pathway for complex act such as speak english or french or write be not form at birth but must be build up within the life-time of the individual it be the process of build they up that we call education this process be a physical feat involve the production of change in physical material in the brain study involve the overcome of resistance in the nervous system that be why it be so hard in you early school-day when you set about laboriously learn the multiplication table you unwilling protest be wring because you be be compel to force the nervous current through new pathway and to overcome the inertia of physical matter today when you begin a train of reasoning the task be difficult because you be open hitherto untravelled pathway there be a comforting thought however which be derive from the factor of modifiability in that with each succeed repetition the task become easier because the path become worn smoothly and the nervous current seek it of its own accord in other word each act and each thought tend to become habitualized education be then a process of form habit and the rest of the book will be devote to the description and discussion of habit which a student should form reading and exercise reading : herrick -lrb- 7 -rrb- exercise 1 draw a picture of the brain show roughly what take place there -lrb- a -rrb- when you read a book -lrb- 6 -rrb- listen to a lecture -lrb- c -rrb- take note chapter iv formation of study-habit as already intimate this book adopt the view that education be a process of form habit in the brain in the formation of habit there be several principle that must be observe accordingly we shall devote a chapter to the consideration of habit in general before discuss the specific habit involve in various kind of study habit may be define roughly as the tendency to act time after time in the same way thus define you see that the force of habit extend throughout the entire universe it be a habit for the earth to revolve on its axis once every twenty-four hour and to encircle the sun once every year when a pencil fall from you hand it have a habit of drop to the floor a piece of paper once fold tend to crease in the same place these be example of the force of habit in nonliving matter living matter show its power even more clearly if you assume a petulant expression for some time it get fix and the expression become habitual the hair may be train to lie this way or that these be example of habit in live tissue but there be one particular form of live tissue which be most susceptible to habit that be nerve tissue let we review briefly the fact which underlie this characteristic in nerve tissue impressibility conductivity and modifiability be develop to a marked degree the nerve-cell in the sense organ be impress by stimulation from the outside world the nervous current thus generate be conduct over long nerve fiber through the spinal cord to the brain where it be receive and we experience a sensation thence it push on over association neurone in the brain to motor neurone over which it pass down the spinal cord again to muscle and end in some movement in the pathway which it traverse it leave its impression and thereafter when the first neurone be excite the nervous current tend to take the same pathway and to end in the same movement it should be emphasize that the nervous current once start always tend to seek outlet in movement this be a extremely important feature of neural action and as will be show in another chapter be a vital factor in study movement may be start by the stimulation of a sense organ or by a idea in the latter case it start from region in the brain without the immediately precede stimulation of a sense organ howsoever it start you may be sure that it seek a way out and prefer pathway already traverse hence you see you be bind to have habit they will develop whether you wish they or not already you be a bundle of habit they manifest themselves in two way -- as habit of action and habit of thought you illustrate the first every time you tie you shoe or sign you name to illustrate the second i need only ask you to supply the end of this sentence : columbus discover america in -- speech reveal many of these habit of think certain phrase persist in the mind as habit so that when the phrase be once begin you proceed habitually with the rest of it when some one start in spite you mind go on to think of more or call up less when i ask you what word be call up by black you reply white accord to the principle of mental habit you mind be arrange in such habitual pattern and from these example you readily see that a large part of what you do and think during the course of twenty-four hour be habitual twenty year hence you will be even more bind by this overpowering despot we act we angel be or good or ill we constant shadow that walk with we still since you can not avoid form habit how important it be that you seek to form those that be useful and desirable in acquire they there be several general principle deducible from the fact of nervous action the first be : guard the pathway lead to the brain nerve tissue be impressible and everything that touch it leave a ineradicable trace you can control you habit to some extent then by observe caution in permit thing to impress you many unfortunate habit of study arise from neglect of this the habit of use a pony for example arise when one permit oneself to depend upon a group of english word in translate from a foreign language nerve pathway should then be guard with respect to _ what _ enter they should also be guard with respect to the _ way _ thing enter remember as the first pathway be cut subsequent nervous current will be direct consequently if you make a wrong pathway you will have trouble undoing it another maxim which will obviously prevent undesirable pathway be go slowly at first this be a important principle in all learn if when try to learn the date 1453 you carelessly impress it first as 1435 you be likely to have trouble ever after in remember which be right 1453 or 1435 as you value you intellectual salvation then go slowly in make the first impression and be sure it be right the next rule be : guard the exit of the nervous current that be watch the movement you make in response to impression and idea this be necessary because the nervous current push on past obstruction through area in the brain until it end in some form of movement and in find the way out it seek those pathway that have be most frequently travel in study it usually take the form of movement of speech or write you will need to guard this part of the process just as you do the incoming pathway you must see that the movement be make which you wish to build into a habit in learn the pronunciation of a foreign word for example see that you first pronunciation of it be absolutely right when learn to typewrite see that you always hit the right key during the early trial the point of exit of a nervous current be the point also where precaution be to be take in develop good form the path should be the shortest possible involve only those muscle that be absolutely necessary this make for economy of effort the third general principle to be keep in mind be that habit be most easily form in youth for this be the period when nerve tissue be most easily impressed and modify with respect to habit formation then you see that youth be the time when emphasis should be lay upon the formation of as many useful habit as possible the world recognize this to some extent and society be so organize that the youth of the race be give leisure and protection so that they may form useful habit the world ask nothing of you during the next four year except that you develop yourself and form useful habit which will enable you in later life to take you place as a useful and stable member of society in addition to the principle just discuss there be a number of other maxim which have be lay down as guide in the formation of new habit the first be _ make a assertion of will _ vow to yourself that you will form the habit and keep that resolve ever before you the second maxim be _ make a emphatic start _ surround yourself with every aid possible make it easy at first to perform the act and difficult not to perform it for example if you desire to form the habit of arise at six every morning surround yourself with a number of aid buy a alarm clock and tell some one of you decision such effort at the start will give you new begin such a momentum that the temptation to break down will not occur as soon as it otherwise might and every day during which a breakdown be postpone add to the chance of its not occur at all man have discover the value of such device during the course of he long history and have evolve custom accordingly when man decide to swear off smoking they choose the opening of a new year when many other new thing be be start they make solemn promise to themselves to each other and finally to they friend such custom be precaution which help to bolster up the determination at the time when extraordinary effort and determination be require in form the habit incidental to college life take pain from the start to surround yourself with as many aid as possible this will not constitute a confession of weakness it be only a wise and natural precaution which the whole experience of the race have justify the third maxim be _ never permit a exception to occur _ suppose you have a habit of say aint which you wish to replace with a habit of say be not if the habit be deeply root you have wear a pathway in the brain to a considerable depth represent in the accompany diagram by the line _ a x b _ a | x \/ \ b c let we suppose that you have already start the new habit and have say the correct word ten time that mean you have worn another pathway _ a x c _ to a considerable depth during all this time however the old pathway be still open and at the slightest provocation will attract the nervous current you task be to deepen the new path so that the nervous current will flow into it instead of the old now suppose you make a exception on some occasion and allow the nervous current to travel over the old path this unfortunate exception break down the bridge which you have construct at _ x _ from _ a _ to _ c _ but this be not the only result the nervous current as it revisit the old path deepen it more than it be before so the next time a similar situation arise the current seek the old path with much greater readiness than before and vastly more effort be require to overcome it some one have liken the effect of these exception to that produce when one drop a ball of string that be partially wind by a single slip more be undo than can be accomplish in a dozen winding the fourth maxim be _ seize every opportunity to act upon you resolution _ the reason for this will be understand better if you keep in mind the fact state before that nervous current once start whether from a sense-organ or from a brain-center always tend to seek egress in movement these outgoing nervous current leave a imprint upon the modifiable nerve tissue as inevitably as do incoming impression therefore if you wish you resolve to be firmly fix you should act upon they speedily and often it be not in the moment of they form but in the moment of they produce _ motor effect _ that resolve and aspiration communicate the new ` set ' to the brain no matter how full a reservoir of _ maxim _ one may possess and no matter how good one 's _ sentiment _ may be if one have not take advantage of every concrete opportunity to _ act _ one 's character may remain entirely unaffected for the better particularly at time of emotional excitement one make resolve that be very good and a glow of fine feeling be present beware that these resolve do not evaporate in mere feeling they should be crystallize in some form of action as soon as possible let the expression be the least thing in the world -- speak genially to one 's grandmother or give up one 's seat in a car if nothing more heroic offer -- but let it not fail to take place strictly speak you have not really complete a resolve until you have act upon it you may determine to go without lunch but you have not consummate that resolve until you have permit it to express itself by carry you past the door of the dining-room that be the crucial test which determine the strength of you resolve many repetition will be require before a pathway be worn deep enough to be settle seize the very earliest opportunity to begin groove it out and seize every other opportunity for deepen it after this view of the place in you life occupy by habit you readily see its far-reaching possibility for welfare of body and mind its most obvious because most annoying effect be on the side of its disadvantage bad habit secure a grip upon we that we be sometimes powerless to shake off true this ineradicableness need have no terror if we have form good habit indeed as will be point out in the next paragraph habit may be a great asset nevertheless it may work positive harm or at best may lead to stagnation the fixedness of habit tend to make we move in rut unless we exert continuous effort to learn new thing if we permit ourselves to move in old groove we cease to progress and become old fogy but the advantage of habit far outweigh its disadvantage habit help the individual to be consistent and help people to know what to expect from one it help society to be stable to incorporate within itself mode of action conducive to the common good for example the respect which we all have for the property of other be a habit and be so firmly intrench that we should find ourselves unable to steal if we wish to habit be thus a very desirable asset and be truly call the enormous fly-wheel of society a second advantage of habit be that it make for accuracy act that have become habitualize be perform more accurately than those not habitualize movement such as those make in typewriting and piano-playing when measure in the psychological laboratory be find to copy each other with extreme fidelity the human body be a machine which may be adjust to a high degree of nicety and habit be the mechanism by which this adjustment be make a third advantage be that a stock of habit make life easier there be no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing be habitual but indecision for whom the lighting of every cigar the drinking of every cup the time of rise and go to bed every day and the beginning of every bit of work be subject of express volitional deliberation full half the time of such a man go to the decide or regret of matter which ought to be so ingrain in he as practically not to exist for he consciousness at all have you ever reflect how miserable you would be and what a task living would be if you have to learn to write anew every morning when you go to class or if you have to relearn how to tie you necktie every day the burden of live would be intolerable the last advantage to be discern in habit be economy habitual act do not have to be actively direct by consciousness while they be be perform consciousness may be otherwise engage the more of the detail of we daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism the more we higher power of mind will be set free for they own proper work while you be brushing you hair or tie you shoe you mind may be engage in memorize poetry or calculate arithmetical problem habit be thus a great economizer the ethical consequence of habit be so striking that before leave the subject we must give they acknowledgment we can do no better than to turn to the statement by professor jame whose wise remark upon the subject have not be improve upon : the physiological study of mental condition be thus the most powerful ally of hortatory ethic the hell to be endure hereafter of which theology tell be no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by habitually fashion we character in the wrong way could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walk bundle of habit they would give more heed to they conduct while in the plastic state we be spin we own fate good or evil and never to be undo every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leave its never-so-little scar the drunken rip van winkle in jefferson 's play excuse himself for every fresh dereliction by say ' i will not count this time ' well he may not count it and a kind heaven may not count it but it be be count none the less down among he nerve-cell and fiber the molecule be count it register it and store it up to be use against he when the next temptation come nothing we ever do be in strict scientific literalness wipe out of course this have its good side as well as its bad one as we become permanent drunkard by so many drink so we become saint in the moral and authority and expert in the practical and scientific sphere by so many separate act and hour of work but let no youth have any anxiety about the upshot of he education whatever the line of it may be if he keep faithfully busy each hour of the work day he may safely leave the final result to itself he can with perfect certainty count on wake up some fine morning to find himself one of the competent one of he generation in whatever pursuit he have single out silently between all the detail of he business the _ power of judge _ in all that class of matter will have build itself up within he as a possession that will never pass away young people should know the truth of this in advance the ignorance of it have probably engender more discouragement and faintheartedness in youth embark on arduous career than all other cause put together exercise exercise 1 point out a undesirable habit that you be determine to eradicate describe the desirable habit which you will adopt in its place give the concrete step you will take in form the new habit how long a time do you estimate will be require for the formation of the new habit mark down the date and refer back to it when you have form the habit to see how accurately you estimate chapter v active imagination a very large part of the mental life of a student consist in the manipulation of image by image we mean the revival of thing that have be impress upon the sens call to mind for the moment you house-number as it appear upon the door of you home in so do you mentally reinstate something which have be impress upon you sens many time and you see it almost as clearly as if it be actually before you the mental thing thus revive be call a image the word image be somewhat ill-chosen for it usually signify something connect with the eye and imply that the stuff of mental image be entirely visual the true fact of the matter be we can image practically anything that we can sense we may have tactual image of thing touch auditory image of thing hear gustatory image of thing taste olfactory image of thing smell how these behave in general and how they interact in study will engage we attention in this chapter the most highly dramatic use of image be in connection with that mental process know as imagination as we study the writings of jack london poe defoe bunyan we move in a realm almost wholly imaginary and as we take a cross-section of we mind when thus engage we find they fill with image furthermore they be of great variety -- image of color sound taste smell touch even of sensation from we own internal organ such as the palpitation of the heart that accompany feeling of pride indignation remorse exaltation a further characteristic be that they be sharp clean-cut vivid note in the balcony scene from romeo and juliet the number variety and vividness of the image : but soft what light through yonder window break it be the east and juliet be the sun arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who be already sick and pale with grief that thou she maid art far more fair than she be not she maid since she be envious she vestal livery be but sick and green two of the fairest star in all the heaven have some business do entreat she eye to twinkle in they sphere till they return what if she eye be there they in she head the brightness in she cheek would shame those star as daylight doth a lamp she eye in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that bird would sing and think it be not night see how she lean she cheek upon she hand o that i be a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek we may conclude then that three of the desirable attribute of great work of the imagination be _ number variety _ and _ vividness _ of mental image one question that frequently arise concern work of the imagination be what be they source superficial thinker have loosely answer inspiration imply -lrb- accord to the literal meaning of the word to breathe in -rrb- that some mysterious external force -lrb- call by the ancient a muse -rrb- enter into the mind of the author with a special revelation psychological analysis of these imaginative work show that this explanation be untrue that the bizarre and apparently novel product arise from the experience of the author revive in imagination and combine in new way the horrendous incident depict in dante 's divine comedy never occur within the lifetime experience of the author as such they separate element do however and furnish the basis for dante 's clever combination the oft-heard say that there be nothing new under the sun be psychologically true in the light of this brief analysis of product of the imagination we be ready to develop a program which we may follow in cultivate a active imagination recognize that image have they source in sensory experience we see that the first step to take be to seek a multitude of experience make intimate acquaintance with the object of you environment handle they tear they apart put they together place they next to other object note the likeness and difference thus you will acquire the stuff out of which image be make and will stock you mind with a number of image then when you wish to convey you idea you will have a number of term in which to do it -- one of the characteristic of a free-flowing imagination the second characteristic we find to be variety to secure this seek a variety of sensational experience perceive the object of you experience through several sens -- touch smell sight hearing taste by means of this variety in sensation you will secure corresponding variety in you image to revive they easily sometimes require practice for it have be discover that all people do not naturally call up image related to the various sens with equal ease most people use visual and auditory image more freely than they do other kind in order to develop skill in evoke the other practice recall they sit down for a hour of practice as you would sit down for a hour of piano practice try to recall the taste of raisin english walnut the smell of hyacinth of witch-hazel the rough touch of a orange-skin though you may at first have difficulty you will develop with practice a gratifying facility in recall all variety of image the third characteristic which we observe in work of the imagination be vividness to achieve this pay close attention to the detail of you sensory experience observe sharply the minute but characteristic item -- the accent mark on _ aprs _ the coarse stubby beard of the typical alley tough stock you mind with a wealth of such detailed impression keep they alive by the kind of practice recommend in the precede paragraph then describe the object of you experience in term of these significant detail we discover in discuss the source of imaginative work that the man whom we be accustom to call imaginative genius do not have unique communication with heaven or with any external reservoir of idea instead we find they wonder-evoking creation to be merely new combination of old image the true secret of they success be they industrious utilization of past experience accord to the program outline above they select certain element from they experience and combine they in novel way this be the explanation of they strange beautiful and bizarre production this be what carlyle mean when he characterize genius as the transcendent capacity for take trouble this be what hogarth mean when he say genius be nothing but labor and diligence for concrete exemplification of this truth we need only turn to the autobiography of great writer in this passage from john barleycorn jack london describe he method : early and late i be at it -- write typing study grammar study writing and all form of write and study the writer who succeed in order to find out how they succeed i manage on five hour ' sleep in the twenty-four and come pretty close to work the nineteen waking hour leave to I by say that the novel effect of imagination come by way of industry we do not mean to imply that one should strain after novelty and eccentricity unusual and happy combination will come of themselves and naturally if one only make a sufficient number there be law of combination know as the psychological law of association by which image will unite naturally the number of possible combination be infinite by industriously make a large number you will by the very law of chance stumble upon some that be especially happy and striking in summarize this discussion we may conclude that a active fertile imagination come from crowd into one 's life a large number of varied and vivid experience store they up in the mind in the form of image and industriously recall and combine they in novel relationship mental image occur in other mental process besides imagination they bulk importantly in memorize as we shall see in chapter vi and vii and in reasoning as we shall see in chapter ix throughout the book we shall find that as we develop ability to manipulate mental image we shall increase the adaptability of all the mental process read and exercise reading : dearborn -lrb- 2 -rrb- chapter iii exercise 1 call up in imagination the sound of you french instructor 's voice as he say _ tudiant _ call up the appearance on the page of the conjugation of _ tre _ present tense exercise 2 choose some word which you have have difficulty in learn look at it attentively secure a perfectly clear impression of it then practice call up the visual image of it until you secure perfect reproduction exercise 3 list the different image call up by the passage from _ romeo and juliet _ chapter vi first aid to memory impression of all the mental operation employ by the student memory be probably the one in which the greatest inefficiency be manifest though we often fail to realize it much of we life be take up with memorize every time we make use of past experience we rely upon this function of the mind but in no occupation be it quite so practically important as in study we shall begin we investigation of memory by divide it into four phase or stage -- impression retention recall and recognition any act of memory involve they all there be first a stage when the material be be impressed second a stage when it be be retain so that it may be revive in the future third a stage of recall when the retain material be revive to meet present need fourth a feeling of recognition through which the material be recognize as have previously be in the mind impression be accomplish through the sense organ and in the foregoing chapter we lay down the rule : guard the avenue of impression and admit only such thing as you wish to retain this necessitate that you go slowly at first this be a principle of all habit formation but be especially important in habit of memorize much of the poor memory that people complain about be due to the fact that they make first impression carelessly one reason why people fail to remember name be that they do not get a clear impression of the name at the start they be introduce in a hurry or the introducer mumble consequently no clear impression be secure under such circumstance how could one expect to retain and recall the name go slowly then in impress material for the first time as you look up the word of a foreign language in the lexicon try to memorize they english equivalent take plenty of time obtain a clear impression of the sound and appearance of the word inasmuch as impression may be make through any of the sense organ one problem in the improvement of memory concern the choice of sense avenue as a infant you use all sens impartially in you eager search after information you voraciously put thing into you mouth and discover that some thing be sweet some sour you bump you head against thing and learn that some be hard and some soft in you insatiable curiosity you pull thing apart and peer into they in short utilize all the sense organ in adult life however and in education as it take place through the agency of book and instructor most learn depend upon the eye and ear even yet however you learn many thing through the sense of touch and through muscle movement though you may be unaware of it you probably have better success retain impression make upon one sense than another the majority of people retain better thing that be visually impressed such person think often in term of visual image when thinking of water run from a faucet they can see the water fall see it splash but have no trace of the sound the whole event be noiseless in memory when they think of they instructor they can see he stand at he desk but can not imagine the sound of he voice when strive to think of the cause lead to the civil war they picture they as they be list on the page of the text-book or note-book other people have not this ability to recall in visual term but depend to greater extent upon sound when ask to think about they instructor they do it in term of he voice when ask to conjugate a french verb they hear it pronounced mentally but do not see it on the page these be extreme of imagery type but they illustrate preference as they be find in many person some person use all sens with ease other unconsciously work out combination prefer one sense for some kind of material and another for other kind for example one might prefer visual impression for remember date in history but auditory impression for conjugate french verb you will find it profitable to examine yourself and discover you preference if you find that you have greater difficulty in remember material impress through the ear than through the eye reduce thing to visual term as much as possible make you lecture note more complete or tabulate thing that you wish to remember thus secure impression from the written form the writer have difficulty in remember name that be only hear so he ask that the name be spell then project the letter on a imaginary background thus form visual stuff which can easily be recall if on the contrary you remember best the thing that you hear you may find it a good plan to read you lesson aloud many a student upon the discovery of such a preference have increase he memory ability many fold by adopt the simple expedient of read he lesson aloud it might be point out that while you be read aloud you be make more than auditory impression by the use of the vocal organ you be make muscular impression which also aid in learn as will be point out in chapter x after this discussion do not jump to the conclusion that just because you find some difficulty in use one sense avenue for impression it be therefore impossible to develop it facility in use particular sens can be gain by practice to improve ability to form visual image of thing practice call up vision of thing try to picture a page of you history textbook can you see the headline of the section and the paragraph to develop auditory imagery practice call up sound try to image you french instructor 's voice in say _ lve _ the development of these sense field be a slow and laborious process and one question whether it be worth while for a student to undertake the labor involve when another sense be already very efficient probably it be most economical to arrange impression so as to favor the sense that be already well develop and reliable another important condition of impression be repetition it be well know that material which be repeat several time be remember more easily than that impressed but once if two repetition induce a give liability to recall four or eight will secure still greater liability of recall you knowledge of brain action make this rule intelligible because you know the pathway be deepen every time the nervous current pass over it experiment in the psychological laboratory have show that it be best in make impression to make more than enough impression to insure recall if material be to be retain for any length of time a simple mastery of it for immediate recall be not sufficient it should be learn far beyond the point of immediate reproduction if time and energy be to be save this principle of learn point out the fact that there be two kind of memory -- immediate and defer the first kind involve recall immediately after impression be make the second involve recall at some later time it be a well-known fact that thing learn a long time before they be to be recall fade away if you be not go to recall material until a long time after the impression store up enough impression so that you can afford to lose a few and still retain enough until time for recall another reason for overlearning be that when the time come for recall you be likely to be disturb if it be a time of public performance you may be embarrassed or you may be hurry or under distraction accordingly you should have the material exceedingly well memorize so that these distraction will not prove detrimental the mere statement make above that repetition be necessary in impression be not sufficient it be important to know how to distribute the repetition suppose you be memorize psalm of life to be recite a month from to-day and that you require thirty repetition of the poem to learn it shall you make these thirty repetition at one sit or shall you distribute they among several sitting in general it be better to spread the repetition over a period of time the question then arise what be the most effective distribution various combination be possible you might rehearse the poem once a day during the month or twice a day for the first fifteen day or the last fifteen day four time every fourth day _ ad infinitum _ in the face of these possibility be there anything that will guide we in distribute the repetition we shall get some light on the question from a examination of the curve of forget -- a curve that have be plot show the rate at which the mind tend to forget forget proceeds accord to law the curve descend rapidly at first and then more slowly the larger proportion of the material learn be forget the first day or so after that a constantly decrease amount be forget on each succeed day for perhaps a week when the amount remain practically stationary this give we some indication that the early repetition should be closer together than those at the end of the period so long as you be forget rapidly you will need more repetition in order to counterbalance the tendency to forget you might well make five repetition then rest in about a hour five more within the next twenty-four hour five more by this time you should have the poem memorize and all within two day you would still have fifteen repetition of the thirty and these might be use in keep the poem fresh in the mind by a repetition every other day as intimate above one important principle in memorize be to make the first impression as early as possible for older impression have many chance of be retain this be evidence by the vividness of childhood scene in the mind of we grandparent a old soldier recall with great vividness event that happen during the civil war but forget event of yesterday there be involve here a principle of nervous action that you have already encounter namely that impression be more easily make and retain in youth it should also be observe that pathway make early have more chance of be use than those make recently still another peculiarity of nervous action be reveal in these extend period of memorize it have be discover that if a rest be take between impression the impression become more firmly fix this point to the presence of a surprising power by which we be able to learn as it be while we sleep we shall understand this better if we try to imagine what be happen in the nervous system process of nutrition be constantly go on the blood bring in particle to repair the nerve cell rebuild they accord to the pattern leave by the last impression indeed the entrance of this new material make the impression even more fix the nutritional process seem to set the impression much as a hypo bath fix or set a impression on a photographic plate this peculiarity of memory lead professor jame to suggest paradoxically that we learn to skate in summer and to swim in winter and indeed one usually find in begin the skating season that after the initial stiffness of muscle wear off one glide along with surprising agility you see then that if you plan thing rightly nature will do much of you learning for you it might be suggest that perhaps thing impressed just before go to sleep have a better chance to set than thing impress at other time for the reason that sleep be the time when the reparative process of the body be most active since the brain pattern require time to set it be important that after the first impression you refrain from introduce anything immediately into the mind that might disturb it after you have impress the poem you be memorize do not immediately follow it by another poem let the brain rest for three or four minute until after the first impression have have a chance to set now that we have regard this unconscious memorize from the neurological standpoint let we consider it from the psychological standpoint how be the idea be modify during the interval between impression modern psychology have discover that much memorize go on without we know it paradoxical as that may seem the process may be describe in term of the doctrine of association which be that whenever two thing have once be associate together in the mind there be a tendency thereafter if the first of they recur for the other to come with it after the poem of we illustration have once be repeat there be a tendency for event in everyday experience that be like it to associate themselves with it for example in the course of a day or week many thing might arise and recall to you the line life be real life be earnest and it would become by that fact more firmly fix in the mind this valuable semi-conscious recall require that you must make the first impression as early as possible before the time for ultimate recall this persistence of idea in the mind mean that the process of learning do not cease with the actual work of learning but that if not disturb this process run on of itself for a time and add a little to the result of we labor it also mean that if it be to we advantage to stand in readiness with some word or thought we shall be able to do so if only this word or thought recur to we but once some time before the critical moment so we remember to keep a promise to pay a call to make a remark at the proper time even though we turn we mind to other work or talk for some hour between we can do this because if not vigorously prevent idea and word keep on reappear in the mind you may utilize this principle in theme-writing to good advantage as soon as the instructor announce the subject for a theme begin to think about it gather together all the idea you have about the subject and start you mind to work upon it suppose you take as a theme-subject the value of training in public speaking for a business man the first time this be suggest to you a few thought at least will come to you write they down even though they be disconnect and heterogeneous then as you go about you other work you will find a number of occasion that will arouse idea bear upon this subject you may read in a newspaper of a brilliant speech make before the chamber of commerce by a lead business man which will serve as a illustration to support you affirmative position or you may attend a banquet where a prominent business man disappoint he audience with a wretched speech such experience and many other bear more or less directly upon the subject will come to you and will call up the theme-subject with which they will unite themselves write down these idea as they occur and you will find that when you start to compose the theme formally it almost write itself require for the most part only expansion and arrangement of idea while thus organize the theme you will reap even more benefit from you early start for as you be compose it you will find new idea crowd in upon you which you do not know you possess but which have be associate themselves in you mind with this topic even when you be unaware of the fact in write theme the principle of distribution of time may also be profitably employ after you have once write a theme lay it aside for a while -- perhaps a week then when you take it up read it in a detach manner and you will note many place where it may be improve these benefit be to be enjoy only when a theme be plan a long time ahead hence the rule to start as early as possible before leave the subject of theme-writing which be call up by the discussion of unconscious memory another suggestion will be give that may be of service to you when correct a theme employ more than one sense avenue do not simply glance over it with you eye read it aloud either to yourself or better still to someone else when you do this you will be amaze to discover how different it sound and what a new view you secure of it when you thus change you method of composition you will find a new group of idea throng into you mind in the auditory rendition of a theme you will discover fault of syntax which escape you in silent reading you will note duplication of word split infinitive mixed tense poorly balanced sentence moreover if you mind have certain peculiarity you may find even more advantage accrue from such a practice the author for example have a slightly different set of idea at he disposal accord to the medium of expression employ when write with a pencil one set of idea come to mind with a typewriter slightly different idea arise when talk to a audience still different idea three set of idea and three vocabulary be thus available for use on any subject in adopt this device of compose through several medium you should combine with it the principle of distribute time already discuss in connection with repetition of impression write a theme one day then lay it aside for a few day and go back to it with a fresh mind the rest will be find very beneficial in help you to get a new viewpoint of the subject revert to we discussion of memory we come upon another question : in memorize material like the poem of we example should one impress the entire poem at once or break it up into part impress a stanza each day most people would respond without think the latter and as a matter of fact most memorizing take place in this way experimental psychology however have discover that this be uneconomical the selection if of moderate length should be impress as a whole if too long for this it should be break up as little as possible in order to see the necessity for this let we examine you experience with the memorization of poem in you early school day you probably proceed as follow : after school one day you learn the first stanza then go out to play the next day you learn the second one and so on you think at the end of a week that you have memorize it because at the end of each day 's sit you be able to recite perfectly the stanza learn that day on speak day you start out bravely and recite the first stanza without mishap when you start to think of the second one however it would not come the memory balk now what be the matter how can we explain this distressing blank in psychological term we ascribe the difficulty to the failure to make proper association between stanza association be make effectively between the line of the single stanza but not between the separate stanza after you finish impress the first stanza you go about something else playing ball perhaps when you approach the poem the next day you start in with the second stanza there be then no bridge between the two there be nothing to link the last line of the first stanza and thing be not what they seem with the first line of the next stanza life be real life be earnest this make clear the necessity of impress the poem as a whole instead of by part accord to another classification there be two way of memorize -- by rote and by logical association rote memorize involve the repetition of material just as it stand and usually require such long and laborious drill that it be seldom economical true some matter must be memorize this way such as the day of the week and the name of the month but there be another and gentler method which be usually more effective and economical than that of brutal repetition that be the method of logical association by which one link up a new fact with something already in the mind if for example you wish to remember the date of the world 's fair in chicago you might proceed as follow : ask yourself what do the fair commemorate the discovery of america in 1492 the four hundredth anniversary occur in 1892 the fair could not be make ready in that year however so be postpone a year such a process of memorize the date be less laborious than the method of rote memory and be usually more likely to lead to ready recall the old fact already in mind act as a magnet which at some later time may call up other fact that have once be associate with it you can easily see that this new fact might have be associate with several old fact thus secure more chance of be call up from this it may be infer that the more fact you have in you mind about a subject the more chance you have of retain new fact it be sometimes think that if a person store so much in he memory it will soon be so full that he can not memorize any more this be a false notion involve a conception of the brain as a hopper into which impression be pour until it run over on the contrary it should be regard as a interlacing of fiber with infinite possibility of inter-connection and no one ever exhaust the number of association that can be make the method of logical association may be employ with tell effect in the study of foreign language when you meet a new word scrutinize it carefully for some trace of a word already familiar to you either in that language or in another this independent discovery of meaning be a very great aid in save time and in fix the meaning of new word opportunity for this method be especially frequent in the german language since so many german word be form by compound other word rathausmarkt be a long and apparently difficult german word and one 's first temptation be to look it up in the lexicon and promptly forget it let we analyze it however and we shall see that it be only a compound of already familiar word _ rat _ be already familiar as the word for counsel -lrb- _ raten _ to give advice -rrb- _ haus _ be equally familiar so we see that the first part of the word mean council-house the council-house of a city be call a city hall _ markt _ be equally familiar as market-square so the significance of the entire word stand city-hall-square by such a method of utilize fact already know you may make yourself much more independent of the lexicon and may make you memory for foreign word much more tenacious we approach a phase of impression the importance of which be often unsuspected namely the intention with which memorize be do the fidelity of memory be greatly affect by the intention if at the time of impression you intend to retain only until the time of recall the material tend to slip away after that time if however you impress with the intention to retain permanently the material stay by you better student make a great mistake when they study for the purpose merely of retain until after examination time intend to retain fact permanently and there will be greater likelihood of they permanence reading and exercise reading : adam -lrb- 1 -rrb- chapter iii seashore -lrb- 16 -rrb- chapter ii swift -lrb- 20 -rrb- chapter vii watt -lrb- 21 -rrb- exercise i cite example from you own experience show the effect of the follow fault in make impression _ a _ first impression not clear _ b _ insufficient number of repetition _ c _ use of rote method instead of method of logical association _ d _ impression not distribute _ e _ improper use of part method exercise 2 after experimentation state what be you most effective sense avenue for the impression of foreign word fact in history the pronunciation of english word exercise 3 make a preliminary draft of you next theme lay it aside for a day or two then write another on the same subject combine the two use the best part of each lay this aside for a day or two then read it aloud make such change as be prompt by the auditory presentation can you find element of worth in this method which will warrant you in adopt it at least in part chapter vii second aid to memory : retention recall and recognition we discussion up to this point have centre around the phase of memory call impression we have describe some of the condition favorable to impression and have see that certain and accurate memory depend upon adherence to they the next phase of memory -- retention -- can not be describe in psychological term we know we retain fact after they be once impressed but as to they status in the mind we can say nothing if you be ask when the declaration of independence be sign you would reply instantly when ask however where that fact be five minute ago you could not answer somewhere in the recess of the mind perhaps but as to immediate awareness of it there be none we may try to think of retention in term of nerve cell and say that at the time when the material be first impressed there be some modification make in certain nerve cell which persist this trait of nerve modifiability be one factor which account for greater retentive power in some person than in other it must not be conclude however that all good memory be due to the inheritance of this trait it be due partly to observance of proper condition of impression and much can be do to overcome or offset innate difficulty of modification by such observance we be now ready to examine the third phase of memory -- recall this be the stage at which material that have be impressed and retain be recall to serve the purpose for which it be memorize recall be thus the goal of memory and all the device so far discuss have it for they object can we facilitate recall by any other means than by faithful and intelligent impression for answer let we examine the state of mind at time of recall we find that it be a unique mental state it differ from impression in be a period of more active search for fact in the mind accompany by expression instead of a concentration upon the external impression it be also usually accompany by motor expression either talk or write since recall be a unique mental state you ought to prepare for it by means of a rehearsal when you be memorize anything to be recall make part of you memorize a rehearsal of it if possible under same condition as final recall in memorize from a book first make impression then close the book and practice recall when memorize a selection to be give in a public speaking class intersperse the period of impression with period of recall this be especially necessary in preparation for public speaking for face a audience give rise to a vastly different psychic attitude from that of impression the sight of a audience may be embarrassing or exciting furthermore unforeseen distraction may arise accordingly create those condition as nearly as possible in you preparation imagine yourself face the audience practice aloud so that you will become accustomed to the sound of you own voice the importance of the practice of recall as a part of the memory process can hardly be overestimate one psychologist have advise that in memorize significant material more than half the time should be spend in practise recall there still remain a fourth phase of memory -- recognition whenever a remembered fact be recall it be accompany by a characteristic feeling which we call the feeling of recognition it have be describe as a feeling of familiarity a glow of warmth a sense of ownership a feeling of intimacy as you walk down the street of a great city you pass hundred of face all of they strange suddenly in the crowd you catch sight of some one you know and be instantly suffuse with a glow of feeling that be markedly different from you feeling toward the other that glow represent the feeling of recognition it be always present during recall and may be use in great advantage in study it derive its virtue for we purpose from the fact that it be a feeling and at the time of feel the bodily activity in general be affect change occur in heart beat breathing various glandular secretion be affect the digestive organ respond in this general quickening of bodily activity we have reason to believe that the nervous system partake and thing become impressed more readily thus the feeling of recognition that accompany recall be responsible for one of the benefit of review at such a time material once memorize become tinged with a feelingful color different from that which accompany it when new review then not merely to produce additional impression but also to take advantage of the feeling of recognition we have now discuss memory in its four phase and have see clearly that it operate not in a blind chaotic manner but accord to law certain condition be require and when they be meet memory be good after provide proper condition for memory then trust you memory a attitude of confidence be very necessary if when you be memorize you continually tremble for fear that you will not recall at the desire moment the fixedness of the impression will be greatly hinder therefore after utilize all you knowledge about the condition of memorize rest content and trust to the law of nature they will not fail you by this time you have see that memory be not a mysterious mental faculty with which some people be generously endowed and of which other be deprive all people of normal intelligence can remember and can improve they ability if they desire the improvement do not take the form that some people expect however no magic wand can transform you into a good memorize you must work the transformation yourself furthermore it be not a instantaneous process to be accomplish overnight it will come about only after you have build up a set of habit accord to we conception of study as a process of habit formation a final word of caution should be add some people think of memory as a separate division or compartment of the mind which can be control and improve by exercise it alone such a conception be fallacious improvement in memory will involve improvement in other mental ability and you will find that as you improve you ability to remember you will develop at the same time better power to concentrate attention to image to associate fact and to reason reading and exercise reading : see reading for chapter vi exercise i compare the mental condition of impression with those of recall chapter viii concentration of attention nearly everyone have difficulty in the concentration of attention brain worker in business and industry student in high school and college and even professor in university complain of the same difficulty attention seem in some way to be at the very core of mental activity for no matter from what aspect we view the mind its excellence seem to depend upon the power to concentrate attention when we examine a grow infant one of the first sign by which we judge the awakening of intelligence be the power to pay attention or to notice thing when we examine the intellectual ability of normal adult we do so by means of test that require close concentration of attention in judge the intelligence of people with whom we associate every day we regard one who be able to maintain close attention for long period of time as a person of strong mind we rate thoma edison as a powerful thinker when we read that he become so absorb in work that he neither eat nor sleep finally when we examine the insane and the feeble-minded we find that one form which they derangement take be a inability to control the attention this evidence add to we own experience show we the importance of concentration of attention in study and we become even more desirous of investigate attention to see how we may develop it we shall be better able to discuss attention if we select for analysis a concrete situation when the mind be in a state of concentrated attention concentrate for a moment upon the letter o although you be ostensibly focus all you power of attention upon the letter nevertheless you be really aware of a number of thing besides : of other word on the page of other object in the field of vision of sound in the room and on the street of sensation from you clothing and of sensation from you bodily organ such as the heart and lung in addition to these sensation you will find if you introspect carefully enough that you mind also contain a number of idea and imagining thought about the paragraph you just read or about one of you lesson thus we see that at a time when we apparently focus we attention upon but one thing we really have a large number of thing in we mind and they be of a great variety the mental field might be represent by a circle at the center of which be the object of attention it may be a object in the external world perceive through one of the sens or it may be a idea we be think about such for example as the idea of infinity but whether the thing attend to be a perception or a idea we may properly speak of it as the object of attention or the focal object in addition to this we must recognize the presence of a large number of other object both sensory and ideational these be nearer the margin of the mental field so we call they marginal the distinctive thing about a state of mind such as that just describe be that the focal object be much clearer than the marginal object for example when you fixate the letter o it be only in the vaguest sort of fashion that you be aware of the contact of you clothing or the lurk idea of other lesson as we examine these marginal object further we find that they be continually seek to crowd into the center of attention and to become clear you may be help in form a vivid picture of condition if you think of the mind as a stream ever in motion and as it flow on the object in it continually shift they position a cross-section of the stream at any moment may show the contents of the mind arrange in a particular pattern but at the very next moment they may be arrange in a different pattern another object occupy the focus while the previous tenant be push to the margin thus we see that it be a tendency of the mind to be forever change if leave to itself it would be in ceaseless fluctuation the whim of every pass fancy this tendency to fluctuate come with more or less regularity some psychologist say every second or two true we do not always yield to the fluctuate tendency nevertheless we be recurrently tempt and we must exercise continuous effort to keep a particular object at the focus the power to exert effort and to regulate the arrangement of we state of mind be the peculiar gift of man and be a prime function of education view in this light then we see that the voluntary focus of we attention consist in the selecting of certain object to be attend to and the ignore of other object which act as distraction we may conveniently classify the latter as external sensation bodily sensation and irrelevant idea let we take a actual situation that may arise in study and see how this apply suppose you be in you room study about charlemagne a page of you history text occupy the center of you attention the marginal distraction in such a case would consist first in external sensation such as the glare from you study-lamp the hissing of the radiator the practising of a neighbor vocalist the rattle of pass street-car the bodily distraction might consist of sensation of weariness refer to the back the arm and the eye and fainter sensation from the digestive organ heart and lung the irrelevant idea might consist of thought about a german lesson which you be go to study vision of a face or thought about some social engagement these marginal object be in the mind even when you conscientiously focus you mind upon the history lesson and though vague they try to force they way into the focus and become clear the task of pay attention then consist in maintain the desire object at the center of the mental field and keep the distraction away with this definition of attention we see that in order to increase the effectiveness of attention during study we must devise means for overcome the distraction peculiar to study obviously the first thing be to eliminate every distraction possible such a plan of elimination may require a radical rearrangement of study condition for student often fail to realize how wretched they condition of study be from a psychological standpoint they attempt to study in room with two or three other who talk and move about continually they drop down in any spot in the library and expose themselves needlessly to a great number of distraction if you wish to become a good student you must prepare condition as favorable as possible for study choose a quiet room to live in free from distract sound and sight have you room at a temperature neither too hot nor too cold 68  f be usually consider favorable for study when read in the library sit down in a quiet spot with you back to the door so you will not be tempt to look up as people enter the room do not sit near a group of gossiper or near a creaking door have make the external condition favorable for study you should next address yourself to the task of eliminate bodily distraction the most disturbing of these in study be sensation of fatigue for contrary to the opinion of many people study be very fatiguing work and involve continual strain upon the muscle in hold the body still particularly those of the back neck arm hand and above all the eye how many movement be make by you eye in the course of a hour 's study they sweep back and forth across the page incessantly be move by six muscle which be bind to become fatigue still more fatigue come from the contraction of delicate muscle within the eyeball where adjustment be make for far and near vision and for vary amount of light the eye then give rise to much fatigue and altogether be the source of a great many bodily distraction in study other distraction may consist of sensation from the clothing we be always vaguely aware of pressure of we clothing usually it be not sufficiently noticeable to cause much annoyance but occasionally it be as be demonstrate at night when we take off a shoe with such a sigh of relief that we realize in retrospect it have be vaguely trouble we all day in try to create condition for efficient study many bodily distraction can be eliminate the study chair should be easy to sit in so as to reduce fatigue of the muscle support the body the book-rest should be arrange so as to require little effort to hold the book the light should come over the left shoulder this be especially necessary in write so that the write hand will not cast a shadow upon the work the muscle of the eye will be rest and fatigue will be retard if you close the eye occasionally then in order to lessen the general fatigue of the body you may find it advantageous to rise and walk about occasionally lastly the clothing should be loose and unconfining especially should there be plenty of room for circulation in the overcome of distraction we have see that much may be do by way of eliminate distraction and we have point out the way to accomplish this to a certain extent but in spite of we most careful provision there will still be distraction that can not be eliminate you can not for example chloroform the vocalist in the neighbor apartment nor stop the street-car while you study you can not rule out fatigue sensation entirely and you can not build a fence around the focus of you mind so as to keep out unwelcome and irrelevant idea the only thing to do then be to accept as inevitable the presence of some distraction and to realize that to pay attention it be necessary to habituate yourself to the ignore of distraction in the accomplishment of this end it will be necessary to apply the principle of habit formation already describe start out by make a strong determination to ignore all distraction practice ignore they and do not let a slip occur try to develop interest in the object of attention because we pay attention to those thing in which we be most interested a final point that may help you be to use the first lapse of attention as a reminder of the object you desire to fixate upon this may be illustrate by the follow example : suppose in study a history lesson you come upon a reference to the royal apparel of charlemagne the word royal might call up purple a northwestern university pennant the person who give it to you and before you know it you be off in a long day-dream lead far from the history lesson such migration as these be very likely to occur in study and constitute one of the most treacherous pitfall of student life in try to avoid they you must form habit of disregard irrelevant idea when they try to obtrude themselves and the way to do this be to school yourself so that the first lapse of attention will remind you of the lesson in hand it can be do if you keep yourself sensitive to wanderings of attention and let the first slip from the topic with which you be engage remind you to pull yourself back do this before you have take the step that will carry you far away for with each step in the series of association it become harder to draw yourself back into the correct channel in read one frequent cause for lapse of attention and for the intrusion of unwelcome idea be obscurity in the material be read if you trace back you lapse of attention you will often find that they first occur when the thought become difficult to follow the sentence ambiguous or a single word unusual as a result the meaning grow hazy in you mind and you fail to comprehend it naturally then you drift into a channel of thought that be easier to follow this happen because the mental stream tend to seek channel of least resistance if you introspect carefully you will undoubtedly discover that many of you annoying lapse of attention can be trace to such condition the obvious remedy be to make sure that you understand everything as you read as soon as you feel the thought grow difficult to follow begin to exert more effort consult the dictionary for the meaning of word you do not understand probably the ordinary freshman in college ought to look up the meaning of as many as twenty word daily again the thought may be difficult to follow because you previous knowledge be deficient perhaps the discussion involve some fact which you never do comprehend clearly and you will naturally fail to understand something build upon it if deficiency of knowledge be the cause of you lapse of attention the obvious remedy be to turn back and study the fundamental fact to lay a firm foundation in you subject of study this discussion show that the condition at time of concentrated attention be very complex that the mind be full of a number of thing that you object as a student be to keep some one thing at the focus of you mind and that in do so you must continuously ignore other mental contents in we psychological description we have imply that the mind stand still at time permit we to take a cross-section and examine it minutely as a matter of fact the mind never stand still it continually move along and at no two moment be it exactly the same this result in a condition whereby a idea which be at one moment at the center can not remain there unless it take on a slightly different appearance from moment to moment when you attempt to fix you attention upon the letter o you find a constant tendency to shift the attention perhaps to a variation in the intensity of the type or to a flaw in the type or in the paper in view of the inevitable nature of these change you see that in spite of you best effort you can not expect to maintain any object of study inflexibly at the center of attention the way to do be to manipulate the object so that it will appear from moment to moment in a slightly different light if for example you be try to concentrate upon a rule of english grammar long enough to memorize it do not read it over and over again depend solely upon repetition a better way after thoroughly comprehend it be to think about it in several relation compare it with other rule note point of likeness and difference apply it to the construction of a sentence the essential thing be to do something with it only thus can you keep it in the focus of attention this be equivalent to the restatement of another fact stress in a previous chapter namely that the mind be not a passive thing that stand still but a active thing when you give attention you actively select from a number of possible object one to be clearer than the rest this selection require effort under most condition of study but you may be cheer by the thought that as you develop interest in the field of study and as you develop habit of ignore distraction you will be able to fixate you attention with less and less effort a further important fact be that as you develop power to select object for the consideration of attention you develop simultaneously other mental process -- the ability to memorize to economize time and effort and to control future thought and action in short power to concentrate attention mean power in all the mental process exercise exercise i watch a small dot so far away that it can just be see can you see it all the time how many time a minute do it come and go make what inference you can from this regard the fluctuation of attention during study exercise 2 what concrete step will you take in order to accommodate you study to the fluctuation of attention exercise 3 the next time you have a lapse of attention during study retrace you step of think write down the idea from the last one in you mind to the one which start the digression represent the digression graphically if you can exercise 4 make a list of the thing that most persistently distract you attention during study what specific step will you take to eliminate they to ignore the unavoidable one chapter ix how we reason if you be ask to describe the most embarrassing of you class-room experience you would probably cite the occasion when the instructor ask you a series of question demand close reasoning as he pin you down to statement of fact and force you to draw valid conclusion you feel in a most perplexed frame of mind either you find yourself unable to give reason or you entangle yourself in contradiction in short you flounder about helplessly and feel as though the bottom of you ship of knowledge have drop out and when the ordeal be over and you have make a miserable botch of a recitation which you think you have be perfectly prepare for you complain that if the instructor have follow the book or if he have ask straight question you would have answer every one perfectly have memorize the lesson word for word this complaint so often voice by student reveal the fundamental characteristic which distinguish the mental operation of reasoning from the other we have study in reasoning we face a new kind of situation present difficulty not encounter in the simpler process of sensation memory and imagery and when we attempt to substitute these simple process for reasoning we fail miserably for the two kind of process be essentially different and can not be substitute one for the other broadly speak the mental activity of study may be divide into two group which for want of better name we shall call process of acquisition and process of construction the mental attitude of the first be that of acquirement sometimes we main business seem to be to acquire knowledge certain matter be place before we in book or by we teacher and we be require to master they to make they part of we stock of knowledge at other time we be call upon to use the knowledge we already possess in order to attain some end that be set before we in geography for example so long as we be merely learn the bare fact of the subject the size and contour of the different continent the political division the natural feature we be at the acquisitive stage but when we go on to try to find out the reason why certain fact that we have learn should be as they be and not otherwise we pass to the constructive stage we be work constructively when we seek to discover why it be that great city be so often find on the bank of river why peninsula more frequently turn southward than northward you readily see that this constructive method of study involve the setting and solve of problem as its distinguish feature and that in the solution of these problem we make use of reason a little reflection will show that though there be a distinct difference between process of acquisition and of construction nevertheless the two must not be regard as entirely separate from each other in acquire new fact we must always use a little reason while in constructive work we can not always rely upon have all the necessary matter ready to hand we have frequently to stop we constructive work for a little in order to acquire some new fact that we find to be necessary thus we acquire a certain number of new fact while we be reasoning about thing and while we be engage in acquire new matter we must use we reason at least to some small extent the two overlap then but there be a difference between they from the standpoint of the student and the term denote two fundamentally different attitude which student take in study the two attitude may be illustrate by contrast the two method often use in study geometry some student memorize the theorem and the step in the demonstration recite they verbatim at class-hour other do not memorize but reason out each step to see its relation to the preceding step and when they see it must necessarily follow they pass on to the next and do the same these two type of student apparently arrive at the same conclusion but the mental operation lead up to the qed of each be vastly different the one student do he study by the rote memory method the other by the road of reasoning the former road be usually consider the easier and so we find it most frequently follow to memorize a table a definition or a series of date be relatively easy one know exactly where one be and can keep track of one 's progress and test one 's success some people be attract by such a task and be perfectly happy to follow this plan of study the kind of mind that contents itself with such phonographic record however must be acknowledge to be a commonplace sort of affair we recognize its limitation in ordinary life invariably rating it lower than the mind that can reason to new conclusion and work independently accordingly if we wish to possess mind of superior quality we see that we must develop the reasoning process when we examine the mental process by which we think constructively or in other word reason we find first of all that there be recognition of a problem to be solve when we start to reason we do it because we find ourselves in a situation from which we must extricate ourselves the situation may be physical as when we automobile stop suddenly on a country road or it may be mental as when we be decide what college to attend in both case we recognize that we be face a problem which must be solve after recognition of the problem we next step be to start vigorous effort to solve it in do this we cast about for means we summon all the power at we disposal in the case of the automobile we call to mind other accident and the cause of they we remember that once the spark-plug play out so we test this hypothesis at another time some dust get into the carburetor so we test this so we go on call up possible cause and apply appropriate remedy until the right one be find and the engine be start in bring to bear upon the problem fact from we past experience we form a series of judgment in the case of the problem as to what college to attend we might form these judgment : this college be nearer home that one have a celebrated faculty this one have good laboratory that one be my father 's alma mater so we might go on bring up all the fact regard the problem and fitting each one mentally to see how it work note that this utilization of idea should not consist merely of fumble about in a vague hope of hit upon some solution it must be a systematic search guide by carefully choose idea for example if the clock on the mantle-piece have stop and we have no idea how to make it go again but mildly shake it in the hope that something will happen to set it go we be merely fumble but if on move the clock gently so as to set the pendulum in motion we hear it wobble about irregularly and at the same time observe that there be no ticking of any kind we come to the conclusion that the pendulum have somehow or other escape the little catch that connect it with the mechanism we have be really think from the fact that the pendulum wobble irregularly we infer that it have lose its proper catch from the fact that there be no tick we infer the same thing for even when there be something wrong with the clock that will prevent it from go permanently if the pendulum be set in motion by force from without it will tick for a few seconds before it come to rest again the important point to observe be that there must be inference this be always indicate by the word _ therefore _ or its equivalent if you reach a conclusion without have to use or at any rate to imply a _ therefore _ you may take it for grant that you have not be really think but only jump to conclusion this process of put fact in the form of judgment and draw inference may be liken to a court-room scene where argument be present to the judge as each bit of evidence be submit it be subject to the test of its applicability to the situation or to similar situation in the past it be rigidly examine and nothing be accept as a candidate for the solution until it be find by trial -lrb- of course in imagination -rrb- to be pertinent to the situation the third stage of the reasoning process come when some plan which have be suggest as a possible solution of the difficulty prove effective and we make the decision the argument support or overthrow each other add to and eliminate various consideration until finally only one course appear possible as we say before the solution come inevitably as represent by the word _ therefore _ little active work on we part be necessary for if we have go through these other phase properly the decision will make itself you can not make a wrong decision if you have the fact before you and have give each the proper weight when the solution come it be recognize as right for it come tinge with a feeling that we call belief now that we have find the reasoning process to be one of problem-solving of which the first step be to acknowledge and recognize the difficulty the second to call up various method of solution and the third to decide on the basis of one of the solution that come tinge with certainty we be ready to apply this schema to study in the hope that we may discover the cause and remedy for the reasoning difficulty of student in view of the fact that reasoning start out with a problem you see at once that to make you study effective you must study in problem avoid a habitual attitude of mere acquisition do not memorize fact in the same pattern as they be hand out to you in history in general literature in science do not read fact merely as they come in the text but seek the relation between they voluntarily set before yourself intellectual problem ask yourself _ why _ be this so in other word in you study do not merely acquire but also _ construct _ the former make use mostly of memory and though you memorize be do ever so conscientiously if it comprise the main part of you study you fail to utilize you mind to its fullest extent let we now consider the second stage of the reasoning process as find in study at this stage the fact in the mind be bring forward for the purpose of be fit into the present situation and the essential thing be that you have a large number of fact at you disposal if you be go to reason effectively about problem in history mathematics geography it be absolutely indispensable that you know many fact about the subject one reason why you experience difficulty in reasoning about certain subject be that you do not know enough about they particularly be this true in such subject as political economy sociology and psychology the result of such ignorance be often demonstrate in political and social movement why do the mass so easily fall victim to doubtful reform in national and municipal policy because they do not know enough about these matter to reason intelligently watch ignorant people listen to a demagogue and see what unreasonable thing they accept the speaker propound a question and then proceed to answer it in he own way he make it appear plausible assure he hearer it be the only way and they agree because they do not have enough other fact at they command to refute it they be unable as we say to see the situation in several aspect the mistake in reasoning which child make have a similar basis the child reach for the moon reasoning -- here be something bright i can touch most bright thing therefore i can touch this he reasoning be fallacious because he do not have all the fact this condition be parallel in the class-room when student make what be shamefacedly look back upon as miserable blunder when one of these fiasco occur the cause can many time be refer to the fact that the student do not have enough fact at he command speak broadly the most effective reasoning in a field can be do by one who have have the most extensive experience in that field if one have complete acquaintance with all fact one would have perfect condition for reasoning thus we see that effectiveness in reasoning demand a extensive array of fact accordingly in you course of study you must read with avidity when you be give a list of reading in a course some of which be require and some optional read both set and every new fact thus secure will make you better able to reason in the field but good reasoning demand more than mere quantity of idea the idea must conform to certain qualitative standard before they may be effectively employ in reasoning they must arise with promptness in a orderly manner pertinent to the matter in hand and they must be clear in secure promptness of association on the part of you idea employ the method describe in the chapter on memory make many logical association with clearness and repetition in order to insure the rise of idea in a orderly manner pay attention to the manner in which you acquire they remember thing will be recall as they be impress so the value of you idea in reasoning will depend upon the manner in which you make original impression a further characteristic of serviceable idea be clarity idea be sometimes describe as clear in opposition to muddy you know what be mean by these distinction and you may be assure that one cause for you failure in reasoning be that you idea be not clear this manifest itself in inability to make clear statement and to comprehend clearly the latter condition be easily illustrate when you begin the study of geometry you face a multitude of new term we call they technical term such as projection scalene theory of limit these have to be clearly understand before you could reason in the subject and when in the progress of you study you experience difficulty in reasoning out problem it be very likely due to the fact that you do not master the technical term and as soon as you encounter the difficulty of the course you fail because you foundation lay do not involve the acquisition of clear idea examine you difficulty in reasoning subject and if you find they traceable to vagueness of idea take step to clarify they idea may be clarify in two way : by definition and by classification definition be a familiar device for you have have much to do with it in learn the memorization of definition be a excellent practice not as a end in itself but as a means to the end of effective reasoning throughout you study then pay much attention to definition some you will find in you text but other you will have to make for yourself in order to get practice in this undertake the manufacture of a few definition use term such as charity benevolence natural selection this exercise will reveal what a exacting mental operation definition be and will prove how vague most of you think really be a large stock of definition will help you to think rapidly stand as they do for a large group of experience definition be a means of mental economy for illustration of they service in reasoning suppose you be ask to compare the serf the peon and the american slave if you have a clean-cut definition of each of these term you can readily differentiate between they but if you can not define they you will hardly be able to reason concern they the second means of clarify idea be classification by this be mean the process of group similar idea or similar point of idea for example you idea of serf peon and slave have some point in common group the idea then with reference to these point then in reasoning you can quickly place a idea in its proper group the third stage of the reasoning process be decision base on belief and it come inevitably provide the other two process have be perform rightly accordingly we need say little about its place in study one caution should be point out in make decision do not make they hastily on the basis of only one or two fact wait until you have canvass all the idea that bear importantly upon the case the mass that listen top eagerly to the demagogue do not err merely from lack of idea but partly because they do not utilize all the fact at they disposal this fault be frequently discernible in impulsive people who notoriously make snap-judgment which mean that they decide before canvass all the evidence this trait mark the fundamental difference between superficial and profound thinker the former accept surface fact and decide immediately while the latter refuse to decide until after canvass many fact in the improvement of reasoning ability you task be mainly one of habit formation it be necessary first to form the habit of state thing in the form of problem second to form habit by which idea arise promptly and profusely third to form habit of reserve decision until the important fact be in these be all specific habit that must be build up if the reasoning process of the mind be to be effective already you have form some habit if not habit of careful look into thing then habit of hasty heedless impatient glancing over the surface apply the principle of habit formation already enunciate and remember that with every act of reasoning you perform you be mould yourself into a careless reasoner or a accurate reasoner into a clear thinker or a muddy thinker this chapter show that reasoning be one of the highest power of man it be a mark of originality and intelligence and stamp its possessor not a copier but a originator not a follower but a leader not a slave to have he think foist upon he by other but a free and independent intellect unshackled by the bond of ignorance and convention the man who employ reason in acquire knowledge find delight in study that be deny to a rote memorizer when one look at the world through glass of reason inquire into the eternal _ why _ then fact take on a new meaning knowledge come with new power the fact of experience glow with vitality and one 's own relation with they appear in a new light reading and exercise reading : adam -lrb- 1 -rrb- chapter iv dearborn -lrb- 2 -rrb- chapter v dewey -lrb- 3 -rrb- chapter iii and vi exercise i illustrate the step of the reasoning process by describe the way in which you study this chapter exercise 2 try to define the follow word without the assistance of a dictionary : college university grammatical town-meeting exercise 3 prepare a set of maxim design to help a student change from the rote memory method of study to the reason-why -lrb- or problem -rrb- method chapter x expression as a aid in study in we discussion of the nervous basis underlie study we observe that nerve pathway be affect not only by what enter over the sensory pathway but also by what flow out over the motor pathway as the nerve current travel out from the motor centre in the brain to the muscle they leave trace which modify future thought and action this be so it be easy to see that what we give out be fully as important as what we take in in other word we _ expression _ be just as important as we _ impression _ by expression we mean the motor consequence of we thought and in study they usually take the form of speech and writing of a kind to be specify later the far-reaching effect of motor expression be too infrequently emphasize but psychology force we to give they prime consideration we be first apprise of they importance when we study the nervous system and find that every incoming sensory message push on and on until it find a motor pathway over which it may travel and produce movement this be inevitable the very structure and arrangement of the neurone be such that we be oblige to make some movement in response to object affect we sense organ the extent of movement may vary from the wide-spread tremor that occur when we be frighten by a thunderstorm to the merest flicker of a eye-lash but whatever be its extent movement invariably occur when we be stimulate by some object this have be demonstrate in startling way in the psychological laboratory where even so simple a thing as a piece of figure wall-paper have be show to produce measurable bodily disturbance ordinarily we do not notice these because they be so slight sometimes be merely twitch of deep-seated muscle or slight enlargement or contraction of artery which be very responsive to nerve current but no matter how large or how small we may be sure that movement always occur on the excitation of a sense organ this lead we to assert in a earlier chapter that the function of the nervous system be to convert incoming sensory current into outgoing motor current so ingrained be this tendency toward movement that we do not need even a sensory cue to start it off a idea will do as well in other word the nervous current need not start at a sense organ but may start in the brain and still produce movement this fact be embody in the law of ideo-motor action -lrb- distinguish from sensory-motor action -rrb- every idea in the mind tend to express itself in movement this motor character of idea be manifest in a most thorough-going way and render we muscular system a faithful mirror of we thought we have in the psychological laboratory delicate apparatus which enable we to measure many of these slight movement for example we fasten a recording device to the top of a person 's head so that he slightest movement will be record then we ask he while stand perfectly still to think of a object at he right side after several moment the record show that he involuntarily lean in the direction of the object about which he be think we find further illustration of this law when we examine people as they read for they involuntarily accompany the reading with movement of speech measurable in the muscle of the throat the tongue and the lip these fact and many other constitute good evidence for the statement that idea seek expression in movement the ethical consequence of this be so momentous that we must remark upon they in pass we now see the force of the biblical statement not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man but that which proceedeth out of the mouth this defileth the man think what it mean to one 's character that every thought harbor in the mind be bind to come out it may not manifest itself at once in overt action but it affect the motor pathway and either weaken or strengthen connection so that when the opportunity come some act will be further or hinder in view of the proneness to permit base thought to enter the mind human being might sometimes fear even to think a more optimistic idea however be that noble thought lead to noble act therefore keep in you mind the kind of thought that you wish to see actualize in you character and the appropriate act will follow of they own accord but it be with the significance of expression in study that we be at present concerned and here we find they of supreme importance we ordinarily regard learn as a process of take thing into the mind and regard expression as a thing apart from acquisition of knowledge we shall find in this discussion however that there be no such sharp demarcation between acquire knowledge and express knowledge but that the two be intimately bind together expression be properly a part of wise and economical learning when we survey the mode of expression that may be use in study we find they to be of several kind speech be one this be the form of expression for which the class-recitation be provide if you wish to grow as a student utilize the recitation period and welcome every chance to recite orally for thing about which you recite in class be more effectively learn talk about a subject under all circumstance will help you learn when study subject like political economy sociology or psychology seize every opportunity to talk over the question involve hold frequent conference with you instructor voice you difficulty freely and the very effort to state they will help to clarify they it be a good plan for two student in the same course to come together and talk over the problem the debate thus stimulate and the question arouse by mental interaction be very helpful in impress fact more vividly upon the mind writing be a form of expression and be one thing that give value to note-taking and examination its value be further recognize by the requirement of theme and term-papers these be all medium by which you may develop yourself and they merit you earnest cooperation another medium of expression that student may profitably employ be draw this be especially valuable in such subject as geology physiology and botany student in botany be compel to do much drawing of the plant-form which they study and this be a wise requirement for it make they observe more carefully report more faithfully and recall with greater ease you may secure the same advantage by employ the graphic method in other study for example when read in a geology text-book about the stratification of the earth in a certain region draw the part describe and label they accord to the description you will be surprise to see how clear the description become and how easily it be later recall let we examine the effect of the expressive movement of speech writing and the like and see the mechanism by which they facilitate the study process we may describe they effect in two way : neurologically and psychologically as may be expect from we preliminary study of the nervous system we see they first effect upon the motor pathway lead out to the muscle each passage of the nerve current from brain to muscle leave trace so that the result act be perform with greater ease upon each repetition this fact have already be emphasize by the warning guard the avenue of expression especially be it important at the first performance of a act because this determine the path of later performance in such study as piano-playing vocalizing and pronunciation of foreign word see that you first performance be absolutely right then as the expressive movement be repeat they will be more firmly ingrain because of the deepen of the motor pathway the next effect of act of expression be to be find in the modification make in the sensory area of the brain you will recall that every movement of a muscle produce nervous current which go back to the brain and register there in the form of kinaesthetic sensation to demonstrate kinaesthetic sensation close you eye and move you index finger up and down you can feel the muscle contracting and the tendon move back and forth even into the back of the hand these sensation ordinarily escape we attention but they occupy a prominent place in the control of we action for example when ascend familiar stair in the dark they notify we when we have reach the top we be still further impressed with they importance when we be deprive of they when we try to walk upon a foot or a leg that have go to sleep that be when the kinaesthetic nerve be temporarily paralyze we find it difficult to walk but besides be use to control muscular action they may be use in study for they may be make the source of impression and impression as we learn in the chapter on memory be a prime requisite for learn each expression become then through its kinaesthetic result the source of new impression when for example you pronounce the german word _ anwenden _ with the english word to employ in addition to the impression make through the ear you make impression through the muscle of speech -lrb- kinaesthetic impression -rrb- and these kinaesthetic impression enter into the body of you knowledge and later may serve as the means by which the word may be revive when you write the word you make kinaesthetic impression which may later serve as form of revival so the movement of expression produce sensory material that may serve as tentacle by means of which you can later reach back into you memory and recall fact we shall now consider another service of expression which though little regarded nevertheless be of much moment when we make expressive movement much nervous energy be generate much more than during passive impression energy be send back to the brain over the kinaesthetic nerve cell and the greater the extent of the movement the greater be the amount of new energy send to the brain it pour into the brain and diffuse itself especially throughout the association area here it excite region which could not be excite by a more limited amount of energy this mean in psychical term that new idea be be arouse the obvious inference from this fact be that you may by start movement of expression actually summon to you assistance add power of mind for example when you be call upon to recite in class you mind seem to be a complete blank -- in a state of deadlock you may break this deadlock and start brain-action by some kind of movement it may be only to clear you throat to ejaculate well or to squirm about in the seat but whatever form the movement take it will usually be effective in create the desire nervous energy and after the inertia be once overcome the mental stream will flow freely the unconscious application of this device be see when a man be call on suddenly to make a speech for which he have not prepare he usually start out by tell a story thus liberating nervous energy to pour back into the brain and start think process with increase vehemence of expression the idea come more and more freely and the result be a speech which surpass the expectation of the speaker himself the gesticulation of many speaker have this same function be frequently of great service in arouse more nervous energy which go back to the brain and arouse more idea the device of stimulate idea by expressive movement may be utilize in theme - or letter-writing it be generally recognize that the difficult thing in such writing be to get a start and the too common practice be to sit listlessly gaze into space wait for inspiration this be usually a futile procedure the better way be to begin to write anything about the topic in hand what you write may have little merit either of substance or form nevertheless if you persist in keep up the activity of write make more and more movement you will find that the idea will begin to come in greater profusion until they come so fast you can hardly write they down have try to picture the neural effect of expression we may now translate they into psychological term ask what service the expression render to the conscious side of we study first of all we note that the expression help to make the act and idea in study habitual we find ourselves with each expression better able to perform such act as the pronunciation of foreign word second they furnish new impression through the kinaesthetic sense thus be a source of sense-impression third they give rise to a greater number of idea and link they up with the idea dominant at the moment there be a further psychological effect of expression in the clarification of idea it be a well-attested fact that when we attempt to explain a thing to someone else it become clearer in we own mind you can demonstrate this for yourself by attempt to explain to someone a intricate conception such as the nebular hypothesis the effort involve in make the explanation make the fact more vivid to you the habit of thus utilize you knowledge in conversation be a excellent one to acquire indeed expression be the only objective test of knowledge and we can not say that we really know until we can express we knowledge expression be thus the great clarification agency and the test of knowledge before leave this discussion it might be well to remark upon one phase of expression that be sometimes a source of difficulty this be the embarrassment incident to some form of expression notably oral many people be deter from utilize this form of expression because of shyness and embarrassment in the presence of other if you have this difficulty in such excess that it hinder you from free expression resolve at once to overcome it begin at the very outset of you academic career to form habit of disregard you impulse to act in frightened manner take a course in public speak the practice thus secure will be a great aid in develop habit of fearless and free oral expression this discussion have show that expression be a powerful aid in learning and be a most important feature of mental life cultivate you power of expression for you college education should consist not only in the development of habit of impression but also in the development of habit of expression grasp eagerly every opportunity for the development of skill in clear and forceful expression devote assiduous attention to theme and all write work and make serious effort to speak well remember you be form habit that will persist throughout you life emphasize therefore at every step method of expression for it be this phase of learn in which you will find greatest growth exercise exercise i give a example from you own experience show how expression -lrb- a -rrb- stimulate idea -lrb- b -rrb- clarify idea chapter xi how to become interested in a subject i can not get interested in mediaeval history this illustrate a kind of complaint frequently make by college student it be we purpose in this chapter to show the fallacy of this to prove that interest may be develop in a uninteresting subject and to show how in order to lay a firm foundation for we psychologize let we examine into the nature of interest and see what it really be it have be define as : the recognition of a thing which have be vitally connect with experience before -- a thing recognize as old impulse to attend interest naturally arouse tendency to act the root idea of the term seem to be that of be engage engross or entirely take up with some activity because of its recognize worth interest mark the annihilation of the distance between the person and the material and result of he action it be the sign of they organic union in addition to the characteristic just mention should be note the pleasurableness that usually attend any activity in which we be interested a grow feeling of pleasure be the sign which notify we that we be grow interested in a subject and it be such a aid in the performance of work that we should seek earnestly to acquire it in connection with any work we have to do the person who make the complaint at the head of this chapter notice that they take interest easily in certain thing : a jack london story a dish of ice cream a foot-ball game and they take interest in they so spontaneously and effortlessly that they think these interest must be bear within they when we examine carefully the interest of man and trace they source we see that the above view be fallacious we acquire most of we interest in the course of we experience professor jame assert : a adult man 's interest be almost every one of they intensely artificial they have be slowly build up the object of professional interest be most of they in they original nature repulsive but by they connection with such natively exciting object as one 's personal fortune one 's social responsibility and especially by the force of inveterate habit they grow to be the only thing for which in middle life a man profoundly care since interest be largely product of experience then it follow that if we wish to have a interest in a give subject we must consciously and purposefully develop it there be wide choice open to we we may develop interest in early victorian literature prize-fight promote social theory lignitic rock history of siam the collection of scarab mediaeval history we should not be deceive by the glibness of the above statement into assume that the development of interest be a easy matter it require adherence to certain definite psychological law which we may call the law of interest the first may be state as follow : _ in order to develop interest in a subject secure information about it _ the force of this law will be apparent as soon as we analyze one of we already-developed interest let we take one that be quite common -- the interest which a typical young girl take in a movie star she interest in he come largely from what she have be able to learn about he the name of the production in which he have appear he age the color of he automobile he favorite novel she interest may be say actually to consist at least in part of these fact the astute press agent know the force of this law and at well-timed interval he let slip through bit of information about the star which fan the interest of the fair devotee to a still whiter heat the relation of information to interest be still further illustrate by the case of the typical university professor or scientist he be interested in certain object of research -- infusorium electron plant ecology -- because he know so much about they he interest may be say to _ consist _ partly of the body of knowledge that he possess he be not always interested in the specific obscure field but by saturating himself in fact about it he have develop a interest in it amount to passionate absorption which manifest itself in absent-mindedness of such profundity as to make he often a object of wonder and ridicule let we demonstrate the application of the law again show how interest may be develop in a specific college subject let we choose one that be generally regard as so difficult and abstract that not many people be interested in it -- philology the study of language as a science let we imagine that we be try to interest a student of law in this as a first step we shall select some legal term and show what philology can tell about it a term frequently encounter in law be indenture -- a certain form of contract philological research have uncover a interesting history regard this word it seem that in olden day when two person make a agreement they write it on two piece of paper then notch the edge so that when place together the notch on the edge of one paper would just match those of the other this protect both party against substitution of a fraudulent contract at time of fulfillment still earlier in man 's development before he could write it be customary to record such agreement by break a stick in two piece and leave the jagged end to be fit together at time of fulfillment sometimes a bone be use this way because its critical feature be the saw-toothed edge this kind of contract be call indenture -lrb- derive from the root _ dent _ -- tooth the same one from which we derive we word dentist -rrb- the formal legal-looking document which we today call a indenture give we no hint of its humble origin but the word when analyze by the technique of philology tell the whole story and throw much light upon the legal practice of we forbear have discover one such valuable fact in philology the student of law may be lead to investigate the science still further and find many more as a result still he will become interested in philology by this illustration we have demonstrate the first psychological law of interest and also its corollary which be : _ state the new in term of the old _ for we not only give we lawyer new information cull from philological source we also introduce we fact in term of a old fact which be already interesting to the lawyer this be recognize as such a important principle in education that it have become embody in a maxim : proceed from the know to the unknown a classic example of good educational practice in this connection be the way in which franci w parker a progressive educator of a former generation teach geography when he desire to show how water run over hard rocky soil produce a niagara he take he class down to the creek behind the school house build a dam and allow the water to flow over it when he wish to show how water flow over soft ground result in a deltoid nile he take the class to a low flat portion of the creek bed and point out the effect the creek bed constitute a old familiar element in the child 's experience niagara and the nile describe in term of it be intelligible naturally in modern educational practice it be not always possible to have miniature waterfall and river bottom at hand still it be possible to follow this principle when in study mediaeval history you read a description of the guild do not regard they as distant cold inert institution devoid of significance in you life rather think of they in term of thing you already know : modern labor union technical school in so far as the comparison hold good then trace they industrial descendant down to the present time by thus think about the guild hitherto distant and uninteresting you will begin to see they suffuse with mean alight with significance a real part of yourself in short you will have achieve interest there be still another psychological law of interest : _ in order to develop interest in a subject exert activity toward it _ we see the force of this law when we observe a man in the process of develop a interest in golf at the start he may have no interest in it whatever he may even deride it yield to the importunity of he friend however he take he stick in hand and sample the game then he begin to relent admit that perhaps there may be something interesting about the game after all as he practise with greater frequency he begin to develop a warmer and still warmer interest until finally he think of little else neglect social and professional obligation and bore he friend _ ad nauseum _ with recital of golfing incident the method by which the new-fledged golfer develop a interest in golf will apply with equal effectiveness in the case of a student in try to become interested in mediaeval history keep actively engage in it read book after book deal with the subject apply it to you study in political economy english and american history choose sub-topic in mediaeval history as the subject for theme in english composition course try to help some other student in the class take part in class discussion and talk informally with the instructor outside of the classroom use you ingenuity to devise method of keep active toward the subject presently you will discover that the subject no longer appear cold and forbid but that it glow warm with virility that it have become interesting it will readily be notice that the two law of interest here set forth be closely interrelate one can hardly seek information about a subject without exert activity toward it conversely one can not maintain activity on behalf of a subject without at the same time acquire information about it these two easily-remembered and easily-applied rule of study will go far toward solve some of the most try condition of student life memorize they apply they and you will find yourself in possession of a power which will stay with you long after you quit college wall one which you may apply with profit in many different situation of life we have show in this chapter the fallacy of the assumption that a student can not become genuinely interested in a subject which at first seem uninteresting we have show that he may develop interest in any subject if he but employ the proper psychological method that he must obey the two-fold law -- secure information about the subject -lrb- state the new in term of the old -rrb- and exert activity toward it that when he have thus light the flame of interest he will find he entire intellectual life illuminate glowing with purpose resplendent with success in conclude this discussion we should note the wide difference between the quality of study which be do with interest and that do without it under the latter condition the student be a slave a drudge under the former a god a creator touch by the galvanic spark he see new significance in every page in every line as he vision enlarge he perceive new relation between he study and he future aim indeed between he study and the progress of the universe and he go to he educational task not as a prisoner weight down by ball and chain but as a eager prospector infatuate by the lust for gold encourage by the continual store of new thing he uncover intoxicate by the ozone of mental activity he delve continually deeper until finally he emerge rich with knowledge and full of power -- the intellectual power that signify mastery over a subject reading and exercise reading : jame -lrb- 8 -rrb- chapter x and xi dewey -lrb- 3 -rrb- exercise i show how you interest in some subject for example the game of foot-ball have grow in proportion to the number of fact you have discover about it and the activity you have exert toward it exercise 2 choose some subject in which you be not at present interested make the statement : -- i be determine to develop a interest in -- i will take the follow specific step toward this end chapter xii the plateau of despond in we investigation of the psychology of study we have so far direct we attention chiefly toward the subjective side of the question seek to discover the _ contents _ of mind during study we shall now take a objective view of study examine not the contents of mind nor method of study but the objective result of study in do this we choose certain unit of measurement the number of minute require for learn a give amount or the amount learn in a stated period of time we may do this for the learning of any material whether it be greek verb or typewrite all that be necessary be to decide upon some method by which progress can be note and express in numerical unit this you will observe constitute a statistical approach to the process of study such as be employ in science and just as the statistical method have be useful in science so it may be of value in education and by means of statistical investigation of learn we may hope to discover some of the factor operative in good learning progress in learning be best observable when we represent we measurement graphically when they take the form of a curve variously call the curve of efficiency practice curve learn curve we shall take a sample curve for the basis of we discussion show the progress of a beginner in the russian language for sixty-five day -lrb- indicate in the figure by horizontal division -rrb- the student study industriously for thirty minute each day and then translate as rapidly as possible for fifteen minute the number of word translate be represent by the vertical space on the chart thus on the tenth day twenty-five word be translate on the twentieth day forty-five word -lrb- illustration -lrb- graph -rrb- : study of russian -rrb- in make a analysis of this typical curve we note immediately a exceed irregularity at one time there be extraordinary improvement but a later measurement register pronounced loss this irregularity be very common in learn some day we do a great amount of work and do it well but perhaps the very next day show marked diminution in we work the second characteristic we note be that there be extremely rapid progress at the begin the curve slant up quite sharply this be common in learn and may be account for in several way in the first place the easiest thing come first for example when you be begin the study of german you be give mostly monosyllabic word to learn these be easily remembered hence progress be rapid a second reason be that at the beginning there be many different respects in which progress can be make for example the beginner in german must learn noun case ending declension of adjective day of the week in short a vast number of new thing all at once at a later period however the number of new thing to be learn be much smaller and improvement can not be so rapid a third reason why learn proceeds more rapidly at first be that the interest be greater at this time you have doubtless many time experience this fact and you know that when a thing have the interest of novelty you work harder upon it if you will examine the learning curve closely you will note that after the initial spurt there be a slow up the curve at this point resemble a plateau and indicate cessation of progress if not retrogression this period of no progress be regard as a characteristic of the learning curve and be a time of great discouragement to the conscientious student so distressing that we may designate it the plateau of despond most people describe it as a time when they feel unable to learn more about a subject the mind seem to be sate new idea can not be assimilate and old one seem to be forget the plateau may extend for a long or a short time depend upon the nature of the subject-matter and the length of time over which the learning extend in the case of professional training it may extend over a year or more in the case of grow child in school it sometimes happen that a entire year elapse during which the learning of a apparently bright student be retard in a course of study in high school or college it may come on about the third week and extend a month or more something akin to the plateau may come in the course of a day when we realize that we efficiency be greatly diminish and we seem for a hour or more to make no progress inasmuch as the plateau be such a common occurrence in human activity we should analyze it and see what factor operate to influence it it be interesting to note that the plateau generally occur just before a abrupt rise in efficiency this be significant for it may mean that the plateau be necessary in learn especially just before reach the really advanced stage of proficiency accordingly when you be experience a plateau in the mastery of some accomplishment you may perhaps derive some comfort from the prospect of a approach rise in efficiency on the theory that it be a necessary part of learn it have be regard as a rest place we be so constitute by nature that we can not run on indefinitely nature sometimes must call a halt consequently the plateau may be a warning that we can not learn more for the present and that the proper remedy be to refrain for a little while from further effort in that line we have possible justification for this interpretation when we reflect that a vacation do we much good and though we begin it feel stale we end it feel much fresher and more efficient but to stop work temporarily be not the only way to meet a plateau and fatigue or ennui be probably not the sole or most compelling explanation it may be that we should not regard the objective result as the true measure of learn perhaps learn be go on even though the result be not apparent we discover something in the nature of unconscious learning in we discussion of memory and it may be that a period of little objective progress mark a period of active unconscious learning another meaning which the plateau may have be simply to mark place of greater difficulty as already remark the early period be a stage of comparative ease but as the work become more difficult progress be slower it be also quite likely that the plateau may indicate that some of the factor operative at the start be operative no longer thus although the learning be rapid at the beginning because the material learn at that time be easy the plateau may come because the thing to be learn have become difficult or whereas the beginning be attack with considerable interest the plateau may mean that the interest be die down and that less effort be be exert if these theory be the true explanation of the plateau we see that it be not to be regard as a time of reduction in learn to be contemplate with despair the appropriate attitude may be one of resignation with the determination to make it as slightly disturbing as possible but though the reason just describe may have something to do with the production of the plateau as yet we have no evidence that the plateau can not be dispense with it be practically certain that the plateau be not cause entirely by necessity for rest or unconscious learn it frequently be due we must regretfully admit to poor early preparation if at the beginning of a period of learn a insecure foundation be lay it can not be expect to support the burden of more difficult subject-matter we have enumerate a number of the explanation that have be advance to account for the plateau and have see that it may have several cause among which be necessity for rest increase difficulty of subject-matter loss of interest and insufficient preparation in try to eliminate the plateau we remedy should be adapt to the cause in recognition of the fact that learn proceeds irregularly we see that it be rational to expect the amount of effort to be exert throughout a period of learn to vary it will vary partly with the difficulty of subject-matter and partly with fluctuation in bodily and mental efficiency which be bind to occur from day to day since this irregularity be bind to occur you may well make you effort vary from one extreme to the other at time perhaps you most profitable move may be to take a complete vacation the vacation might cover several week a week-end or if the plateau be merely a low period in the day 's work then ten minute may suffice for a vacation as a adjunct to such rest period some form of recreation should usually be plan for the essential thing be to permit the mind to rest from the tiresome activity if you plateau represent greater difficulty of subject-matter and loss of interest you duty be plainly to work harder in exert more effort make some change in you method of study for example if you have be accustom to study a certain subject by silent reading begin to read you lesson aloud change you method of take note or change the hour of day in which you prepare you lesson in short try any of the method describe in this book and use you own ingenuity and the change in method may overcome the plateau if a plateau be due to we last-mentioned cause insufficient preparation the remedy must be drastic to make new resolution and to put forth additional effort be not enough you must go back and relay the foundation make a thorough review of the work which you cover slightingly make sure that every step be clear this process be describe in a earlier chapter as the clarification of idea and be absolutely essential in build up a structure of knowledge that will stand indeed as you take various course you will find that you study will be much improve by periodical review the benefit can not all be enumerate here but we may reasonably claim that a review will be very likely to remove a plateau and use with the other remedy herein suggest will help you to rid yourself of one of the most discouraging feature of student life reading and exercise reading : swift -lrb- 20 -rrb- chapter iv exercise i describe one or more plateau that you have observe in you own experience what do you regard as the cause chapter xiii mental second-wind do you ever engage in any exhausting physical work for a long period of time if so you probably remember that as you proceed you become more and more fatigued finally reach a point when it seem that you could not endure the strain another minute you have just decide to give up when suddenly the fatigue seem to diminish and new energy seem to come from some source this curious thing which happen frequently in athletic activity be know as second-wind and be describe by those who have experience it as a time of increase power when the work be do with greater ease and effectiveness and with a freshness and vigor in great contrast to the staleness that precede it it be as though one tap a level of new energy reveal hidden store of unexpected power and it be commonly report that with persistence in push one 's self farther and farther a third and fourth wind may be uncovered each one lead to greater height of achievement this phenomenon occur not alone on the physical plane it be discernible in mental exertion as well true we seldom experience it because we be mentally lazy and have the habit of stop we work at the first sign of fatigue do we persist however disregard fatigue and ennui we should find ourselves tap vast reserve of mental power and accomplish mental feat of astonishing brilliancy the occasional occurrence of the phenomenon of second-wind give ground for the statement that we possess more energy than we ordinarily use there be several line of evidence for this statement one be to be find in the energize effect of emotional excitement under the impetus of anger a man show far greater strength than he ordinarily use similarly a mother manifest the strength of a tigress when she young be endanger a second line of evidence be furnish by the effect of stimulant alcohol bring to the fore surprising reserve of physical and psychic energy lastly we have innumerable instance of accession of strength under the stimulus of a idea under the domination of a all-absorbing idea one perform feat of extraordinary strength utilize store of energy otherwise out of reach we have only to read of the heroic achievement of little joan of arc for a example of such manifestation of reserve power when we examine this accession of energy we find it to be describable in several way -- physiologically neurologically and psychologically the physiological effect consist in a heightening of the bodily function in general the muscle become more ready to act the circulation be accelerate the breathing more rapid curious thing take place in various gland throughout the body one the adrenal gland have be the object of special study and have be show upon the arousal of these reserve of energy to produce a secretion of the utmost importance in provide for sudden emergency this little gland be located above the kidney and be arouse to intense activity at time pour out into the blood a fluid that go all over the body some of its effect be to furnish the blood with chemical that act as fuel to the muscle assist they to contract more vigorously to make the lung more active in introduce oxygen into the system to make the heart more active in distribute the blood throughout the body such glandular activity be a important physiological condition of these higher level of energy in neurological term the increase in energy consist in the flow of more nervous energy into the brain particularly into those area where it be need for certain kind of controlled thought and action a abundance of nervous energy be very advantageous for as have be intimate in a former chapter nervous energy be diffuse and spread over all the pathway that be easily permeable to its distribution this result in the use of considerable area of brain surface and knit up many association so that one idea call up many other idea this lead we to recognize the psychological condition of increase energy which be first the presence of more idea second the more facile flow of idea the whole accompany by a state of marked pleasurableness pleasure be a notable effect of increase energy when work progress rapidly and satisfactorily it be accomplish with great zest and a feeling almost akin to exaltation these condition describe to some degree the condition when we be do efficient work since we be endowed with the energy requisite for such efficient work the obvious question be why do we not more frequently use it the answer be to be find in the fact that we have form the habit of give up before we create condition of high efficiency you will note that the condition require long-continued exertion and resolute persistence this be difficult and we indulgently succumb to the first symptom of fatigue before we have more than scratch the surface of we real potentiality because of the prominent place occupy by fatigue in thus be responsible for we diminished output we shall briefly consider its place in study everyone who have study will agree that fatigue be a almost invariable attendant of continuous mental exertion we shall lay down the proposition at the start however that the awareness of fatigue be not the same as the objective fatigue in the organ of the body fatigue should be regard as a twofold thing -- a state of mind designate its subjective aspect and a condition of various part of the body designate its objective aspect the former be observable by introspection the latter by analysis of bodily secretion and by measurement of the diminution of work entirely without reference to the way the mind regard the work fatigue subjectively or fatigue as we _ feel _ it be not at all the same as fatigue as manifest in the body if we be to make two curve the one show the advancement of the _ feeling _ of fatigue and the other show the advancement of impotence on the part of the bodily process the two curve would not at all coincide stated another way fatigue be a complex thing a product of idea feeling and sensation and sometimes the idea overbalance the sensation and we think we be more tired then we be objectively it be this fact that account for we too rapid give up when we be engage in hard work a psychological analysis of the subjective side of fatigue will make its true nature more apparent probably the first thing we find in the mind when fatigue be a large mass of sensation they be refer to various part of the body mostly the part where muscular activity have be most violent and prolonged not all of the sensation however be intense enough to be localizable some be so vague that we merely say we be tire all over these vague sensation be often overlook nevertheless as will be show later they may be exceedingly important but sensation be not the only contents of the mind at time of fatigue feeling be present also usually of a very unpleasant kind they be related partly to the sensation mention above which be essentially painful and they be feeling of boredom and ennui we have yet to examine the idea in mind and they behavior at time of fatigue they come sluggishly association be make slowly and inaccurately and we make many mistake but constriction of idea be not the sole effect of fatigue at such a time there be usually other idea in the mind not relevant to the fatiguing task of the moment and exceedingly distracting often they be so insistent in force themselves upon we attention that we throw up the work without further effort it be practically certain that much of we fatigue be due not to real weariness and inability to work but to the presence of idea that appear so attractive in contrast with the work in hand that we say we be tire of the latter what we really mean be that we would rather do something else these obtrude idea be often introduce into we mind by other people who tell we that we have work long enough and ought to come and play and though we may not have feel tire up to this point still the suggestion be so strong that we immediately begin to feel tired various social situation can arouse the same suggestion for example as the clock near quit time we feel that we ought to be tire so we allow ourselves to think we be let we now examine the bodily condition to see what fatigue be objectively physiologically it have be demonstrate that fatigue be accompany by three sort of change first poison accumulate in the blood and affect the action of the nervous system as have be show by direct analysis mosso select two dog as nearly alike as possible one he keep tie all day the other he exercise until by night it be thoroughly tired then he transfuse the blood of the tired animal into the vein of the rest one and produce in he all the sign of fatigue that be show by the other there can be no doubt that the waste product of the body accumulate in the blood and interfere with the action of the nerve cell and muscle it be probable that these accumulation come as a result of mental as well as of physical work a second change in fatigue have be find in the cell body of the neurone hodge show that the size of the nucleus of the cell in the spinal cord of a bee diminish nearly 75 per cent as a result of the day 's activity and that the nucleus become much less solid a third change that have be demonstrate as a result of muscular work be the accumulation of waste product in the muscle tissue fatigue muscle contain considerable percentage of these product that they be important factor in the fatigue process have be show by wash they from a fatigued muscle as a result the muscle gain new capacity for work the experiment be perform on the muscle of a frog that have be cut from the body and fatigue by electrical stimulation when they will no longer respond they sensitivity may be renew by wash they in dilute alcohol or in a weak salt solution that will dissolve the product of fatigue it be probable that these product stimulate the sense-organ in the muscle and thus give some of the sensation of fatigue of these physical effect of fatigue the accumulation of waste product in the blood and the effect upon the nerve cell be probably common both to mental and physical fatigue the effect upon the muscle play a part in mental fatigue only so far as all mental work involve some muscular activity by this time you must be convince that the subject of fatigue be exceedingly complicate that its effect be manifest differently in mind and body in relieve fatigue the first step to be take be to rest properly man can not work incessantly he must rest sometimes and it be just as important to know how to rest efficiently as to know how to work efficiently by this be not mean that one should rest as soon as fatigue begin to be feel quite the reverse keep on work all the harder if you wish the second-wind to appear perhaps two hour will exhaust you first supply of energy and will leave you greatly fatigue do not give up at this time however push yourself farther in order to uncover the second layer of energy before enter upon this however it will be possible to secure some advantage by rest for about fifteen minute do not rest longer than this or you may lose the momentum already secure and you two hour will have go for naught if one indulge in too long a rest the energy seem to run down and more effort be require to work it up again than be originally expend it be also important to observe the proper mental condition during rest do not spend the fifteen minute in get interested in some other object for that will leave distracting idea in the mind which will persist when you resume work make the rest a time of physical and mental relief move cramp muscle rest you eye and let you thought idly wander then come back to work in ten or fifteen minute and you will be amaze at the refresh feeling with which you do you work and at the accession of new energy that will come to you keep on at this new plane and you work will take on all the attribute of the second-wind level of efficiency besides plan intelligent rest you may also adjust yourself to fatigue by arrange you daily program so as to do you hardest work when you be fresh and you easiest when you efficiency be low in other word you be a human dynamo and should adjust yourself to the different load you carry when carry a heavy load employ you best energy but when carry only a light load exert a proportionate amount of energy every student have task of a routine nature which do not require a high degree of energy such as copying material plan to perform such work when you stock of energy be lowest one of the best way to insure the attainment of a higher plane of mental efficiency be to assume a attitude of interestedness this be a emotional state and we have see that emotion call forth great energy a final aid in promote increase of energy be that gain through stimulate idea other thing be equal the student who be animated by a stimulate idea work more diligently and effectively than one without the idea may be a lofty professional ideal it may be a desire to please one 's family a sense of duty or a wish to excel whatever it be a idea may stimulate to extraordinary achievement adopt some compelling aim if you have none a vocational aim often serve as a powerful incentive throughout one 's student life a idea may operate for even more transient purpose it may make one oblivious to present discomfort to a remarkable degree this be accomplish through the aid of suggestion when feeling of fatigue approach you may ward they off by resolutely suggest to yourself that you be feel fresh above all the will be effective in lift one to higher level of efficiency it be notorious that a single effort of the will such as say ` no ' to some habitual temptation or perform some courageous act will launch a man on a higher level of energy for day and week will give he a new range of power ` in the act of uncork the whiskey bottle which i have bring home to get drunk upon ' say a man to I ' i suddenly find myself run out into the garden where i smash it on the ground i feel so happy and uplift after this act that for two month i be not tempt to touch a drop ' but the result of exertion of the will be not usually so immediate and you may accept it as a fact that in raise yourself to a higher level of energy you can not do it by a single effort continuous effort be require until the higher level of energy have _ form the habit _ of respond when work be to be do in lay the burden upon nature 's mechanism of habit you see you be again face to face with the proposition lay down at the beginning of the book -- that education consist in the process of form habit of mind the particular habit most important to cultivate in connection with the production of second-wind be the habit of resist fatigue form the habit of persist in spite of apparent obstacle and limitation though they seem almost unsurmountable they be really only superficial bury deep within you be store of energy that you yourself be unaware of they will assist you in accomplish feat far greater than you think yourself capable of draw upon these resource and you will find yourself gradually live and work upon a higher plane of efficiency improve the quality of you work increase the quantity of you work and enhance you enjoyment in work reading and exercise reading : jame -lrb- 9 -rrb- seashore -lrb- 14 -rrb- chapter iii swift -lrb- 20 -rrb- chapter v exercise i describe condition you have observe at time of second-wind in connection with prolonged -lrb- a -rrb- physical exertion -lrb- b -rrb- intellectual exertion chapter xiv examination one of the most vexatious period of student life be examination time this be almost universally a time of great distress give rise in extreme case to condition of nervous collapse the reason for this be not far to seek for upon the result of examination frequently depend momentous consequence such as valuable appointment diploma degree and other important event in the life of a student in view of the importance of examination then it be natural that they be regard with considerable fear and trepidation and it be important that we devise what rule we can for meet they exactious demand with greatest ease and effectiveness examination serve several purpose the foremost of which be to inform the examiner regard the amount of knowledge possess by the student in discover this two method may be employ first to test whether or not the student know certain thing plainly a reproductive exercise second to see how well the student can apply he knowledge but this be not the only function of a examination it also show the student how much he know or do not know again the examination often serve as a incentive to harder work on the part of the student for if one know there will be a examination in a subject one usually study with greater zeal than when a examination be not expect lastly a examination may help the student to link up fact in new way and to see they in new relationship in this aspect you readily see that examination constitute a valuable device in learning but student be not very patient in philosophize about the purpose of examination declare that if examination be a necessary part of the educational process they wish some advice that will enable they to pass examination easily and with credit to themselves so we shall turn we attention to the practical problem of pass examination we first duty in give advice be to call attention to the necessity for faithful work throughout the course of study some student seem to think that they can slight they work throughout a course and by vigorous cram at the end make up for slight work and pass the examination this be a extremely dangerous attitude to take it might work with certain kind of subject-matter a certain type of student-mind and a certain kind of examiner but as a general practice it be a most treacherous method of pass a course the greatest objection from a psychological standpoint be that we have reason to believe that learn thus concentrated be not so permanently effective as that extend over a long period of time for instance a german course extend over a year have much to commend it over a course with the same number of recitation-hours crowd into two month we already discuss the reason for this in chapter vi when we show the beneficial result come from the distribution of impression over a period of time against cram it may further be urge that the hasty impression of a mass of new material be not likely to be lasting particularly be this true when the cram be make specifically for a certain examination as we see in the chapter on memory the intention to remember affect the firmness of retention and if the cram be do merely with reference to the examination the fact learn may be forget and never be available for future use so we may lay it down as a rule that feverish exertion at the end of a course can not replace conscientious work throughout the course in spite of these objection however we must admit that cram have some value if it do not take the form of new acquisition of fact but consist more of a manipulation of fact already learn as a method of review it have a eminently proper place and may well be regard as indispensable some student it be true assert that they derive little benefit from a pre-examination review but one be incline to question they method we have already find that learning be characteristically aid by review and that recall be facilitate by recency of impression review just before examination serve the memory by provide repetition and recency which as we learn in the chapter on memory be condition for favorable impression a further value of cram be that by means of such a summarize review one be able to see fact in a greater number of relation than before it too often happen that when fact be take up in a course they come in a more or less detach form but at the conclusion of the course a review will show the fact in perspective and will disclose many new relation between they another advantage of cram be that at such a time one usually work at a high plane of efficiency the task of review in a few hour the work of a entire course be so huge that the attention be closely concentrated impression be make vividly and the entire mentality be tune up so that fact be well impressed coordinate and retain these advantage be not all present in the more leisurely learning of a course so we see that cram may be regard as a useful device in learn we must not forget that many of the advantage secure by cram be dependent upon the method pursue there be good method and poor method of cram one of the most reprehensible of the latter be to get into a flurry and scramble madly through a mass of fact without regard to they relation to each other this method be characterize by breathless haste and a anxious fear lest something be miss or forget perhaps its most serious evil be its formlessness and lack of plan in other word the fact should not be seize upon singly but should be regard in the light of they different relation with each other suppose for example you be review for a examination in mediaeval history the important event may be study accord to country study one country at a time but that be not sufficient the event occur during one period in one country should be correlate with those occur in another country at the same time likewise the movement in the field of science and discovery should be correlate with movement in the field of literature religion and political control tabulate the event in chronological order and compare the different series of event with each other in this way the fact will be see in new relation and will be more firmly impressed so that you can use they in answer a great variety of question have make preparation of the subject-matter of the examination the next step be to prepare yourself physically for the try ordeal for it be well know that the mind act more ably under physically healthful condition go to the examination-room with you body rest after a good night 's sleep eat sparingly before the examination for mental process be likely to be clog if too heavy food be take have reach the examination-room there be a number of consideration that be requisite for success some of the advice here give may seem to be superfluous but if you have ever correct examination papers you would see the need of it all let you first step consist of a preliminary survey of the examination question read they all over slowly and thoughtfully in order to discover the extent of the task set before you a striking thing be accomplish by this preliminary reading of the question it seem as though during the examination period the knowledge relate to the different question assemble itself and while you be focus you attention upon the answer to one question the answer to the other question be formulate themselves in you mind it be a semi-conscious operation akin to the unconscious learning discuss in the chapter on memory in order to take advantage of it it be necessary to have the question in mind as soon as possible then it will be find that relevant association will form and will come to the surface when you reach the particular question during the examination when some of these association come into consciousness ahead of time it be often wise to digress from the question in hand long enough to jot they down by all means preserve they for if you do not write they down they may leave you and be lose sometimes very brilliant idea come in flash and inasmuch as they be so fleeting it be wise to grasp they and fix they while they be fresh in write the examination be sure you read every question carefully each question have a definite point look for it and do not start answer until you be sure you have find it discover the implication of each question canvass its possible interpretation and if it be at all ambiguous seek light from the instructor if he be willing to make any further comment it be well to have scratch paper handy and make outline for you answer to long question it be a good plan also when deal with long question to watch the time carefully for there be danger that you will spend too much time upon some question to the detriment of other equally important though shorter one error which student often commit in take examination be to waste time in dream as they come upon a difficult question they sit back and wait for the answer to come to they this be the wrong plan the secret of freedom of idea lie in activity therefore at such time keep active so that the associative process will operate freely stimulate brain activity by the method suggest in chapter x namely by means of muscular activity instead of idly wait for flash of inspiration begin to write you may not be able to write directly upon the point at issue but you can write something about it and as you begin to explore and to express you meager fund of knowledge one idea will call up another and soon the correct answer will appear after you have prepare yourself to the extent of you ability you should maintain toward the examination a attitude of confidence believe firmly that you will pass the examination make strong suggestion to yourself affirm positively that you have the requisite amount of information and the ability to express it coherently and forcefully fortify by the consciousness of faithful application throughout the work of a course reinforce by a thorough well-planned review and with a firm conviction in the strength of you own power you may approach you examination with comparative ease and with good chance of pass they creditably reading and exercise reading : adam -lrb- 1 -rrb- chapter x dearborn -lrb-

6 -rrb- after enter it chapter xv bodily condition for effective study it be a truism to say that mental ability be affect by bodily condition a common complaint of student be that they can not study because of a headache or they fail in class because of loss of sleep so patent be the interrelation between bodily condition and study that we can not consider we discussion of study problem complete without recognition of the topic we shall group we discussion about three of the most important physical activity eat sleep and exercise these make up the greater part of we daily activity and if they be properly regulate we study be likely to be effective food -- it be generally agree that the main function of food be to repair the tissue of the body other effect be present such as pleasure and sociability but its chief benefit be reparative so we may well regard the subject from a strictly utilitarian standpoint and inquire how we may produce the highest efficiency from we eat some of the important question about eat be how much to eat what kind of food to eat when to eat what be the most favorable condition for eat the quantity of food to be take vary with the demand of the individual appetite and the individual power of absorption in general one who be engage in physical labor need more because of increase appetite and increase waste of tissue so a farm-hand need more food than a college student whose work be mostly indoors and sedentary much have be say recently about the ill of overeat one of the most enthusiastic defender of a decrease diet be mr horace fletcher who by the practice of protracted mastication contrive to satisfy the appetite while take a exceptionally small amount of food salivary digestion be favor and the mechanical subdivision of the food be carry to a extreme point remarkably complete digestion and absorption follow by faithfully pursue this system mr fletcher have vastly better he general health and be a rare example of muscular and mental power for a man above sixty year of age he be a vigorous pedestrian and mountain-climber and hold surprising record for endurance test in the gymnasium the chief gain observe in he case as in other which be more or less parallel be the acquire of immunity to fatigue both muscular and central it be not claim that the spare diet confer great strength for momentary effort -- ` explosive strength ' as the term go -- but that moderate muscular contraction may be repeat many time with far less discomfort than before the inference appear to be that the subject who eat more than be best have in he circulation and he tissue by-product which act like the muscular waste which be normally responsible for fatigue accord to this conception he be never really fresh for he task but be oblige to start with a handicap when he reduce he diet the cell and fluid of he body free themselves of these by-product and he realize a capacity quite unguessed in the past the same assumption explain the fact mention by mr fletcher that the hour of sleep can be reduce decidedly when the diet be cut down it would seem as though a part of we sleep might often be due to avoidable auto-intoxication if one can shorten he nightly sleep without feel the worse for it this be a important gain but the amount of food be probably not so important as the kind food contain much starch as potato and rice may ordinarily be take in greater quantity than food contain much protein such as meat and nut so we problem be not so much concern with quantity as with the choice of kind of food probably the most favorable distribution of food for student be a predominance of fruit coarse cereal starch and sugar and less prominence to meat do not begin the day 's study on a breakfast of cake they be a heavy tax upon the digestive power and they nutritive value be low the mid-day meal be also a crucial factor in determine the efficiency of afternoon study and many student almost completely incapacitate themselves for afternoon work by a too-heavy noon meal frequently a afternoon course be render quite valueless because the student drows through the lecture sodden by a heavy lunch one way of overcome this difficulty be by dispense with the mid-day meal another way be to drink a small amount of coffee which frequently keep people awake but these device be not to be universally recommend the heavy meal of a student may well come at evening it should consist of a varied assortment of food with some liquid preferably clear soup milk and water meat also form a substantial part of this meal though ordinarily it should not be take more than once a day much be hear nowadays about the danger of excessive meat-eating and the objection be well-founded in the case of brain-worker the undesirable effect be a unprofitable spur of the metabolism -- more particularly objectionable in warm weather -- and the menace of auto-intoxication too much protein find in meat lay a burden upon the liver and kidney and when the burden be too great waste which can not be take care of gather and poison the blood give rise to that feeling of be tire all over which be so inimical to mental and physical exertion when meat be eat care should be take to choose right kind some kind of meat be well know to occasion indigestion pork and veal be particularly fear while we may not know the reason why these food so often disagree with people it seem probable that texture be a important consideration in both these meat the fiber be fine and fat be intimately mingle with the lean a close blending of fat with nitrogenous matter appear to give a fabric which be hard to digest the same principle be illustrate by fat-soaked fried food under the cover of the fat thorough-going bacterial decomposition of the protein may be accomplish with the final release of highly poisonous product attack of acute indigestion result from this cause be much like the so-called ptomaine poisoning much of the benefit of meat may be secure from other food fat for example may be obtain from milk and butter free from the objectionable quality of the meat-fibre in this connection it be important to call attention to the use of fried fat avoid fat that be mix with starch particle in such food as fried potato and pie-crust the condition during meal should always be as pleasant as possible this refer both to physical surroundings and mental condition the process occur in the alimentary canal be greatly subject to influence radiate from the brain it be especially striking that both the movement of the stomach and the secretion of the gastric juice may be inhibit as a result of disturbing circumstance intestinal movement may be modify in similar fashion cannon have collect various instance of the suspension of digestion in consequence of disagreeable experience and it would be easy for almost anyone to add to he list he tell we for example of the case of a woman whose stomach be empty under the direction of a specialist in order to ascertain the degree of digestion undergo by a prescribe breakfast the dinner of the night before be recover and be find almost unaltered inquiry lead to the fact that the woman have pass a night of intense agitation as the result of misconduct on the part of she husband people who be seasick some hour after a meal vomit undigested food apprehension of be sick have probably inhibit the gastric activity just as a single occasion of painful emotion may lead to a pass digestive disturbance so continued mental depression worry or grief may permanently impair the working of the -lrb- alimentary -rrb- tract and undermine the vigor and capacity of the sufferer homesickness be not to be regard lightly as a cause of malnutrition companionship be a powerful promoter of assimilation the attractive serve of food a pleasant room and good ventilation be of high importance the lack of these so commonly face by the lonely student or the young man make a start in a strange city may be to some extent counteract by the cultivation of optimism and the mental discipline which make it possible to detach one 's self from sordid surroundings almost as important as eating be drink for liquid constitute the largest item in the income of the body free drinking be recommend by physiologist the beneficial result be the avoidance of constipation and the promotion of the elimination of dissolve waste by the kidney and possibly the liver in regard to the use of water with meal a point upon which emphatic caution be formerly offer recent experiment have fail to show any bad effect from this and the advice be now give to drink all the water that one choose with meal caution should be observe however about introduce hot and cold liquid into the stomach in quick succession other liquid have be much discuss by dietitian especially tea and coffee these beverage owe what limited food value they have to the cream and sugar usually mixed with they they give pleasure by they aroma but they be give a peculiar position among article of diet by the presence in they of the compound caffein which be distinctly a drug it be a stimulant to the heart the kidney and the central nervous system individual susceptibility to the action of caffein vary greatly where one person notice little or no reaction after a cup of coffee another be exhilarate to a marked degree and hour later may find himself lie sleepless with tense or tremble muscle a dry burning skin and a mind feverishly active often it be find that a more protracted disturbance follow the taking of coffee with cream than be cause by black coffee it be too much to claim that the use of tea and coffee be altogether to be condemn many people nevertheless be better without they for all who find themselves strongly stimulate it be the part of wisdom to limit the enjoyment of these decoction to real emergency when uncommon demand be make upon the endurance and when for a time hygienic consideration have to be ignore if young people will postpone the formation of the habit they will have one more resource when the pressure of mature life become severe before conclude this discussion a word might be add concern the relation between fasting and mental activity prolong abstinence from food frequently result in highly sharpened intellectual power numerous example of this be find in the literature of history and biography many actor speaker and singer habitually fast before public performance there be some disadvantage to fasting especially loss of weight and weakness but when do under the direction of a physician fasting have be know to produce very beneficial effect it be mention here because it have such marked effect in speed up the mental process and clear the mind and the well-nourished student may find the practice a source of mental strength during time of stress such as examination sleep -- about one-third of a average human life be pass in the familiar and yet mysterious state which we call sleep from one point of view this seem a large inroad upon the period in which we consciousness have its exercise a subtraction of twenty-five year from the life of one who live to be seventy-five yet we know that the efficiency and comfort of the individual demand the surrender of all this precious time it have often be say that sleep be a more imperative necessity than food and the claim seem to be well found it be quite likely that some student indulge in too much sleep this may sometimes be due to laziness but frequently it be due to actual intoxication from a excess of food which result in the presence of poisonous narcotize substance absorb from the burden intestine this theory be render tenable by the fact that when the diet be reduce the hour of sleep may be reduce if one be in good health it seem right to expect that one should be able to arise gladly and briskly upon awake by all means do not indulge yourself in long period of lie in bed after a good night 's rest if we examine the physical and physiological condition of sleep we shall better understand its hygiene sleep be a state in which the tissue of the body which have be use up may be restore of course some restoration of broken-down tissue take place as soon as it begin to wear out but so long as the body keep work the one process can never quite compensate for the other so there must be a periodic cessation of activity so that the energy of the body may be devote to restoration viewing sleep as a time when broken-down bodily cell be restore we see that we tax the energy of the body less if we go to sleep each day before the cell be entirely deplete that be the significance of the old teaching that sleep before midnight be more efficacious than sleep after midnight it be not that there be any mystic virtue in the hour before twelve but that in the early part of the evening the cell be not so nearly exhaust as they be later in the evening and it be much easier to repair they in the partially exhaust stage than it be in the completely exhaust stage for this reason a mid-day nap be often effective or a short nap after the evening dinner by thus catch the cell at a early stage of they exhaustion they can be restore with comparative ease and more energy will be available for use during the remainder of the work hour a problem that may occasionally trouble a student be sleeplessness and we may properly consider here some of the way of avoid it one prime cause of sleeplessness be external disturbance the disturbance may be visual although it be ordinarily think that if the eye be close no visual disturbance can be sense nevertheless as a matter of fact the eye-lid be not wholly opaque sight may be obtain through they as you may prove by close you eye and move you finger before they the lid transmit light to the retina and it be quite likely that you be frequently awaken by a beam of light fall upon you closed eye-lid for this reason one who be incline to be wakeful should shut out from the bed-room all avenue whereby light may enter as a distraction the temperature sense be also a source of distraction in sleep and it be a common experience to be awaken by extreme cold the ear too may be the source of disturbance in sleep for even though we be asleep the tympanic membrane be always expose to vibration of air in fact stimulus be continually play upon the sense-organ and be arouse nervous current which try to break over the boundary of sleep and impress themselves upon the brain for this reason one who wish to have untroubled sleep should remove all possible distraction but apart from external distraction wakefulness may still be cause by distraction from within troublesome idea may be present and persist in keep one awake this mean that brain activity have be start and need suppression various device have be suggest one be to eat something very light just enough to draw the surplus blood which excite the brain away from the brain to the digestive tract this advice should be take with caution however for eat just before retire may use up in digestion much of the energy need in repair the body and may leave one greatly fatigue in the morning one way to relieve the mind of mental distraction be to fill it with non-worrisome restful thought read something light a restful essay or a non-exciting story or poetry another device be to bathe the head in cold water so as to relieve congestion of blood in the brain a tepid or warm bath be say to have a similar effect dream constitute one source of annoyance to many and while they be not necessarily to be avoid still they may disturb the night 's rest we may avoid they in some measure by create condition free from sensory distraction for many of we dream be direct reflection of sensation we be experience at the moment a dream with a arctic setting may be the result of become uncover on a cold night to use a illustration from elli : a man dream that he enlist in the army go to the front and be shoot he be awaken by the slamming of a door it seem probable that the enlistment and the march to the field be theory to account for the report which really cause the whole train of thought though it seem to be its latest item such dream may be partially eliminate by care in arrange condition so that there will be few distraction especially should they be guard against in the later hour of the sleep for we do not sleep so soundly after the first two hour as we do before and stimulus can more easily impress themselves and affect the brain before leave the subject of sleep we should note the benefit to be derive from regularity in sleep all nature seem to move rhythmically and sleep be no exception insomnia may be treat by means of habituate one 's self to get sleepy at a certain time and there be no question that the rise process may be make easier if one form the habit of arise at the same time every morning to rhythmize this important function be a long step towards the efficient life exercise -- brain worker do not ordinarily get all the exercise they should particularly be this true of some conscientious student who feel they must not take any time from they study but this denote a false conception of mental action the human organism need exercise man be not a disembodied spirit he must pay attention to the claim of the body indeed it will be find that time spend in exercise will result in a higher grade of mental work this be recognize by college and university by the requirement of gymnasium work and the opportunity should be welcome by the student inasmuch as institution generally give instruction in this subject we need not go specifically into the matter of exercise perhaps the only caution that need be urge be that against the excessive participation in such exhausting game as foot-ball it be seriously to be question whether the strenuous grilling that a foot-ball player must undergo do not actually impair he ability to concentrate upon he study if you undertake a course of exercise by all means have it regular little be gain by sporadic exercise adopt the principle of regularity and rhythmize this important phase of bodily activity as well as all other phase in conclude we discussion of physical hygiene for the student we can not stress too much the value of relaxation the life of a student be a try one it exercise chiefly the higher brain centre and keep the organism key up to a high pitch these centre become fatigue easily and ought to be rest occasionally therefore the student should relax at interval and engage in something remote from study to forget book for a entire week-end be often wisdom to have a hobby or a avocation be also wise a student must not forget that he be something more than a intellectual be he be a physical organism and a social being and the well-rounded life demand that all phase receive expression we grant that it be wrong to exalt the physical and stunt the mental but it be also wrong to develop the intellectual and neglect the physical we must recognize with browning that all good thing be ours nor soul help flesh more now than
