disease of woman and child author of hint to mother on the management of they health 1840 preface this little book have be write for the young and inexperienced mother it be intend to furnish she with that information which the experience and observation of some year convince the author young mother almost without any exception do not possess and yet from ignorance of which the constitution of many a infant have receive irretrievable injury and life itself but too frequently fall a sacrifice in the first chapter devote to the general management of the child in health the author have endeavor to teach the young mother that the prevention of disease be she province not its cure that to this object all she best effort must be direct and moreover that to tamper with medicine when disease have actually commence be to hazard the life of she offspring in the fourth chapter it have be attempt to point out how the first symptom of disease may be early detect by the parent the subject have be feel to be a difficult one and to give particular direction quite out of the question but it be hope that the suggestion throw out will in some measure answer the purpose intend on the advantage of a early and prompt application of remedy in the disease of childhood generally so active in they progress and severe in they character it be unnecessary to offer any observation the latter part of the work consist of the maternal management of disease the author regard as a subject of high and serious moment small as be the attention which have be hitherto pay to it yet in the disease of infancy and childhood how invaluable be a careful and judicious maternal superintendence to give effect to the measure prescribe by the physician the author have endeavor to arrange the contents of the work

maternal management of child chapter i on the general management of infancy and childhood the line of demarcation make between infancy and childhood both by ancient and modern writer have always be arbitrary i would draw the line between the two at a period of time which appear to I to be the most natural the most simple and least likely to lead the reader into the danger of misapply any part of the practical direction of this or any future chapter of the work we will consider then that -- infancy commence with birth extend to about the end of the second year when the first dentition be complete childhood extend from about the second to the seventh or eighth year when the second dentition be commence sect i dietetics of infancy in the early month of infancy the organ of digestion be unsuited to any other food than that derive from the breast of the mother so little capable be they indeed to digest any other even of the blandest and most digestible kind that probably not more than one infant in six or seven ever arrive at the more advanced period of life when deprive of the kind of nourishment nature intend for this epoch it be not every parent however who be able to become a nurse and with many this office would not only be highly injurious to they own health but materially so to that of they offspring this may arise from various cause hereafter to be notice but whenever they exist a wet-nurse be demand again the latter resource be not always attainable so that the hazardous experiment of a artificial diet or bring up by hand as it be then term be oblige to be resort to thus infantile dietetics naturally divide itself into maternal nursing wet-nurse suckling and artificial feeding 1 maternal nursing plan of suckling from the first moment the infant be apply to the breast it must be nurse upon a certain plan this be necessary to the well-doing of the child and will contribute essentially to preserve the health of the parent who will thus be render a good nurse and she duty at the same time will become a pleasure this imply however a careful attention on the part of the mother to she own health for that of she child be essentially dependent upon it healthy nourishing and digestible milk can be procure only from a healthy parent and it be against common sense to expect that if a mother impair she health and digestion by improper diet neglect of exercise and impure air she can nevertheless provide as wholesome and uncontaminate a fluid for she child as if she be diligently attentive to these important point every instance of indisposition in the nurse be liable to affect the infant and this lead I to observe that it be a common mistake to suppose that because a woman be nurse she ought therefore to live very fully and to add a allowance of wine porter or other fermented liquor to she usual diet the only result of this plan be to cause a unnatural degree of fulness in the system which place the nurse on the brink of disease and which of itself frequently put a stop to the secretion of the milk instead of increase it the right plan of proceeding be plain enough only let attention be pay to the ordinary law of health and the mother if she have a sound constitution will make a better nurse than by any foolish deviation found on ignorance and caprice the follow case prove the correctness of this statement : -- a young married lady confine with she first child leave the lying-in - room at the expiration of the third week a good nurse and in perfect health she have have some slight trouble with she nipple but this be soon overcome the porter system be now commence and from a pint to a pint and a half of this beverage be take in the four and twenty hour this be resort to not because there be any deficiency in the supply of milk for it be ample and the infant thrive upon it but because have become a nurse she be tell that it be usual and necessary and that without it she milk and strength would ere long fail after this plan have be follow for a few day the mother become drowsy and disposed to sleep in the daytime and headach thirst a hot skin in fact fever supervene the milk diminish in quantity and for the first time the stomach and bowels of the infant become disorder the porter be order to be leave off remedial measure be prescribe and all symptom both in parent and child be after a while remove and health restore have be accustom prior to become a mother to take a glass or two of wine and occasionally a tumbler of table beer she be advise to follow precisely she former dietetic plan but with the addition of half a pint of barley-milk morning and night both parent and child continue in excellent health during the remain period of suckling and the latter do not taste artificial food until the ninth month the parent 's milk be all-sufficient for its want no one can doubt that the porter be in this case the source of the mischief the patient have go into the lying-in-room in full health have have a good time and come out from she chamber -lrb- comparatively -rrb- as strong as she enter it she constitution have not be previously wear down by repeat child-bearing and nursing she have a ample supply of milk and be fully capable therefore of perform the duty which now devolve upon she without resort to any unusual stimulant or support she previous habit be totally at variance with the plan which be adopt she system become too full disease be produce and the result experience be nothing more than what might be expect the plan to be follow for the first six months-until the breast - milk be fully establish which may not be until the second or third day subsequent to delivery -lrb- almost invariably so in a first confinement -rrb- the infant must be feed upon a little thin gruel or upon one third water and two third milk sweeten with loaf sugar after this time it must obtain its nourishment from the breast alone and for a week or ten day the appetite of the infant must be the mother 's guide as to the frequency in offer the breast the stomach at birth be feeble and as yet unaccustomed to food its want therefore be easily satisfied but they be frequently renew a interval however sufficient for digest the little swallow be obtain before the appetite again revive and a fresh supply be demand at the expiration of a week or so it be essentially necessary and with some child this may be do with safety from the first day of suckling to nurse the infant at regular interval of three or four hour day and night this allow sufficient time for each meal to be digest and tend to keep the bowels of the child in order such regularity moreover will do much to obviate fretfulness and that constant cry which seem as if it could be allay only by constantly put the child to the breast a young mother very frequently run into a serious error in this particular consider every expression of uneasiness as a indication of appetite and whenever the infant cry offer it the breast although ten minute may not have elapse since its last meal this be a injurious and even dangerous practice for by overload the stomach the food remain undigested the child 's bowels be always out of order it soon become restless and feverish and be perhaps eventually lose when by simply attend to the above rule of nurse the infant might have become healthy and vigorous for the same reason the infant that sleep with its parent must not be allow to have the nipple remain in its mouth all night if nurse as suggest it will be find to awaken as the hour for its meal approach with great regularity in reference to night-nursing i would suggest suckle the babe as late as ten o'clock p m and not put it to the breast again until five o'clock the next morning many mother have adopt this hint with great advantage to they own health and without the slightest detriment to that of the child with the latter it soon become a habit to induce it however it must be teach early the foregoing plan and without variation must be pursue to the sixth month after the sixth month to the time of wean -- if the parent have a large supply of good and nourishing milk and she child be healthy and evidently flourish upon it no change in its diet ought to be make if otherwise however -lrb- and this will but too frequently be the case even before the sixth month -lrb- fn # 1 -rrb- -rrb- the child may be feed twice in the course of the day and that kind of food choose which after a little trial be find to agree best -lrb- fn # 1 -rrb- see deficiency of milk p 11 leman 's top and bottom steep in hot water with the addition of a little fresh milk and sweeten or not with loaf sugar be one of the best description if the stomach reject this farinaceous food boil in water and mixed with a small quantity of milk may be employ or weak mutton or veal broth or beef tea clear and free from fat and mixed with a equal quantity of farinaceous food if this artificial diet be use before the sixth month it must be give through the sucking-bottle after this period with a spoon : in either case it must be previously pass through a sieve when the large or grind tooth have appear the same food be still to be continue but need not any longer be express through the sieve such be the plan of nursing to be follow by the mother until she wean she infant altogether from the breast the period when this ought to take place as also the manner of accomplish it be detail in the section on wean -lrb- fn # 2 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 2 -rrb- see page 51 the diet from wean to the termination of infancy be point out under artificial feeding -lrb- fn # 3 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 3 -rrb- see page 34 deficiency of milk if this deficiency exist from the earliest week after delivery and it be not quickly remedy by the means presently to be point out a wet-nurse must be obtain it will be of no avail partially to nurse and partially to feed the infant at this period and under such circumstance for if it be not soon lose it will only live for a few month or a year at most and be a object of the greatest anxiety and grief to its parent this condition arise from the unwholesomeness of the mother 's milk unite with the artificial food for when the milk be deficient from the first and continue so notwithstanding the means use for its increase it be invariably unhealthy in its quality this deficiency however may exist and even at a very early period after delivery and yet be remove this however be not to be accomplish by the means too frequently resort to for it be the custom with many two or three week after they confinement if the supply of nourishment for the infant be scanty to partake largely of malt liquor for its increase sooner or later this will be find injurious to the constitution of the mother : but how then be this deficiency to be obviate let the nurse keep but in good health and this point gain the milk both as to quantity and quality will be as ample nutritious and good as can be produce by the individual i would recommend a plain generous and nutritious diet not one description of food exclusively but as be natural a wholesome mixed animal and vegetable diet with or without wine or malt liquor accord to former habit and occasionally where malt liquor have never be previously take a pint of good sound ale may be take daily with advantage if it agree with the stomach regular exercise in the open air be of the greatest importance as it have a extraordinary influence in promote the secretion of healthy milk early after leave the lying-in room carriage exercise where it can be obtain be to be prefer to be exchange in a week or so for horse exercise or the daily walk the tepid or cold salt-water shower bath should be use every morning but if it can not be bear sponge the body withsalt-water must be substitute by adopt with perseverance the foregoing plan a breast of milk will be obtain as ample in quantity and good in quality as the constitution of the parent can produce as the follow case prove : on the 17th September 1839 i attend a lady twenty-four year of age a delicate but healthy woman in she first confinement the labor be good every thing go on well for the first week except that although the breast become enlarged and promise a good supply of nourishment for the infant at its close there be merely a little ooze from the nipple during the next fortnight a slight but very gradual increase in quantity take place so that a dessert spoonful only be obtain about the middle of this period and perhaps double this quantity at its expiration in the mean time the child be necessarily feed upon a artificial diet and as a consequence its bowels become deranged and a severe diarrhoea follow a wet-nurse be advise for the child as the only means of save its life and change of air for the mother as the most likely expedient -lrb- in connection with the general treatment point out above -rrb- for obtain a good breast of milk accordingly on the 5th October the patient take with she the infant and a wet-nurse go a few mile from town for three or four day it be a question whether the little one would live for so greatly have it be reduce by the looseness of the bowels that it have not strength to grasp the nipple of its nurse the milk therefore be oblige to be draw and the child feed with it from a spoon after the lapse of a few day however it could obtain the breast-milk for itself and to make short of the case on the 25th of the same month the mother and child return home the former have a very fair proportion of healthy milk in she bosom and the child perfectly recover and evidently thrive fast upon it where however there have be a early deficiency in the supply of nourishment it will most frequently happen that before the sixth or seventh month the infant 's demand will be greater than the mother can meet the deficiency must be make up by artificial food which must be of a kind generally employ before the sixth month and give through the bottle if however this plan of dieting should disagree the child must even at this period have a wet-nurse woman who marry comparatively late in life and bear child generally have a deficiency of milk after the second or third month : artificial feeding must in part be here resort to the injurious effect to the mother and infant of undue and protracted suckling upon the mother -- the period of suckling be generally one of the most healthy of a woman 's life but there be exception to this as a general rule and nursing instead of be accompany by health may be the cause of its be materially and even fatally impaired this may arise out of one of two cause either a parent continue to suckle too long or from the original power or strength not be equal to the continued drain on the system example of the first class i be meeting with daily i refer to poor married woman who have nurse they infant eighteen month two year or even longer than this from the belief that by so do they will prevent pregnancy call to consult I with a exhaust frame and disorder general health arise solely from protracted nursing pursue from the above mistaken notion i most frequently meet with example of the second class in the delicate woman who have have two or three child in quick succession she health have give way so that she have all the symptom arise from undue suckling when perhaps the infant at she breast be not more than two or three month old since the health of the mother then will suffer materially from this circumstance she ought not to be ignorant of the fact so that when the first symptom manifest themselves she may be able to recognize they insidious approach and trace they to they real cause obtain medical advice before she health be seriously impaired symptom -- the earliest symptom be a drag sensation in the back when the child be in the act of sucking and a exhaust feeling of sink and emptiness at the pit of the stomach afterwards this be soon follow by loss of appetite costive bowels and pain on the left side then the head will be more or less affected sometimes with much throbbing singing in the ear and always some degree of giddiness with great depression of spirit soon the chest become affected and the breathing be short accompany by a dry cough and palpitation of the heart upon the slightest exertion as the disease advance the countenance become very pale and the flesh waste and profuse night perspiration great debility swell of the ankle and nervousness ensue it be unnecessary however to enter into a more full detail of symptom treatment -- all that it will be useful to say in reference to treatment be this that although much may be do in the first instance by medicine change of air cold and sea bathing yet the quickest and most effectual remedy be to wean the child and thus remove the cause the ill effect upon the infant -- there be another and equally powerful reason why the child should be wean or rather have a young and healthy wet-nurse if practicable the effect upon the infant suckle under such circumstance will be most serious bear in perfect health it will now begin to fall off in its appearance for the mother 's milk will be no longer competent to afford it due nourishment it will be inadequate in quantity and quality its countenance therefore will become pale its look sickly and aged the flesh soft and flabby the limb emaciate the belly in some case large in other shrink and the evacuation fetid and unnatural and in a very few week the bloom healthy child will be change into the pale sickly peevish waste creature whose life appear hardly desirable the only measure that can save the life and recover a infant from this state be that which would previously have prevent it a healthy wet-nurse if the effect upon the infant should not be so aggravate as those just describe and it subsequently live and thrive there will be a tendency in such a constitution to scrofula and consumption to manifest itself at some future period of life undoubtedly acquire from the parent and dependent upon the impaired state of she health at the time of its suckle a wet-nurse early resort to will prevent this it will be naturally ask for how long a period a mother ought to perform the office of a nurse no specific time can be mention and the only way in which the question can be meet be this : no woman with advantage to she own health can suckle she infant beyond twelve or eighteen month and at various period between the third and twelfth month many woman will be oblige partially or entirely to resign the office -lrb- fn # 4 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 4 -rrb- see wean p 51 the monthly period generally reappear from the twelfth to the fourteenth month from delivery and when establish as the milk be find invariably to diminish in quantity and also to deteriorate in quality and the child be but imperfectly nourish it be positively necessary in such instance at once to wean it of mother who ought never to suckle there be some female who ought never to undertake the office of suckle both on account of they own health and also that of they offspring the woman of a consumptive and strumous constitution ought not -- in the infant bear of such a parent there will be a constitutional predisposition to the same disease and if it be nourish from she system this hereditary predisposition will be confirm no fact in medicine be better establish than that which prove the hereditary transmission from parent to child of a constitutional liability to pulmonary disease and especially to consumption yet no condition be less attend to in form matrimonial engagement the child of scrofulous and consumptive parent be generally precocious and they mind be early mature they engage early in the business of life and often enter the married state before they bodily frame have have time to consolidate for a few year every thing seem to go on prosperously and a numerous family gather around they all at once however even while youth remain they physical power begin to give way and they drop prematurely into the grave exhaust by consumption and leave child behind they destine in all probability either to be cut off as they approach maturity or to run through the same delusive but fatal career as that of the parent from whom they derive they existence -lrb- fn # 5 -rrb- there be scarcely a individual who read these fact to whom memory will not furnish some sad and mournful example of they truth though they perhaps may have hitherto be in ignorance of the exciting cause -lrb- fn # 5 -rrb- combe 's principle of physiology apply to the preservation of health etc it be however with the mother as a nurse that i have now to do and i would earnestly advise every one of a consumptive or strumous habit -lrb- and if there be any doubt upon this point the opinion of a medical adviser will at once decide it -rrb- never to suckle she offspring she constitution render she unfit for the task and however painful it may be to she mind at every confinement to debar herself this delightful duty she must recollect that it will be far better for she own health and infinitely more so for that of the child that she should not even attempt it that she own health would be injure and she infant 's sooner or later destroy by it the infant of a consumptive parent however must not be bring up by hand it must have a young healthy and vigorous wet-nurse and in select a woman for this important duty very great care must be observe -lrb- fn # 6 -rrb- the child should be nurse until it be twelve or fifteen month old in some case it will be right to continue it until the first set of tooth have appear when it will be desirable that a fresh wet-nurse should be obtain for the last six month -lrb- fn # 7 -rrb- if the child be partially feed during the latter month -lrb- from necessity or any other cause -rrb- the food should be of the lightest quality and constitute but a small proportion of its nutriment -lrb- fn # 6 -rrb- see choice of a wet-nurse p 28 -lrb- fn # 7 -rrb- one that have be confine about six week or two month but not only must the nourishment of such a child be regard but the air it breathe and the exercise that be give to it as also the careful removal of all functional derangement as they occur by a timely application to the medical attendant and maintain especially a healthy condition of the digestive organ all these point must be strictly follow out if any good be to be effect by a rigid attention to these measure the mother adopt the surest antidote indirectly to overcome the constitutional predisposition to that disease the seed of which if not inherit from the parent be but too frequently develop in the infant during the period of nursing and at the same time she take the best means to engender a sound and healthy constitution in she child this surely be worth any sacrifice if the infant derive the disposition to a strumous constitution entirely from the father and the mother 's health be unexceptionable then i would strongly advise she to suckle she own child the mother of a highly susceptible nervous temperament ought not -- there be other woman who ought never to become nurse the mother of a highly nervous temperament who be alarm at any accidental change she may happen to notice in she infant 's countenance who be excite and agitate by the ordinary occurrence of the day such a parent will do she offspring more harm than good by attempt to suckle it she milk will be totally unfit for its nourishment : at one time it will be deficient in quantity at another so depraved in its quality that serious disturbance to the infant 's health will ensue the young and inexperienced mother who be a parent for the first time and altogether ignorant of the duty of she office and at the same time most anxious to fulfil they faithfully be but too frequently a instance in point although at a future period she will generally make a good nurse the follow be a illustration : -- in December 1838 i attend a young married lady in she first confinement and in excellent health she give birth to a fine plump healthy boy every thing go on well for three week the mother have a abundant supply of milk and the infant evidently thrive upon it about this time however the child have frequent fit of cry the bowels become obstinately costive -- the motion be lumpy of a mixed color quite dry and pass with great pain it become rapidly thin and after a while its flesh so waste and become so flabby that it might be say literally to hang on the bone the fit of cry now increase in frequency and violence come on every time after the little one leave the breast when it would commence scream violently beat the air with its hand and foot and nothing that be do could appease it have last for half a hour or more it would fall asleep quite exhaust the fit recur again when again it have be to the breast it be very evident that the infant 's hunger be not satisfy as it be also but too evident its body be not nourish by the parent 's milk which although abundant in quantity -lrb- the breast be large and full of milk -rrb- be at this time seriously deteriorated in its nutritive quality this be cause i believe from great anxiety of mind she nurse become suddenly deranged and the whole responsibility and care of the child thus devolve upon the mother of the duty connect with which she be entirely ignorant a wet-nurse be obtain in a very few hour after this change be effect the scream cease the child have quiet and refreshing sleep and in twelve hour a healthy motion be pass the child gain flesh almost as quickly as it have previously lose it and be now as fine and healthy a infant as it promise to be when bear whenever there have exist previously any nervous or mental affection in the parent wet-nurse suckling be always advisable this with judicious management of childhood will do much to counteract the hereditary predisposition the mother who only nurse she infant when it suit she convenience ought not -- the mother who can not make up she mind exclusively to devote herself to the duty of a nurse and give up all engagement that would interfere with she health and so with the formation of healthy milk and with the regular and stated period of nurse she infant ought never to suckle it be unnecessary to say why but i think it right for the child 's sake to add that if it do not sicken pine and die disease will be generate in its constitution to manifest itself at some future period the child then under all the foregoing circumstance must be provide with its support from another source and a wet-nurse be the best 2 wet-nurse suckling ill health and many other circumstance may prevent a parent from suckle she child and render a wet-nurse necessary now although she will do wisely to leave the choice of one to she medical attendant still as some difficulty may attend this and as most certainly the mother herself ought to be acquaint with the principal point to which he attention be direct in the selection of a good nurse it will be well to point out in what they consist choice of a wet-nurse the first thing to which a medical man look be the general health of the woman next the condition of she breast the quality of she milk its age and she own whether she be ever unwell while nursing and last of all the condition and health of the child be the woman in good health -- she general appearance ought to bear the mark of a sound constitution and ought to be free from all suspicion of a strumous character she tongue clean and digestion good she tooth and gum sound and perfect she skin free from eruption and she breath sweet what be the condition of the breast -- a good breast should be firm and well form its size not dependent upon a large quantity of fat which will generally take away from its firmness give it a flabby appearance but upon its glandular structure which convey to the touch a knotted irregular and hard feel and the nipple must be perfect of moderate size but well develop what be the quality of the milk -- it should be thin and of a bluish - white color sweet to the taste and when allow to stand should throw up a considerable quantity of cream what be its age -- if the lying-in month of the patient have scarcely expire the wet-nurse to be hire ought certainly not to have reach she second month at this time the nearer the birth of the child and the delivery of its foster-parent the better : the reason for which be that during the first few week the milk be thinner and more watery than it afterwards become if consequently a new-born infant be provide with a nurse who have be deliver three or four month the natural relation between its stomach and the quality of the milk be destroy and the infant suffer from the oppression of food too heavy for its digestive power on the other hand if you be seek a wet-nurse for a infant of four or five month old it would be very prejudicial to transfer the child to a woman recently deliver the milk would be too watery for its support and its health in consequence would give way the nurse herself should not be too old -- a vigorous young woman from twenty-one to thirty admit of no question and the woman who have have one or two child before be always to be prefer as she will be likely to have more milk and may also be suppose to have acquire some experience in the management of infant inquire whether she be ever unwell while nursing -- if so reject she at once you will have no difficulty in ascertain this point for this class of person have a idea that they milk be renew as they term it by this circumstance monthly and therefore that it be a recommendation render they milk fitter for younger child than it would otherwise have be it produce however quite a contrary effect it much impair the milk which will be find to disagree with the child render it at first fretful -- after a time be vomit up and productive of frequent watery dark green motion last of all what be the condition of the child -- it ought to have the sprightly appearance of health to bear the mark of be well nourish its flesh firm its skin clean and free from eruption it should be examine in this respect particularly about the head neck and gum if a medical man find that both mother and child answer to the above description he have no hesitation in recommend the former as likely to prove a good wet-nurse diet and regimen of a wet-nurse the regimen of a wet-nurse should not differ much from that to which she have be accustom and any change which it may be necessary to make in it should be gradual it be erroneous to suppose that woman when nursing require to be much more highly feed than at other time : a good nurse do not need this and a bad one will not be the better for it the quantity which many nurse eat and drink and the indolent life which they too often lead have the effect of derange they digestive organ and frequently induce a state of febrile excitement which always diminish and even sometimes altogether disperse the milk it will be necessary then to guard against the nurse overload she stomach with a mass of indigestible food and drink she should live as much as possible in the manner to which she have be accustom she should have a wholesome mixed animal and vegetable diet and a moderate and somewhat extra quantity of malt liquor provide it agree with she system a very prevailing notion exist that porter tend to produce a great flow of milk and in consequence the wet-nurse be allow as much as she like a large quantity be in this way take and after a short time so much febrile action excite in the system that instead of increase the flow of milk it diminish it greatly some parent however aware of this fact will go into a opposite extreme and refuse the nurse even that which be necessary either excess be of course wrong it be difficult in general term to say what ought to be consider a proper daily allowance but some be in general necessary and whenever a woman have be use to drink malt-liquor she will rarely make a good wet-nurse if she be deny a reasonable quantity of that beverage good sound ale sometimes agree better than porter it may be well here to remark that in london i frequently meet with severe case of diarrhoea in infant at the breast fairly traceable to bad porter which vitiate the quality of the milk no medical treatment cure the disease until this beverage be leave off or change when it at once disappear the nurse should take exercise daily in the open air nothing tend more directly to maintain a good supply of healthy milk than air and exercise and the best wet-nurse would soon lose she milk if constantly keep within door sponge the whole body also with cold water with bay-salt in it every morning should be insist upon if possible : it preserve cleanliness and greatly invigorate the health unite with this the nurse should rise early and also be regularly employ during the day in some little portion of duty in the family a attendance upon the want of the child not be alone sufficient a amiable disposition and good temper be very desirable a violent fit of passion may exert so peculiar a influence in change the natural property of the milk that a child have be know to be attack with a fit of convulsion after be suckle by a nurse while labor under the effect of a fit of anger the depressing passion frequently drive the milk away altogether it be hence of no small moment that a wet-nurse be of a quiet and even temper and not dispose to mental disturbance 3 artificial feeding or bring up by hand extreme delicacy of constitution diseased condition of the frame defective secretion of milk and other cause may forbid the mother suckle she child and unless she can perform this office with safety to herself and benefit to she infant she ought not to attempt it in this case a young and healthy wet-nurse be the best substitute but even this resource be not always attainable under these circumstance the child must be bring up on a artificial diet by hand -- as it be popularly call to accomplish this with success require the most careful attention on the part of the parent and at all time be attend with risk to the life of the child for although some child thus rear live and have sound health these be exception to the general rule artificial feeding be in most instance unsuccessful the kind of artificial food before the sixth month it should be as like the breast-milk as possible this be obtain by a mixture of cow 's milk water and sugar in the follow proportion : -- fresh cow 's milk two third boiling water or thin barley water one third loaf sugar a sufficient quantity to sweeten this be the best diet that can be use for the first six month after which some farinaceous food may be combine in early infancy mother be too much in the habit of give thick gruel panada biscuit-powder and such matter think that a diet of a lighter kind will not nourish this be a mistake for these preparation be much too solid they overload the stomach and cause indigestion flatulence and gripe these create a necessity for purgative medicine and carminative which again weaken digestion and by unnatural irritation perpetuate the evil which render they necessary thus many infant be keep in a continual round of repletion indigestion and purge with the administration of cordial and narcotic who if they diet be in quantity and quality suit to they digestive power would need no aid from physic or physician in prepare this diet it be highly important to obtain pure milk not previously skim or mix with water and in warm weather just take from the cow it should not be mix with the water or sugar until wanted and not more make than will be take by the child at the time for it must be prepare fresh at every meal it be best not to heat the milk over the fire but let the water be in a boiling state when mix with it and thus give to the infant tepid or lukewarm as the infant advance in age the proportion of milk may be gradually increase this be necessary after the second month when three part of milk to one of water may be allow but there must be no change in the kind of diet if the health of the child be good and its appearance perceptibly improve nothing be more absurd than the notion that in early life child require a variety of food only one kind of food be prepare by nature and it be impossible to transgress this law without marked injury if cow 's milk disagree with a infant -- and this be sometimes unfortunately the case even from its birth ass 's milk -- dilute with one third its quantity of water may be give

come on with which the third child have be affect which again give way upon follow up the same plan of diet -- the substitution of the ass 's milk for that of the cow the evident conclusion from this be that the breast-milk of a healthy woman be incomparably the most suitable diet for the infant but that if she be not of a healthy constitution it may be destructive to the child and that where this can not be obtain and cow 's milk be find to disagree ass 's milk may sometimes be resort to with the happiest result -lrb- fn # 8 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 8 -rrb- a infant will generally consume a quart or a little more of ass 's milk in the four and twenty hour and as this quantity be nearly as much as the animal will give it be best to purchase a ass for the express purpose the foal must be separate from the mother and the forage of the latter carefully attend to or the milk will disagree with the child sometimes the mother 's breast and every description of milk be reject by the child in which case recourse must be have to veal or weak mutton broth or beef tea clear and free from fat mixed with a very small quantity of farinaceous food carefully pass through a sieve before it be pour into the sucking-bottle the mode of administer it -- there be two way -- by the spoon and by the nursing-bottle the first ought never to be employ at this period inasmuch as the power of digestion in infant be very weak and they food be design by nature to be take very slowly into the stomach be procure from the breast by the act of suck in which act a great quantity of saliva be secrete and be pour into the mouth mix with the milk and be swallow with it this process of nature then should be emulate as far as possible and food -lrb- for this purpose -rrb- should be imbibe by suction from a nursing-bottle : it be thus obtain slowly and the suction employ secure the mixture of a due quantity of saliva which have a highly important influence on digestion too much care can not be take to keep the bottle perfectly sweet for this purpose there should always be two in the nursery to be use alternately and if any food remain after a meal it must be empty out the bottle must always be scald out after use the flat glass nursing-bottle itself be too well know to need description it may be well however to say a word about the teat that cover its narrow neck and through which the infant suck the food if the artificial or prepared cow 's teat be make use of it should be so attach to the bottle that its extremity do not extend beyond its apex more than half or three quarter of a inch for if it project more than this the child will get the side of the teat so firmly press together between its gum that there will be no channel for the milk to flow through this remark apply equally to the teat make of soft wash - leather which many lady prefer to that of the cow and it be a good substitute but then a fresh piece of leather must be make use of daily otherwise the food will be taint and the child 's bowels derange it be also necessary that both of these when use should have a small conical piece of sponge inclose the most cleanly and convenient apparatus be a cork

essential to the success of this plan of rear child the quantity of food to be give at each meal -- this must be regulate by the age of the child and its digestive power a little experience will soon enable a careful and observe mother to determine this point -- as the child grow older the quantity of course must be increase the chief error in rear the young be overfeed and a most serious one it be but which may be easily avoid by the parent pursue a systematic plan with regard to the hour of feeding and then only yield to the indication of appetite and administer the food slowly in small quantity at a time this be the only way effectually to prevent indigestion and bowel complaint and the irritable condition of the nervous system so common in infancy and secure to the infant healthy nutrition and consequent strength of constitution as have be well observe nature never intend the infant 's stomach to be convert into a receptacle for laxative carminative antacid stimulant and astringent and when these become necessary we may rest assure that there be something faulty in we management however perfect it may seem to ourselves the frequency of give food -- this must be determine as a general rule by allow such a interval between each meal as will insure the digestion of the previous quantity and this may be fix at about every three or four hour if this rule be depart from and the child receive a fresh supply of food every hour or so time will not be give for the digestion of the previous quantity and as a consequence of this process be interrupt the food pass on into the bowel undigested will there ferment and become sour will inevitably produce cholic and purge and in no way contribute to the nourishment of the child the posture of the child when

go the wrong way as it be call after each meal the little one should be put into its cot or repose on its mother 's knee for at least half a hour this be essential for the process of digestion as

about this period one or two will make they appearance -- solid farinaceous matter boil in water beat through a sieve and mixed with a small quantity of milk may be employ or top and bottom steep in

error to feed a infant with animal food before it have tooth proper for masticate it show a total disregard to the plain indication of nature in withhold such tooth till the system require they assistance to masticate solid food and the method of grate and pound meat as a substitute for chew may be well suit to the toothless octogenarian whose stomach be capable of digest it but the stomach of a young child be not adapt to the digestion of such food and will be disorder by it -lrb- fn # 10 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 10 -rrb- sir jame clarke on consumption if the principle already lay down be true it can not reasonably be maintain that a child 's mouth without tooth and that of a adult furnished with the tooth of carnivorous and graminivorous animal be design by the creator for the same sort of food if the mastication of solid food whether animal or vegetable and a due admixture of saliva be necessary for digestion then solid food can not be proper when there be no power of mastication if it be swallow in large mass it can not be masticate at all and will have but a small chance of be digest and in a undigested state it will prove injurious to the stomach and to the other organ concern in digestion by form unnatural compound the practice of give solid food to a toothless child be not less absurd than to expect corn to be ground where there be no apparatus for grind it that which would be consider as a evidence of idiotism or insanity in the last instance be defend and practice in the former if on the other hand to obviate this evil the solid matter whether animal or vegetable be

circumstance which will regulate this matter independently of any general rule that might be lay down the mother 's health may in one case oblige she to resort to wean before the sixth month and in another instance the delicacy of the infant 's health to delay it beyond the twelfth nevertheless as a general rule both child and parent be in good health wean ought never to take place earlier than the ninth -lrb- the most usual date -rrb- and never delay beyond the twelfth month i should say further that if child and parent be both in vigorous health if the infant have cut several of its tooth and be already accustom to be partially feed wean ought to be gradually accomplish at the ninth month on the other hand that if the child be feeble in constitution the tooth late in appear and the mother be healthy and have a sufficient supply of good milk especially if it be the autumnal season it will be far better to prolong the nursing for a few month in such a case the fact of the on-appearance of the tooth indicate a unfitness of the system for any other than the natural food from the maternal breast and again if the infant be bear of a consumptive parent and a healthy and vigorous wet-nurse have be provide wean should most certainly be defer beyond the usual time carefully watch however that neither nurse nor child suffer from its continuance the mode -- it should be effect gradually from the sixth month most child be feed twice or oftener in the four-and-twenty hour the infant be in fact therefore from this time in the progress of wean that be to say its natural diet be partly change for a artificial one so that when the time for complete wean arrive it will be easily accomplish without suffer to the mother or much denial to the child it be however of the greatest importance to regulate the quantity and quality of the food at this time if too much food be give -lrb- and this be the great danger -rrb- the stomach will be overload the digestive power destroy and if the child be not carry off suddenly by convulsion its bowels will become obstinately disorder it will fall away from not be nourished and perhaps eventually become a sacrifice to the

intimate extend from about the second to the seventh or eighth year when the second dentition be commence no precise rule of diet can be lay down for this period as this require to be adapt in every case to the particular constitution concern there be however certain general principle which must be act upon and which can be easily modify by a judicious and observant parent as circumstance and constitution may require general direction and of animal food -- the diet of the latter month of infancy be still to be continue but with the important addition of animal food which the child have now get tooth to masticate this must be give in small quantity it should be of the lightest quality only allow on alternate day and even then its effect must be carefully watch as all change in the regimen of child should be gradual a child at this age then should have its meal at interval of about four hour : -- thus its breakfast between seven and eight o'clock to consist of top and bottom steep in hot water a little milk add and the whole sweeten with sugar or bread may be soften in hot water the latter drain off and fresh milk and sugar add to the bread its dinner about twelve o'clock to consist every other day of a small quantity of animal food -lrb- chicken fresh mutton or beef be the only meat allow -rrb- with a little bread and water on the alternate day well boil rice and milk a plain bread sago tapioca or arrow - root pudding contain one egg or farinaceous food with beef-tea its afternoon mealy about four o'clock the same diet as form the breakfast at seven a little arrow-root make with a very small proportion of milk or a biscuit or crust of bread after which the child should be put to bed the child must be teach to take its food slowly retain it in it be mouth long and swallow it tardily nothing must be give in the interval of the meal the stomach require a period of repose after the labor of digestion and if the child be entertain by its nurse and its mind occupy there will be no difficulty in follow out this important direction as the child grow older the quantity at each meal should be increase the top and bottom change for bread and pure milk boil or not meat may be take daily except circumstance forbid it and a small quantity of vegetable also if a child then be of a sound constitution with healthy bowels a cool skin and clean tongue the diet may be liberal and provide it be sufficiently advance in age animal food may be take daily too low a diet would stint the growth of such a child and induce a state of body deficient in vigor and unfit for maintain full health : scrofula and other disease would be induce at the same time let the mother guard against pampering for this would lead to evil no less formidable though of a different character and as long as the general health of this child be unimpaired the body and mind active and no evidence present to mark excess of nutriment this diet may be continue but if languor at any time ensue fever become manifest the skin hotter than natural the tongue white and furred and the bowels irregular then though these symptom should bebonly in slight degree and unattended with any specific derangement amount to what be consider disease not only should the parent lower the diet and for a time withdraw the animal part but the medical adviser should be consult that measure may be take to correct the state of repletion which have be suffer to arise for some time after its removal care should also be take to keep the diet under that which occasion the constitutional disturbance but if the child be of a delicate and weakly constitution -lrb- and this be unfortunately the more common case -rrb- it will not bear so generous a diet as the foregoing during the three or four earliest year it should be restricted chiefly to a mild farinaceous diet with a small allowance only of meat on alternate day the constant endeavor of the parent now should be to seek to increase the digestive power and bodily vigor of she child by frequent exercise in the open air and by attention to those general point of management detail in the after - part of this chapter this accomplish a greater proportion of animal food may be give and in fact will become necessary for the growth of the system while at the same time there will be a corresponding power for its assimilation and digestion a great error in the dietetic management of such child be but too frequently commit by parent they suppose that because they child be weakly and delicate that the more animal food it take the more it will be strengthen and they therefore give animal food too early and in too great quantity it only add to its debility the system as a consequence become excited nutrition be impede and disease

age there will be deranged condition of the bowels and headach -- the child will soon become peevish irritable and impatient it will entirely lose the good humor so natural to childhood and that there be something wrong will be evident enough the parent however little suspect the real cause and occasion of all the evil in such a child too it will be find that the ordinary disease of infancy scarlet fever measles small pox etc will be attend with a unusual degree of constitutional disturbance that it will not bear such active treatment as other child or so quickly rally from the illness strength

each interval of wakefulness grow longer so that it sleep less frequently but for longer period at a time this disposition to repose in the early week of the infant 's life must not be interfere with but this period have expire great care be necessary to induce regularity in its hour of sleep otherwise too much will be take in the day-time and restless and disturbed night will follow the child should be bring into the habit of sleep in the middle of the day before its dinner and for about two hour more or less if put to rest at a later period of the day it will invariably cause a bad night at first the infant should sleep with its parent the low temperature of its body and its small power of generate heat render this necessary if it should happen however that the child have disturb and restless night it must immediately be remove to the bed and care of another female to be bring to its mother at a early hour in the morning for the purpose of be nurse this be necessary for the preservation of the mother 's health which through sleepless night would of course be soon deranged and the infant would also suffer from the influence which such deranged health would have upon the milk when a month or six week have elapse the child if healthy may sleep alone in a cradle or cot care be take that it have a sufficiency of clothing that the room in which it be place be sufficiently warm viz 60 degree and the position of the cot itself be not such as to be expose to current of cold air it be essentially necessary to attend to these point since the faculty of produce heat and consequently the power of maintain the temperature be less during sleep than at any other time and therefore exposure to cold be especially injurious it be but too frequently the case that inflammation of some internal organ will occur under such circumstance without the true source of the disease ever be suspect here however a frequent error must be guard against -- that of cover up the infant in its cot with too much clothing throw over its face the muslin handkerchief -- and last of all draw the drapery of the bed closely together the object be to keep the infant sufficiently warm with pure air it therefore ought to have free access to its mouth and the atmosphere of the whole room should be keep sufficiently warm to allow the child to breathe it freely : in winter therefore there must always be a fire in the nursery the child up to two year old at least should sleep upon a feather bed for the reason refer to above the pillow however after the sixth month should be make of horsehair for at this time teethe commence and it be highly important that the head should be keep cool during childhood -- up to the third or fourth year the child should be permit to sleep for a hour or so before its dinner after this time it may gradually be discontinue but it must be recollect that during the whole period of childhood more sleep be require than in adult age the child therefore should be put to rest every evening between seven and eight and if it be in health it will sleep soundly until the follow morning no definite rule however can be lay down in reference to the number of hour of sleep to be allow for one will require more or less than another -lrb- fn # 16 -rrb- regularity as to the time of go to rest be the chief point to attend to permit nothing to interfere with it and then only let the child sleep without disturbance until it awake of its own accord on the follow morning and it will have have sufficient rest -lrb- fn # 16 -rrb- the amount of sleep necessary to preserve health vary accord to the state of the body and the habit of the individual as already observe infant pass much the greater portion of they time in sleep child sleep twelve or fourteen hour the schoolboy generally ten in youth a third part of the twenty-four hour be spend in sleep whilst in advanced age many do not spend more than four five or six hour in sleep it be a cruel thing for a mother to sacrifice she child 's health that she may indulge she own vanity and yet how often be this do in reference to sleep a evening party be to assemble and the little child be keep up for hour beyond its stated time for retire to rest that it may be exhibit fondle and admire its usual portion of sleep be thus abridged and from the previous excitement what little he do obtain be break and unrefreshing and he rise on the morrow weary and exhaust once awake it should not be permit to lie longer in bed but should be encourage to arise immediately this be the way to bring about the habit of early rising which prevent many serious evil to which parent be not sufficiently alive promote both mental and corporeal health and of all habit be say to be the most conducive to longevity a child should never be suddenly arouse from sleep it excite the brain quicken the action of the heart and if often repeat serious consequence would result the change of sleep to wake should always be gradual the bed on which the child now sleep should be a mattress : at this age a feather bed be always injurious to child for the body sink deep into the bed be completely bury in feather and the unnatural degree of warmth thus produce relax and weaken the system particularly the skin and render the child unusually susceptible to the impression of cold then instead of the bed be make up in the morning as soon as vacate and while still saturate with the nocturnal exhalation from the body the bed-clothes should be throw over the back of chair the mattress shake well up and the window throw open for several hour so that the apartment shall be thoroughly ventilate it be also indispensably requisite not to allow the child to sleep with person in bad health or who be far advance in life if possible it should sleep alone sect v bathing and cleanliness during infancy -- too much attention can not be pay to cleanliness it be essential to the infant 's health the principal point to which especial attention must be pay by the parent for this purpose be the following : -- temperature of the water -- at first the infant should be wash daily with warm water and a bath every night for the purpose of thoroughly clean the body be highly necessary to bathe a delicate infant of a few day or even week old in cold water with a view to harden the constitution -lrb- as it be call -rrb- be the most effectual way to undermine its health and entail future disease by degree however the water with which it be sponge in the morning should be make tepid the evening bath be continue warm enough to be grateful to the feeling a few month have pass by the temperature of the water may be gradually lower until cold be employ with which it may be either sponge or even plunge into it every morning during summer if plunge into cold water however it must be keep in but a minute for at this period especially the impression of cold continue for any considerable time depress the vital energy and prevent that healthy glow on the surface which usually follow the momentary and brief action of cold and upon which its usefulness depend with some child indeed there be such extreme delicacy and deficient reaction as to render the cold bath hazardous no warm glow over the surface take place when its use inevitably do harm : its effect therefore must be carefully watch dry the skin -- the surface of the skin should always be carefully and thoroughly rub dry with flannel -- indeed more than dry for the skin should be warm and stimulate by the assiduous gentle friction make use of for this process of wash and dry must not be do languidly but briskly and expeditiously and will then be find to be one of the most effectual means of strengthen the infant it be especially necessary carefully to dry the arm-pits groin and nate and if the child be very fat it will be well to dust over these part with hair-powder or starch : this prevent excoriation and sore which be frequently very troublesome soap be only require to those part of the body which be expose to the reception of dirt napkin -- the frequency of the discharge from the bowels and bladder require a frequent change of napkin a nurse can not be too careful of this duty from the first so that she may be enable to discover the period when those discharge be about to take place that she may not only anticipate they but teach the child at a very early age to give intelligent warning of its necessity thus a habit of regularity with regard to those function will be establish which will continue through life and tend greatly to the promotion of health as the child grow older the system of cleanliness must in no particular be relax and it will be find the best preservative against those eruptive disorder which be so frequent and troublesome during the period of infancy during childhood -- when this period arrive or shortly after bathing be but too frequently leave off the hand and face of the child be keep clean and with this the nurse be satisfy the daily ablution of the whole body however be still necessary not only for the preservation of cleanliness but because it promote in a high degree the health of the child plan to be pursue with the vigorous and healthy -- a child of a vigorous constitution and robust health as he rise from he bed refresh and active by he night 's repose should be put into the shower-bath or if this excite and alarm he too much must be sponge from head to foot with salt water if the weather be very cold the water may be make slightly tepid but if he constitution will bear it the water should be cold throughout the year then the body should be speedily dry and hastily but well rub with a somewhat coarse towel and the clothes put on without any unnecessary delay this should be do every morning of the child 's life if such a child be at the sea-side advantage should be take of this circumstance and seabathing should be substitute the best time be two or three hour after breakfast but he must not be fatigue beforehand for if so the cold bath can not be use without danger care must be take that he do not remain in too long as the animal heat will be lower below the proper degree which would be most injurious in boy of a feeble constitution great mischief be often produce in this way it be a matter also of great consequence in bathing child that they should not be terrify by the immersion and every precaution should be take to prevent this the healthy and robust boy too should early be teach to swim whenever this be practicable for it be attend with the most beneficial effect it be a most invigorating exercise and the cold bath thus become doubly serviceable plan to be pursue with the delicate and strumous -- if a child be of a delicate and strumous constitution the cold bath during the summer be one of the best tonic that can be employ and if live on the coast sea-bathing will be find of singular benefit the effect however of sea-bathing upon such a constitution must be particularly watch for unless it be succeed by a glow -- a feeling of increase strength -- and a keen appetite it will do no good and ought at once to be abandon for the warm or tepid bath the opinion that warm bath generally relax and weaken be erroneous for in this case as in all case when properly employ they would give tone and vigor to the whole system in fact the tepid bath be to this child what the cold bath be to the more robust in conclusion : if the bath in any shape can not from circumstance be obtain then cold saltwater sponging must be use daily and all the year round so long as the proper reaction or glow follow its use but when this be not the case and this will generally occur if the child be delicate and the weather cold tepid vinegar and water or tepid salt water must be substitute sect vi clothing in infancy -- infant be very susceptible of the impression of cold a proper regard therefore to a suitable clothing of the body be imperative to they enjoyment of health unfortunately a opinion be prevalent in society that the tender child have naturally a great power of generate heat and resist cold and from this popular error have arise the most fatal result this opinion have be much strengthen by the insidious manner in which cold operate on the frame the injurious effect not be always manifest during or immediately after its application so that but too frequently the fatal result be trace to a wrong source or the infant sink under the action of a unknown cause the power of generate heat in warm-blooded animal be at its minimum at birth and increase successively to adult age young animal instead of be warmer than adult be generally a degree or two colder and part with they heat more readily fact which can not be too generally know they show how absurd must be the folly of that system of harden the constitution -lrb- to which reference have be before make -rrb- which induce the parent to plunge the tender and delicate child into the cold bath at all season of the year and freely expose it to the cold cut current of a easterly wind with the lightest clothing the principle which ought to guide a parent in clothing she infant be as follow : -- the material and quantity of the clothes should be such as to preserve a sufficient proportion of warmth to the body regulate therefore by the season of the year and the delicacy or strength of the infant 's constitution in effect this however the parent must guard against the too common practice of envelop the child in innumerable fold of warm clothing and keep it constantly confine to very hot and close room thus run into the opposite extreme to that to which i have just allude : for nothing tend so much to enfeeble the constitution to induce disease and render the skin highly susceptible to the impression of cold and thus to produce those very ailment which it be the chief intention to guard against in they make they should be so arrange as to put no restriction to the free movement of all part of the child 's body and so loose and easy as to permit the insensible perspiration to have a free exit instead of be confine to and absorb by the clothes and hold in contact with the skin till it give rise to irritation in they quality they should be such as not to irritate the delicate skin of the child in infancy therefore flannel be rather too rough but be desirable as the child grow older as it give a gentle stimulus to the skin and maintain health in its construction the dress should be so simple as to admit of be quickly put on since dress be irksome to the infant cause it to cry and exciting as much mental irritation as it be capable of feel pin should be wholly dispense with they use be hazardous through the carelessness of nurse and even through the ordinary movement of the infant itself the clothing must be change daily -- it be eminently conducive to good health that a complete change of dress should be make every day if this be not do wash will in a great measure fail in its object especially in insure freedom from skin disease in childhood -- the clothing of the child should possess the same property as that of infancy it should afford due warmth be of such material as do not irritate the skin and so make as to occasion no unnatural constriction in reference to due warmth it may be well again to repeat that too little clothing -lrb- that state of semi-nudity which the vanity of some parent encourage -rrb- be frequently productive of the most sudden attack of active disease and that child who be thus expose with naked breast and thin clothing in a climate so variable as ours be the frequent subject of croup and other dangerous affection of the air - passage and lung on the other hand it must not be forget that too warm clothing be a source of disease -- sometimes even of the same disease which originate in exposure to cold -- and often render the frame more susceptible of the impression of cold especially of cold air take into the lung regulate the clothing then accord to the season resume the winter dress early lay it aside late for it be in spring and autumn that the vicissitude in we climate be greatest and congestive and inflammatory complaint most common with regard to material -lrb- as be before observe -rrb- the skin will at this age bear flannel next to it and it be now not only proper but necessary it may be put off with advantage during the night and cotton maybe substitute during the summer the flannel be resume early in the autumn if from very great delicacy of constitution it prove too irritating to the skin fine fleecy hosiery will in general be easily endure and will greatly conduce to the preservation of health it be highly important that the clothes of the boy should be so make that no restraint shall be put on the movement of the body or limb nor injurious pressure make on he waist or chest all he muscle ought to have full liberty to act as they free exercise promote both they growth and activity and thus insure the regularity and efficiency of the several function to which these muscle be subservient the same remark apply with equal force to the dress of the girl and happily during childhood at least no distinction be make in this matter between the sex not so however when the girl be about to emerge from this period of life a system of dress be then adopt which have the most pernicious effect upon she health and the development of the body the employment of tight stay which impede the free and full action of the respiratory organ be only one of the many restriction and injurious practice from which in latter year they be thus doom to suffer so severely sect vii air and exercise in infancy -- the respiration of a pure air be at all time and under all circumstance indispensable to the health of the infant the nursery therefore should be large well ventilate in a elevated part of the house and so situate as to admit a free supply both of air and light for the same reason the room in which the infant sleep should be large and the air frequently renew for nothing be so prejudicial to its health as sleeping in a impure and heated atmosphere the practice therefore of draw thick curtain closely round the bed be highly pernicious they only answer a useful purpose when they defend the infant from any draught of cold air the proper time for take the infant into the open air must of course be determine by the season of the year and the state of the weather a delicate infant bear late in the autumn will not generally derive advantage from be carry into the open air in this climate till the succeed spring and if the room in which he be keep be large often change and well ventilate he will not suffer from the confinement while he will most probably escape catarrhal affection which be so often the consequence of the injudicious exposure of infant to a cold and humid atmosphere -lrb- fn # 17 -rrb- if however the child be strong and healthy no opportunity should be lose of take it into the open air at state period experience daily prove that it have the most invigorating and vivifying influence upon the system regard however must always be have to the state of the weather and to a damp condition of the atmosphere the infant should never be expose as it be one of the most powerful exciting cause of consumptive disease the nurse-maid too should not be allow to loiter and linger about thus expose the infant unnecessarily and for a undue length of time this be generally the source of all the evil which accrue from take the babe into the open air -lrb- fn # 17 -rrb- sir jame clark on consumption exercise also like air be essentially important to the health of the infant its first exercise of course will be in the nurse 's arm after a month or two when it begin to sleep less during the day it will delight to roll and kick about on the sofa : it will thus use its limb freely and this with carry out into the open air be all the exercise it require at this period by and by however the child will make its first attempt to walk now it be important that none of the many plan which have be devise to teach a child to walk should be adopt -- the go-cart leading-string etc they tendency be mischievous and flatness of the chest confine lung distorted spine and deform leg be so many evil which often originate in such practice this be explain by the fact of the bone in infancy be comparatively soft and pliable and if prematurely subject by these contrivance to carry the weight of the body they yield just like a elastic stick bend under a weight and as a natural consequence become curved and distorted it be highly necessary that the young and experienced mother should recollect this fact for the early effort of the little one to walk be naturally view by she with so much delight that she will be apt to encourage and prolong its attempt without any thought of the mischief which they may occasion thus many a parent have have to mourn over the deformity which she have herself create it may be as well here to remark that if such distortion be timely notice it be capable of correction even after evident curvature have take place it be to be remedy by use those means that shall invigorate the frame and promote the child 's general health -lrb- a daily plunge into the cold bath or sponge with cold salt water will be find signally efficacious -rrb- and by avoid the original cause of the distortion -- never allow the child to get upon he foot the only way to accomplish the latter intention be to put both the leg into a large stock this will effectually answer this purpose while at the same time it do not prevent the free and full exercise of the muscle of the leg after some month pursue this plan the limb will be find no longer deform the bone to have acquire firmness and the muscle strength and the child may be permit to get upon he foot again without any hazard of perpetuate or renew the evil the best mode of teach a child to walk be to let it teach itself and this it will do readily enough it will first crawl about : this exercise every muscle in the body do not fatigue the child throw no weight upon the bone but impart vigor and strength and be thus highly useful after a while have the power it will wish to do more : it will endeavor to lift itself upon its foot by the aid of a chair and though it fail again and again in its attempt it will still persevere until it accomplish it by this it learn first to raise itself from the floor and secondly to stand but not without keep hold of the object on which it have seize next it will balance itself without hold and will proudly and laughingly show that it can stand alone fearful however as yet of move its limb without support it will seize a chair or anything else near it when it will dare to advance as far as the limit of its support will permit this little adventure will be repeat day after day with increase exultation when after numerous trial he will feel confident of he power to balance himself and he will run alone now time be require for this gradual self-teaching during which the muscle and bone become strengthened and when at last call upon to sustain the weight of the body be fully capable of do so in childhood -- when the child have acquire sufficient strength to take active exercise he can scarcely be too much in the open air the more he be habituate to this the more capable will he be of bear the vicissitude of the climate child too should always be allow to amuse themselves at pleasure for they will generally take that kind and degree of exercise which be best calculate to promote the growth and development of the body in the unrestrained indulgence of they youthful sport every muscle of the body come in for its share of active exercise and free growth vigor and health be the result if however a child be delicate and strumous and too feeble to take sufficient exercise on foot -- and to such a constitution the respiration of a pure air and exercise be indispensable for the improvement of health and without they all other effort will fail -- ride on a donkey or pony form the best substitute this kind of exercise will always be find of infinite service to delicate child it amuse the mind and exercise the muscle of the whole body and yet in so gentle a manner as to induce little fatigue the exercise of horseback however be most particularly useful where there be a tendency in the constitution to pulmonary consumption either from hereditary or accidental cause it be here beneficial as well through its influence on the general health as more directly on the lung themselves there can be no doubt that the lung like the muscle of the body acquire power and health of function by exercise now during a ride this be obtain and without much fatigue to the body the free and equable expansion of the lung by full inspiration necessarily take place this maintain they healthy structure by keep all the air-passage open and pervious it prevent congestion in the pulmonary circulation and at the same time provide more completely for the necessary chemical action on the blood by change at each act of respiration a sufficient proportion of the whole air contain in the lung -- all object of great importance and all capable of be promote more or less by the means in question and be it remember that these remark apply with equal force to the girl as to the boy she should be allow and even encourage to take the same active exercise fortunately this course be follow during childhood not so unfortunately -lrb- in the majority of case at least -rrb- after this period young female be then subject to those unnatural restraint both in exercise and dress which fashion and vanity impose to be follow by effect which though not immediately obvious be capable of lay the foundation of evil that can not afterwards be remedy a good carriage be the point aim at -lrb- and to which i particularly refer -rrb- and the means adopt for its cultivation fail after all in they end just in proportion to they rigid employment for this purpose the head be keep erect and the shoulder draw back and they be to be keep in this position not for a hour or so but continually to preserve however this unnatural and constrain position require considerable muscular power such as no girl can exercise without long painful and injurious training nor even by this unless other measure be resort to in aid of she direct endeavor for instead of the muscle obtain increase power and strength by these effort -lrb- to enforce a good carriage -rrb- they be enfeebled and soon become more and more incapable of perform what be require of they this fact soon become perceptible weakness be notice but instead of correct this by the only rational mode that of invigorate the weakened muscle mechanical aid be call in to support they and lace waistcoat be resort to these undoubtedly give support -- nay they may be so use as almost wholly to supersede the muscular effort with the advantage of not tire however long or continuously employ improvement of carriage be manifest the child be sensible of relief from a painful exertion the mother be please with the success of she management and this success appear to superficial observation fully to confirm the judgment which superintend it yet what be the consequence to which she measure tend and which such measure be daily and hourly produce the muscle of the back and chest restrain in they natural and healthful exercise by the waistcoat call in to aid they and more signally in after-life by the tightly - lace stay or corset become attenuate and still further enfeebled until at length they be wholly dependent on the mechanical aid be quite incapable of dispense with it for any continuance by and by a taper waist become a object of ambition and the stay be lace more closely than ever this be still do gradually and at first imperceptibly to the party the effect however though slow be sure and the power of endurance thus exercise come in time to bear almost unconsciously what if suddenly or quickly attempt no heroism could possibly sustain this increase pressure impede the motion of the rib for perfect respiration these motion should be free and unrestrained and perfect respiration be necessary to those change in the blood which fit it for nutrition and the other purpose of the animal frame in proportion as respiration be impede be the blood imperfectly vitalise and in the same ratio be the nutrient and other function dependent on the blood inadequately perform here then be one source of debility which affect the whole frame reduce every part below the standard of healthful vigor quicken respiration soon ensue the heart become excited the pulse accelerate and palpitation be in time superadded there be still further evil produce by tight lacing for the pressure be chiefly make on the lower part of the chest the stomach and liver be necessarily compress to the great disturbance of they function and be press downward too these trespass on that space which the other abdominal viscera require superinduce still further derangement thus almost every function of the body become more or less impede and again the girl not be able always to have she body case in the tight-laced stay some relaxation must take place under it the muscle of the back deprive of they accustomed support and incapable of themselves to sustain the incumbent weight yield and the column of the spine bend at first anteriorly cause round shoulder and a arch back but eventually incline to one or other side give rise to the well-known and too frequently occur state of lateral curvature this last change most frequently commence in the sit posture such female be through general debility much disposed to sedentary habit such though but very slightly sketch be a few of the evil attend this baneful practice but how then be a good carriage to be obtain which be not only please to the eye but be when natural absolutely conducive itself to health to insure a good carriage the only rational way be to give the necessary power especially to the muscle chiefly concerned and this be to be do not by weary those muscle by continual and unrelieved exertion but by invigorate the frame generally and more especially by strengthen the particular muscle through varied exercise alternate with due repose attention to general health suitable diet regular bowels moderate but regular exercise not of particular muscle only but of the whole frame cold-bathing or sponging and other such measure will maintain a good carriage by give that power which the more direct means so generally practice serve but to exhaust -lrb- fn # 18 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 18 -rrb- the above remark on good carriage be almost wholly take from a valuable article of dr barlow 's in the cyclopaedia of practical medicine chap ii on the use and abuse of certain remedy sect i -- aperient medicine one of the greatest error of the nursery be the too frequent and indiscriminate exhibition by the mother or nurse of purgative medicine to the infant various be the form in which it be give perhaps the little powder obtain from the chemist be the most frequent as it be certainly the most injurious form they chief ingredient be calomel the choice of the aperient or the dose or the exact condition of the health of the infant or whether it be a aperient at all that be require be point entirely overlook : a little medicine be think necessary because the child appear unwell and a purgative or a little white powder be forthwith give the great art of medicine be the proper application of the proper medicine in the proper dose at the proper time point never consider in the nursery for example i have know a large dose of magnesia give by a nurse to a infant that have be suffer from a diarrhoea of some day ' standing and very quickly cause death now magnesia be one of the most useful and harmless medicine that can be give to a infant when indicate when prescribe in a dose suit to its age and when the proper time be fix upon for its exhibition in the foregoing case however every thing forbid its use but none of these point be consider aperient medicine too be sometimes unwittingly repeat to remove those symptom which it have itself produce some incidental pain and uneasiness some slightly greenish appearance of the motion lead the mother to believe that more purge be necessary when in fact both circumstance have probably be induce by the irritation cause by the purgative already too freely administer how frequently be this the case during the first week or ten day of the infant 's life when the nurse dose the child with tea-spoonful after tea-spoonful of castor oil for the relief of pain which she repeated dose of medicine have alone create the bowels of a infant in health should be relieved two three or four time in the twenty-four hour the stool should be of the consistence of thin mustard and of a lightish yellow color have little smell free from lump or white curdy matter and pass without pain or any considerable quantity of wind and a parent be only justified in give aperient medicine when any deviation from these condition exist and only then when what may be call healthy costiveness be present viz either the stool less frequent than they ought to be or lumpy and partially solid then the only purgative medicine that can be give with safely to a infant without medical sanction be castor oil manna rhubarb and magnesia the application of the lavement and the aperient liniment castor oil this be one of the mildest aperient prompt in its action and effective in clear out the contents of the bowels it be a medicine therefore particularly applicable to infant during teethe there be generally much torpor of the bowels here then castor oil be a very appropriate and useful artificial means of increase the frequency of the alvine discharge then again no purgative can be so much rely on for overcome habitual costiveness as castor oil it may for this purpose be give daily for some week gradually reduce the dose until only a few drop be take after which the bowels generally continue to act without further artificial assistance even its occasional administration leave the bowels in a relax state a great advantage over other purgative which generally cause after they action be pass off a confine state the proper dose will depend upon the age and the known effect of aperient medicine upon the childsome require more other less : under one year one small tea-spoonful under three year two ditto under six year three ditto under ten year and upward a table spoonful the quantity be more or less accord to the facility with which the bowels be purge it may be give in various way pour upon a little mint water or blended with a little moist sugar -- or if the stomach be unusually delicate the oil may be make into a emulsion with some aromatic water by the intervention of the yolk of a egg and a little syrup of rose or sugar combine with it the follow proportion make a elegant and not at all a disagreeable mixture of which a desert - spoonful -lrb- or more accord to the age -rrb- may be repeat every hour until it operate : castor oil six drachm the yolk of a egg mix well together and add dill water two ounce syrup of rose two drachm manna this also may be give with impunity to the youngest infant it be sweet to the taste and mild in its operation it should be exhibit in dose of one to two drachm in a little warm milk or if it cause flatulence in this form in some aromatic water a desert spoonful of carraway-seed or dill water for child above two year it must always be give with some other aperient : thus it may be combine with castor oil by the medium of mucilage or the yolk of a egg in fact it might be substitute for the syrup of rose in the previous prescription for castor oil magnesia and rhubarb magnesia besides be a laxative allay irritability of the stomach it be consequently useful during dentition at which period there be both much irritability and a prevail acescency of the stomach the dose be from five grain to ten for a infant increase the quantity to fifteen grain or twenty to child of nine or ten year of age when take alone the best vehicle be hot milk which greatly quicken its aperient operation and whenever the bowels be distend with wind the pure magnesia be preferable to the carbonate it be well to mention here that when the infant throw up the nurse 's milk it be generally curdle a fact which lead the inexperienced mother to infer that the child be suffer from acidity and to counteract the suppose evil magnesia be give again and again this be a useless and pernicious practice for curdling or coagulation of the milk always take place in the stomach and be produce by the gastric juice and be so far from be a morbid process that milk can not be properly digest without it rhubarb it should always be recollect have a astringent as well as purgative property accord to the extent of the dose in which it be administer the former of which never oppose or interfere with the energy of the latter since it only take effect when the substance be administer in small dose or if give in larger one not until it have cease to operate as a cathartic this latter circumstance render it particularly eligible in case of diarrhoea as it evacuate the offend matter before it operate as a astringent upon the bowels as a purgative it operate mildly and may be give to the youngest infant if from two to twelve month old from three to six grain for child above that age the dose may range from ten grain to twenty its operation however be much quicken by the addition of magnesia both of which be more effective when thus unite than when give separately the following form in a costive and flatulent state of the bowels will be find useful -lrb- fn # 19 -rrb- a tea-spoonful or more may be give every three or four hour until the desire effect be obtain : -- powdered rhubarb half a drachm magnesia two scruple compound spirit of ammonia twenty drop dill water two ounce simple syrup two drachm -lrb- fn # 19 -rrb- this may be make up and keep in the nursery for a long time without spoil rhubarb mixed with flour and warm water may be make into a poultice and apply to the abdomen of a child that obstinately refuse to swallow medicine and it will be find to produce the same effect as if the medicine have be take into the stomach it will purge briskly the lavement this be a excellent nursery remedy when the bowels be obstinately costive it may then be employ as a substitute for medicine a protracted and frequent use of which -lrb- even of the mildest aperient -rrb- be apt to injure the digestive function and to give rise to some degree of intestinal irritation lavement however like aperient medicine must not be resort to for a long time together for whilst the latter irritate the former most certainly tend after a long continued use to debilitate the bowels and thus render they less than ever dispose to act for themselves they be a excellent occasional remedy the simplest form of a aperient enema be warm water but barley - water or thin gruel or even milk and water be to be prefer at all time as they be of a more bland and less irritating nature if it be desirable to increase the strength of the injection castor oil may be add the proportion of fluid which be necessary for the different stage of life under ordinary circumstance maybe state as follow : -- a infant at its birth require about one fluid ounce a child between the age of one and five year from three to four fluid ounce and a youth of ten or fifteen from six to eight fluid ounce the mode of administer a injection to a infant deserve particular attention as injury might be cause by its be perform in a careless or unskilful manner a gum elastic pipe should be always use instead of the hard ivory tube have smear this over with lard and place the infant on its left side with its knee bent up in the lap of the nurse it be to be pass a couple of inch into the bowel in a direction not parallel to the axis of the body but rather incline to the leave the latter circumstance should never be neglect for if not attend to there will be difficulty in administer the injection the fluid must then be propel very gradually or it will be instantly reject on the whole be throw up -lrb- the pipe carefully and slowly withdraw -rrb- the child must be keep quietly repose on its nurse 's lap and in the same posture for some little time the aperient liniment a liniment to be rub on the stomach be another resource in case of habitual costiveness and will frequently be attend with great success when repeat purgative have be resist olive or castor oil may be use for this purpose they must be warm and rub over the abdomen night and morning for five or ten minute perhaps the best form of liniment that can be make use of be the following : -- compound soap liniment one ounce compound tincture of aloe half a ounce sect ii -- calomel calomel be one of the most useful medicine we possess but though powerful for good it be by no means powerless for mischief and page might be write upon the evil effect which have result from its indiscriminate use in the nursery medical man be daily and hourly witness this fact it be particularly eligible in the disease of child but then it be quite impossible for unprofessional person to judge when it may be appropriately exhibit and it can not be too generally know that the effect of this medicine upon the evacuation be always to make they appear unnatural from ignorance of this fact calomel be often repeat again and again to relieve that very condition which it have itself produce cause but too frequently a degree of irritation in the delicate lining membrane of the bowel which it may be very difficult for a medical man to remove and perhaps a source of misery to the child as long as it live its frequent exhibition have also another evil attend it for the immoderate use of mercury in early infancy produce more perhaps than any other similar cause that

the whole anterior arch of the jaw from the first double tooth on the left side to the eye-tooth on the right by degree the dead portion of bone be raise and become loose when i find that the mischief be not confine to the alveolar process but comprise the whole substance of the bone within the space just mention etc surely the knowledge of such a case as this would induce every prudent mother to exclude calomel from she list of domestic nursery medicine sect iii -- opiate this class of medicine be often keep in the nursery in the form of laudanum syrup of white poppy dalby 's carminative and godfrey 's cordial the object with which they be generally give be to allay pain by produce sleep they be therefore remedy of great convenience to the nurse and i be sorry to be oblige to add that so exhibit they be but too often fatal to the little patient the fact be that in the hand of the physician there be no medicine the administration of which require greater caution and judgment than opiate both from the susceptibility of infant to they narcotic influence and they vary capability of bear it the danger therefore with which they use be fraught in the hand of a nurse should for ever exclude they from the list of domestic nursery medicine dalby 's carminative and godfrey 's cordial be perhaps more frequently use than any other form and some striking case illustrative of the fatal result of exhibit they indiscriminately and without medical sanction be on record -lrb- fn # 21 -rrb- the late dr clark in he commentary mention a case which he see where forty drop of dolly 's carminative destroy a infant dr merriman give the follow in a note in underwood on the disease of child : -- -lrb- fn # 21 -rrb- two or three fatal case and upon which coroner ' inquest be hold have occur within the last two year a woman living near fitzroy square think she child not quite well give it a dose of godfrey 's cordial which she purchase at a chemist 's in the neighborhood in a very short time after take it the child fall into convulsion and soon die in less than a month the child of another woman in the same house be find to be ill with disorder bowels the first woman not at all suspect that the godfrey 's cordial have produce the convulsion in she infant persuade she friend to give the same medicine to she child a dose from the same bottle be give and this child be likewise attack almost immediately with convulsion and also die convulsion and epilepsy without such fatal result as the foregoing be not uncommon as the effect of a single dose of a opiate give unadvisedly and by they continue and habitual use -lrb- and the form of syrup of poppy be but too often administer by a indiscreet and lazy nurse unknown by the parent -rrb- a low irritative febrile state be produce gradually follow by loss of flesh the countenance become pallid sallow and sunken the eye red and swollen and the expression stupid and heavy and the power of the constitution at last become completely undermine such a object be to be see daily among the poorer class -- the miniature of a sickly aged person : death soon follow here sect iv -- leech difficulty sometimes arise in put a stop to the bleeding from leech-bite a matter of considerable importance in the case of a delicate infant the follow measure may be resort to for this purpose : -- 1 expose the surface of the part to the external air so that a coagulum of blood may form at the orifice : this simple mode will frequently arrest it 2 if this fail make compression upon the part : this be one of the most effectual means of restrain hemorrhage it be to be effect by take a piece of lint fold three or four thickness and the size of the finger-nail to be steadily press upon the open orifice with the point of the finger until the blood have cease to flow the pledget of lint however must not be remove for some hour afterwards or the bleeding will break out afresh 3 if the compression fail in stop the bleeding or from the situation of the leech-bite it can not be adopt because there be no firm point of resistance upon which to make pressure the part may be dust with starch or gum arabic powder or if this be of no avail the wound may be touch with lunar caustic if none of these measure be successful the assistance of the medical attendant must be obtain and if firm pressure be make upon the part no serious loss of blood can ensue before he arrival leech should never be resort to by a parent for any of the disease of infancy without medical direction sect v -- blister and poultice a blister should never be apply for any infantile disease except when order by a medical man as its injudicious use might greatly aggravate the complaint there be also one or two precaution in reference to the mode of the application of a blister which it be always right for a parent to attend to from the great irritability of the skin it should never be allow to remain on longer than from two to four hour at the expiration of this time the surface will usually become red and inflamed and if the blister be remove and the part dress with fresh spermaceti ointment spread on lint or with a soft bread and water poultice a full blister will soon be raise : the little patient be thus save much suffering and a very troublesome sore prevent a piece of tissue or silver paper interpose between the blister and the skin will answer the same purpose the blister will act well and the evil before allude to will be prevent after a blister have be two or three hour apply its edge should be carefully raise to ascertain the effect produce and if the surface be much inflamed more particularly if little point of vesication -lrb- watery bladder -rrb- be present it should be remove and the above direction attend to mustard poultice be invaluable in some of the disease of infancy and childhood and therefore frequently order a mustard poultice be make by mix two third of mustard flour and one third of wheaten flour with warm water or vinegar in sufficient quantity to render the powder of the consistence of paste it be then spread on linen from the size of a half-crown to that of the palm of the hand accord to the effect intend and place on the skin how long it be to be keep on will depend upon the individual sensibility of the skin of the child but in general from fifteen to twenty minute will be find amply sufficient the application however must at all time be carefully watch for if it remain on too long ulceration and death of the part might ensue therefore directly the skin be find tolerably red the poultice should be remove after its removal the part may be expose or if very painful smear over with fresh cream or common cerate a bread and water poultice although one of the commonest application in use be rarely well make or properly apply it thus become injurious rather than useful add to the inflammation or irritation of the part instead of soothing and allay it nothing however be more simple than the mode of its preparation cut slice of stale bread of sufficient quantity scald out a bason put the bread into it pour upon it boiling water cover it over and let it stand for ten minute next strain the water oft gently squeeze the saturated bread in a thin cloth so that the poultice shall not be too moist and then spread it upon a cloth so that it shall be in thickness half a inch and of a size large enough to cover the whole of the inflamed part and a little more apply it just warm enough to be bear and cover it well with oil silk a poultice thus make will act as a local tepid bath to the inflamed part and the oil silk prevent evaporation it will be find when take off as moist as the first moment that it be put on sect vi -- bath bath be much resort to during infancy and childhood both in health and in disease in the former state they constitute a important measure of hygeiene -lrb- this have be briefly allude to under the section bathing -rrb- and in the latter a valuable remedial agent they indiscriminate use however might be follow by serious consequence it be therefore important to point out a few rule for they judicious employment the cold water plunge bath it consist of water in its natural degree of heat its temperature vary accord to the season of the year or other circumstance from 30 degree to 60 degree the phenomenon produce upon a strong and healthy boy plunge into this bath will be as follow : -- he will first experience a sensation of cold follow by slight shuddering and if the immersion have be sudden a peculiar impression in the nervous system call a shock almost immediately after the shock the feeling of cold will vanish and give place to a sensation of warmth speedily diffuse itself over the whole frame if the boy leave the bath at this time or at all event before the warmth of the body go off and quickly dress himself a renewal of the reaction which have follow the shock of immersion will be experience he will be in a most delightful glow -- there will be a general feeling of enjoyment accompany by a sensible increase of animal power and invigoration of the whole system but on the other hand if the boy greatly prolong he stay in the water no reaction will ensue and he will become chilly which will gradually increase to a strong and general shiver -- he foot and leg will become benumbed and the whole body will soon be languid exhaust and powerless the same result will happen to the young and delicate infant if plunge into this bath the same sensation will be produce except that here the shock be scarcely follow by any reaction and therefore from the first moment of the immersion the shiver and consequent train of sensation occur this arise from the infant at birth have less power of produce heat than when further advance in age from the foregoing remark then it will be see that in early infancy the cold bath be inadmissible and water of a higher temperature than that which feel cool to the hand of the nurse should always be use at this age but that as the child grow older -- if of a healthy and vigorous constitution -- the cold bath be unquestionably most desirable and if use in a proper manner will be find to act as a most powerful tonic to the system the summer be of course the only period of the year when the cold plunging bath can be resort to for the child sea bathing when sea bathing can be obtain it be even more conducive to the health of the child than the fresh water plunge bath for the sea water be more tonic stimulant and brace than fresh the period of the year best adapt for sea bathing be the summer and autumn the best time of the day for bathing be two or three hour after breakfast except in very hot weather when a earlier hour must be choose exercise be always useful previously to the bath but it must be gentle so as not to induce fatigue or much perspiration then the bath must be enter suddenly with a plunge inasmuch as a instantaneous immersion produce a greater reaction than a gradual immersion -lrb- fn # 22 -rrb- the length of time of remain in will depend upon circumstance one dip only be enough at the first bath subsequently the time of remain in the water may be prolonged but this must be increase gradually the positive necessity of leave the bath while there still remain sufficient power of reaction be always keep in mind exercise in the water particularly that of swimming be highly useful the body should be speedily and well dry immediately upon come out a rough jack towel be a excellent means of accomplish this purpose while at the same time it insure considerable friction of the surface of the skin if the boy be in sound health he may bathe daily -lrb- fn # 22 -rrb- it be a matter of importance in bathing child that they should not be terrify by the immersion and every precaution should be take to prevent this as a remedy sea bathing be highly serviceable its employment however require much caution and great mischief be sometimes commit by its indiscriminate use the child of a strumous habit may be greatly benefit by sea bathing unite with a few year ' residence on the coast indeed by carefully follow up a course of sea bathing a suitable diet and a judicious mode of live the very temperament of the individual may be all but change and a power and activity impart to the system productive eventually of comparatively strong and robust health a parent will do wisely therefore to send a child of such a habit to a school on the coast great caution however must be observe when bathing be commence lest the shock be too powerful for the energy of the system and be not follow by the necessary degree of reaction it will be prudent to begin with the tepid bath -lrb- 85 degree to 92 degree -rrb- and gradually reduce the temperature until the open sea can be resort to without fear the measure already mention for promote reaction -- exercise previous to immersion the immersion at first only momentary and follow by strong friction -- must be diligently regard in such a case in the child of a delicate and feeble habit much out of health whose general debility be dependent on some organic disease sea bathing be not only improper but dangerous instead of be strengthen such a child will be render more weak and debilitate on the other hand when the child be of a weak and relax habit but free from organic disease the cold bath will be highly useful provide sufficient power of reaction exist in the system in this case the skin and flesh of the child be relax and flabby there be a great tendency to warm perspiration in bed capricious appetite confine or relax bowels indisposition to exertion and weariness from the slightest effort the shower bath the effect of the shower bath be on the whole similar to those of the plunge bath of the same degree of temperature except that the immediate shock of the shower bath be in general feel to be greater than that from simple immersion this however may be meet by put warm water into the bottom of the bath in sufficient quantity to cover the ankle of the individual take the bath which tend at once to lessen the shock and to increase the reaction the apprehension and alarm experience by young child in enter this kind of bath be easily overcome by use at first a modification of it lately bring into use it consist of a tin vessel in the form of a large bottle pierce at the bottom like a colander and terminate in the upper part in a narrow tube with a open mouth when put into water it become fill which be retain by close the mouth of the tube with the finger on remove which the water flow gradually out of the sieve-like bottom in a gentle shower this may be use to the youngest child at first the quantity of water employ should be small and its temperature warm as however the child grow older and accustom to the bath the former may be increase and the latter lower its tonic effect may be augment by the addition ofbay salt and by much active rub as the child get older the common form of shower bath may be use and throughout the year if he enjoy robust health during the winter season however the water should be make tepid this bath should be take immediately upon rise from bed ablution or sponging by ablution be mean the process of apply water to the surface of the body by means of a sponge or towel it be one of the best substitute for the cold bath and if do quickly and thoroughly produce a glow and invigoration of frame almost equal to the former it be also the surest preventive against catch cold every child in health ought to be oblige every morning of its life -lrb- when other means of bathing can not be obtain -rrb- upon rise and while the body still retain all the warmth of the bed to sponge the whole body if too young to do it for himself it must be do for he salt or vinegar should be add to the water and if the boy be robust cold water may be use throughout the year if not in the winter season it must be make tepid as a remedy cold water sponging and the application of ice and iced water be often order under certain state of disease by the medical attendant and frequently follow by delightful result but it be necessary that they should be properly apply to do good cold water sponging be a convenient and grateful method of moderate febrile heat of the surface provide undoubted power of reaction be present in the system it be frequently order therefore to be employ in eruptive fever as measles scarlet fever smallpox and other fever and also in some local inflammation particularly of the brain vinegar may be add to the water under these circumstance with advantage it should at first be use tepid or cool but afterwards cold as a general rule the more dry and parch the heat of the surface the more urgent the necessity for the application of the cold and the more frequently and fearlessly ought it to be renew -- every hour or half-hour not be too often should the child fall asleep during the process and begin to perspire it must be intermit but resume again on a recurrence of the parching heat ice and iced water be most frequently employ in affection of the brain the former be most conveniently apply in a well-cleaned pig 's bladder which should be half fill with broken fragment of the ice the bladder prevent moisture about the clothes and from its smooth and pliant nature readily accommodate itself to every part of the child 's head if iced water be use care must be take that the cloth be sufficiently large to cover the whole of the head and they should be double to prevent they get rapidly warm indeed in apply cold locally as in inflammation of the brain one rule it be of the utmost importance to observe viz that the application of the cold shall be continuous therefore a second set of cold cloth or bag of ice should be apply before the former have become warm this plan especially pursue during the night along with judicious internal treatment will save many child from perish under the most insidious and fatal disease of childhood -- water on the brain if neither water of a sufficiently low temperature nor ice can be procure then recourse may be have to refrigerate mixture of which the follow be a good form : -- common water five pint vinegar two pint nitre eight ounce sal ammoniac four ounce the warm bath the warm bath judiciously prescribe be one of the most valuable remedial agent we possess but although powerful for good when misapply it be equally powerful for mischief for instance in active inflammatory affection before the loss of blood the use of the warm bath would greatly aggravate the disease and yet for a infant with active inflammation of the respiratory organ it be continually resort to again nothing be more common than for a child when attack with convulsion to be put immediately in the warm bath and generally speak it be extremely beneficial in this class of disease but it be sometimes no less prejudicial when apply without due examination of the peculiarity of individual case for in plethoric and gross child the local abstraction of blood from the head and the complete unload of the alimentary canal be often necessary to render such a measure beneficial or even free from danger in convulsion however and particularly when arise from teethe a parent may without hesitation at any time immerse the foot of the infant in water as warm as can be bear at the same time that cloth wet with cold water be apply to the head and temple as a preventive where there be a tendency to disease the warm bath may be employ without scruple and will be find most serviceable its value in this point of view be very great and it be to be regret that it be not sufficiently appreciate and use for example a severe cold have be take and inflammation of the air - tube be threaten : only put the child into a warm bath and with the common domestic remedy a very serious attack may be ward off again in the commencement of a diarrhoea a warm bath and discontinue the cause of the attack will alone suffice to cure and more-over in the protracted diarrhoea attendant upon teethe where after various remedy have be try in vain the child have lose flesh and strength to a apparently hopeless degree recovery have be bring about by the simple use of the warm bath in the treatment of scrofulous child warm and tepid bathing be of great value in such case a course of warm sea bathing with active friction over the whole surface after each bath will at once relieve that abdominal fulness which be generally present improve the function of the skin and give tone and vigor to the whole system towards the termination of such a course of bath they temperature must be gradually reduce till they become tepid -lrb- 85 degree to 92 degree -rrb- the opinion that warm bath generally relax be erroneous : they be no doubt debilitate when use by person of a weak and relax constitution or when continue too long but on the contrary they invariably give tone when employ in the case to which they be properly applicable a partial warm bath such as the foot-bath be of much service in ward off many complaint if a child get the foot wet plunge they into warm water will often prevent any ill consequence and even when the first chill and slight shivering which usher in cold fever and other inflammatory complaint have be complain of the disease may be cut short by the use of a foot-bath continued till free perspiration occur rule for the use of the warm bath temperature of the water -- when the warm bath be use as a measure of hygeiene as a general rule any degree of temperature may be choose between 92 degree and 98 degree which appear to be most agreeable to the child but on no account must 98 degree be exceed when order as a remedial measure the temperature will of course be fix by the medical attendant the same degree of temperature must be keep up during the whole period of immersion for this purpose the thermometer must be keep in the bath and addition of warm water make as the temperature be find to decrease these addition of warm water however must be regulate by the indication of the thermometer and not by the feeling of the child period of remain in the bath -- this must depend upon circumstance as a measure of hygeiene it must be vary accord to the age of the child for the first four or five week the infant should not be keep in beyond three or four minute and the duration must afterwards be gradually prolong as the child advance in age until it extend to a quarter of a hour a period which may be allow after it have attain the age of four year when the bath be employ as a remedial agent the time of immersion must be prolong this will be determine by the medical adviser speak generally a quarter of a hour may be say to be the shortest period a hour the longest and half a hour the medium when in the bath care must be take that the child 's body be immerse up to the shoulder or neck otherwise that part of the body which be out of the bath -lrb- the shoulder arm and chest -rrb- be expose to the cooler temperature of the air will be chill when the infant or child be take out of the bath the general surface especially the foot must be carefully rub dry with towel previously warm and when one of the object of the bath be to excite much perspiration the child should be immediately wrap in flannel and put to bed when however the object be not to excite perspiration the child may be dress in he ordinary clothing but should not be allow to expose himself to the open air for at least a hour time of use the bath -- when resort to for sudden illness the bath must of course be employ at any time need when use for any complaint of long standing or a measure of hygeiene as a general rule it should be take between breakfast and dinner about two hour after the former or a hour and a half before the latter this imply that the infant should never be put into the bath after have be freely nourish at the breast neither should it ever be use when the child be in a state of free perspiration from exercise or on awake from sleep chap iii of teething and hint on the permanent or adult tooth the infant at birth have no tooth visible : the mouth be toothless it possess however hide in the jaw the rudiment of two set the first of these which make its appearance be call the temporary or milk tooth the second the permanent or adult tooth and these come up as the former fall out and so gradually replace they sect i -- on teethe the manner in which the temporary or milk-teeth appear -- the first set of tooth or milk-teeth as they be call be twenty in number they usually appear in pair and those of the lower jaw generally precede the corresponding one of the upper the first of the milk-tooth be generally cut about the sixth or seventh month and the last of the set at various period from the twentieth to the thirtieth month thus the whole period occupy by the first dentition may be estimate at from a year and a half to two year the process vary however in different individual both as to its whole duration and as to the period and order in which the tooth make they appearance it be unnecessary however to add more upon this point they developement be a natural process it be too frequently however render a painful and difficult one by error in the management of the regimen and health of the infant previously to the come of the tooth and during the process itself thus chiefly in consequence of injudicious management it be make the most critical period of childhood not that i believe the extent of mortality fairly traceable to it be by any means so great as have be state for it be rate as high as one sixth of all the child who undergo it still no one doubt that first dentition be frequently a period of great danger to the infant it therefore become a very important question to a anxious and affectionate mother how the danger and difficulty of teethe can in any degree be diminish or if possible altogether prevent a few hint upon this subject then may be useful i shall consider first the management of the infant when teethe be accomplish without difficulty -- and secondly the management of the infant when it be attend with difficulty management of the infant when teethe be without difficulty in the child of a healthy constitution which have be properly that be naturally feed upon the milk of its mother alone the symptom attend teething will be of the mildest kind and the management of the infant most simple and easy symptom -- the symptom of natural dentition -lrb- which this may be fairly call -rrb- be a increase flow of saliva with swell and heat of the gum and occasionally flushing of the cheek the child frequently thrust its finger or any thing within its grasp into its mouth its thirst be increase and it take the breast more frequently though from the tender state of the gum for shorter period than usual it be fretful and restless and sudden fit of cry and occasional start from sleep with a slight tendency to vomit and even looseness of the bowels be not uncommon many of these symptom often precede the appearance of the tooth by several week and indicate that what be call breed the tooth be go on in such case the symptom disappear in a few day to recur again when the tooth approach the surface of the gum treatment -- the management of the infant in this case be very simple and seldom call for the interference of the medical attendant the child ought to be much in the open air and well exercise : the bowels should be keep freely open with castor oil and be always gently relax at this time cold sponge employ daily and the surface of the body rub dry with as rough a flannel as the delicate skin of the child will bear friction be very useful the breast should be give often but not for long at a time the thirst will thus be allay the gum keep moist and relax and they irritation soothe without the stomach be overload the mother must also carefully attend at this time to she own health and diet and avoid all stimulant food or drink from the moment dentition begin pressure on the gum will be find to be agreeable to the child by numb the sensibility and dull the pain for this purpose coral be usually employ or a piece of orris-root or scrape liquorice root a flat ivory ring however be far safer and better for there be no danger of its be thrust into the eye or nose gentle friction of the gum also by the finger of the nurse be please to the infant and as it seem to have some effect in allay irritation may be frequently resort to in france and in this country also it be very much the practice to dip the liquorice-root and other substance into honey or powdered sugar-candy and in germany a small bag contain a mixture of sugar and spice be give to the infant to suck whenever it be fretful and uneasy during teethe the constant use however of sweet and stimulating ingredient must do injury to the stomach and render they employment very objectionable the management of the infant in difficult teething in the child which have be partly or altogether bring up by hand or who be of a feeble and delicate constitution or imbue with any hereditary taint the process of dentition will be attend with more or less difficulty and not unfrequendy with danger symptom -- the symptom of difficult dentition be of a much more aggravate description than those which attend the former case and it be right that a mother should to a certain extent be acquaint with they character that she may early request that medical aid which if judiciously apply will mitigate and generally quickly remove they difficult dentition will be attend with painful inflammation and swell of the gum which be hotter of a deeper red than natural and intolerant of the slightest pressure there be often great determination of blood to the head which a mother may recognize by the cheek be red hot and swollen the eye red irritable and watery and the saliva run from the mouth profusely the fever be great and the thirst extreme the child be at one time restless and irritable and at another heavy and oppressed : the sleep will be break and the infant frequently awake suddenly and in alarm from its short slumber such be the chief symptom of difficult teething and which will be present to a greater or less degree treatment -- as most of the above symptom be induce by the painful tension of the gum it would seem that the most rational mode of attempt they relief be by freely lance the swollen part great prejudice however still exist in the mind of some parent against this operation they think it give great pain and if the tooth be not very near make its come through the gum subsequently the more difficult with regard to the first objection the lancet be carry through the gum so quickly that this be hardly possible and the fact that the infant will often smile in you face after it be do although previously cry from pain be sufficient evidence that it be not a very painful operation in reference to the second that the scar which ensue oppose by its hardness the subsequent progress of the tooth it be quite groundless for cicatrix like all other new-formed part be much more easily absorb than the original structure of the practical utility and perfect safety of this operation we have ample proof in its daily performance with impunity and in the instant relief which it often afford to all the symptom mere scarify the gum be sometimes all that be require and will afford great relief this operation therefore should not be oppose by the mother she at the same time should be acquaint with its precise object lest the speedy return of the symptom and the non - appearance of the expect tooth might tend to bring the operation of lance the gum into disrepute the parental management of the infant then and by which much of the pain and difficulty of teething may be remove or alleviate consist in attend to the follow direction : -- first to the state of the mouth -- to this it be a important part of the mother 's duty to pay especial attention and by so do she will save she child much suffer the condition of the mouth should be carefully inspect from time to time and should a swollen gum be discover it should immediately be attend to not wait till constitutional symptom appear before she employ proper aid for she child for this purpose the mother should make herself familiar with the appearance of the gum under distention and inflammation a matter of no difficulty accompany as this condition usually be by a profuse secretion of saliva heat of mouth and at a time when the age of the child justify the supposition that it be about to cut its first tooth or if it have some tooth that other be about to appear secondly to the food -- if a child be teethe with difficulty it should always have its quantity of nourishment diminish if it be be feed as well as nurse at the breast at the time the former should be immediately withhold : if it be be feed alone the only kind of food that should be allow be milk and water these case be much aggravate by the not uncommon habit of parent give the infant food whenever it cry from the irritation attend upon the process and thus a slightly difficult dentition be convert into serious disease thirdly to the state of the bowels -- these must be carefully watch that they may not become confine it be necessary that they should be gently relax at this time if a slight diarrhoea be present it must not be check if it pass beyond this however medicine must be have recourse to and great benefit will also arise from put the child into a warm hip-bath and warmly clothing the body but keep the head cool fourthly to the head -- the infant 's head should be wash with cold water night and morning and no other cover than that which nature have provide should be put upon it when within door or asleep and on no occasion should warm feel or velvet hat be worn during mild or warm weather straw or white hat be much lighter and cooler the child should be much in the open air the sponging of the infant 's body daily either with cold or tepid water must depend upon the season of the year and constitution of the child as well as upon other circumstance sponge the head with cold water night and morning be almost invariably atttend with great benefit and may be resort to in every case without fear and now and then the use of the warm hip-bath for several day together will be order by the physician which by act upon the skin diminish the determination of blood to the head and thus form a important source of relief fifthly of convulsion -- if they should occur and they be not unfrequently excite by difficult teething and then give great alarm to the parent relief will be afford by immerse the hip leg and foot of the infant in water as warm as can be bear and at the same time apply over the head and temple a piece of flannel wet with cold water i have also often cut the fit short by sprinkle cold water in the child 's face while in the bath the gum should always be look to and if they appear swollen and painful at once lance i have know the most formidable convulsion to cease immediately after this operation sixthly of the use of opiate -- it be the practice with some nurse to administer narcotic to quiet infant while teethe it be not only objectionable but from the uncertain effect of sedative upon infant a very dangerous practice and they ought never to be give except at the suggestion of a medical man it be far better if the child be restless at night to have it frequently take out of its cot and carry about in a airy room for the cool air and change of posture will do much to allay the feverishness and restlessness of the child from these few hint it must have be see how much the suffering from teethe may be mitigate by judicious management that if the parent be able to support she infant upon the breast alone teethe will be find comparatively a easy process and unattended with danger the mother thus reap a delightful reward for all the anxiety and privation nurse necessarily involve that the child bring up partially or entirely by hand will always pass through dentition with more or less of pain and difficulty but that even here if the diet have be properly regulate much less suffer and inconvenience will arise than when less attention have be pay to it and lastly that when teethe be difficult how highly important it be to call in proper aid at a early period and to carry out fully the direction of the medical attendant allow no foolish prejudice to interfere with he prescription and management if i stand in need of any argument to impress upon the mind of a parent the importance of attend to the last injunction i would simply state that its neglect be but too frequently the cause of disease of the brain terminate in death or a state of idiotcy far worse than death of which i know more than one living instance it may be as well to add that eruption about the ear head face and various part of the body very frequently appear during the process of the first teething -lrb- fn # 23 -rrb- if they be slight they should be leave alone be rather useful than otherwise if they be troublesome they must receive that kind of attention from the parent which will be point out under the chapter on disease the same remark apply to enlargement of the gland of the neck which frequently appear at this time -lrb- fn # 23 -rrb- in some infant a rash always precede the cut a tooth sometimes it appear in the form of hard elevated pimple as large as pea in other instance in the form of red patch of the size of a shilling upon the arm shoulder and back of the neck they be always harmless require no particular attention and prevent i doubt not more serious complaint sect ii hint upon the permanent or adult tooth parent be not sufficiently alive to the importance of attend to the condition of the mouth of they child at the period of change the first for the second set of tooth they do not seem to be aware how much the comfort appearance and future health of the child depend upon it nor do they subsequently impress upon the mind of they child how necessary on they part be the observance of certain rule for the preservation of the tooth and how distressing be the effect which result from they neglect it be propose here to say a few word for the information and guidance of the parent upon this subject the manner in which they appear the change of the temporary for the permanent or adult tooth commence in the majority of instance at about seven year of age occasionally it occur as early as five and as late as eight year and a half the necessity which exist for this change and the mode by which it be effect be striking and beautiful it be however not we object to enter fully upon its consideration here it have already be observe that the infant be bear with the rudiment of two set of tooth in the jaw although neither make they appearance till long after birth the time when and the manner in which the first set appear have be point out now although these admirably answer the purpose for which they be give up to the seventh year after this period they fail to do so : they be not sufficiently numerous -- in they structure they be not strong or durable -- nor be they power of mastication sufficiently great they be not sufficiently large or numerous if the mouth of a child at this age be examine it will be see that a considerable interval have take place between the tooth in consequence of the growth and expansion of the face hence a larger set have become necessary to fill the arch but it may be ask do not the tooth grow with the growth of the body and if not why be it so they do not and for this reason : the important office which these organ be destine to perform require that they should be compose of a substance too dense and of too low a organization to allow of any subsequent growth and enlargement thus the size of the tooth be determine and acquire before they make they appearance through the gum this be the case it will be readily see that the tooth which would be of appropriate size in the mouth of the infant would be quite inadequate to the enlarged dimension of the adult hence the necessity of a second set exceed in number and size the tooth of the first that a necessity also exist at this age that the weak and delicate tooth of childhood should be exchange for a set stronger and more durable in they structure more robust and more powerful will be sufficiently apparent if we only recollect the great change which have gradually be take place in the nature of the food of the two epoch of childhood and adult age the second set or permanent tooth then lie under the milk-teeth and hide in the jaw undergo in this situation they full developement before they appear above the gum this occurrence commence about seven year of age at which period the first set begin to fall out from they root become absorb and no longer retain they hold of the jaw to be entirely replace in the course of a few year by the permanent set which thus succeed they the first tooth of this set which make they appearance be the large double tooth which emerge from the gum immediately behind the last of the temporary set next the two front tooth of the lower jaw fall out and be succeed by two other of similar character and form but of larger size then the two corresponding tooth of the upper row be cast off and they place supply shortly after the tooth immediately adjoining these then the double tooth of the first set be exchange for they smaller successor of the second the eye-tooth after a time begin to make they appearance and then more double tooth make in all twenty-eight tooth and occupy in they developement from the seventh to the fourteenth year of age they be not however yet complete for between the latter date and the twenty-first year four more tooth appear call the wisdom tooth make the adult set or permanent tooth to amount in all to thirty-two tooth it should be observe that whilst this be the most usual course in which this set appear the line of succession be sometimes different they value and importance it would seem almost unnecessary to say a word upon so self-evident a truth and yet perhaps the full extent of this statement be not generally appreciate it have not perhaps occur to the mind of all that upon the right position and arrangement of the tooth the beauty and expression of the countenance much depend but so it be for however regular and perfect the general feature if the tooth be irregular or deficient a unpleasing expression proportionate to the extent of the displacement be inevitably produce now every mother should be alive to this fact that she may early apply to the dentist to have any error of the above nature rectify before it be too late on they complete and entire state also depend the perfection of utterance and articulation the child for instance make no attempt at articulation until it have acquire several tooth this faculty become also exceedingly imperfect during the process of change they from this time it continue to improve until again it be permanently impaired in old age when they be finally lose and so again if a child lose merely a single tooth from the front of its mouth lisping will result or if a supernumerary or irregular tooth be present the articulation will be abrupt and imperfect : -- the former plainly show the importance of the entireness of the series and the latter the necessity of regularity in they arrangement and position the tooth however be chiefly important in relation to the part they sustain in connection with digestion viz the mastication of the food by this act the food after be receive into the mouth be mix with the saliva and break down till it become of a uniform pulpy consistence fit for be easily swallow and act upon by the gastric juice on its arrival in the stomach that due mastication of the food be essential to healthy digestion which will be promote or retard in exact proportion as it approach or fall short of this point be a fact so generally know as scarcely to need comment suffice it to add that if food be introduce into the stomach unmasticate the gastric juice will only act upon its surface and after a number of hour it will be either reject by vomit or pass on into the intestine to give rise to cholic bowel complaint or flatulence and very frequently in child to a serious attack of convulsion they management and preservation irregularity of arrangement and position -- every parent ought to have the mouth of she child inspect occasionally during the advance of the permanent tooth that any irregularity in they position or arrangement may be prevent and it be equally she duty to see to it that she choose a competent person to do this since great mistake be not unfrequently make in this matter and which themselves become the source of evil far more serious than those they be intend to obviate i have know say mr bell no less than eight or even ten firm tooth forcibly remove from the jaw of a child at once when there be not the slightest reason to apprehend any evil result from they be leave alone here there be a most cruel because unnecessary infliction of pain as well as great hazard incur of seriously injure the permanent tooth by interfere with the secretion of they enamel and besides all this there be another and yet greater evil for if the temporary tooth be remove before the permanent one be so advanced as to be ready to occupy they situation the arch of the jaw will assuredly contract and when subsequently the permanent tooth be fully form there will not be room for they to range in they proper situation thus the operation which be intend to prevent irregularity become the cause of its occurrence and that in its very worst form produce a want of accordance between the size of the tooth and that of the jaw the eye-teeth generally occasion most anxiety to a parent from the prominent position in which they present themselves but in the majority of case nothing but time be require to reduce they to they proper station but whatever may be the peculiarity of each individual case the dentist will decide what may be require only i would again repeat do not neglect the occasional inspection of the mouth at this age if you regard the future comfort and appearance of you child they preservation -- the preservation of the tooth require attention to several point the first and principal of which be to enforce the habit in the child of thoroughly clean the tooth by means of water and a brush night and morning and rinse out the mouth after each meal the brush should not be very hard as it will not only be more difficult to clean the interstice between the tooth the part in which the tartar -lrb- fn # 24 -rrb- be most likely to be deposit but by its friction will occasion the gradual absorption of the gum and the exposure of the neck of the tooth the hair of the brush should be firm and elastic and not too closely set -lrb- fn # 24 -rrb- a sort of calcareous substance which become deposit at the root of the tooth from a want of proper attention to cleanliness and if allow to remain will destroy first they beauty and then the organ itself tartar -- if there be a tendency to the formation of tartar then it will be necessary to have recourse to some tooth-powder tooth-powder however must be choose with care as many of they be compose of substance highly injurious to the tooth many of the tooth-powder which be offer for sale with the promise of render the tooth beautifully white perform for a time all that be promise at the expense of permanent and irremediable injury to the tooth for they often contain a quantity of tartaric or other acid which effect a gradual decomposition of the enamel -lrb- fn # 25 -rrb- prepared chalk be one of the simplest and best tooth-powder -lrb- fn # 25 -rrb- bell on the tooth the following form also may be use with advantage : -- prepared chalk three ounce orri root powdered half a ounce powdered myrrh half a ounce cuttle fish powdered one ounce essential oil of cinnamon four drop -- mix the best preservative then against the formation of tartar be to see that the child clean he tooth thoroughly night and morning with the brush powder and water and also -lrb- if possible -rrb- that he rinse out the mouth after each meal if the gum should be tender irritable and bleed -lrb- as be frequently the case when a individual get out of health or the tartar accumulate -rrb- the mouth may be wash night and morning with a tumbler of tepid water contain from ten to twenty drop of the tincture of myrrh and the same quantity of spirit of camphor or the following form may be use : -- alum one drachm and a half tincture of myrrh two drachm camphor mixture five ounce and a half -- mix acid -- the use of acid to the tooth can not be too strongly deprecate : they decompose they substance and lead to they rapid decay hence the whiteness produce by acid tooth-powder and wash be not less deceitful than ruinous in its consequence as have be just observe they perform all that they vendor promise cause the tooth for a little while to become very white and beautiful in they appearance but at the same time injure they irremediably : the enamel become gradually decompose the bone of the tooth expose and its death be the inevitable consequence it be therefore of great importance when acid medicine be order for child that they should be take through a glass tube to prevent they come in contact with the tooth from a want of this precaution i know a lady -lrb- and there be many such instance -rrb- who once have as sound and fine a set of tooth as any one could boast of but from this cause have have nearly the whole of the upper row destroy she be in delicate health : it be judge requisite that she should take for a considerable time -lrb- with other medicine -rrb- sulphuric acid but the glass tube be not think of and the consequence follow which have be describe calomel -- this medicine as it be frequently give alone or in the little white powder in infancy and childhood by mother and nurse be productive of serious and indeed irremediable injury to the tooth the immoderate use of mercury in early infancy produce more perhaps than any other similar cause that universal tendency to decay which in many instance destroy almost every tooth at a early age it be certainly not unimportant to bear this fact in mind in the administration of this sovereign remedy this panacea as many appear to consider it in infantile disease -lrb- fn # 26 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 26 -rrb- bell on the tooth heat and cold -- the tooth be exceedingly apt to suffer from sudden variation of temperature fluid therefore should never be take into the mouth so hot or so cold as to produce the slightest pain and for the same reason the water with which the mouth be cleansed should in winter be always warm or tepid when ice be take the precaution of place they in the center of the mouth so as to prevent contact with the tooth should be carefully observe there be many other cause which might be mention as tend to induce decay of the tooth but they consideration here be purposely avoid it be hope that enough have be say to draw the parent 's attention to the subject of the tooth to prevent they neglect and yet at the same time to induce a cautious management chap iv hint for the early detection of disease in the child by the mother life be soon extinguish in infancy at this epoch any disease be formidable and must be meet most promptly it be either sudden and active in its assault or come with slow and insidious approach the first sign of its come on be not always visible to a unpractised eye : it may have make dangerous advance before the mother 's mind be awaken to its presence and medical aid may be solicit when remedy and advice be no longer of any avail it be therefore highly important that a mother should possess such information as will enable she to detect disease at its first appearance and thus insure for she child timely medical assistance this knowledge it will not be difficult for she to obtain she have only to bear in mind what be the indication which constitute health and she will at once see that all deviation from it must denote the presence of disorder if not of actual disease with these change she must to a certain extent make herself acquaint sect i -- sign of health the sign of health be to be find first in the healthy performance of the various function of the body the regular demand make for its supply neither in excess or deficiency and a similar regularity in its excretion both in quantity and appearance if the figure of the healthy infant be observe something may be learn from this there will be perceive such a universal roundness in all part of the child 's body that there be no such thing as a angle to be find in the whole figure whether the limb be bent or straight every line form a portion of a circle the limb will feel firm and solid and unless they be bent the joint can not be discover the tongue even in health be always white but it will be free from sore -- the skin cool -- the eye bright -- the complexion clear -- the head cool -- and the abdomen not project too far -- the breathing regular and without effort when awake the infant will be cheerful and sprightly and loving to be play with will often break out into its merry happy laugh whilst on the other hand when asleep it will appear calm every feature compose its countenance display a expression of happiness and frequently perhaps light up with a smile sect ii sign of disease just in proportion as the above appearance be present and entire health may be say to exist and just in proportion to they partial or total absence disease will have usurp its place we will however for the sake of clearness examine the sign of disease as they be manifest separately by the countenance -- the gesture -- in sleep -- in the stool -- and by the breathing and cough of the countenance in health the countenance of a thild be expressive of serenity in mind and body but if the child be unwell this expression will be change and in a manner which to a certain extent will indicate what part of the system be at fault the brow will be contract if there be pain and its seat be in the head this be frequently the very first outward sign of any thing be wrong and will occur at the very onset of disease if therefore remark at a early period and proper remedy use its notice may prevent one of the most fearful of infantile complaint -- water in the head if this sign be pass by unheeded and the above disease be threaten soon the eye will become fixed and stare -- the head hot and move uneasily from side to side upon the pillow or lie heavily upon the nurse 's arm -- the child will start in its sleep grind its tooth and awake alarmed and scream -- its face will be flush particularly the cheek -lrb- as if rouge -rrb- -- its hand hot -- but foot cold its bowels obstinately costive or its motion scanty dark-coloured and foul if the lip be draw apart so as to show the tooth or gum the seat of the pain be in the belly this sign however will only be present during the actual existence of suffer if therefore there be any doubt whether it exist press upon the stomach and watch the eifect on the expression of the countenance if the pain arise simply from irritation of the bowels excite from indigestion it will be temporary and the sign will go and come just as the spasm may occur and slight remedial measure will give relief if however the disease be more serious and inflammation ensue this sign will be more constantly present and soon the countenance will become pale or sallow and sunken -- the child will dread motion and lie upon its back with the knee bent up to the belly -- the tongue will be load -- and in breathing while the chest will be see to heave with more than usual effort the muscle of the belly will remain perfectly quiescent if the nostril be draw upward and in quick motion pain exist in the chest this sign however will generally be the accompaniment of inflammation of the chest in which case the countenance will be discolor -- the eye more or less stare and the breathing will be difficult and hurry and if the child 's mode of respire be watch the chest will be observe to be unmoved while the belly quickly heave with every inspiration convulsion be generally precede by some change in the countenance the upper lip will be draw up and be occasionally bluish or livid then there may be slight squint or a singular rotation of the eye upon its own axis alternate flushing or paleness of the face and sudden animation follow by languor these sign will sometimes manifest themselves many hour nay day before the attack occur may be look upon as premonitory and if timely noticed and suitable medical aid resort to the occurrence of a fit may be altogether prevent the state of the eye should always be attend to in health they be clear and bright but in disease they become dull and give a heavy appearance to the countenance though after long continue irritation they will assume a degree of quickness which be very remarkable and a sort of pearly brightness which be better know from observation than it can be from description the direction of the eye too should be regard for from this we may learn something when the infant be first bring to the light both eye be scarcely ever direct to the same object : this occur without any tendency to disease and merely prove that regard one object with both eye be only a acquire habit but when the child have come to that age when the eye be by habit direct to the same object and afterwards it lose that power this circumstance alone may be look upon as a frequent prelude to disease affect the head of the gesture the gesture of a healthy child be all easy and natural but in sickness those deviation occur which alone will often denote the nature of the disease suppose a infant to have acquire the power to support itself to hold its head erect let sickness come its head will droop immediately and this power will be lose only to be regain with the return of health and during the interval every posture and movement will be that of languor the little one that have just teach itself to run alone from chair to chair have two or three tooth press upon and irritate the gum will for a time be completely take off its foot and perhaps lie languidly in its cot or on its nurse 's arm the leg be draw up to the belly and accompany by cry be proof of disorder and pain in the bowels press upon this part and you pressure will increase the pain look to the secretion from the bowels themselves and by they unhealthy character you suspicion in reference to the seat of the disorder be at once confirm the hand of a child in health be rarely carry above its mouth but let there be any thing wrong about the head and pain present and the little one 's hand will be constantly raise to the head and face sudden start when awake as also during sleep though it occur from trifling cause should never be disregard it be frequently connect with approach disorder of the brain it may forebode a convulsive fit and such suspicion be confirm if you find the thumb of the child draw in and firmly press upon the palm with the finger so compress upon it that the hand can not be force open without difficulty the same condition will exist in the toe but not to so great a degree there may also be a puffy state of the back of the hand and foot and both foot and wrist bent downward there be other and milder sign threaten convulsion and connect with gesture which should be regard : -- the head be draw rigidly backwards -- a arm fix firmly to the side or near to it -- as also one of the leg draw stifly upward these sign as also those enumerate above be confirm beyond all doubt if there be present certain alteration in the usual habit of the child : -- if the sleep be disturb -- if there be frequent fit of cry -- great peevishness of temper -- the countenance alternately flush and pale -- sudden animation follow by as sudden a fit of languor -- catching of the breath follow by a long and deep inspiration -- all so many premonitory symptom of a approach attack of the sleep the sleep of the infant in health be quiet compose and refreshing in very early infancy when not at the breast it be for the most part asleep in its cot and although as the month advance it sleep less yet when the hour for repose arrive the child be no sooner lay down to rest than it drop off into a quiet peaceful slumber not so if ill frequently it will be unwilling to be put into its cot at all and the nurse will be oblige to take the infant in she arm it will then sleep but for a short time and in a restless and disturbed manner if it suffer pain however slight the countenance will indicate it and as when awake so now if there be any thing wrong about the head the contraction of the eye-brow and grind of the tooth will appear if any thing wrong about the belly the lip will be draw apart show the tooth or gum -- and in both instance there will be great restlessness and frequent starting of the stool in the new-born infant the motion be dark color very much like pitch both in consistence and appearance the first milk however secrete in the mother 's breast act as a aperient upon the infant 's bowels and thus in about four-and-twenty hour it be cleanse away or if it should not a tea-spoonful of castor oil accomplish this purpose from this time and through the whole of infancy the stool will be of a lightish yellow color the consistence of thin mustard have little smell smooth in appearance and therefore free from lump or white curded matter and pass without pain or any considerable quantity of wind and as long as the child be in health it will have daily two or three or even four of these evacuation but as it grow older they will not be quite so frequent they will become darker in color and more solid though not so much so as in the adult any deviation then from the above character be of course a sign of something wrong and as a deranged condition of the bowels be frequently the first indication we have of come disease the nurse should daily be direct to watch the evacuation they appearance color and the manner in which discharge be the point principally to be look to if the stool have a very curdy appearance or be too liquid or green or dark-coloured or smell badly they be unnatural and in reference to the manner in which they be discharge it should be bear in mind that in a healthy child the motion be pass with but little wind and as if squeeze out but in disease it will be throw out with considerable force which be a sign of great irritation the number too of stool pass within the four-and - twenty hour it be important to note so that if the child do not have its accustomed relief -lrb- and it must not be forget that child although in perfect health differ as to the precise number -rrb- a little castor oil may be at once exhibit and thus mischief be prevent this however be not the place to discuss the question of disorder bowels but simply to point out how this circumstance may be know -lrb- fn # 27 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 27 -rrb- see section on disorder of the stomach and bowels p 208 of the breathing and cough the breathing of a child in health be form of equal inspiration and expiration and it breathe quietly regularly inaudibly and without effort but let inflammation of the air-tube or lung take place and the inspiration will become in a few hour so quicken and hurry and perhaps audible that the attention have only to be direct to the circumstance to be at once perceive now all change which occur in the breathing from its healthy standard however slight the shades of difference may be it be most important should be notice early for many of the complaint in the chest although very formidable in they character if only see early by the medical man may be arrest in they progress but otherwise may be beyond the control of art a parent therefore should make herself familiar with the breathing of she child in health and she will readily mark any change which may arise of cough i should not have say any thing in this chapter as it can never fail to be notice except that it be highly necessary to throw out one caution whenever a child have the symptom of a common cold attend by hoarseness and a rough cough always look upon it with suspicion and never neglect seek a medical opinion hoarseness do not usually attend a common cold in the child and these symptom may be premonitory of a attack of croup a disease excessively rapid in its progress and which from the importance of the part affect carry on as they do a function indispensably necessary to life require the most prompt and decide treatment the follow observation of dr cheyne be so strikingly illustrative and so pertinent to my present purpose that i can not refrain insert they : -- in the approach of a attack of croup which almost always take place in the evening probably of a day during which the child have be expose to the weather and often after catarrhal symptom have exist for several day he may be observe to be excite in variable spirit more ready than usual to laugh than to cry a little flushed occasionally cough the sound of the cough be rough like that which attend the catarrhal stage of the measles more generally however the patient have be for some time in bed and asleep before the nature of the disease with which he be threaten be apparent then perhaps without wake he give a very unusual cough well know to any one who have witness a attack of the croup it ring as if the child have cough through a brazen trumpet it be truly a tussis clangosa it penetrate the wall and floor of the apartment and startle the experienced mother -- ` oh i be afraid we child be take the croup ' she run to the nursery find she child sleep softly and hope she may be mistaken but remain to tend he before long the ring cough a single cough be repeat again and again the patient be rouse and then a new symptom be remark the sound of he voice be change puling and as if the throat be swell it correspond with the cough etc how important that a mother should be acquaint with the above sign of one of the most terrific complaint to which childhood be subject for if she only send for medical assistance during its first stage the treatment will be almost invariably successful whereas if this golden opportunity be lose this disease will seldom yield to the influence of measure however wisely choose or perseveringly employ sect iii -- other circumstance which will assist in the early detection of disease 1 the influence of the season in produce particular form of disorder -- the recollection of the fact that at the different season of the year some disease be more prevalent than at other period will greatly aid a judicious parent in the early detection of the presence of disorder and its kind in she child thus in the early part of the winter what be call catarrh viz a increase secretion of mucus from the membrane of the nose fauce and air-tube with fever and attend with sneezing and cough thirst lassitude and want of appetite be generally prevalent as the winter advance the air-tube of the lung and the lung themselves be liable to become the seat of disorder and those sign will present themselves which have be point out in the previous section as characteristic of such attack in the spring we have still the same disease prevalent and in addition measles scarlet fever small-pox and chicken pox which increase in liability towards the close of this season and with the first week of summer in the summer disease be less prevalent than at any other period of the year but towards its middle and close and through the whole of the autumnal month bowel complaint may be expect in the form of diarrhoea cholera and dysentery 2 the influence of a hereditary predisposition to certain disease -- without enter into this subject at large still it may be useful to remark that in some family there be a predisposition to some disease which occur in the first child will as each succeed child be bear attack at the same age amongst other disease of this class be croup hooping-cough and water in the head this observation should not only lead a mother to be alive to the possibility of the successional occurrence of these disease in she family and so early note they appearance and seek medical advice but should at the same time make she most anxious on the one hand to shield she child from all they exciting cause and on the other to adopt those measure which may contribute indirectly to overcome the constitutional predisposition to they of the scrofulous constitution i will merely mention here that it be of the greatest importance where a predisposition to this disease exist in a family that a mother should immediately attend to any alteration in the gait or contour of she child and give prompt attention also to any complaint make of swell about a joint although it may be unattended with pain the importance of this remark will be see by contrast the result of the follow case which occur in child of the same family case i a b a female child have blue eye light hair and a fair complexion in the early part of the year 1838 be then two year of age have a enlargement of the left knee joint for some week previous to this time there have be a degree of heat about the part but as no pain apparently exist it be not regard as of any consequence and nothing be do the child living in the neighborhood of london be afterwards place under medical treatment two or three month have elapse it be bring to town and show to I in consequence of a slight tumefaction over the lower part of the spine this soon disappear under the measure employ and eventually the disease of the knee -lrb- evidently scrofulous -rrb- be arrest so that now the case promise to be cure but the joint will for ever be stiff and the limb thus affect shorter than the other case ii g b the brother of the above a handsome boy with light hair fine blue eye -- indeed very much like he little sister -- in the year 1836 have enlargement of the gland in he neck which be relieve by the treatment resort to in April 1839 be then eight year old he be observe by he mother to limp slightly in walk but complain of little or no pain from the caution however which have be give to the parent at the time i be consult about the previous case to notice at a early period any symptom of this nature in she child the fact be immediately attend to the affection be evidently in the hip there be imperfection in the gait and pain upon press over the joint a blister be apply perfect rest to the limb enjoin and steel medicine order and in a fortnight the motion of the joint be restrain more effectually by the application of strip of soap plaster and a bandage in three month the child be order to the sea - side and eventually be able to walk without the slightest limp or pain and may be say to be quite well i would not say that in the first case if the disease have be discover early and at that time meet by judicious medical treatment a stiff knee and shorten limb would have be prevent although this be my belief but in reference to the latter case i have no hesitation in say that without the disease have be early detect by the mother and as promptly attend to by she the remedial measure might have fail -- certainly the result would not have be so highly satisfactory as it be chap v on what constitute the maternal management of the disease of child the especial province of the mother be the prevention of disease not its cure to the establishment and carry out of this principle every word contain in the precede page have directly or indirectly tend this however be not all when disease attack the child the mother have then a part to perform which it be especially important during the epoch of infancy and childhood should be do well i refer to those duty which constitute the maternal part of the management of disease medical treatment for its successful issue be greatly dependent upon a careful pains-taking and judicious maternal superintendence no medical treatment can avail at any time if direction be only partially carry out or be negligently attend to and will most assuredly fail altogether if counteract by the erroneous prejudice of ignorant attendant but to the affection of infancy and childhood this remark apply with great force since at this period disease be generally so sudden in its assault and rapid in its progress that unless the measure prescribe be rigidly and promptly administer they exhibition be soon render altogether fruitless the amount of suffer too may be greatly lessen by the thoughtful and discerning attention of the mother the want and necessity of the young child must be anticipate the fretfulness produce by disease soothe by kind and affectionate persuasion and the possibility of the sick and sensitive child be expose to harsh and ungentle conduct carefully provide against again not only be a firm and strict compliance with medical direction in the administration of remedy of regimen and general measure necessary but a unbiased faithful and full report of symptom to the physician when he visit he little patient be of the first importance a ignorant servant or nurse unless great caution be exercise by the medical attendant may by a unintentional but erroneous report of symptom produce a very wrong impression upon he mind as to the actual state of the disease he judgment may as a consequence be bias in a wrong direction and the result prove seriously injurious to the welldoing of the patient the medical man can not sit hour after hour watch symptom hence the great importance of they be faithfully report this can alone be do by the mother or some person equally competent there be other weighty consideration which might be adduce here prove how much depend upon efficient maternal management in the time of sickness but they will be severally dwell upon when the disease with which they be more particularly connect be speak of sect 1 -- accident and disease which may occur to the infant at birth or soon after still-born sometimes the child come into the world apparently dead and unless the most active exertion be make by the attendant be lose the superintendence of the means use devolve upon the medical man but it would be often well if he assistant be already acquaint with the measure pursue under these circumstance for they would be more likely to be carry into effect with promptitude and success than they now frequently be and again the still-born child be frequently in this state from have be bear very rapidly and before the medical man can have arrive it will be more especially useful in such a case that the attendant in the lying-in-room should know how to proceed the various cause produce this condition it be unnecessary to mention the condition itself may exist in a greater or less degree : the infant may be completely stillborn with no indication of life except perhaps the pulsation of the cord or a feeble action of the heart -- or it may make ineffectual effort at breathing or even cry faintly and yet subsequently perish for want of strength to establish perfectly the process of respiration under all these circumstance a good deal can often be effect by art in every instance therefore in which we have not positive evidence of the child be dead in the existence of putrefaction or of such malformation as be incompatible with life it be we duty to give a fair trial to the means for restore suspend animation and as long as the slightest attempt at motion of the respiratory organ be evince or the least pulsation of the heart continue we have good grounds for persevere and hope for ultimate success the measure to be employ to restore a still-born child will be a little modify by the circumstance present if there be no pulsation -- no beating in the cord when the child come into the world it may at once be separate from the mother this be to be effect by first tie the navel-string with common sewing thread -lrb- three or four time double -rrb- about two inch from the body of the child and again two inch from the former ligature and then divide the cord with a pair of scissors between the two and now the means for its restoration be to be make use of which be detail below viz inflation of the lung and perhaps the warm bath if with the above circumstance the child 's face be livid and swollen some drop of blood should previously be allow to escape before the ligature be apply to that part of the navel-string which be now only attach to the child if there be pulsation in the cord but respiration be not fully establish it must not be divide and as long as pulsation continue and the child do not breathe perfectly and regularly no ligature should be apply the first thing to be do here be to pass the finger cover with the fold of a handkerchief or soft napkin to the back of the child 's mouth to remove any mucus which might obstruct the passage of air into the lung and at the same time to tickle those part and thereby excite respiratory movement the chest should then be rub by the hand and a gentle shock give to the body by slapping the back if these means fail the chest and sole of the foot must next be rub with spirit the nostril and back of the throat irritated with a feather previously dip in spirit of wine and ammonia or hartshorn may be hold to the nose inflation of the lung -- these means not have be successful and the pulsation in the cord have cease the infant must be separate and inflation of the lung resort to this be to be effect gently and cautiously as follow : -- the child wrap in flannel be to be lay on its back upon a table place near the fire its head be to be slightly extend and the nostril hold between the finger and thumb of one hand whilst with the finger of the other slight pressure be to be make upon the pit of the stomach so as to prevent the air from pass into that organ the lung of the child be now to be fill with air by the operator apply he own lip -- with a fold of silk or muslin intervene for the sake of cleanliness -- to those of the child and then simply blow in its mouth he be to propel the air from he own chest into that of the infant previously however to he do this he should make several deep and rapid inspiration and finally a full inspiration in order to obtain greater purity of air in he own lung when the chest of the child have be thus distend it be to be compress gently with the hand so as to empty the lung and then the inflation with the alternately compress the chest must be repeat again and again until either the commencement of natural respiration be announce by a sneeze or deep sigh or until after long-continued steady persevere but unavail effort to effect this object shall have remove all ground of hope for a successful issue whilst these effort be be make some other individual must endeavor to maintain or restore the warmth of the infant 's body by gently but constantly press and rub its limb between he warm hand and after respiration be establish the face must still be freely expose to the air whilst the warmth of the limb and body be carefully sustain it will sometimes happen -- and to this circumstance the operator should be fully alive -- that when the child begin to manifest symptom of return animation its tongue will be draw backwards and upwards against the roof of the mouth fill up the passage to the throat and prevent further inflation of the lung this be to be remedy by the introduction of the fore-finger to the upper and back part of the child 's tongue and gently press it downward and forwards by which the difficulty will be remove and the air again pass the warm bath -- more reliance may be place upon the above measure to restore animation than upon the warm bath still this be sometimes useful and therefore must not be neglect whilst inflation be go on the bath may be get ready then resort to and if unsuccessful inflation may and ought again to be follow up -lrb- fn # 28 -rrb- if the bath be useful at all it will be so immediately upon put the infant into it respiration will be excite follow by a cry and if this do not occur at once it would be wrong to keep the child longer in the bath as it would be only lose valuable time which ought to be devote to other effort the temperature of the bath should be about 100 degree and if upon plunge the infant into it it fortunately excite the respiratory effort it should then be take out rub with dry but hot flannel and when breathing be fully establish lay in a warm bed or what be still better in its mother 's bosom let it however have plenty of air -lrb- fn # 28 -rrb- we should not relinquish we endeavor at resuscitation under two or three hour or even longer and if ultimately successful the state of the infant should be carefully watch for two or three day injury receive during birth if a labor be long and tedious the head and body of the child may be bruise and disfigure the shape of the head be frequently alter by the compression it have undergo so that it may be elongate and measure from the chin to the back of the head as much as six or seven inch this always excite surprise sometimes apprehension in the mind of the attendant : there be no ground for it it must be allow to regain its natural shape without interference tumor or swelling upon the head be very common they arise from pressure upon the part during the labor the only treatment that be require or safe be freedom from all pressure and the application of cold lotion compose of brandy or vinegar and water the swell will gradually subside it will be right to direct the attention of the medical man to this circumstance the face may be frightfully disfigure from the above cause exceedingly black and the feature distorted nothing be necessary here in a few day the face will recover its proper appearance retention of urine occasionally a infant will not pass any urine for many hour after its birth this most frequently arise from the fact of none be secrete in the last case of this kind that i be call to three day have elapse since birth and no urine have be pass it prove that none have be secrete sometimes however it be the effect of another cause which the use of the warm bath will be find to remove which should always therefore be employ four and twenty hour after the birth of the infant if it have not by that time pass any water it now and then happen but fortunately very rarely that some physical obstruction exist it be always important therefore for the nurse to pay attention to the above point and it be she duty to direct the attention of the medical man to the subject if anything unusual or unnatural be present the same observation apply to the bowel also and if twelve hour pass without any motion the part should be examine swell of the breast at birth or two or three day subsequently the breast of the infant will frequently be find swollen hard and painful contain a fluid much resemble milk nurse generally endeavor to squeeze this out and thus do great mischief for by this mean inflammation be excite in the part and sometimes abscess be the result if the breast be simply slightly enlarged it be unnecessary to do any thing more than rub they occasionally and very gently with warm almond oil and a little time will restore they to they proper size if however they be inflamed hot painful with a red surface and unusually large a bread and water poultice must be apply every three or four hour which will generally prevent either the formation of matter or any other unpleasant consequence in a few day under this treatment they will usually subside and be quite well inflammation of the eye its importance -- about the second or third day after the child 's birth a inflammation sometimes attack the eye which be of considerable consequence the more so from its commence in a way not calculate to excite the attention or alarm the fear of the mother or nurse the child can not express its sensation and the swell of the eye conceal the progress of the disease so that serious mischief be frequently do before the medical man see the patient in the first place the inflammation be not immediately notice and in the second the measure employ be frequently insufficient to check its progress : hence it cause more blindness -lrb- i refer to the lower class of society more particularly -rrb- than any other inflammatory disorder that happen to the eye and the number of child be very considerable whose sight be partially or completely destroy by it the parent or nurse be apt to suppose when this inflammation first appear that it be merely a cold in the eye which will go off and the consequence which i have just mention take place in many case before they be aware of the danger and before the medical man be resort to for assistance i only desire in mention this complaint to inform the attendant of the lying-in-room of its great importance that it may not be trifle with that upon its first approach the physician may be inform of it and that the treatment he direct for its cure may be sedulously and rigidly follow symptom -- the inflammation commonly come on about three day after birth but it may take place at a later period it may be know by its commence thus : -- when the child wake from sleep the eyelid will be observe to stick together a little they edge will be redder than natural and especially at the corner the child experience pain from the access of light and therefore shut the eye against it a little white matter will also be observe lie on the inside of the lower lid after a short time the lid swell become red on they external surface and a large quantity of matter be secrete and constantly pour from the eye the quantity of discharge increase until it become very great but enough have be say to point out the importance of the disease and the sign by which it may be recognize at its first approach treatment -- keep the eye free from discharge by the constant removal of the matter secrete be what the medical attendant will chiefly insist upon and without this be do any treatment he may adopt will be useless with it there be no doubt of a successful issue of the case provide he attention have only be call to it at a sufficiently early period hare-lip this be a blemish too well know to require a formal description the question most interesting to a mother in relation to it be -- how be she child to be nourish that be bear with it and when ought a operation to be perform for its removal the mode of feed the infant -- if the defect be but trifle the infant will be able to suck provide the mother 's nipple be large and the milk flow freely from it if this be not the case the difficulty may be obviate by use the cork nipple shield -lrb- fn # 29 -rrb- i have know this to answer the purpose admirably when the mother have previously despair of nurse she infant the nipple be too small for it to grasp -lrb- fn # 29 -rrb- see p 41 if however the defect exist in a still greater degree feeding by means of the spoon must be resort to the greatest care be necessary as to the quantity quality and preparation of the food -lrb- fn # 30 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 30 -rrb- see artificial feeding p 34 caution in reference to the operation -- with regard to the operation for the removal of this deformity i would strongly warn parent against desire its too early performance various consideration contribute to make the distressed parent anxious for this but very seldom indeed -- except the deformity be very great and implicate other part beside the lip -- will the operation be require or ought it to be resort to before the second year and a half of the infant 's life and for this very cogent reason exist for instance convulsion may thus be induce which often terminate fatally the most proper age for remove this deformity by operation be from that of two year and a half to four year bleed from the navel-string bleeding from the navel-string will sometime take place hour after it have be suppose to be carefully secure this will arise either from the cord be carelessly tie or from its be unusually large at birth and in a few hour shrink so much that the ligature no longer sufficiently press on the vessel in either case it be of importance that the attendant in the lying-in-room should understand how to manage this accident when it occur that it may not prove injurious or fatal to the child the mode of arrest the bleeding -- the clothes of the child and the flannel roller must be take off -- the whole cord without delay must be unwrapped and then a second ligature be apply below the original one -lrb- viz nearer to the body of the infant -rrb- take great care that it shall not cut through the cord when draw very tight but at the same time draw it sufficiently tight to compress the vessel the ligature should be compose of fine linen thread three or four thickness and not of tape or bobbin or any substance of this nature as it can not be rely on for this purpose ulceration or imperfect healing of the navel the cord separate from the navel generally some time between the fifth and fifteenth day from delivery and the part usually heal without give the slightest trouble this however be not always the case for sometimes a thin discharge will take place which if the part be examine will be find to proceed from a small growth about the size perhaps of a pea or even less this must be remove by apply a little powdered alum -- or if this fail it should be once or twice slightly touch with blue-stone and afterwards dress with calamine cerate at other time though fortunately very rarely excoriation of the navel and the part around take place which quickly spread and assume a angry and threatening character if however the attention of the medical man be call to it early it will always do well : until he direction be give apply a nicely make bread and water poultice bleeding from the navel sometimes a day or two after the cord separate or at the time of separation bleeding take place from the navel : fortunately this very seldom occur indeed it be very rarely meet with and i only mention it to observe that upon its occurrence the point of the finger should be place over the part and pressure steadily apply until medical assistance be obtain now and then in these case a growth sprout up and bleed let this be touch with lunar caustic or any other astringent application or let pressure be employ still it will bleed -- not freely or in a stream but there will be a constant drain from the part and the infant as a consequence will waste and be bring to death 's door excise it it will only make matter worse the treatment in this case consist in simply wind a piece of very narrow tape round the growth and then leave it untouch the bleeding will soon cease the fungus will sprout over the upper margin of the tape in a very short time it will as it be strangle the disease which subsequently fall off a complete cure be accomplish jaundice it frequently happen during the first or second week after birth that the skin of the child become very yellow and it have all the appearance of have the jaundice this give rise to great distress to the parent when she perceive it and she become very anxious for the medical man 's next visit now ordinarily it be of no consequence commonly disappear spontaneously and require no medical treatment if however it do not go off in two or three day a tea-spoonful of castor oil should be give once or oftener if necessary it be of course possible for a attack of real jaundice to occur at this early period and a disease of a very serious nature will then have to be deal with but except as a consequence of malformation -lrb- a very infrequent occurrence -rrb- it be not likely to arise and therefore jaundice during the first and second week after delivery need not create alarm tongue-tied from what it arise -- this arise from the bridle under the tongue be so short or its attachment to the tongue extend so near the tip as to interfere with the motion of the organ in sucking and in after year in speak it be a rare occurrence although nothing be more common than for medical man to have infant bring to they suppose to be labor under the above defect how its existence may be determine -- the best guide for a parent to determine whether it exist or not be for she to watch whether the infant can protrude the tip of the tongue beyond the lip : if so it will be able to suck a good nipple readily and nothing need or ought to be do no mother will unnecessarily expose she infant to a operation which unless very carefully perform be not altogether unattended with danger and if she suspect any defect of this kind to exist she have only to observe the circumstance mention above to satisfy she mind upon the subject mole and mark on the skin etc the suppose influence of the imagination of the mother in the production of the above appearance in the texture of the skin of she infant have be fully discuss in the author 's work hint to mother etc this part of the subject be however foreign to the present inquiry which chiefly have reference to the probable effect of they presence upon the health of the child they may be divide into two class : the brownish mole and claret - stain and small but somewhat elevated tumor either of a dark blue livid color or of a bright vermilion hue mole and stain -- they be of no importance as far as the health of the infant be concern if situate in the face however they frequently cause great disfigurement as the claret-stain which may be see sometimes to occupy nearly half the face but they happily do not increase in size remain stationary through life and as any operation that might be propose for they removal would only cause a equal if not greater deformity they ought to be leave alone color spot or tumor -- these vary in they number size and situation the same child be sometimes bear with many of they they may be as small as a pea or as large as a crown piece they be not only find on the skin but on the lip in the mouth etc etc these also sometimes remain stationary in they size have no tendency to enlarge unless indeed they be subject to friction or pressure but as they frequently require surgical aid in which case the earlier the application of remedial measure the less severe in they kind and the greater the probability of a speedy and successful result -- so be it always important for the mother early to obtain a medical opinion that the measure of interference or non-interference may be decide sect ii disorder of the stomach and bowels of the infant indigestion flatulence vomit gripe and looseness disorder of the stomach and bowels be one of the most fruitful source of the disease of infancy only prevent they derangement and all thing be equal the infant will be healthy and flourish and need not the aid of physic or physician experience daily prove that a large proportion of the child who die in infancy be lose from derangement of these organ as the primary cause there be many cause which may give rise to these affection many of they appertain to the mother 's system some to that of the infant all be capable to a great extent of be prevent or remedy it be therefore most important that a mother should not be ignorant or misinformed upon this subject it be the prevention of these affection however that will be principally dwell upon in this chapter for let the mother ever bear in mind and act upon the principle that the prevention of disease alone belong to she the cure to the physician for the sake of clearness and reference these disorder will be speak of as they occur : -- to the infant at the breast at the period of wean and to the infant bring up by hand 1 to the infant at the breast unhealthy milk -- the infant 's stomach and bowels may become deranged from the breast-milk become unwholesome this may arise from the parent get out of health a circumstance which will be so manifest to herself and to those more immediately interested in she welfare that it be only necessary just to allude to it here suffice it to say that there be many cause of a general kind to which it may owe its origin but that the most frequent be undue lactation a subject to which reference have already be make and the effect both upon mother and child fully dwell upon -lrb- fn

character and deficient in quantity give rise to flatulence griping and sometimes even convulsion in the infant -lrb- fn # 32 -rrb- a fit of passion in the nurse will frequently be follow by a fit of bowel complain in the child -lrb- fn # 33 -rrb- these cause of course be temporary and when remove the milk become a healthy and sufficient for the child as before -lrb- fn # 32 -rrb- see page 25

husband of this lady fail a adversity which have be impend since the date when the breast-milk disappear upon which day the deranged state of the husband 's affair be make know to the wife -- a fact which at once explain the mysterious disappearance of the milk unwholesome article of diet will affect the mother 's milk and derange the infant 's bowels on the 25th may 1836 i be call to see a infant at the breast with diarrhoea the remedial measure have but little effect so long as the infant be allow the breast-milk but this be discontinue and arrow-root make with water only allow the complaint be quickly put a stop to believe that the mother 's milk be impaired from some accidental cause which might now be pass the infant be again allow the breast in less than four-and-twenty hour however the diarrhoea return the mother be a very healthy woman it be suspect that some unwholesome article in she diet might be the cause the regimen be accordingly carefully inquire into when it appear that porter from a neighbouring publican 's have be substitute for they own for some little time past this prove to be bad throw down when leave to stand a few hour a considerable sediment it be discontinue good sound ale take instead the infant again put to the breast upon the milk of which it flourish and never have another attack in the same way aperient medicine take by the mother will act on the child 's bowels through the effect which it produce upon she milk this however be not the case with all kind of purgative medicine nor do the same purgative produce a like effect upon all child it be well therefore for a parent to notice what aperient act thus through she system upon that of she child and what do not and when a aperient become necessary for herself unless she desire that the infant 's bowels be move to avoid the latter if otherwise she may take the former with good effect again the return of the monthly period whilst the mother be a nurse always affect the property of the milk more or less derange the stomach and bowels of the infant it will thus frequently happen that a few day before the mother be go to be unwell the infant will become fretful and uneasy its stomach will throw up the milk and its motion will be frequent watery and greenish and then when the period be fully over the milk will cease to purge it be principally in the early month however that the infant seem to be affect by this circumstance for it will be generally find that although the milk be certainly impair by it be less abundant and nutritious still after the third or fourth month it cease to affect the infant be then a mother because she monthly period return after she delivery to give up nursing certainly not unless the infant 's health be seriously affect by it for she will generally find that as the period come round by keep the infant pretty much from the breast during its continuance and feed he upon artificial food she will prevent disorder of the child 's health and be able in the interval to nurse she infant with advantage it must be add however that a wet - nurse be to be resort to rather than any risk incur of injure the child 's health and that in every case partial feeding will be necessary at a much earlier period than when a mother be not thus affect the milk may also be render less nutritive and diminish in quantity by the mother again become pregnant in this case however the parent 's health will chiefly suffer if she persevere in nursing this however will again act prejudicially to the child it will be wise therefore if pregnancy should occur and the milk disagree with the infant to resign the duty of a nurse and to put the child upon a suitable artificial diet -- if however pregnancy should take place before the infant be six month 's old a wet-nurse ought to be procure from irregular nursing -- this be one of the most frequent source of derangement of the stomach and bowels of the child the infant that be constantly at the breast will always be suffer more or less from flatulence gripe looseness of the bowels and vomit this be cause by a sufficient interval not be allow between the meal for digestion the milk therefore pass on from the stomach into the bowels undigested and the effect just allude to follow time must not only be give for the proper digestion of the milk but the stomach itself must be allow a season of repose this evil then must be avoid most carefully by the mother strictly adhering to those rule for nursing which have be already lay down -lrb- fn # 34 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 34 -rrb- see page 5 from teethe -- the bowels of the infant at the breast as well as after it be wean be generally affect by teethe and it be fortunate that this be the case for it prevent more serious affection indeed the diarrhoea that occur during dentition except it be violent must not be subdue if however this be the case attention must be pay to it it will generally be find to be accompany by a swollen gum the freely lance of which will sometimes alone put a stop to the looseness : further medical aid may however be necessary from cold and damp etc -- of course there be other cause besides these already allude to give rise to bowel complaint during this epoch -- cause not cognisable by the mother however and not mention therefore here it be right however that she should be aware that these affection be sometimes the result simply of impression of cold or damp particularly at certain season of the year in the autumn for instance when as be well know bowel complaint be very frequent when thus produce it be important early to seek medical aid as inflammation be generally the result 2 at the period of wean there be great susceptibility to derangement of the stomach and bowels of the child at the period when wean ordinarily take place so that great care and judgment must be exercise in effect this object usually however the bowels be derange during this process from one of these cause from wean too early from effect it too suddenly and abruptly or from over-feeding and the use of improper and unsuitable food there be another cause which also may give rise to diarrhoea at this time independently of wean viz the irritation of difficult teethe wean too early -- the substitution of artificial food for the breast - milk of the mother at a period when the digestive organ of the infant be too delicate for this change be a frequent source of the affection now under consideration the attempt to wean a delicate child for instance when only six month old will inevitably be follow by disorder of the stomach and bowels unless therefore a mother be oblige to resort to this measure from become pregnant or any other unavoidable cause if she consult the welfare of she child she will not give up nursing at this early period but if she should be no longer competent to suckle and she infant be delicate a wet-nurse must be obtain for the infant 's bowels become disorder medicine or remedy will avail little without healthy breast milk the age at which wean ought to take place must ever depend upon circumstance the ninth month would not be too early for some the twelfth would be for other -lrb- fn # 35 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 35 -rrb- see page 51 for sudden and abrupt alteration of diet -- deprive the child at once of the breast and substitute artificial food however proper under due regulation such food may be will invariably cause bowel complaint certain rule and regulation must be adopt to effect wean safely the detail of which be give elsewhere -lrb- fn # 36 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 36 -rrb- see page 52 overfeeding and the use of improper and unwholesome food -- these cause be more productive of disorder of the stomach and bowels at the time of wean than any yet refer to if too large a quantity of food be give at each meal or the meal be too frequently repeat in both instance the stomach will become oppressed wearied and deranged part of the food perhaps throw up by vomit whilst the remainder not have undergo the digestive process will pass on into the bowels irritate its delicate lining membrane and produce flatulence with gripe purge and perhaps convulsion then again improper and unsuitable food will be follow by precisely the same effect and unless a judicious alteration be quickly make remedy will not only have no influence over the disease but the cause be continue the disease will become most seriously aggravate it be therefore of the first importance to the well-doing of the child that at this period when the mother be about to substitute a artificial food for that of she own breast she should first ascertain what kind of food suit the child best and then the precise quantity which nature demand many case might be cite where child have never have a prescription write for they simply because these point have be attend to they diet have be manage with judgment and care whilst on the other hand other might be refer to whose life have be hazard and all but lose simply from injudicious dietetic management over-feeding and improper article of food be more frequently productive in they result of anxious hour and distressing scene to the parent and of danger and loss of life to the child than almost any other cause teethe -- the irritation cause by difficult teething may give rise to diarrhoea at the period when the infant be wean independently of the wean itself such disorder of the bowels if it manifestly occur from this cause be a favourable circumstance and should not be interfere with unless indeed the attack be severe and aggravate when medical aid become necessary slight diarrhoea then during wean when it be fairly traceable to the cutting of a tooth -lrb- the heated and inflamed state of the gum will at once point to this as the source of the derangement -rrb- be of no consequence but it must not be mistake for disorder arise from other cause lance the gum will at once then remove the cause and generally cure the bowel complaint 3 to the child bring up by hand child bring up on a artificial diet be very liable to indigestion and bowel complaint indeed none more so : and it be from these affection that so many of these infant perish when then it be absolutely necessary from untoward circumstance to have recourse to this mode of nourish the child the rule and regulation lay down in the section on artificial feeding must be most strictly follow out if the parent would hope to avoid disease and rear she child -lrb- fn # 37 -rrb- and if these affection should at any time unfortunately manifest themselves the mother ought carefully and diligently to examine whether the plan of feed pursued be in every particular correct particularly bear in mind that the two cause most frequently productive of disorder in the child be overfeed and the exhibition of unsuitable food -- the two grand error of the nursery these result however have already be sufficiently dwell upon as likely to take place at wean and they may of course occur to a child who be bring up on a artificial diet at any period -lrb- fn # 37 -rrb- see page 34 maternal treatment of the disorder of the stomach and bowels as must have be already see the maternal treatment chiefly consist in the removal of the cause of the disorder medicine may occasionally be exhibit by the mother but its use in she hand must be very limited indeed unfortunately the general resource and only remedy of most mother in affection of the stomach and bowels be a aperient and a combination contain calomel be the one too frequently select the primary cause of the disorder be undetected and consequently no measure take for its removal but purgative powder after purgative powder be give the evil be suppose to rest in the bowels alone and that such means must eventually get rid of it the mother be not aware all this time that the real source of the derangement be probably in the diet itself that there be some error here and that unless this be correct the remedy must be worse than useless the consequence of such a plan of proceeding be usually very sad a confirm and obstinate diarrhoea but too commonly ensue and the infant be sometimes reduce to the last extremity the removal of the cause of the disorder then in a large number of instance of derangement of the stomach and bowels if effect early will cure the disease and without further remedy but it will be ask by what method be this cause to be detect in this way in all human probability the primary cause of the disorder be connect with the diet this be the case in ninety-nine instance out of a hundred well then be the sick child at the breast if so ascertain whether the breast-milk be healthy and wholesome or whether any circumstance exist which have render it otherwise if nothing faulty be find here the next question would naturally be whether the rule and regulation lay down for suckle have be strictly adhere to or whether the infant be sufficiently old to render it at all probable that a tooth may be irritate the gum perhaps the child be be wean well be there any error here be the change be attempt too early or too suddenly and abruptly if this be not the case then have the child be overf or be the food give of the proper description be the child be bring up by hand then there be every reason to suspect either that the quality of the food give be not the most suitable or that the quantity exhibit be too great in fact that the rule lay down for artificial feeding have not be strictly act upon by a mode of investigation like this any defect or error in the dietetic management of the infant produce the disorder will be easily detect by a careful mother and its correction alone will in very many instance be all that be necessary to remove the symptom for example if flatulence and gripe follow by diarrhoea occur to a infant at the breast if at the same time it become pale its flesh flabby its disposition fretful always cry until it be put to the breast the nipple of which it grasp eagerly suck eagerly yet never satisfy for its hunger continue it be not nourish if too the more it suck the more the stomach and bowels be derange the more it vomit and be purge depend upon it the cause of all the evil will be find to be unwholesome milk no medicine will avail any thing here the cause must be remove the best medicine and the only remedy be a breast of healthy milk and if this be not procure early there will be great danger of a diarrhoea setting in which may probably prove fatal to the child again if there be simply vomit of the breast-milk almost immediately after the child have be suckle the milk come up pure and unchanged and discharge without any apparent effort and the moment after the child be cheerful and happy this will be find to depend upon repletion and not upon unwholesome milk in fact the stomach have receive too much this must be prevent in future not by give medicine but simply by remove the infant from the nipple immediately it cease to draw strongly the moment it begin to dally with the breast again if flatulence and gripe occur to the child bring up by handy this derangement will generally be find to result from overfeed : abstinence and diminution of the quantity of the food will generally be all that be necessary here it will be well however for the mother in this case and she may do it with the utmost safety to unload the bowels of they indigestible contents by the exhibition of a tea-spoonful of castor oil a dose or two of this medicine will effectually clear they out without increase the irritation or weaken the child whilst it will in most instance altogether remove the symptom if the flatulence however should continue four or five grain of magnesia may be mix with the last meal at night and a little warm water throw up into the bowel as a injection the next morning diarrhoea occur in a child bring up by hand if it be not the result of overfeed will very frequently be find to arise from unsuitable diet the food give not be of a kind suit to the infant 's stomach for what will agree with one child often disagree with another alteration of diet will sometimes alone suffice in these case to cure if this alteration be only make early enough before any considerable irritation of the stomach and bowels have be induce thin arrow-root make with water -lrb- prepared very carefully or the child will refuse it -rrb- should be give for five or six day the warm bath use every night for the same period a new flannel bandage roll round the body and the child cautiously protect from a damp atmosphere the arrow-root upon the cessation of the diarrhoea may have cow ' milk add to it if milk be not find to disagree : when this be the case chicken or weak mutton broth free from fat or beef - tea thickened with farinaceous food with a little salt add be the best substitute should not the diarrhoea yield to the foregoing measure and that readily medical aid ought to be seek diarrhoea be very frequent from the time of wean to the third year of age and certainly in its effect form so important a disease that unless in the slight form notice above a mother be not justified in attempt its relief in conclusion i would observe that i do not think a mother justified in attempt more than what have be lay down here for she guidance it be believe that the few and plain common-sense direction give if follow will do much to prevent disease and even to relieve it in its milder form they will not however cure disease itself when really establish : and again i would repeat let the mother recollect that to prevent disease be she province -- to cure it be the physician 's sect iii -- costiveness 1 in infancy the principle to act upon in the management of the infant 's bowels be this -- that they should be keep free and by the mildest and least irritating means if therefore they become accidentally confine -lrb- less than two stool in the four-and-twenty hour -rrb- and the infant be suckle the mother may ascertain whether a aperient take by herself will render she milk of a sufficiently purgative quality to act upon the bowels of she child this be the mildest mode of all if however this do not answer or be not practicable from the child be feed artificially then the mildest aperient medicine must be choose to accomplish this purpose the kind of medicine to be select and the dose in which to be adminster will be find in the section on aperient medicine -lrb- fn # 39 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 39 -rrb- see page 97 if however the bowels of the infant be dispose to be habitually confine it should be ascertain whether this may not be dependent upon its diet the same food that agree perfectly well with one child will frequently cause costiveness in another a intelligent and observe mother will soon discover whether this be the source of the mischief or not boil milk for instance will invariably cause confine bowels in some child the same result will follow sago boil in beef tea with other whilst on the other hand the bowels may frequently be bring into regular order and they confine state overcome by change the food to leman 's top and bottom steep in hot water and a small quantity of unboiled milk add or prepared barley mix in warm water and unboiled milk will have the same effect sometimes child be constitutionally costive that be the bowels be relieved every third or fourth day not oftener and yet perfect health be enjoy this occasionally will happen in large family all the child though perfectly healthy and robust be similarly affect when such be find by a mother to be really the habit of she child it would be very unwise because injurious to its health to attempt by purgative to obtain more frequent relief at the same time it will be prudent and necessary for she to watch that the regular time be not exceed this condition seldom occur to the very young infant 2 in childhood child of sound health who be judiciously feed and have sufficient exercise very seldom need aperient medicine error in diet a want of proper attention to the state of the skin insufficiency of air and exercise in fine a neglect of those general principle which have be lay down for the management of health and upon the observance of which the due and healthy performance of every function of the body depend be the source of bowel derangement and particularly at this age of costiveness i feel assure however that some child be more trouble with costiveness than other from the simple but important circumstance of they not be early teach the habit of relieve the bowels daily and at a certain hour there be a natural tendency to this periodical relief of the system and it exist at the earliest age and if the mother only cause this habit to be fairly establish in infancy she will do much towards promote regularity of she child 's bowels throughout life the recollection of this fact and the mother 's act upon it be of the greatest importance to the future health and comfort of she child if the bowels be accidentally confine at this age castor oil be certainly the best aperient that can be give : it act mildly but efficiently clear out the bowels without irritate they the dose must be regulate by the age as also by the effect that aperient generally have upon the individual great care must in future be take to avoid the cause or accidental circumstance which produce the irregularity when the bowels be habitually costive much care and judgment be necessary for they relief and future management fortunately this condition be very rare in youth the activity and exposure to the air usual at this period of life render purgative unnecessary unless indeed -lrb- as just mention -rrb- some error in diet or some unusual circumstance render they accidentally confine should however the foregoing state exist medicine alone will avail little there be certain general measure which must also be act up to and most strictly if the end be to be accomplish they consist principally in a observance of great regularity with respect to the time of take food its quality quantity and due mastication regular and sufficient exercise horse exercise be particularly serviceable the shower-bath or daily ablution early rising -lrb- the indulgence in the habit of lie in bed always predispose to constipation -rrb- and lastly the patient habituate himself to evacuate the bowels at a certain hour of the day after breakfast appear to be the time when the bowels be more disposed to act than at any other part of the day this be the time then that should be choose all these point must be sedulously observe and upon the principle lay down in the various chapter upon these subject if habitual costiveness be expect to be overcome sect iv -- worm not so frequent as popularly suppose a error productive of mischief -- almost all disease have be at one time or other attribute to the generation of worm in the intestine and at the present day it be not at all a uncommon occurrence for medical man to be call in to prescribe for child to whom the strongest purgative quack medicine have be previously exhibit by parent for the removal of symptom which upon investigation be find in no way connect with or produce by worm the result of such error be always more or less mischievous and sometimes of so serious a nature as to lay the foundation of disease which ultimately prove fatal this observation moreover it behove a mother carefully to regard since the symptom popularly suppose to indicate the existence of worm be so deceptive -lrb- and none more so than that which be usually so much depend upon -- the picking of the nose -rrb- that it may be positively assert to be impossible for a unprofessional person to form a correct and sound opinion in any of these case it be at one time imagine and the idea be still popularly current that worm be the occasion of a troublesome and linger species of fever which be therefore designate worm-fever this notion be now entirely explode for if worm be present under such circumstance it be a mere accidental complication the fever refer to be generally of a remit character and neither cause by or cause the generation of worm the symptom of this fever however have lead and continue to lead very many astray this be not surprising since they so closely resemble those which characterise the presence of worm that a unprofessional person be almost sure to be mislead by they amongst other symptom there be the picking of the nose and lip offensive breath occasional vomit deranged bowels pain in the head and belly with a tumid and swollen condition of the latter a short dry cough wasting of the flesh etc symptom continually attendant upon the disorder now under consideration these case have hitherto be perpetually look upon by mother as worm-case and after have be treat by they as such by the use of the popular worm-powder of the day have as perpetually present themselves to the physician greatly and grievously aggravate by such injudicious treatment it be folly at any time for a unprofessional person to prescribe for a case where worm be actually know to exist : surely where there be any doubt upon the latter point it must be greater folly still the infant at the breast be seldom if ever the subject of this disorder whilst a artificial diet or bring up by hand predispose to it worm most frequently occur however during childhood much more so at this epoch than in adult age they do not invariably occasion indisposition for they be now and then pass without pain or distress by child who be in the enjoyment of perfect health and in whom previously there be not the slightest suspicion of they existence the idea formerly so prevalent of they be attend with danger be without foundation for unless the case be mismanage they rarely give rise to serious consequence how produce and how best prevent -- the cause of worm it be not very easy to explain at the same time it be very certain that some known circumstance favor they production if the general health of a child be enfeebled particularly if the child be strumous such a condition will favor the generation of these animal the protracted use of unwholesome and innutritious article of food or a deficient supply of salt -lrb- the most necessary stimulant to the digestive organ -rrb- or other condiment predispose to worm this observation be strikingly illustrate by a occurrence which formerly take place in holland where a ancient law exist forbid salt in the bread of certain criminal they be in consequence horribly infested with worm and quickly die sugar too whilst a necessary condiment for the food of child if give in the form of sweetmeat and they indulgence long persist in may so enfeeble the organ of digestion as to cause worm and lastly -lrb- though many other cause might be refer to -rrb- the injudicious means occasionally employ to effect the removal of these animal by the debility produce in the intestinal canal favor not only they re-appearance but they increase these then be so many cause which may occasion worm in the child and of course the best and most effectual method to prevent they production be they avoidance a mother therefore should at all time be careful in the regulation of the diet and general management of she child 's habit and health even if no stronger obligation exist than the dread of this disorder and she must be more than ordinarily vigilant on this head when the slightest disposition to such disorder be manifest again she must not forget that the symptom so commonly ascribe as characteristic of worm be much more frequently cause by other disease that at no time therefore be she justify in give worm powder or strong dose of medicine for such symptom for if they do exist they use be always attend with risk and if they do not the debility which they occasion in the stomach and bowels may itself become the source of they production sect v scarlet fever there be several variety of this disease it will be more perspicuous however for we purpose to speak of it under the two follow form : -- mild scarlet fever scarlet fever with sore throat mild scarlet fever -- in this form of the disease there be only the rash with fever symptom -- the anticipate symptom be those of fever : they precede the eruption the degree of fever however be variable for the symptom be sometimes so moderate as scarcely to attract attention slight and irregular shiver nausea perhaps vomit thirst and heat of skin whilst at other there be considerable constitutional disturbance indicate by pungent heat of skin flushing of the face suffusion of the eye pain in the head great anxiety and restlessness and occasionally slight delirium these symptom be follow on the second day -lrb- in the majority of instance -rrb- by the rash this first appear in numerous speck or minute patch of a vivid red color on the face neck and chest in about four-and-twenty hour it become gradually diffuse over the whole trunk on the follow day -lrb- the third -rrb- it extend to the upper and lower extremity so that at this period the whole surface of the body be of a bright red color hot and dry the efflorescence too be not always confine to the skin but occasionally tinge the inside of the lip cheek palate throat nostril and even the internal surface of the eyelid sometimes the efflorescence be continuous and universal but more generally on the trunk of the body there be interval of a natural hue between the patch with papulous dot scatter over they the color be most deep on the loin and neighbouring part at the flexure of the joint and upon those part of the body which be subject to pressure it be also generally most vivid in the evening gradually become paler towards morning the eruption be at its height on the fourth day -- it begin to decline on the fifth when the interstice widen and the florid hue fade -- on the sixth the rash be very indistinct and on the eighth day it be wholly go the various symptom with which the eruption be accompany gradually disappear with the efflorescence but the tongue still remain morbidly red and clean the peel off of the cuticle -lrb- the outer layer of the skin -rrb- which begin about the end of the fifth day on the part on which the eruption first appear proceeds so that about the eighth or ninth portion of the cuticle be throw off the thickest and largest be those detach from the skin of the hand and foot scarlet fever with sore throat -- in this form of the disease the fever and rash be accompany with inflammation of the throat symptom -- the symptom be more severe than in the mild form of this disease and in the majority of instance the inflammation of the throat appear with the eruption and go through its progress of increase and decline with the cutaneous eruption sometimes however it precede the fever whilst at other it do not appear until the rash be at its height it be generally in the course of the second day that the child complain of considerable stiffness in the muscle of the neck extend to the lower jaw and under the ear -- of a roughness of the throat and difficulty in swallow -- and some degree of hoarseness will be notice : all so many indication that the throat be affect very shortly a increase secretion of the mucus of these part occur and collect about the tonsil aggravate the child 's suffering from the frequent and ineffectual effort make to expel it if the inflammatory action be more severe exudation of lymph will also be pour out and intermingle with the mucus greatly augment the difficulty of swallow at this time the lining membrane of the mouth as also the tongue assume a florid red color the red point of the latter become much elongate the febrile symptom be severe from the first amongst other there will be headach sometimes accompany by slight delirium nausea intense heat of skin languor and considerable inquietude and anxiety : and as the inflammation approach its height the fever increase the pulse rise the breathing become oppressed the skin become more pungently hot and dry and the thirst urgent all these symptom be increase towards evening when the febrile restlessness be often succeed by delirium the rash be seldom perceptible before the third day and then come out in irregular patch on various part of the body particularly about the elbow and wrist thus differ as to the time and mode of its appearance from the mild form of the disease it frequently recede or entirely vanish the day after it first come out and then reappear partially and at uncertain time this generally protract the duration of the disorder without however produce any perceptible change in the other symptom on the fifth or sixth day of the disease the fever and inflammation of the throat begin to abate at the same time the rash decline and the peel off of the cuticle soon follow this be the ordinary course of scarlet fever with sore throat but in many case the symptom run still higher and the disease be alarmingly dangerous from its commencement in some instance there be a acrid discharge from the nostril or ear often accompany with deafness as also enlargement of the gland in the neck follow by the formation of abscess in they immediate neighborhood it be unnecessary however to follow out the symptom of scarlet fever more fully as all that have be attempt here have be so to sketch out the more prominent symptom of this disease that the direction upon the parental management may be readily comprehend : they will be very brief but a strict attention thereto will be find all-important to the well-doing and comfort of the child character of scarlet fever compare with that of measles -- it will be seldom difficult to distinguish this disease from other acute eruptive disorder the one to which it bear the greatest resemblance be the measles but from this it be readily distinguish by the absence of the cough the inflamed and watery eye run at the nose and sneeze which be the predominant symptom in the early stage of the measles but which do not usually attend on scarlet fever -- at least in any high degree in measles also there be a absence of that restlessness anxiety and depression of spirit by which scarlet fever be peculiarly distinguish -- the rash too in measles do not appear till two or three day later than that of scarlet fever it also differ in its character in scarlet fever the eruption consist of innumerable minute dot or point diffuse in patch with uneven edge of various size and form and give to those portion of the skin on which it appear a diffused bright red color in measles the rash come out in irregular semi-lunar or crescentic shaped patch distinctly elevate the spot be of a deeper red in the center than in the circumference and leave intervene space in which the skin retain its natural pale color maternal management -- the chief point to which the parent 's attention must be direct irrespective of a strict attention to the more immediate medical treatment direct by the physician be the following : -- ventilation of the bed-room -- even in the mildest case the child must be keep in bed from the first accession of the fever he must not be load however as be formerly the practice with a quantity of bed-clothes in order to encourage the fever and increase the quantity of eruption a moderate quantity of clothing be all that be require adapt to the heat of skin and feeling of the patient the bed-room must be keep cool and well ventilate this be of importance in the mildest case but in the more severe form of this disease in which the throat be much affect the constant and free admission of pure air will have a most decide and mark good effect upon the symptom the air should be renew therefore from time to time the linen both of the bed and the patient should also be frequently change daily -- if practicable however mild the symptom of this disease may be at the commencement the child must always be carefully and vigilantly watch by the parent as inflammation of some internal organ may suddenly arise -lrb- which be generally indicate by symptom sufficiently obvious -rrb- and thus change a apparently mild form of this disease into one of a alarming character cold sponge -- whenever the skin be pungently hot and dry the whole surface of the body should be sponge with cold water or with vinegar and water the heat be by this mean rapidly abstracted and the child refresh and this may again and again be resort to as the heat again return by this application alone the pulse have be diminish in frequency the thirst have abate the tongue have become moist a general free per spiration have break forth the skin have become soft and cool and the eye have brighten and these indication of relief have be speedily follow by a calm and refreshing sleep in all these respects the condition of the patient present a complete contrast to that which precede the cold wash and he languor be exchange for a considerable share of vigor the morbid heat it be true when thus remove be liable to return and with it the distressing symptom but a repetition of the remedy be follow by the same beneficial effect as at first -lrb- fn # 40 -rrb- -lrb- fn # 40 -rrb- bateman 's practical synopsis of cutaneous disease gargle and the inhalation of warm water -- when the throat be affect gargle be sometimes order but the pain and inconvenience which they employment give rise to frequently preclude they use : and child seldom understand how to employ they even if the state of the throat permit it under these circumstance the inhalation of the steam of hot water or hot vinegar and water may be substitute and with decide benefit mudge 's inhaler be a good contrivance to effect this when the throat be find by the mother to be early affect a immediate application to the medical adviser be especially important for if he be call upon to treat this form of scarlet fever at its very commencement by judicious treatment the duration and violence of the disease may be both shorten and greatly mitigate regimen -- cooling drink as plain water toast and water barley water flavor with lemon peel fresh whey lemonade and thin gruel may all be resort to in they turn the child may also be allow orange grape or lemon sweeten with sugar particularly when the mouth be foul and dry but care must be take that neither the pulp nor the stone be swallow these will both refresh and feed the patient as much as be necessary until the decline of the disease the parent must strictly forbid the attendant in the sick chamber give at this period any heating or stimulate fluid as also animal food and this injunction must be strictly regard even in the mildest form of the disease when the child be convalescent mild nourishment will be require such as arrow-root tapioca chicken or mutton broth beef tea jelly and roasted apple and by and by a mutton chop wine be seldom necessary except under circumstance of unusual debility after a protracted illness when its moderate use tend much to assist the convalescence but if give unadvisedly there will be great hazard of exciting internal inflammatory disease relapse be sometimes cause by the child get about too soon and by indulgence of the appetite particularly for food : a proper degree of restraint therefore must be place upon the child by the parent who can not too strictly carry out the direction of the medical attendant upon the diet and regimen during this period great attention must still be pay to the state of the bowels and indeed to all the secretion and excretion peel off of the cuticle and fall off of the hair -- to promote the more easy separation of the cuticle from the surface of the body a warm or tepid bath may be usefully employ at the close of the disease it will moreover greatly contribute to the comfort of the child and induce a more healthy condition of the skin occasionally the cuticle of the whole hand and finger will peel off unbroken when it will resemble precisely a glove in shape as be the case in all fever more or less so particularly after scarlet fever there be a great tendency to the fall off of the hair it will be always well therefore to shave the head at this time and exhibit daily a tepid shower bath as early as the strength of the child will permit caution etc -- the contagious character of this disease require the separation of the invalid from the rest of the family and when it be practicable the child should be remove to a distance this measure be imperatively call for when the form of the disease be very severe in its character great caution must also be exercise after the convalescence of the patient that the other child be not bring into too early contact with he : for infection may be thus produce though several week may have elapse from the period of the peel off of the skin the period at which the disease show itself after the exposure of a individual to source of contagion be exceedingly various one child will be seize within a few hour another not for some day and now and then -lrb- though rarely -rrb- five or six week have intervene between the period of exposure and the manifestation of the disease when this disease be rife in a family it will frequently affect the individual compose it very differently some escape altogether -- other have the mild form of the complaint -- other the severe -- and again the attendant in the sick room may be attack with the sore throat and fever only both of which may subside without any appearance of a rash in conclusion this disease be a complaint of infancy and childhood rather than of adult age generally affect the same individual but once during he life and though example of a second attack have occur such a circumstance be extremely rare sect vi -- measle measles consist of a fever in which the mucous lining of the air - passage be principally affect and which after about three day ' duration result in a eruption of a red rash over the surface it depend upon a specific contagion -- occur most frequently during childhood and adolescence though no age be exempt from it -- and affect the system but once a peculiarity to which a exception be very rare prove by the few instance of the kind which have be record the period at which the disease manifest itself after infection be various -- generally about the ninth day it have however be delay until the sixteenth description of the disease -- the child infect will be observe not to be as well as usual less active and out of spirit he appetite will fail and he sleep be restless and disturbed it will soon be evident that he have apparently take a cold in he head and that this be accompany by fever he voice will be hoarse there will be frequent cough headach sneeze run from the nose and eye -- the eyelid be somewhat swollen and the eye inflamed -- the skin will be hot and dry and he will complain of occasional chilliness in the course of the next two or three day these symptom will increase in severity and perhaps be accompany by oppression at the chest and hurry breathing and towards evening by slight delirium on the fourth day the rash will appear but the symptom will be little if at all mitigate indeed they will sometimes increase in severity the eruption will first be perceive about the head and face in the form of small red spot at first distinct from each other but soon coalesce and form patch of a irregular crescent-like or semilunar figure of a dull red color and slightly elevated -lrb- give a sensation of hardness to the finger -rrb- while portion of the skin intervene between they will retain they natural appearance at this time the eruption will also be find on the inside of the mouth and throat and the hoarseness will consequently increase on the fifth day the rash usually cover the whole surface of the body with the exception of the leg and foot and be now very vivid on the face which be not unfrequently so much swell especially the eyelid that the eye be quite close up as in small-pox on the sixth day it be fully out on the extremity and be begin to fade on the face on the eighth it be fading from all part on the ninth it be hardly perceptible and have entirely disappear on the tenth day from the commencement of the fever or the sixth from its own first appearance as the fading proceeds the spot drop off in the form of little branny scale which be sometimes from they minuteness scarcely perceptible they leave a slight discolouration on the skin with considerable itch such be the ordinary course of this disease occasionally however deviation be meet with character of measles compare with scarlet fever and small-pox -- under the description give of scarlet fever be notice several sign by which that disease may be distinguish from measles : to these may be add the absence of cough of water flow from the eye and of redness and swell of the eyelid as in measles again in measles the eruption be more pointed of a crimson instead of a scarlet hue and do not appear until two day later than in scarlet fever in small-pox the fever abate as soon as the eruption make its appearance in scarlet fever this be by no mean the case and as little so in measles : the vomit indeed subside but the cough fever and headach grow more violent and the difficulty of breathing weakness of the eye and indeed all the catarrhal symptom remain without any abatement till the eruption have all but complete its course maternal management -- measles in its ordinary and simple form be a mild and by no means dangerous disease : it be sometimes however accompany or immediately follow by symptom of a very serious character and which it be to be fear in many instance owe they origin to the carelessness of the attendant in the sick chamber a mother 's superintendence therefore be much require at this time to insure a careful attention to the medical direction as also to those general point of management upon which the well-doing of she child much depend of which the follow be the most important : -- ventilation of the bed-room etc -- the child must be keep in bed from the onset of the attack he must have so much clothing only as will secure he comfort avoid equally too much heat or exposure to cold to these point the parent 's attention must be particularly direct it be the practice with some nurse in the belief that a breath of cool air be most pernicious to keep the child constantly envelop in a smother heap of bed-clothes with curtain closely draw and the room well heat by fire by which mean the fever and all its concomitant danger be greatly augmented it be equally a popular error -lrb- and yet by many it be still hold and act upon -rrb- to suppose that because in small-pox exposure to cold be useful that therefore it must be of equal advantage in measles it can not be too generally know that the nature of the fever accompany the two disease be widely different and that the adoption of this error be productive of the most serious consequence for it would most likely produce in measles inflammation of the lung which in truth be commonly the result of carelessness upon this point the bed-room should be large and airy free from current of cold but well ventilate and not hot the room also must be darken on account of the tenderness of the eye all noise exclude and mental excitement or irritation carefully avoid regimen -- little or no food must be allow and whatever be take must be of the simplest kind and in a liquid form mild mucilaginous drink and warm may be give liberally as barley-water or thin gruel etc sponge etc -- the face chest arm and hand should be sponge occasionally with vinegar and warm water -lrb- one fourth and three fourth -rrb- this will be productive of great comfort to the little patient it remove the heat dryness and itching of the skin which be often very distressing and be especially useful at night in relieve wakefulness if the cough be troublesome it will be useful for the child to breathe the steam of warm water not through a inhaler but over a large basin with the head cover with flannel large enough to hang over its edge by this mean the tender and inflamed eye will at the same time derive advantage from the soothing effect of the vapor caution -- whenever the measles be know to be prevalent in a neighborhood and a child manifest symptom of cold in the head and fever it should at once be a reason for carefulness on the part of the parent the diet should be light cooling and scanty and the child should be carefully keep in door it have be before remark that in its ordinary course measles be a disease unaccompanied with danger but that the mildest form may be speedily convert into the most dangerous that be to say a sudden change may lake place in the symptom arise out of circumstance which could not have be foresee and therefore unavoidable or may be produce by improper management on the part of the nurse such as the give of stimulant by too much heat or by exposure to cold now it be for the parent early to notice any change which may occur from the first source and by she watchfulness to guard against the possibility of its arise from either of the second in reference to the first if the child should complain at any period of the disease of severe headach with pierce pain through the temple and if this be accompany by wander of mind great increase of suffusion of the eye as also intolerance of light the immediate attention of the medical man be demand so if towards the dose of the eruption that be from the seventh to the ninth day the breathing should again become hurry -lrb- this symptom be very generally present during the height of the eruption and be not necessarily connect with disease of the lung -rrb- with pain and oppression feel at the chest the cough become hacking and incessant etc -lrb- all symptom cognizable by the mother and indicative of inflammation of the lung -rrb- no time must be lose in seek medical aid with regard to the last cause -lrb- improper management -rrb- it may be well in reference to it to observe that it sometimes happen that the rash come out imperfectly or have appear properly suddenly retrocede and disappear and that under such circumstance the nurse will almost certainly if not well watch give the child a good dose of sulphur in dilute spirit or a glass of punch contain saffron which be consider specifics for bring out the eruption nothing can be more injurious than such remedy for generally the disappearance of the rash will be dependent upon the existence of some internal inflammation or of too high a fever for the removal of which the medical man ought to be instantly apply to sometimes however it may be fairly trace to a careless exposure to cold : under such circumstance the child should be instantly and without hesitation put into the warm bath measles be frequently follow by cough and deranged bowels and there be always great susceptibility about the child for some time on this account he should be carefully screen from a cold or damp atmosphere the diet should be carefully regulate and flannel worn next to the skin if the cough should continue it must not be neglect on the supposition that it will wear off for it demand the skilful and careful attention of the medical man in conclusion it may be remark that very frequently during infancy and childhood and particularly during the period of teethe eruption very similar in appearance to this disease occur unless however they be accompany by the specific fever and run the regular course they may at once be decide upon as not be the measles sect vii -- small-pox this disease the most dreaded of all eruptive fever be not so commonly meet with in the present day as formerly thanks to that providence which lead to the discovery of jenner but although its occurrence be not so frequent it still do occasionally present itself when it will assume either a mild or severe form if it attack a child that have not previously be vaccinate it be call natural small-pox and the chance be that the disorder will be severe in character -- if on the other hand it occur in the vaccinate the disease will generally be much modify in its symptom the attack will be mild and without danger natural small-pox -- the infection of small-pox have be receive into the system of a child that have not be vaccinate fourteen day -lrb- on a average -rrb- will transpire before the commencement of the febrile symptom or eruptive fever a distinct rigor or shiver fit then take place accompany by pain in the back or in the stomach with sickness giddiness or headach as also great drowsiness and if a infant be the subject of the disease a convulsive fit will sometimes take place or several in succession at the end of eight-and-forty hour from the occurrence of the rigor -lrb- in the majority of case -rrb- the eruption come out and show itself first on the face and neck in minute flea-bite spot in the course of the next four-and-twenty hour in some case and in other not until the expiration of two or three day it completely cover the body not be confine exclusively to the skin but frequently extend to the mouth and throat and even to the external membrane of the eye in the course of two or three day from they first appearance the little pimple increase in size will be find to contain a thin transparent fluid to pit or become depress in they center and the skin in the space between they will be find red on the seventh or eighth day from the commencement of the fever the fluid contain in the pimple will be no longer transparent but opaque and they will consequently appear white or of a light straw color each pimple or pock will be no longer depress in its center but will become raise and point be more fully distend by the increase quantity of fluid within and the skin around each pock will now be of a bright crimson the head face hand and wherever else the eruption show itself gradually swell and the eyelid be often so much distended as to close the eye and produce temporary blindness there will always at this time be some degree of fever present and its amount will vary with the circumstance of each individual ease the skin too will be very tender so much so sometimes as greatly to harass and distress the child on the eleventh day the swell and inflam of the skin of the body and face subside the pimple upon these part dry up and form scab which fall off about the fourteenth or fifteenth day those on the hand as they come out later commonly continue a short time longer the eruption leave behind in some case the peculiar mark of the disease and in other merely discolor spot which disappear in the progress of a short time the natural small-pox be sometimes much more severe in its character than the foregoing and what be call confluent small-pox be say to exist this form will be mark by great constitutional disturbance and the eruption come out earlier than in the milder form instead of be distinct that be each pimple standing distinct and separate one from the other they will coalesce and appear flat and doughy not prominent : they will more particularly run into each other on the face where they will form one continuous bag which soon become a sore will discharge copiously small-pox in the vaccinate -- when small-pox occur to those that have be formerly vaccinate the disease in almost every instance be much altered or modify in its character indeed in child in whom of course vaccination have be but comparatively lately perform small-pox when it occur will in the majority of case be so mild that the real nature of the disease will be with difficulty determine : so mild that again and again have a parent be hear to exclaim surely these few scattered pimple can not be the small-pox if however as the pimple progress they be narrowly watch and be see to become depressed in they center if there have be the precursory rigor etc and if the source of the disorder can be trace to some case of undoubted small-pox the child in fact have be expose to contagion no doubt ought to exist in reference to the nature of such a case however slight may be the character of the disease the usual progress however of small-pox modify by vaccination be as follow the first stage be the same usually as in the natural form of the disease as soon however as the eruption appear the modify power of the vaccination become apparent the eruption will be find to be generally both less in quantity and more limited in its extent or if even it should come out profusely and cover a large extent of the surface of the body still the controul power of the vaccination will immediately show itself after its appearance -- first in the complete subsidence of all the febrile symptom which will now take place and secondly in reference to the eruption part of which will die away at once and the remainder will by the fifth day be fill with the opaque yellowish fluid then dry up become hard and horny and fall off will leave a mottled red appearance of the skin and now and then slight pit such be the usual progress of the disease : subsequent to vaccination it be a mild and tractable disorder it be right however to mention that small-pox have occur even to the vaccinate in almost as severe a form as the confluent natural small-pox and run its regular course unaltered or unmodified such instance however be extremely rare and form the exception to the general rule for no reasonable doubt can be entertain from the abundance of fact now before the world that such modification be the law of the animal economy and that the regular or natural progress be the exception maternal management -- the grand principle in the treatment of small-pox be to moderate and keep under the fever and however the plan adopt by different medical man may vary in particular point to accomplish this purpose they uniformly make this principle they chief aim and object to carry out this intention however the medical adviser be greatly dependent upon the aid and assistance of a judicious parent and without this it be impossible to hope for a successful issue to the case a clear knowledge therefore of those point of general management in which in fact a great part of the above principle consist -lrb- few and simple as these direction be -rrb- it must be all-important for the mother to be acquaint with : for the rest she must and ought to look to the medical man in the more rare and severe form of this disease viz the confluent small-pox although in some instance it run the same course as the milder form the distinct or natural small-pox still usually the constitutional symptom be much more aggravate and the medical and general treatment require will so much depend upon the character of the individual case that we do not think it well to notice it here bed and bed-room -- it will not be necessary at first for the child to be confine to he bed but generally about the third or fourth day he will gladly resort to it and if he do not it will be prudent to keep he there he must not however be load with bed-clothes but lightly cover and the bed and body linen should be change daily if possible the bed-room should be capacious and well ventilate fresh air frequently admit and if the season of the year permit and there be no dampness of atmosphere a window should be constantly open during the day : it be also desirable to keep the chamber darken in all case as there be always a tendency to inflammation of the eye if these direction be not regard and a great heat of the apartment be permit with abundance of bed-clothes heap upon the child the hot bath be use and hot and stimulating regimen give -lrb- upon the old and erroneous notion of bring out the eruption -rrb- the mildest case will inevitably be convert into one of the most severe and dangerous fact have abundantly show that such measure invariably prove the most effectual means of exasperate the disease and endanger life regimen -- this must be most spare cold water may be give whenever the child ask for it lemonade should form the common drink during the fever and gruel barley-water and roasted apple be all else that be require during this period and not until the disease be go off must any change be make in the diet the above period have arrive mildly nutritious food should be give as chicken or mutton broth beef-tea arrow-root tapioca or sago to be follow in a few day by the wing of a chicken or a mutton chop remember always that solid animal food must at first be give cautiously and sparingly wine or stimulant must be positively forbid unless indeed order by the medical man for circumstance may arise which render they advisable the state of the bowels must be carefully attend to at this time the eruption -- in the natural and mild form of this disorder the pustule generally break from the sixth to the eighth day dry scab succeed and in about nine or ten day the part heal perfectly require no treatment in the more aggravate case however in which the pustule be very numerous run one into the other and burst discharge greatly the whole surface of the body should be frequently and liberally dust over with dry flour or what be better starch powder the sore in this instance be always tedious in healing and follow by the well-known pit or mark : these arise from a loss of substance in the true skin and occur more particularly on the face from the great vascularity of this part cause the pustule to be more numerous here than elsewhere it be a popular error to suppose that by wear mask of fine linen or cambric illined with particular ointment these scar or pit may be prevent : it be impossible to prevent they and any local application except a little cold cream or oil of almond apply to the scab when they harden will prove more injurious than useful the child 's hand however should always be muffle to prevent its scratch or break the sore for otherwise he will not be keep from thus attempt to allay the excessive itching which they occasion the hair should be closely cut at a early period of the disease and so keep throughout its continuance this will contribute very much to the comfort of the child by prevent the hair become mat together with the discharge from the pustule when they break which give rise to great pain and irritation in the confluent and worst form of this disease this measure it be particularly necessary to attend to as also to the application of cold lotion to the head when hot and dry -lrb- with other remedial means -rrb- as there be always a tendency in these case to the formation of abscess the healing of which be troublesome and attend with difficulty caution etc -- it have already be state that a free ventilation of the bed-room be necessary to the well-doing of the patient this measure however must not be confine to the chamber of the sick but act upon through the whole house in conjunction with ventilation fumigation by means of aromatic substance keep slowly burn should be resort to a solution of the chloride of lime too a most powerful disinfectant should be use to purify the different apartment this be best accomplish by steep in the solution piece of linen and hang they about the room as also frequently and freely sprinkle the wall themselves and as soon as the invalid be remove the chamber should be white-washed the various article of furniture well scour with soap and water and the room be well and freely ventilate prior to its be again occupy the clothes of the patient and the bed linen should be frequently remove and when take away immediately immerse in boiling water and whilst hang up in the open air sprinkle occasionally with a weak solution of the chloride of lime if these direction be not observe and the clothes be closely wrap up they will retain and give out the disease to other at a great distance of time again : as the contagious property of smallpox hang about the child as long as any scab remain -lrb- which indeed may be say to retain the poison in its concentrated form -rrb- a parent must be most careful that the invalid be not too early bring in contact with the healthy member of the family a observance of these precaution be imperatively demand they not only protect the healthy but aid the infected sect viii -- hooping-cough my chief inducement to notice the above disorder arise out of the well-known fact that there be no complaint of childhood more frequently subject to quackery and mismanagement than be this indeed there be few malady against which a greater array and variety of means have be recommend than against hooping-cough i suppose from the circumstance of the simple and mild form of the complaint be so tractable -lrb- provide it remain such -rrb- that the simplest and mildest measure effect its cure parent be tempt to undertake its management in the more severe and complicated form and the result be but too often the establishment of disease dangerous to life and sometimes fatal to it but although most imprudent for a parent to assume the office of the physician she aid be essentially necessary in carry out the measure prescribe by she watchfulness and care the duration of the disease may not only be abridged but what be of much greater importance a more serious and aggravate form of disease prevent for although hooping-cough in itself be not a dangerous disorder still the most simple and slight case if neglect or mismanage may quickly be convert into one both complicated and dangerous description of the disease -- hooping-cough commence with the symptom of a common cold which be more or less frequent these symptom continue from five day to fifteen at the end of which time the cough change its character and assume the convulsive form which distinguish the disorder it occur in paroxysm vary with the severity of the disease from five to six in the twenty-four hour to one every ten or fifteen minute be generally more severe and frequent during the night than in the day during a paroxysm the expiration be make with such violence and repeat in such quick succession that the child can not breathe and seem in danger of suffocation the face and neck become swollen and purple from suffusion and the eye prominent inject arid full of tear the little one with a forewarning of the attack which it dread fall on he knee or cling closely to any thing near he the paroxysm terminate with one or two long inspiration attend with that peculiar noise or whoop from which the disease have derive its designation sometimes the fit of cough be interrupt for a minute or two so that a little rest be obtain and be then succeed by another fit of cough and another hoop until after a succession of these action the paroxysm terminate by vomit or a discharge of mucus from the lung or both the disease have continue at its height for two or three week it begin naturally to decline the paroxysm become less frequent and violent the expectoration increase the cough lose its characteristic hoop and gradually wear away altogether until at length in two or three month from the first onset of the disease the child be restore to perfect health sometimes however particularly in the autumn and at other season on the occurrence of easterly wind the paroxysm of cough will return -- it will assume its spasmodic character and be accompany with the whoop after a month or even two or three month of perfect and apparent recovery error in diet will sometimes alone have a similar effect it be a disease which usually occur during childhood rarely affect the same individual twice and be seldom see in the very young infant in reference to the probable result of the disease when it occur in its mild and simple form in a healthy child the termination be usually favourable but it may at first assume this form and afterwards become complicated and consequently more or less dangerous owe to injudicious management or to various influence over which the mother have no control it generally appear as a epidemic and at those season when catarrhal complaint be most prevalent and affect many or several at the same time isolate case however frequently occur which seem to prove the disease to be infectious some person deny that it be so mother and nurse however who have not have the disease will often contract it from the child under such circumstance and thus it will be quickly propagate through the family the nursing mother will occasionally take it from the infant at she breast the child who have catch it from other whilst at school and bring home in consequence will communicate it readily to he brother and sister although the disease do not exist previously in the family or neighborhood and be bring from a distant part of the country all these instance be surely proof of its infectious character and point out the necessity of caution whenever hooping-cough may present itself in a family and the necessity which exist for a early removal of the unaffected child from the sphere of its contagious influence the infectious property diminish as the disease decline maternal management -- in the mild and simple form of this disease the medical treatment be one rather of prevention than cure and the maternal management consist in assist by watchfulness and care the fulfilment of this design in these slighter case little more be require of the mother during the jirst stage of the disorder -lrb- that be before the cough become spasmodic -rrb- than attention to diet regimen and the excretion the diet should be farinaceous with milk or as may be otherwise direct the child must be confine to a mild equable temperature in fact to he apartment it be a popular error to suppose that at this time change of air be beneficial to the disease : at a later period it certainly be so but now injurious and attend with great risk should the weather be cold the little patient must be warmly clad and flannel worn next the skin this latter precaution should always be take in the winter spring and autumn purgative and other medicine will be require and order by the medical attendant the chief attention however of the parent must be direct to any change she may observe in the symptom breathe etc she must be all on the alert to notice the first sign of local inflammation of this however we shall speak presently during the early part of the second stage that be when the cough become spasmodic assume its peculiar sound the same diet and regimen must be continue and the same watchfulness observe lest any inflammatory symptom manifest themselves under the foregoing treatment the disease generally run its course without any untoward event and the child recover perfectly sometimes however although the patient be quite well and the disease on the decline the cough still continue in these case and at this time it be that change of air often prove so very serviceable the sea-side be preferable if the season of the year permit and salt - water bathing commence with the warm or tepid bath and pass gradually to the cold-bath -lrb- if no complication forbid it -rrb- will also prove certainly and rapidly remedial cry mental irritation or opposition frequently bring on a fit and even the sight of another in a paroxysm will induce it in those affect by the disease run or other active exercise will generally cause the fit to be more severe young child too must be carefully watch at night and be raise up by the nurse as soon as the fit be threaten these hint the mother should bear in mind so much for the simple form of the disease and that in which it most frequently and commonly present itself to we notice : a mild disease and if carefully manage and watch over certainly not a dangerous one of what then be a parent to be afraid or against what be she to guard lest other disease insidiously come on and advance to a irremediable degree mask by the cough without attract she attention this be the great source of danger in hooping-cough the physician in a case of simple hooping-cough be not in daily attendance upon he patient and therefore not present to notice the commencement or first symptom of those disease which so frequently occur at this time and the successful treatment of which will mainly depend upon they early detection and the decision with which they be treat when you hear of a child or several child in a family die of hooping-cough it be not this disease which prove fatal but death be cause by some disease of lung or brain which have be super-added to the hooping-cough the progress of hooping-cough then must be closely attend to by the parent even in the most favourable case the most frequent complication with hooping-cough be inflammation of the air-tube of the lung this be extremely frequent during spring and winter especially in the month of February march and April owe to the prevalence of easterly wind at this season it be not my intention to detail the symptom of this affection only to point out those which will enable a parent to recognize its approach a parent then may take warning and fear the approach of mischief when she observe the fit of cough become more frequent and more distressing to the child and the breathing hurry in the interval of the paroxysm when any exertion or speak cause increase difficulty of breathing or panting when the expectoration become less abundant and difficult to get up when there be no longer or at all event less frequent vomit after the cough and more or less febrile symptom present if the lung themselves be attack by inflammation most of the symptom already point out will occur the cough will be frequent in short paroxysm the vomiting will not take place the breathing will be very quick and hurry and as the disease advance the hoop will cease if hooping-cough attack a child whilst teething or from six month to two or three year of age it be very common for the brain to suffer and convulsion and water on the head to occur particularly if the latter disease prevail in the family whenever the paroxysm of cough be increase in violence the characteristic hoop disappear and the face become very livid the hand clench and the thumb draw into the palm the head hot and marked fit of drowsiness and languor and the child during sleep scream out or grind its tooth -- something wrong about the head ought to be anticipate of the treatment we have here nothing to say except that the gum must be carefully examine and scarify if they require it and the temperature of the head reduce by cold sponge or the application of a bag of ice when necessary the chief duty however of the parent be to be alive to these symptom and early to detect the incipient mischief that by a prompt application of efficient mean the accession of so formidable a malady may be prevent to specific remedy for this disease it be scarcely necessary to allude after what have be advance except by way of warn in the simple form of the complaint such medicine be superfluous or rather some of they from they violent property most dangerous in the complicated form of the disease they be inadmissible the indiscriminate use of purgative also a parent should avoid bowel affection be not a infrequent attendant upon hooping-cough and always aggravate the primary disorder of external application all that need be say be this that if they be not violently stimulate they do no harm if however they contain tartar emetic in addition to they do no good to the disease they cause unnecessary suffer to the patient and be sometimes productive of dangerous and even fatal sore sect ix -- croup this disease be one of the most formidable of childhood sudden -lrb- generally -rrb- in its attack most active in its progress and if not meet by a prompt and decide treatment fatal in its termination hence the paramount importance of parent be acquaint with the sign which indicate its approach that medical aid may be secure at the very onset of the disease upon this early application of suitable remedy every thing depend sign of its approach -- croup may appear in one of two way : either precede for two or three day by the symptom of a common cold accompany with hoarseness and a rough cough or it may attack with the most alarming suddenness during the night for instance although the child have be merry and well the previous evening hoarseness however be the premonitory and important symptom of croup for although it be not every hoarseness that be follow by this formidable malady still this symptom rarely attend a common cold in young child and therefore always deserve when present the serious attention of the mother particularly if accompany by a rough cough the symptom or sign of the approach of this disease have be ably and graphically depict by the late dr cheyne in the approach of a attack of croup which almost always take place in the evening probably of a day during which the child have be expose to the weather and often after catarrhal symptom have exist for several day he may be observe to be excite in variable spirit more ready than usual to laugh or to cry a little flushed occasionally cough the sound of the cough be rough like that which attend the catarrhal stage of the measles more generally however the patient have be for some time in bed and asleep before the nature of the disease with which he be threaten be apparent then perhaps without awake he give a very unusual cough well know to any one who have witness a attack of the croup : it ring as if the child have cough through a brazen trumpet it be truly a tussis clangosa it penetrate the wall and floor of the apartment and startle the experienced mother -- ` oh i be afraid we child be take the croup ' she run to the nursery find she child sleep softly and hope she may be mistaken but remain to tend he before long the ring cough a single cough be repeat again and again the patient be rouse and then a new symptom be remark : the sound of he voice be change puling and as if the throat be swell it correspond with the cough the cough be succeed by a sonorous inspiration not unlike the kink in hooping-cough -- a crow noise not so shrill but similar to the sound emit by a chicken in the pip -lrb- which in some part of scotland be call the roup hence probably the word croup -rrb- the breathing hitherto inaudible and natural now become audible and a little slower than common as if the breath be force through a narrow tube and this be more remarkable as the disease advance etc etc it be unnecessary for I to add to the foregoing picture maternal management -- have early obtain medical assistance attend with the strictest obedience to the direction give and in this disease more than any other it be particularly important that the mother should give she personal superintendence for the activity of the progress of the disease leave no time to retrieve error or atone for neglect the practitioner may be prompt and decide in the measure he prescribe but they will avail little unless they be as promptly and decidedly act upon the parent will have she reward for if timely aid have be afford and adequate means use the event will be almost invariably favourable its prevention -- croup when it have once attack a child be very liable to recur at any period before the thirteenth or fourteenth year of age it may even do so several time and after interval of various duration it be very desirable therefore that a parent should be acquaint with the means of prevention they consist simply in the follow measure : -- the careful protection of the child from cold or damp weather particularly the north-east wind of spring follow heavy rain croup be most prevalent in those season which be cold and moist or when the alternation of temperature be sudden and remarkable if the residence of the child be favourable to the production of croup -lrb- for instance near a large body of water or in low damp spot -rrb- he should if possible be remove to a healthier situation sponging or the shower-bath with cold water and bay-salt with considerable friction in dry the body should be commence in summer and employ every morning upon the child 's rise from bed the clothing should be warm in the winter and spring the neck always cover and flannel worn next the skin throughout the year but hot room and much clothing when in bed must be avoid the diet must be light and nourishing no beer or stimulant give and the state of the bowels must be carefully watch the above precaution be of course particularly necessary to enforce immediately after a recovery from a attack for there be a great tendency to relapse if the attack take place during the winter or spring month the invalid must be keep until milder weather in the house and in a room of a equable and moderately warm temperature if in the summer change of air as soon as it can be safely effect will be find very useful sect x -- water in the head water in the head be a formidable disease and not unfrequent in its occurrence it be often destructive to life and the instance be numerous in which it have appear again and again in the same family carry off one child after another as they have successively arrive at the same age but notwithstanding its frequency and fearful character a mother may do much to overcome a constitutional predisposition to this disease and thus prevent its appearance as also she may assist greatly in promote its cure when it do occur hence it be most important that a mother should be acquaint with the measure of prevention and also when it do manifest itself that clear and accurate information should be possess upon what may be say to constitute the maternal management of the disorder its prevention -- whenever there be find to exist in a family a predisposition to this malady one or more child have suffer from it a mother must make up she mind and in the strictest sense of the word to be the guardian of the health of any child she may subsequently give birth to and not only during the period of infancy but during that of childhood also must she continue the same careful and vigilant superintendence the infant must be bring up on the breast and if the mother be not of a decidedly healthy and robust constitution she must obtain a wet-nurse possess such qualification the breast-milk and nothing beside must form the nutriment of the child for at least nine month and if the infant be delicate or strumous it will be prudent to continue it even six month longer when the period arrive for the substitution of artificial food it must be carefully select it must be appropriate to the advance age of the child nutritious and unirritating good air and daily exercise and the bath or sponging be of much importance in short all those general measure which have a tendency to promote and maintain the tone and general health of the system and thus induce a vigorous and healthy constitution and to which reference have be so fully make in the first chapter of this work must be strictly regard and follow out by the parent the condition of the digestive organ must be the mother 's especial care costiveness must be guard against and if at any time the secretion from the bowels indicate the presence of derangement the medical attendant must be apply to that appropriate remedy may without delay be exhibit they disorder condition be frequently productive of head-disease again and again have i clearly trace the origin of the complaint of which i be now write as more immediately result from disorder of the digestive apparatus to a child thus predispose to water in the head the healthy state of these organ be not only of first consequence but any deviation from health to be dread to be immediately attend to and guard against in future and as there be a great liability to these attack at the time of wean the above remark especially apply to that period when due attention must be particularly pay to the plan of diet adopt during teethe the mother must be especially watchful for it be at this time that the disease so commonly appear the irritation produce by this process be a frequent exciting cause every thing therefore that will tend to allay excitement of the system must be strictly enforce as well as all cause avoid which would produce derangement of the stomach and bowels the head should be keep cool for this purpose it must be sponge night and morning throughout the whole period of teethe a horse-hair pillow use in the cot and nothing but a light straw hat should be worn except in winter the diet should be moderate and carefully regulate after leave the breast and the child should be as much as possible in the open air the mouth must be occasionally examine and if the gum become hot or distended they must be scarify or lance as may be advise if the parent find at any time a unusual heat about the head the medical man must be at once consult or if there be watchfulness or indisposition to sleep at the proper period or frequent starting in the sleep irritability of temper and much cry danger should be apprehend and prompt and judicious means employ eruption about the head or sore behind the ear discharge more or less will sometimes make they appearance just before the cutting of a tooth and disappear after it be cut or it will sometimes happen that if not interfere with they will continue throughout the whole period of dentition great caution should always be exercise in reference to these eruption in all child and when there be a predisposition to water in the head it be dangerous to interfere with they at all except they run to such a extent as to become very troublesome the sudden healing of these cutaneous affection have again and again be follow by head-disease they be unsightly in the eye of a parent but it must be recollect that they render the situation of such child much more safe and when teethe be complete they will generally disappear spontaneously or if they should not they will readily do so by proper medical treatment i have no doubt that many a child 's life have be save by the appearance and continuance of these eruption and so sensible be medical man of the benefit derive from they that in individual in whom they do not appear and in whose family there exist a predisposition to the disease now under we consideration a issue or seton in the arm or neck have sometimes be make and have a remarkable influence in ward off this affection dr cheyne refer to the circumstance of ten child in one family have die of this disease the eleventh for whom this measure be employ have be preserve stimulant throughout the whole period of infancy and childhood and of every description must be prohibit child nurse by drunken parent and who have indulge in the use of spirituous liquor during suckling be never healthy be the frequent subject of convulsion and many of they die eventually of water in the head the practice of administer spirit to the child itself a habit unfortunately not very uncommon among the lower class produce a similar result narcotic may operate in a like manner : they derange the whole system when persevere in particularly affect the brain promote disease and sometimes give rise to the one in question this remark should be bear in mind by the mother as godfrey 's cordial and other preparation of opium be too often keep in the nursery and secretly give by unprincipled nurse to quiet a restless and sick child all cause of mental excitement should be carefully avoid and particularly the too early or excessive exercise of the intellectual faculty if the child be endow with a precocious intellect the parent must restrain rather than encourage its exercise nothing be more likely to light up this disease in a constitution predispose to it than a premature exertion of the brain itself maternal management of the disease -- the early detection of this disease be of great importance the chance that the medical treatment will terminate successfully much depend upon the early and prompt application of remedial mean the reason why these case have so often terminate fatally have arise from the physician be consult when irremediable mischief have already take place it would be difficult however to point out the sign of its approach in all its form -lrb- for this disease do not always commence in the same way sometimes with fever etc -rrb- still it most frequently occur precede by certain striking and well-marked symptom and whenever the follow be notice by the parent apprehensive of mischief she should at once send for she medical adviser : -- watchfulness or start from sleep with a cry of alarm prolonged scream without any obvious cause moan and drowsiness roll the head from side to side on the nurse 's arm or thrust it back against the pillow knit the brow and aversion from light with heat of head and constant carry the little hand up to it half close the eyelid and frequent vomit the chief and principal point in the maternal management -lrb- for it include every other -rrb- be promptly and faithfully to administer the remedy prescribe by the medical attendant a vigilant maternal superintendence be more necessary in this than almost any other disease and it be highly desirable therefore that the mother should have a day and night nurse -- individual upon whom she can depend a careful notice of symptom and change in the patient in the interval of the medical man 's visit and a true and faithful report to he upon he return be of essential importance a sleepy nurse will neglect the application of the most important remedy and necessarily give a unfaithful report of symptom hour the most valuable to the child 's well-doing be thus lose and the chance of save its life worse than problematical the temperature of the room should be keep rather cool than warm and the bed-clothes only sufficient to preserve the natural heat of the body strong light must be exclude great quiet should be observe freedom from all excitement of the sens and irritation of the temper should be carefully avoid : this be particularly necessary where the child be naturally of a quick and sensitive disposition all the excretion must be put aside for the inspection of the physician but not keep in the sick chamber which must be well air and perfectly free from closeness the regimen must be only such as be order and any departure therefrom will be attend with mischievous consequence during the early period of the disease all that be require be cool diluent give frequently and in small quantity at a time and upon approach convalescence great carefulness must be pay to the amount of nourishment allow lest the disease be rekindle : strict compliance therefore to medical direction must be give a very useful and indeed powerful remedy prescribe in this disease be sometimes render utterly useless from a want of a persevere and also proper mode of apply it viz cold application to the head it be to be effect either by means of cloth keep constantly wet with cold water or evaporate lotion or by means of a bladder contain pound ice mix with water if the two former be employ they require frequent renewal or they become dry hot and more injurious than useful and whichever be use it must be keep in constant contact with the forehead temple and upper part of the head here be another error they be seldom use large enough and only partially cover these part with the further view of keep the head cool and prevent the accumulation of heat a flat horse-hair pillow should be employ and the head and shoulder somewhat raise perseverance in the measure prescribe even when the case appear beyond all hope must ever be the rule of conduct recovery even in the most advanced period of the disease in case apparently desperate occasionally take place there be great reason to fear that many a child have be lose from a want of proper energy and perseverance on the part of the attendant in the sick room they fancy the case be hopeless and to use they own expression they will not torment the child with medicine or remedy any longer whilst there be life there be hope be a sentiment which may with great truth be apply to all the disease of infancy and childhood striking indeed be the recovery which occasionally present themselves to the notice of medical man and those individual may with great justice be charge with unpardonable neglect who do not
