aeroplane boy flight or a hydroplane roundup chapter i the boy flier it be my mistake frank how do you make that out andy simply because i be use the little patent bird monkey-wrench last in we shop and should have put it back in the toolbox belong to the aeroplane the fact that it be not here show that i mislay it give I a bad mark frank well i must say it be a queer stunt for you to forget anything andy bird but with dark come along and home some mile away it be plain that we 'll have to let the mending of that wing go till morning but do you think frank it be just safe to leave we pet hydroplane over night in this field on the quackenboss farm why not andy sky as clear as a bell little or no wind promise and then we can hire the farm hand felix bogg to keep a eye on it look as easy as fall off a log and all because i do not put that little wrench where it belong kick I will not you please cousin i deserve it well i guess not do not i make just as bad a break last week i guess now no boy 's perfect and i do not mind the walk home a bit fact be it ought to do we both good because we do not stretch we leg enough as it be you be the boss chum frank then you be another see what you get for call I name but when you have fasten down that plane so it can not get into trouble if the wind should rise in the night perhaps we would better be hunting up this felix bogg and then start for home well i be glad we 'll get there in the night-time frank even if the moon do happen to be nearly full what make you say that andy because when a aviator leave he wounded machine in a field and walk home it make he feel like a dog with he tail between he leg sneak along back of the fence frank bird laugh merrily at the picture draw by he cousin and then stoop again with a few deft turn of a heavy cord help andy secure the broken plane so it would not get into trouble during the come night after which the two boy head toward the barn belong to the farm which just show they top above the adjacent rise while they be walk there it may be a good time for we to introduce the pair of young aviator to such reader as have not have the good fortune to meet they in previous volume of this series of story the cousin live in the town of bloomsbury a thrive place situate on the southern shore of sunrise lake which be a magnificent body of water say to be nearly seventeen mile long by three wide in place this lake have hilly shore that be heavily wood in spot and with numerous fine cove afford grand sport to the young people of bloomsbury both winter and summer the railroad skirt one shore and then pass through the town some mile off arise a lofty peak know as old thundertop which have a road run part way up its side the summit be believe to be utterly inaccessible to mortal man until one day the bird boy manage to accomplish the wonderful feat by the aid of they aeroplane they have be spend all they spare time when not in school work upon the line that seem to have a strange fascination for they frank 's father be one of the best know doctor in town a man of considerable means and with a firm faith in he boy so that he be easily convinced whenever frank wish to do anything andy have be live with he guardian for some time until the return of he own father professor bird who have be lose while attempt a difficult balloon trip in central america and find in a most miraculous way by the two boy as tell in a previous story andy have inherit the passion which he father a note professor have always have for navigate the air it be a favorite expression of he a bird by any other name would fly as high and he cousin would retort : a bird take to the air just as naturally as a duck do to water they have be do some fine stunt during the last year or two and it may be suppose that the people of bloomsbury be more than a little proud of see the name of they town mention so favorably in the papers in connection with the doings of the bird boy of course as be always the case there be a rival in the field who have be the cause of much trouble in the past and still watch they work with a envious eye this be a boy by the name of percy shelley carberry rather a bold fellow too and as smart as they make they only unscrupulous as to the means he employ by which to gain he end percy be the only son of a rich widow who could never refuse he anything he demand and with unlimited cash at he disposal he have be able to do quite a few feat himself that might have gain he more or less fame only that they be eclipse by the accomplishment of frank and andy and that be where the shoe pinch with percy he temper be one of he weak spot also a liking for fast life which of course include tippling and the aviator who indulge to the slightest degree in strong drink be next door to a fool for as he take he life in he hand every time he leave the ground the necessity for a clear brain be apparent in most of he tricky work young carberry have for a boon companion one sandy hollingshead a sinewy chap whose most prominent trait be he faculty for disappear suddenly in a pinch he be considerable of a boaster but could always invent a most remarkable excuse for go before the storm break but percy no coward himself know how to make use of he sly crony and despite they numerous quarrel that often end in actual fight the pair of precious trickster still keep company together sandy be freckle have pale eye and very blonde hair that give he a queer look those eye never could look any one straight in the face but shift uneasily and other boy say that sandy the cigarette smoker be always on the watch for a quick getaway the bird boy of course have many friend among the lad of bloomsbury but only two who be close enough to be admit freely to the workshop on the grounds of frank 's father 's place where the young inventor work out many of they lofty idea these be larry geohegan and a small runt who have be call elephant by he companion in a spirit of sport and could not shake the name he full name be fenimore cooper small and as a rule he have always be rather timid but elephant be always have queer idea in which he believe fully himself but which be nearly always jeer at by more practical larry the two bird boy have be out on this afternoon try some new arrangement in connection with they hydroplane when they meet with a accident when attempt to land on the quackenboss farm to make some change they see be need to improve the working of the machine neither of they have be even scratch but a certain amount of damage have befall one of the plane which might have be remedy on the spot in time to allow they to get back home easily only for the unfortunate fact that just when they need a monkey wrench the worst kind it be discover to be miss perhaps the only occasion when such a thing have happen with the boy i just see somebody go into the barn there remark frank as they approach the large outbuilding connect with the successful farm of josiah quackenboss yes and it be the farmer himself add andy i know he pretty well and i guess you do too because you father bring he little boy around when everybody think he do not have a single chance to get well i do not believe we 'll have any trouble get felix bogg to look after we machine tonight frank they quickly reach the door of the barn and could hear the steady fall of the stream of milk pass into the bucket as the farmer and he hire hand pursue the regular business of the evening as the two boy enter the half grown boy start up with a exclamation of alarm for of course both andy and frank look rather queer each of they have on a white woolen hood that fit close to head and shoulder for the air in the upper current be very cold these day and secure to this be goggles to protect the eye so that they would not water and dim the vision of the aviator at just a critical instant when they need clear sight then they also wear warm color mackinaw jacket so that altogether felix have reason to be startle when two such sight suddenly enter the barn why even the gentle cow show evidence of nervousness and come near upset the milk bucket hello mr quackenboss call out andy cheerfully we be the bird boy and we have drop in on you without a invitation the fact be we have a little trouble with we aeroplane and land in you field how much rent will you charge we mr quackenboss to let we machine lie there over night it need a little fix which we can not do until morning of course andy be joke when he say this and the farmer know it as well as anything he laugh as he come around out of the stall and offer he rough hand to each of the boy how be you andy and frank bird he say hearty say you do give we a little start when we first see you d'ye know what i think boy why i be just read in the county paper about how the bank up at jasper be rob by two man last week it tell how they have they face hide back of red handkerchief just like they always do out west you know and first thing i sighted you two my heart nigh about jump up in my mought because i think they yegg have drop around to see if i would collect my monthly milk account in town and about leavin ' you aeroplane in my field why there be little that i would not do for the son of the man who save my billie when everybody say he would never get well again we think you might let we show felix here where the aeroplane lie and that we could arrange with he to kind of keep a eye on it tonight of course there be not one chance in a thousand that anything would happen to injure it but then that machine represent a heap of hard work and considerable money besides so we do not care to take chance with it sure he can just as well as not eh felix suppose you go out right now and i 'll finish the milking in the morning i want to take a look at that contraption myself i have see you boy sail around more 'n a little but never get close up to examine the aeroplane well i guess all the money go could not tempt I to go with one of you skip along felix now and the farm hand a heavy-set boy eagerly fall in behind frank and andy as after thank mr quackenboss heartily for he kindness they pass out of the barn felix consider this a event in the tame routine of farm life and would be only too glad to stay up all night if necessary in order to guard the precious aeroplane once in the field the boy explain to felix what they want he to do and he promise not to meddle with anything connect with the engine or the aeroplane itself they be pass back again toward the barn have leave they prize possession in good shape when andy utter a sudden exclamation that tell of both surprise and disgust what be the matter now ask frank who have be talk with felix and be hence not so wide awake as he chum just take a look over there and see what be stop on the road remark andy seem to be a car and i can see two head raise above the top rail of the fence as if the people in it have sight we aeroplane sprawl out there in the field and be wonder what sort of giant insect it could be frank go on look closer frank the other boy go on to say while he disgust deepen and you 'll discover that the two fellow in that car happen to be percy carberry and he shadow sandy hollingshead do you ever hear of such tough luck of all the boy in bloomsbury they be the last we would want to know that we would leave we new hydroplane out unguarded all night in a open field guess i will not go home tonight frank i would rather camp out here with felix you let my folk know and turn up in the morning with a new piece for that plane that be settle and you can not change it chapter ii on guard perhaps i would better stay with you andy the other bird boy remark no need of it reply andy resolutely besides you know one of we ought to get busy in the shop make that new piece we really need so that we job will not have to be do over again you go frank perhaps mr quackenboss would let you have a horse or if you care to you give percy a hail and he would take you back to town i reckon goodness know he owe you a heap after the way you save he life the time he be wreck up on old thundertop what andy refer to be a very exciting event which have occur not so very long before and which be fully treat in the volume precede this frank shake he head in the negative i never want to ask any favor of percy carberry he say resolutely and if mr quackenboss can not let I have a horse to ride why the walking be good and i can make it in less than a hour so do not mention that again please andy it be too late now anyhow remark the other drily because there they go spin down the road like wildfire percy never do anything except in a whirl he be as bold as they make they and the only wonder to I be that he have not meet with a terrible accident before now but somehow he seem to escape even when he smash he flier to kindling wood he luck beat the dutch he believe in it himself you know but some day it be go to fail and then he 'll never what happen to he declare frank of all the profession in the world that of a fly machine man be the one where a cool head and quick judgment be the thing most need and the fellow who take great chance depend on he good luck be bind to meet up with trouble but if you be bind to stay andy i would better be off upon enter the barn they find that the farmer have finish he task and be pitch some new sweet hay to the cow frank suggest hire a horse from he but mr quackenboss scoff at the idea you be as welcome to the use of my saddle hoss as the sunlight be after a spell of rain he say heartily here felix get bob out and you 'll find my new saddle hang on that peg back of the harness room door and as for andy who be go to stay over with we we 'll find a chair for he at the supper table and only hope hell tell we some of the many thing you two have go through with both around this region and away down in south america that time you find the lose professor inside of five minute frank be in the saddle and wave he hand to he chum and cousin of whom he be more fond than if andy have be he own brother he would be back tonight with the part we need and we could make home in the moonlight say andy as with the farmer he head for the house only both of we have promise we folk not to travel at night-time when it can be help even if the moon be bright there be always a risk about landing because it be a tricky light at the best and even a little mistake may wreck thing and so frank will work in the shop tonight and be along in the morning once in the farmhouse andy be give a chance to wash up and then meet the housewife as well as little billie the small chap whose life good doctor bird have save mr quackenboss prove to be a very warm-hearted woman and any one who answer to the name of bird could have the very best that the place afford there be never a night that she do not call down the blessing of heaven upon the physician who have be instrumental in prevent she darling billie from be take away the table be fairly groan under the weight of good thing to eat for when company come the average farmer 's wife never know when to stop bring out the most appetizing thing to eat ever see perhaps i be the luckiest fellow go to be able to stay over-night with you mrs quackenboss laugh andy as he sit down to the generous spread well you know we never like anybody to get up from we table hungry she explain the chance be that i will not be able to get up at all for if i try to taste half i see here i 'll be founder as sure as anything andy go on to say the farmer be not go to allow much time to pass talk about common every-day topic those might do all very well when he have ordinary guest but when fortune send he one of the now famous bird boy for company he want to listen to some thrilling account of adventure that have come the way of the young and daring aviator from the time they build they first aeroplane after purchase most of the part and find that they have a immediate rival in percy carberry andy be willing to oblige and keep those at the table include the farm hand felix bogg thrill with he story but the farmer could not help but notice how modest the boy be give most of the credit to he cousin frank when everybody about bloomsbury know that andy deserve just as much credit if not more than the other bird boy after supper andy and felix prepare to go out to where the hydroplane lay they mean to take blanket along and make themselves as comfortable as possible for a night 's vigil andy would not have dream of do this only for the fact that he know percy and he shadow sandy be aware of the plight of the precious flier and while frank be incline to partly believe that the carberry boy might let up in he mischief-making way for awhile at least after all they have do for he up on old thundertop andy could not bring himself to trust the other further than he could see he he believe that the nature of percy be so rotten as he call it that give a chance to injure he successful rival he would shut he eye to all sense of gratitude and just lie awake night try to get the better of they by fair means or foul andy also know that the other be particularly chagrin because he do not know what manner of a new flier the bird boy have in hand now he have resort to various expedient in order to find out but all without success on this account if no other then andy believe that the other would be apt to come out here during the night to examine the hydroplane with the aluminum pontoon under its body for float on the water and perhaps to slily injure it in such a fashion that it would break down when next frank and andy mount into the air it happen that they have alight close to one corner of the big field though in plain view from the pike andy have note a clump of tree conveniently near and already he mind be make up that he and felix would camp there to pass the night in alternately keep watch and ward over the precious aeroplane that lay there like a wounded bird felix be quiver with eagerness this be like a picnic in the humdrum life of the farm hand except when the circus come to town or there be a harvest home day poor felix know little beyond the eternal grind of get up before dawn and work until long after sunset first of all andy walk around the stranded aeroplane and take occasion to explain how it work use as simple language as he could find because felix be not at all up in professional term and would not have understand have the other speak as he might have do when talk with a fellow aviator then they seek the tree and spread they heavy blanket so as to make as comfortable a seat as possible start to talk in low tone the bright moon hang there in the sky and it seem as though every foot of the big meadow could be scrutinize just as well as in the daytime but andy know from experience how deceptive moonlight can be and how cautious one have to be when try any difficult feat at such a time i have hear people talk about reading by moonlight and how they could tell a friend half a mile away he remark to felix but let I say that it be all a humbug there never be a brighter night than this i reckon you 'll agree with I felix and yet look at that stump not a stone 's throw away you could not say now whether it be a cow lie down a horse a rock or a stump which last i take the thing to be be i right about that why sure 's i live that ere be a fact andy reply the other but i never would a think it moonlight fool a feller the worst kind i throw a stone at a whippoor-will as be perch on the roof a-keepin ' we all awake night and would yuh believe I she go right through the winder of the attic kersmash never be more surprised in my life and you do not ketch I heavin ' stone by moonlight agin from one subject they drift to another andy even tell more or less about how percy carberry have hate and envy they in the past and how often he have try to do they a serious injury frank seem to think he will give up that mean sort of play because we really save he life that time we have we race to the rock on the summit of old thundertop and he aeroplane be smash there so one of we have to carry percy and sandy home bruise as they be but i do not because i know it would take more than that to change the spot of a fellow of he kind and chance be felix we 'll find those two boy sneak up here before the middle of the night wish ' t they would chuckle the farm hand you be ready to give 'em a warm time of it i guess andy be as good as any old circus to I just to see how they jump when you open up let 'em come say i the sooner the better too long they lay there and talk in low tone felix want to make the best of this glorious chance a new world seem to open up to the farm hand as he hear of the wonderful thing the bird boy have see and take part in perhaps ambition be begin to awaken in the boy 's soul and he might not after this be so satisfied to plod along in the same old rut every day of the year perhaps the seed thus sown might take root and bring he either great good or harm as the tide of fortune choose we hear as how a feller be up there to watch you boy fly not a great while ago andy he go on to say a ' he be so take by the way you manage thing that he want to get you to go in with a big concern run by a boss airman but you just up and tell he you could not do that same be that so why yes you must mean mr marsh return the other modestly i believe he do read some account of we that get into the papers and be send up here to look we up he be kind enough to compliment frank on the way he make that corkscrew climb and also on he volplane drop say we have both of they down pretty fine and he do hint at we have a chance to go in with he company but of course we could not think of that we be too young to dream of be professional flier yet and besides we have get to go to school again pretty soon so we turn the offer down but mr marsh be mighty kind and we like he a heap hear how he be watch you fly when that little chap belong to cragan the fisherman get overboard out in the lake and this same gent he see frank dive right off he aeroplane like a bullfrog and save little tommy that jest take he by storm he tell mr quackenboss and he mean to get you boy for he company if money could do it but it all end in smoke do not it it be almost half past nine before andy decide that the time have come for they to shut up shop and do no more talking i be go to take the first watch myself felix and i promise to wake you up when i get to gaping whether it be midnight or two in the morning he say as he settle himself more comfortably on he blanket and pull it up over he shoulder because the night air be already quite chilly and would undoubtedly be much more so ere long but chance air andy they be a-goin ' to come inside a hour or so and you must promise to give I a kick if so be i be sleepin ' then you will will not you sure reply the bird boy after you be so kind as to keep I company i would never think of make a move and you asleep so just settle down and do not get excite if you feel I push my toe into you rib later on felix be tire from he day 's work he have probably be constantly busy since four the morning before it be therefore a fight between weary muscle and brain and the desire to stay awake in order to see all that go on this last for perhaps ten minute then andy know that nature have win out for he could catch the regular breathing of the stout farmhand and from this judge that felix must be sound asleep from where andy sit he have a fine view of the field on all side of the broken hydroplane and especially in that quarter toward the fence beyond which the road lead to bloomsbury lay he keep up a constant watch never relax he vigilance for a single second for andy know that while one might be on guard for fifty-nine minute if he relax just for a breath that be almost sure to be the time when something would happen how often he have prove that when fishing and take he eye from he float just to glance up at some pass bird when down it would bob and he have miss a chance to hook a finny prize the time pass on three separate time do andy look at he little dollar nickel watch and in the bright moonlight he could see that it be now after eleven he be begin to believe that if there be anything do that night it must come about very soon when he think he hear a sound down the road that make he think a car that have be come along have stop short thrill with the expectation that a change be about to occur he sit up a little more eagerly and continue to scan the line of fence as well as the field lie between the road and the helpless hydroplane chapter iii not catch nap five ten minute pass andy be begin to fear that after all he have be mistaken and that it have be some other sound he have hear when he think a car have stop down the road toward bloomsbury then all at once he detect a movement over at the fence and the figure of a man or boy be see to quickly clamber over drop in the field even as he look a second follow suit then a third and even a fourth whew what be all this mean andy whisper to himself as he take notice of the fact that there be quite a procession of fellow change base from the road to the field : percy and sandy thought they might need help in they little game of smash we machine or carry it off somewhere so as to give we a bad scare and i reckon they have pick up a couple more of the same kind as themselves well we ought to be able to take care of four just as easy as two 5 and the howl will be all the louder i guess he move over a little and with the toe of he shoe nudge felix under the rib quit shovin ' there mutter the farm hand possibly think he be in bed with some other boy luckily the night breeze be make the windmill turn not very far away and as it need oil there be a constant succession of squeak and groan so that the chance of felix be hear when he speak in this way be very small andy would not take any further risk but creep over shake the boy roughly wake up felix they be come across the pasture he whisper in he ear that be quite enough for felix he seem to grasp the situation at once and only mutter the one significant word gosh he immediately sit up andy move as little as possible pointed to where move figure could just be detect advance in a bent-over attitude how many whisper the farm hand i count four reply the other whee bully for that chuckle felix no doubt tickle because the promise circus would be a double-ring affair instead of the ordinary kind and therefore quite up to date both of they lay there watch intently they could see how the intruder be crawl along anxious apparently only to avoid be see from the direction of the farmhouse the roof of which show dimly in the moonlight over on the other side of the little ridge as the creeper draw closer the watcher see that they have adopt the method speak of by the farmer in connection with the bank thief keep they identity secret -- they all seem to have handkerchief tie across they face and keep they hat pull well down so that they could easily have pass close to a acquaintance without much risk of discovery of course andy could tell that they be boy and not man and it be a easy task for he to guess who two of the party at least must be the preparation he and felix have make be about as simple as anything could be the farm hand possess a old musket that have be use in the civil war and which muzzleloader that it be have probably bring down many a plump rabbit when hold in the hand of the owner as well as black duck in the marsh along the shore of lake sunrise besides this the farmer have loan andy he double-barrel marlin shotgun a old model when compare with the up-to-date hammerless and the repeater but no doubt a good serviceable weapon of course they have no idea of try to pepper the marauder though it would seem as though they richly deserve to be puncture with a few small bird shot because of the meanness of they contemplated action to give they a good fright would satisfy andy and he have make the eager farm hand promise to fire up in the air also because he be afraid lest felix allow he indignation to have full swing when he see what the four boy mean to do they be skulk very close to where the aeroplane lay now and the critical moment have undoubtedly arrive when the surprise must be launch ready felix he whisper in the softest of tone yep grunt the farm hand at he elbow one two three blaze away with the last word felix let go with he old musket into which he must have ram a tremendous charge for it make a report like unto the crash of thunder and come very near send the owner flat on he back immediately on the heel of this boom andy pull one of the trigger of he double-barrel so that the report seem almost merge in with that of the other weapon the four boy have jump to they foot at the flash and report which startle they when felix fire and as they turn to dash wildly away and that second shot come they become madly excite evidently under the full belief that they be be make target for a whole battalion of sharpshooter two of they collide and roll over on the grass kick wildly and scramble to they foot again to resume they flight toward the fence which doubtless seem three time as distant as when they be creep toward the stranded aeroplane the whole thing be so ridiculous that andy burst out laughing and could hardly hold he gun see which the farm hand make bold to snatch it out of he hand and aim directly at the place where the fugitive be just then in the act of mount the fence in they panicky flight he pull the trigger there be a series of loud yell which would seem to indicate that a few of the small shot contain in the shell with which the marlin have be load must have reach they mark and prick the boy like so many needle would have do that be the last see of they though for a short time they could be hear run along the hard road and exchange excited comment possibly compare they injury then a car be hear to start off with a great deal of bluster and come dash along past the farmhouse though those in it bent low enough to keep any one from discover who they might be andy do not know whether to be a little angry or not because of what the impetuous felix have do but apparently nobody have be seriously hurt and on the whole the four sneak as felix call they deserve some punishment so he let it go at that there be no further alarm that night neither of the guardian of the hydroplane expect any after the prompt measure that have be take to inform meddler of the warm reception they might expect all the same andy keep up he vigil until sleep almost overpower he when he arouse felix to finish out the night with the come of early dawn he know that the safety of the imperil aeroplane be assure and that when the horn blow he and felix could both go in to breakfast indeed he release the farm hand long before that time so that he might go about he usual early morning chore and andy himself find plenty to do around the machine until summon to the morning meal the farmer be a hard sleeper and have not hear a single thing that have take place so that he be surprise when tell how the enemy have come after all and what measure the boy have take in order to frighten they away he even tell felix he could have a day off as soon as the last load of hay be in the barn just to show how he appreciate the bold way in which he hire help have tickle the rascal when they be get over the fence indeed the farmer say andy have be too lenient and that if it have be he aeroplane that be threaten in that mean way he would have feel wholly justified in empty both barrel of the gun after the marauder first give they time to get a certain distance off so that no serious result might follow the discharge but andy be never a vindictive lad and he believe the fellow have receive sufficient punishment especially as no one know exactly what they have mean to do in connection with the new hydroplane possibly percy only want to look it over at close quarter and know he would not be allow to do so if he ask permission outright seek to take this opportunity but from the way in which they have rig themselves out so as to avoid be recognize if see it look as though the four boy have something more than that in view however all 's well that end well and andy be quite satisfied with the way thing have turn out here 's hopin ' a few of 'em may be limpin ' ` round this same mornin ' and feelin ' rayther stiff in the leg felix take occasion to remark as they sit at table and andy be again in danger of be founder by the multitude of good thing which the farmer 's wife spread thereon bacon and egg fry potato scrapple puffy biscuit apple sauce doughnut cold pie jelly and finally heap dish of light pancake which be to be smother in butter and real maple syrup make on the farm each early spring when the sap be run i expect frank will be along any minute now andy remark about the time he have to firmly refuse a fourth help of cake because he could hardly breathe comfortably it would not take he long to do what little work be necessary in we shop which you know my old guardian colonel whymper build for we before we find my father when he be maroon in that valley in south america a prisoner for many month because the cliff around prevent he from escape and of course he 'll gallop out here on you saddle horse mr quackenboss well work be not get any call on either felix or I until we see all that go on that be flat remark the farmer with a smile and it be lucky he do the milkin ' already or else the cow would have to wait long after they usual hour which be a bad way to treat 'em you know they all go out to the field even the housewife and little billie want to see what a real aeroplane look like at close quarter many time have all of they see the bird boy and perhaps percy carberry as well soar aloft as if the upper air current might be they natural heritage but up to now they have never have the chance to examine one of the wonderful machine and touch the various part gingerly as though afraid of injure they beat all what people be a-doing nowadays venture the farmer shake he head with astonishment almost awe as he look the thing over they be not even contented to just fly like a red-tailed hawk or a eagle that kin look the sun direct in the eye but now they get to have a contraption that be at home in the air or on the water a hydroplane you call it do not you andy and they ere twin pontoon underneath that look kinder like gondola as you say be make of aluminum and kin hold up the whole affair when you light on water but tell I how in all creation kin you ever mount up agin once you settle there why that be the easiest thing of all reply the young aviator you have watch a wild duck get up many a time have not you mr quackenboss well we do just the same only instead of flap we wing we start the engine and skim along the surface for a little distance then elevate the plane and immediately begin to soar upward and it do the stunt as gracefully as anything you ever see some time i hope to give you a chance to see how it work when we leave here of course we 'll use the bicycle wheel you see underneath and run along the ground until go fast enough to soar but i think i see frank come away down the road there that be right declare the farmer i know my bob as far as i can see he and he gallop in the bargain frank be evidently come at full speed and andy presently get the idea in he head that he cousin seem to be strangely in a hurry for he he wonder whether anything could have happen at home and if frank would prove to be the bearer of bad news the other dash into the narrow road lead from the pike to the barn of the quackenboss farm hitch the horse to a post he start toward the spot in the big field where the two boy and the farmer await he come close beside the stranded aeroplane frank be carry the little part he have expect to knock together at the workshop but as he draw nearer he chum could readily see that he be considerably excite be everything all right here andy he call out even before reach they yes reply the other bird boy promptly though we do have a call from four fellow who have they face hide behind handkerchief but we fire we gun in the air and nearly frighten they to death felix grab the double-barrel i have and give they a last shot when they be climb the fence over there and we hear some howl too so i guess a few of the number eight shot pink they but what make you look so bother frank have anything happen at home there sure have come from frank as he join they and cast a pleased glance over the fly machine that lay upon the grass like a huge bat with wing extend tell I what it be demand andy breathlessly somebody break into we hangar and workshop and knock thing around at a great rate frank go on to say act like they might be just mad because they do not find we new machine there and want to show they spite and nobody in you house know a thing about it till i come along after a early breakfast mean to get the piece i would be work on up to eleven last night when i go home to sleep and lock up the place as usual that be a queer piece of news you be tell I frank say the other look puzzle as well he might chapter iv the startling news well say frank with a frown on he face it be puzzle I a whole lot let I tell you andy because of course my first thought be that it must have be percy carberry 's work but now that you tell I he be here and know we have not fetch we hydroplane home i hardly know what to think do you say you work till about eleven at the shop ask andy quickly three minute after when i quit lock up and go home frank reply that be just about the time they show up here the other go on to say unless one of we be wrong about the time they could not well be in two place at the same minute now could they seem like it might have be some other crowd that break into we hangar frank but why do they want to play fast and loose with we machine and force a entrance just for that purpose listen to something i be go to tell you andy i find several thing on we work bench where somebody have leave they without mean to do it i guess here be one frank while say this hold something up which he have take from the package he carry under he arm why that be a splendid electric torch look like to I exclaim andy just what it be now the other agreed and it be forget in we shop be it demand andy i make out that whoever enter use this first and then light we lamp to look around with put out the torch and lay it down when they skip out why they just forget all about it also these again do frank make a dive into he pocket and dangle something before the astonished eye of he cousin great caesar what d'ye call those thing gasp andy stare as though hardly able to believe he eye well as near as i can make out they be a couple of half mask make out of black muslin and just like a domino wear at a masquerade ball frank remark with positive conviction in he voice and manner mask echo the other and the fellow who break open we shop wear they do they well the crowd that come out here seem to be satisfy to tie handkerchief across they face and pull they hat down i do not know that they wear they frank go on but they have the thing along and lay they down with the lantern forget the whole lot when they clear out perhaps you dog get to bark and frighten they off before they find a chance to do much damage a regular bullseye electric torch and black mask like cracksman use -- say tell I frank what be come over we quiet country up here lately there be the affair over in a neighboring town when yeggman break into the bank and rob it and now here you tell I we have have a little smash-up on we own account with the burglar leave card behind they but what d'ye think now anybody would want to go poke around in we shop for frank he cousin be look very grave well you forget that we have be work overtime this winter on several little invention that if we ever complete they will make a stir in the world of aviation jupiter i have let that slip away from I for a fact frank exclaimed the other look rather startle of course it sound pretty big for we to even imagine that any party could take enough interest in what the bird boy be do to come up here intend to break into the shop and learn we secret but what else can we think tell I that andy but they would not find out much even if they have six hour to poke around we shop in would they frank i guess you be right because we have make it a rule to be cautious enough to hide we work and cover we track as we go along but let 's get busy now and put the plane into shape so we can slip along home and as we work we can keep on talk as much as we want to frank go on to say the farmer and felix still loiter around determine to see the wonderful contrivance make a start and expect the greatest treat of they life when that event occur such experienced worker as the two bird boy have now become would find little or no trouble about carry out the work they have on hand every steel wire guy be keep as taut as a fiddle string and by the time they be do handle the aeroplane it would be in apple-pie shape for work do they smash much in the shop frank andy ask after they have be work some little time and make fair progress why no it do not seem to I that they take the time to do great damage and that be why i fancy they be scare off somehow or other they go in a hurry or else they would never have forget those thing and when i look around i make up my mind that they be just mad because they do not find we machine at home and so try to let we know that fact perhaps it be a second detachment of the same crowd that come out here suggest andy speculatively tell I what would they be do with electric torch and black mask now you can see that these have be pretty well use they be not new one just cut out by pattern at home with mother 's scissors these have be make by a experienced operator and be buy either for a mask ball or some other purpose well perhaps we 'll never know the truth about it grumble andy who never like anything to puzzle he and would lie awake half the night try to find the answer to a conundrum that have be offer to he by a boy friend oh yes i have get a hunch that we will chirp he cousin with a sublime confidence that quite win andy 's heart if he could not see any good reason for hope himself the fact that he chum pin he faith on it be enough to bolster up he own courage meanwhile they be both as busy as bee and the work be approach completion what be you look up every little while that way for frank ask after notice that andy cock he eye upward several time and appear to be scan the heaven in a expectant manner the day be all right so far as wind go and we ought to get along home without a bit of trouble oh i be not bother my head about that part of it the other reply with a scornful smile we have be out in all sort of weather and now that we have a chance to try this new invention of the wright ' that make it next to impossible to tilt a aeroplane over no matter how you move around when up in the air we can feel safer than ever even a fool would be keep from meeting with a accident when protect by that wonderful balancing bar that respond to the slightest movement of the human body then it be something else you have on you mind be it andy well i be wonder just what take percy and sandy out at daybreak this morning that be all reply the other what be that do you see they pass over in they biplane this morning demand the other felix wake I up at dawn to tell I there be a queer chug overhead that sort of scared he i jump up because of course i know what that must mean and sure enough i be just in time to see a biplane pass over at a good height and head up the lake i lose it back of the barn because a flock of crow come fly along stretch out for a mile or two and among the lot i could not make out just what be biplane and which be crow it be pretty high up too i thought but you make sure it be percy 's biplane ask frank interested somewhat for somehow the other rival flier be always do such bold stunt that he could not help feeling as though it might pay to keep track of what he be do lest they interest clash unexpectedly in midair perhaps i ought to know the way it glide and the whole general look and i would be willing to take my affidavy that be the canvas-back as he call he biplane and he be in it of course with sandy too frank go on i could just make out that there be two aboard say andy but somehow it seem to I that percy have alter he whole way of pilot he airship or else he be drunk and hardly know what he be do frank whistle to indicate he surprise and consternation : when it get as rough as that you can take it from I that percy 's mother will hear something simply awful about he before long he be bind to go from bad to worse and everybody know what the end of such a aviator be go to be but what under the sun could he be off at daylight this morning for andy go on to remark as though that thing have be bother he ever since the moment he lose track of the biplane among the teeter cawing crow frank shrug he shoulder as he reply : do you ever know any reason for half the thing percy do he just act from a sudden impulse remember all that happen when he follow we down there to columbium in south america and try to give we all the trouble he could make up and there have be lot of other time too we can look back at all of which prove what i be say that he be often like a ship without a rudder now perhaps he be get the crazy notion in he head that we might prosecute he either for what he try to do up here to we hydroplane or on account of break into we hangar and do a certain amount of damage if the vandal be percy carberry that sound a little reasonable anyhow frank queer that i never seem to get hold of these thing and they just float along as easy as anything to you but it look as if we have she all prime up now as steady as a church how about it frank for answer the other touch several taut wire guy with a peculiar little movement of finger and thumb and each one respond with a musical note that be the sweetest possible sound in the responsive ear of the young aviator all do and let 's be off he say presently after the last test have be apply accordingly they shake hand with farmer quackenboss he good wife and felix in the palm of which latter andy make sure to leave a greenback that make the boy grin broadly three minute later frank sing out the word and both the farmer and felix run along with the machine for a dozen pace or so when it leave they behind take on speed and finally rush over the ground at a tremendous pace uptilt the plane cause it to leave the ground and start to curve gracefully upward as the whiz propeller do its noisy duty they could hear the farmer and he hire hand shout themselves hoarse with delight at have actually witness the start of a modern aeroplane but naturally the sound grow fainter and fainter in they ear as they leave the field and the squatty farmhouse far behind have arise to the height of several hundred foot frank head toward bloomsbury like a true and alert pilot he be watch and listen to ascertain how they recent work hold and presently a satisfied expression cross he face announce that he find he faith well justified they have skim along for perhaps a mile or more when andy make a certain discovery that cause he to call out look along the road below and ahead frank he say and you 'll see something that make you think of old time when we hunt in company with chief waller for those man who loot leffingwell 's jewelry establishment why as sure as you be bear andy it do look like the chief and he be sit in a vehicle wave he hat he seem to be look up at we and now that i have turn off the motor to glide a little i can hear he shout frank do you think he be just salute we or do he want we to come down demand andy in some apprehension now he be make all sort of gesture and honestly i think he mean that he want to see we have we better drop in that open field just alongside the road look good to I for a rise when we want to start again whatever you think best frank i be always willing to be guide by you mighty seldom you make a bad mess of it while i often do yes let 's drop down and if the field turn out to be pretty smooth we 'll land accordingly the hydroplane which be of course now in a condition for make a landing with the wheel below the aluminum pontoon circle around drop lower and lower until presently it come to a stop in the field close to the fence when it land it be do so beautifully that as andy enthusiastically say a egg would hardly have break have it come between and there not more than twenty foot away the man dress in a blue uniform and wear a silver shield with the word chief of police engrave upon it be soothing he horse which have apparently be badly frighten by the swoop down of what seem to be a great roc or some other species of now extinct gigantic king of the air what be up chief ask frank as soon as they have reach the road together then you have not hear the terrible news they tell I you leave home to come up here about daybreak and we do not find it out until a hour ago the bank in bloomsbury be break open last night the safe rifled and the thief have disappear in the queerest way ever hear of for they leave no trace behind and when i see you boy aloft i be in hope you might have see something of the bank looter chapter v the excitement grow well what d'ye think of that for news eh frank burst out andy in he usual impetuous way after the bloomsbury chief of police have make this startling announcement frank be as a rule much cooler than he cousin he have undoubtedly be equally astounded to hear of the terrible calamity that have befall the banking institution in which most of the lead citizen of the town be financially interested but he certainly do not show it the same way he eyebrow go up to indicate astonishment and a slight frown settle on he grave face as he reply to andy 's question it be a stunner just as you say andy but i wish the chief would tell we a few more detail i think it be a little queer nobody seem to have any suspicion of this awful business at the time i leave home on horseback to ride up to the quackenboss farm where you have be watch we injured aeroplane all night well continue the head of the bloomsbury police force that be because the yegg work so neatly they never leave a bit of mess around to arouse suspicion and the first thing that be know of the looting of the bank be when seth jarvie the day watchman go into the place at seven this morning to relieve cadger the night man and find he lie there tie up like a bundle of goods and nearly dead with fright and humiliation whew be the way andy relieve he pent-up feeling at this point while he cousin go on ask question then cadger must have see the robber if they capture he how about that chief he demand eagerly for the excitement be begin to take hold of he that be right he do and be able to give we more or less information the police officer continue of course as soon as jarvie see what have happen he know it be a case for I to handle and so he run across to headquarters and in a jiffy we have throw a cordon of police around the building to keep out the curious citizen who would have no business inside and spoil any trace of the rascal and would you mind tell we what cadger have to tell chief ask frank not at all because i be depend on you boy to help run the thief down if you feel like give the authority any assistance the other reply craftily frank 's answer be immediate and to the point of course we 'll do anything that be in we power chief both we father be interested in that bank and besides the good name of the town must suffer if it be wreck by a wander band of yeggman and we can understand why you should want to capture the thief chief because that be a part of you business please tell we what the bank watchman have to say then i will and without any frill if i can make it that way return the other earnestly cadger say he be catch nap not that he be asleep but never dream of any danger he step over to the door when he hear a knock and a voice say : ` it be I cadger mr hedden the cashier i forget some important papers and have get out of bed to come back for they let I in without attract any attention if you can ' what do you think of the smartness of that exclaim andy and so of course poor old cadger who be as honest as the day be long never suspect any trick but go and open the door a crack just what he do return the chief and as that side of the bank be in the shadow he could only see the figure of a man who slip in alongside he before he know what be happen he be be chock by a pair of strong hand cadger start to struggle but another man must have join the first for he be knock unconscious by a cruel blow that be leave he face all bloody and after that he do not know a thing for a hour or two whee you have get I all work up with you story chief say andy again i can just seem to see the whole thing happen and chance be that when cadger do come to he find himself tie up and unable to even whisper he have hard work to get enough breath they have fasten the bandage across he mouth so tight but he could see out of one eye and lie there cadger watch the two yegg go through the whole operation of get nitroglycerine plant and use all sort of clothes and even the rug off the floor of the president 's room to deaden the sound of the explosion they be old hand at the business that be sure remark frank when the officer pause to catch he breath for he be talk unusually fast in he desire to give they all the particulars in as brief a space of time as possible yes there can be no doubt of that the chief go on to say wag he head wisely and they have be able in some way to get on to a lot of thing that make we wonder like the name of the cashier and the night-watchman look mighty much like they must have have a friend around bloomsbury who put they wise to those fact then they seem to have the running of the train down pat also for long after they have they arrangement make they just sit down and wait until the freight go north and pass bloomsbury at two-eighteen be pound up-grade from deering 's cross and make all manner of noise oh to think of the smartness of that would you burst out andy i be wonder how they could blow open the safe and the sound of the explosion never even be hear over at headquarters only half a block away but now i see how it could be do just like a fellow say he can pull a hair out of you head and you not feel it and he make out to give you a thump on the head with he other hand at the same time so of course you never notice he pull the hair just about on the same principle say the officer nod for when that heavy freight go pound past the station it make enough noise to drown almost any sort of sound the window rattle and we always have to stop talk until the caboose get past and that be the time they choose to explode they juice with a absolute certainty that no policeman 's ear would hear a single thing and cadger see it all do he ask practical frank a good lot of it by twist he head from time to time reply chief waller and after the thing have be successfully do he could watch the two thief gather the swag together and put it in a satchel they find in the cashier 's room then just at a quarter to three they douse the glim which be only a electric torch one of they carry and skip out lock the door on poor cadger it be hour afterwards when the day watchman come on duty and the discovery follow frank and andy have somehow turn and exchange a significant look about this time and the expression of astonishment on the face of the latter deepen do you say a electric torch chief demand frank immediately yes one of the handy kind that be use so commonly now the other reply tell we do cadger say anything about the thief wear mask over they face or do they use handkerchief to hide they from he i do not mention that matter but it be just as you say frank both man have on mask all the time answer the police officer black one too i expect venture andy that be what they be but see here be you two just guess this or do you happen to know something about those man ask the other quickly for he could not help see from the manner of the bird boy that they be on some sort of a scent and he know from past experience that they sagacity could always be trust to do the right thing well frank go on to say drily while andy be watch we new hydroplane out in the quackenboss pasture i work until eleven o'clock in we shop and then go home this morning early after a bite to eat i hurry over there to do some finishing touch and carry the thing out to apply to we broken plane when to my astonishment i find that the shop have be break into later in the night as well as we hangar where the aeroplane be usually keep and here be what i discover lie on the work-bench where the man have forget they with these word he hold up the flashlight torch and the twin black mask and they produce a immediate shock upon the chief of police and you find those thing in you workshop this morning you say he cry reach out to take hold of the torch and the bit of black muslin yes and whoever be there they must have be mad because they do not find the aeroplane for they smash a few thing just for spite it look like be what frank add then if it be the same man who rob the bank they must have know about you boy have a brand new machine and say that must mean one of the robber be something of a birdman himself because no greenhorn would ever think of make he getaway in a aeroplane do not you see that be a pretty good clue frank i 'll remember that when i be get in touch with other point and find out if there be any aviator who be go crooked of late yes that be worth know now and i be glad you mention it to I what description do cadger give of the man chief query frank oh he say one be tall and thin and the other short and wiry like pretty much like a cat i rather reckon he would be the fellow who be be in the fly business seem to have a stiff left arm too like he would meet up with some sort of a accident that might turn out to be a pointer i 'll just remember it it surely be a lucky thing for I i see you boy come sailing along and manage to attract you attention i begin to feel better already you give I so much help on that other occasion it just seem as if i have to fall back on you again better move you horse out of the way chief because there come a car at a licketty-split racing speed wonder what the fellow in it be think about to take such chance why hello look there frank perhaps you know the one who be at the wheel seem to I i have see he before and that he name be percy carberry it be percy say frank and alongside he who would you expect to see but he shadow sandy hollingshead and they look some excited too as though they would hear about the robbery and the carberry family be threaten with bankruptcy if the missing fund be not recover right away there he see we and be pull up i reckon he be look for you chief the car that have be tear along the pike come to a stop close to where the head of the bloomsbury police force sit in he buggy percy carberry get out and andy could not but notice that he be not display he accustomed agility on this fine morning indeed he make a face as though it give he a stab of pain every time he take a step hello chief waller remark percy in he customary patronize way ignore the presence of the bird boy completely and purposely of course i have come out after you to get you assistance in try to find the rascal who break into my hangar some time last night and run away with my biplane upon hear these astonishing word it be little wonder that andy and frank once more look at each other with the light of understand dawn on they face chapter vi figure it all out that be a strange story you be tell we percy say the head of the local police force at which the boy bridle up immediately i do not see what there be so funny about it chief he exclaim frown i tell you my hangar be break open last night and i be out a biplane that cost I a good round sum it be up to you to get on the track of the same and recover it i hereby offer a reward of three hundred dollar for the recovery of my machine uninjured and make it five hundred if the thief be capture in the bargain when he say this percy assume all the air of a millionaire but then it be well know about bloomsbury that the widow carberry be very wealthy also that she only hopeful could wheedle she in to settle any sort of a bill he choose to contract so that the mention of the sum of five hundred dollar be not anything extravagant for percy oh it be not that i doubt you word at all percy do not think that chief waller hasten to say for like most man he be ready to bow down in front of the golden calf and more than once mr carberry have be very generous to the force -- when she house take fire and come near burning but be save thanks to the energetic work of police and fire department and again when a hire man try to carry off some of she jewelry but have be easily catch and the plunder restore then what make you act like that i would like to know demand percy look very much put out as though he do not like to be treat with suspicion especially when he old-time rival the bird boy be around why the officer go on to say when you say that about you aeroplane be take it strike I all in a heap because frank here be just tell I that two man break into he shop last night after eleven and knock thing around just because they fail to find he hydroplane in its bunk as usual they want that machine and want it so bad that as a last resort they go over to you place and confiscate you biplane it be percy 's turn now to look astonished he even condescend to notice the presence of the two bird boy and survey they with interest be that a fact frank do somebody break into you place last night i remember now that i do see you potter about you craft up there somewhere about the quackenboss place but i would forget it till the chief mention that you do not have it in the hangar that be the time you be lucky see what i get for have mine at home all snug and nice it be be hooked clear as anything and not a trace to tell who do the business hold on there percy say the chief with a broad smile perhaps it be not such a deep mystery after all tell I what you mean when you say that demand the boy loftily as though he resent the fact that anything should be keep from he a single second why frank and andy find these thing in they shop leave by the two man who try to get they hydroplane and the chance be ten to one the same party go right straight over to you place and get yours as a second choice i do not like the way you speak of my biplane chief which cost ever so much more money than the contraption the bird boy own percy remark sneeringly but never mind tell I what these thing stand for a electric torch and -- why those thing look like black mask great caesar and the bloomsbury bank be rob last night they tell I when i be rush around look for you see here do you think the yegg who do that neat job get away with my biplane percy be get more excited than ever now when he do he seem to just foam a little at the corner of he mouth he eye glitter and he face turn red there seem to be no doubt of it reply the chief calmly and yet with a stiffening of he figure as though conscious of have already discover a most promising clue that could not but reflect credit on he astuteness as a officer of the law they know all about frank 's machine and mine too then continue percy still grapple with the tremendous problem look that way the official go on to remark and make I think more than ever that they must have a friend right here in bloomsbury who put they wise to lot of thing time 'll tell that but i do not suppose you find anything around you place like frank do to tell that some stranger have be there while you sleep not a bless thing though to tell the honest truth i do not hang around long when i find my biplane be go it be the best machine i ever own and as you know i have have several all tell and inside of three day i expect that the latest model of aluminum pontoon would be along to turn it into a water as well as a air craft now chance be i 'll never see it again because like as not nobody know which way in creation they go we happen to have a pointer about that same thing andy could not help say though he hardly like the superior air of the other not be able to overlook such thing as easily as he cousin do i hope then you 'll give it to the chief andy the carberry boy remark for the first time directly speak to one of the cousin sure thing we want to see the rascal cop just as much as anybody do you see felix he be the farm hand up at mr quackenboss ' place and I we think it good policy to stay around and keep a eye on we machine while it be lie overnight in that meadow i have have a long watch of it and be take my turn at sleep when just at daybreak felix shake I and say there be a queer noise up aloft that kind of scared he and which he rather believe must come from some sort of air craft oh exclaim percy look intensely interested of course go on please i jump up and sure enough i glimpse a biplane pass over and head up the lake at a pretty good height i think it look like you machine but as i remark to frank later on whoever steer it have a different way about he from you method while i be wonder what take you out so early and i could see there be two in the machine a big flock of crow pass over and i lose track of it so you see percy break in the eager chief just at that point we have get a pretty good clue already about the direction the rascal take who break into the safe of the bank and carry off a bagful of money and valuable papers and then follow that up by crib you biplane it be north they go up the lake in fact and that be the quarter we 'll have to look for they but let I tell you it be put it pretty hard over on a police officer to make he try to track a steal fly machine but you can get in touch with every town to the north and pick up pointer here and there percy declare excitedly get back to town as fast as you can chief and with a couple of you man i 'll carry you wherever you want to go in the meanwhile you can leave order for you man to do the wiring business and whenever we strike a town we can ring up headquarters over the ` phone and learn what news they have manage to pick up percy seem to think that all he have to do be to tell the chief what he want but then he plan of campaign be really a good one and the police officer be wise enough not to quarrel with he bread and butter for the widow carberry be a large property owner in bloomsbury you just take the word out of my mouth seem like it he remark and that be the best plan we could carry out i be just go to suggest to frank and andy here that if they feel like take a little spin off to the northward this fine morning and discover anything suspicious they could get word to we perhaps through the bloomsbury central for we 'll be apt to keep in touch with home percy do not know whether to look pleased at this suggestion or not it would be just like the everlasting luck of the bird boy to make another remarkable success out of this thing for they seem to have a fail that way while all the hard fortune come in he direction that would give he a pain to be sure for he be horribly envious of they local fame as successful aviator but at the same time he hate to lose that beautiful biplane which he have not own very long and which have take he heart by storm so percy finally compromise as he frequently do he even force a grim smile to appear upon he face though it do not deceive frank in the least and as for andy he never take the least stock in percy carberry 's honesty in he mind there be always a deep meaning underneath every action of the other why sure i hope frank will discover the thief and recover the stuff they have grab from the bank also that he 'll have the good luck to get back my biplane without its be badly wreck that reward be worth try for and i do not go back on my word all the same he know very well that neither of the bird boy could be force to ever accept one penny from he hand no matter what good dame fortune allow they to do for he andy be watch keenly when the carberry boy walk back to he machine and climb into the steer seat frank happen to look that way see he cousin 's face light up as if in glee : and he even hear he chuckle perhaps percy may have catch the same sound for he turn he head after drop down into he seat and scowl darkly at andy there be nothing like a guilty conscience to bring about a self-betrayal and somehow percy seem to know what the bird boy be think about just then at any rate he be a adept at the pilot wheel of a car though incline to be a reckless driver just as he be also a daring air voyager take desperate chance that promise to bring he to grief one of these day back the car swiftly around he speed away sandy hollingshead who have not once move from he seat or utter a single word all the time turn he head to look back and andy think he too scowl darkly as though stir by unpleasant thought but in another minute they have vanish around the bend far along the pike and the chief alone be see whipping up he nag in the endeavor to get back as speedily as possible to headquarters well of all thing do not this just take the cake remark andy when he and he cousin once more find themselves alone beside the motionless aeroplane that nestle like a great bird on the grass close to the road it certainly look as though we might be in for a little more excitement reply frank but what seem to make you chuckle so much andy you must have notice something that escape my attention because i be busy thinking of other thing suppose you open up and tell I i be tickled half to death to see how percy try to walk as if nothing be the matter with he when all the time he could not keep from limp because do not you see one or several of those bird-shot felix scatter around last night must have sting he about the leg that be why he scowl so at I frank chapter vii the air scout frank laugh a little himself when he hear he cousin say this i give you credit for get one on I there andy he declare then you believe i hit the right nail on the head do you frank well remark the other come to think of it percy do have a little limp and i guess he try to hide it the best he could for i remember see he wince several time but how about sandy who never try to get out of the car once and do not even open he lip to say a single word i bet you he get a double dose and be pretty sore this morning andy go on you seem to think it be kind of hard line for felix to give 'em a load when they be pretty far off and just climb over that fence but it tickle I every time i think of it seem like the whole bunch just fall over after he shoot and like as not each fellow get he share of the number eight somewhere in he leg but how about this job the chief ask we to engineer frank be we go to start off on that little spin up the lake and d'ye guess we could get a pointer about where the two thief have go we might try anyhow no harm in that be he cousin 's reply as he turn once more toward the hydroplane that lay near by i remember we have great luck that other time when we discover that the man who break into leffingwell 's place be hide in that old cabin up in the wood perhaps the same story might be repeat who know they call it the bird boy ' luck frank but then we work for all we get and ought to have a little credit when we win out if we make a bad job of thing the same people would be quick to say we do not know we business shall we go back to the shop first that would be the only way reply frank if we be go to take on this dangerous job of look up yeggman who have break into a bank and loot it why it seem to I we ought to make a little preparation of course about all we expect to do be to scout around and see if we can pick up any information with the aid of we marine glass it be hardly to be expect that two boy would take the chance of try to nab a couple of reckless thief who must be arm and desperate but if the opening come frank we would not let it slip by would we ask andy always willing to go to the limit when temptation beckon perhaps not answer the other smilingly but there be no use cross a bridge till we come to it so we will not bother any more about that get aboard andy and we 'll head for home again just think of all that be happen since we have that little accident yesterday afternoon up near the quackenboss place andy go on to say as he comply with he cousin 's request and settle himself in he seat leave the piloting of the machine to frank there have be quite a little run of excitement that be a fact muse the other first the accident and we great good luck in make a landing without break a thing include we precious neck then the discovery of percy and sandy look at the hydroplane lie there and hurry away as if they have already lay a plan to come back and pay a night visit if they fail to see we get home by daylight andy go on to add event follow thick and fast after that andy -- the come of the four fellow with they face hide they repulse at the hand of yourself and the friendly felix then the robbery of the bank the break into we shop by man who leave they card behind in the shape of these burglar tool the meeting of the chief on the road and the news he give we and last of all the come of percy with the startling news that he biplane have be steal yes but do not forget my see it sailing over just at early dawn remark the other as frank stooped forward for a last look around before start up the powerful little kinkaid engine because that promise to play quite a figure in the pursuit of the smart thief though they may be fifty mile away from here by now if they know how to handle that fine biplane right hold tight we be off warn frank as he apply the power for the new engine be of course a self-starter and could be operate from he seat with almost as much ease as might be show in use electricity and press the button the hydroplane run easily along the ground for the bicycle wheel be always keep in first class condition and as the speed keep on increase frank soon uptilt the plane and like a great bird rise from the ground with a graceful sweep the fly machine take to the air long practice have make the bird boy familiar with every movement connect with the action of a aeroplane but at the same time they try to be always on they guard against be incautious that be the trouble with most aviator they grow so familiar with danger that they forget the terrible risk that always hang over the head of every one who soar aloft in he frail airship and then when finally something happen after they have become too reckless they never get another chance sweep along not more than three hundred foot above the ground the boy be home in almost no time they could see the car contain percy carberry and he crony sandy just vanish among the house of bloomsbury and the chief about half-way there wave he hat at they as they speed past he then the aeroplane drop lightly down close to the hangar back of the bird home where andy and he father the professor live together with old colonel whymper the veteran who use crutch or a cane on account of he rheumatism bring on he always declare not by age oh no but the wound he receive many year ago when he be fight for he country in the great civil war he be sit there on a pile of lumber wait for they a quaint old fellow who be greatly beloved by both cousin and who believe firmly that some fine day andy bird be bind to even eclipse the fame which he father have gain in the field of science and aviation it happen that the professor be away at the time deliver a series of lecture before some body of scientist in a distant city and whenever the boy be in they shop the old veteran be in the habit of come around to see what new and wonderful thing engage they attention as well as chat with they and he be as welcome as the sun in may of course just then he be bristle with question as a hedgehog would be with sharp-pointed quill and know the colonel of old frank and andy lose no time in tell he all that have happen to they from the time of they little accident down to when they hear the latest news from percy carberry and i warrant now remark colonel whimper as soon as the tale be finish that you two boy get the first clew to where the robber be hide do not you beat the wonderful chief out before and do not history have a habit of repeat itself oh if only i be ten year younger how i would love to be along when all these glorious thing be happen i hate to think i be put by on the shelf and never can be any good again that be the old man 's only fault he be forever complain because he day for indulge in exciting scene have pass but any one who know the half that he have pass through would think the colonel have no reason to say anything and that it be only right that someone else have a show they soon soothe he however and long practice have make andy particularly apt at this sort of thing here come elephant and larry on the run remark frank a little while later i wonder if they see we come home and whether they can have pick up any additional news connect with the bank robbery that we ought know well it might pay we to hold up a little and see add andy yes since we be in no great hurry and the day be long frank remark the two boy come up panting for breath larry have evidently set the pace and it be a matter of the smaller lad keep with he or else be leave behind something elephant never like to have happen so that he be unable to say even a single word for a full minute after arrive alongside the hangar tell we have they learn anything new since the chief start off ask frank as usual right to the point and in this way cut off the myriad of question which he know both the newcomer be prime to ask why yes gasp larry while elephant nod he head as if to say he agree to all that be say after percy come bustling around ask for the chief and tell how somebody have bust into he place and run off with he biplane in the night they get to talk it over and wonder if it could have be the robber and if one of 'em know how to handle such thing so they call up the city and ask question in that way they learn that there be a yegg who have be suspect of have be connect with several other job though they never could just put the kibosh on he and he name be casper blue and one time he use to be a actor and then become a pretty well-known flier but in a accident he break he arm and have to give up he business he be always a crooked sort of feller and after that just booze around join in with hobo gang and they believe touch up a few job himself there that be all we know and now what you be do too long a story to tell just now declare frank the colonel know and perhaps he 'll amuse you after we have go oh say be you meanin ' to take after they feller that bust the bank safe and then get away with percy 's biplane ask elephant eagerly do not i wish though i could just hang on behind and be in the swim for once you two seem to have about all the fun there be go hang the luck say i well you would better not try it that be what say andy shake he head threateningly at the bare suggestion of have elephant aboard when they make a start i think we have get everything now andy remark frank anxious to be off hope you be take gun along because if you do run across they hobo feller you 'll be apt to need they right bad larry go on to say also look downcast at have to miss all the sport simply because nature have never intend he for a aviator as he be incline to get dizzy when look down from any height oh frank 's provide for that and besides we do not really expect to round the thief up just find out if they have drop down anywhere inside of thirty mile to the north of bloomsbury shall i get aboard frank yes and after we be off larry will you and elephant do I the favor to step around to my house and tell my folk that the bird boy have hire out as scout to chief waller tell dad that we 'll be mighty careful and for mother not to worry about we you know i always call aunt laura mother because she be be that ever since my own die year ago will you do that boy and frank sit there ready to start turn a smile face upon he two friend even as they promise the aeroplane start off and a minute later soar up in the air like a bird rejoice at its freedom for leave the earth behind chapter viii just below the cloud good luck to you boy come float up from the ground above the buzz of the busy little kinkaid motor and look down they could see larry elephant yes and the old veteran also carry on excitedly as they swing they hat around who be you wave you handkerchief to frank do you best girl keep she eye on the sky all the day long look to see you come around demand andy humorously yes that be my best girl as sure as you live and she be stand there on the porch of we house right now wave to I -- aunt laura who think just as much of I as any mother could but andy neither of we say anything when larry tell about that hobo aviator name casper blue yet he answer the description the bank watchman give of the smaller man who have a stiff arm oh i notice that all right even if i do not look you way return andy promptly it sort of clinch the nail we drive through do not it frank seem like it the other go on to remark and the chance be ten to one we have get the story down fine right now know who one of the robber be why they want to steal a aeroplane to make they get-away in and all that but there be a few thing we do not know that would throw a little more light on the affair as what query he cousin well for one thing the chief seem to think the thief might have have inside information they seem to know so much about thing connect with the bank we have a aeroplane where we live what we habit be and then about percy 's biplane in the bargain now that be something serious if there be a man in bloomsbury who be in league with such rascal he 'll be apt to help they out again later on if they get away with this job and he ought to be find out whew look like we have get a big job on we hand if we hope to do all that sort of thing comment andy with a whistle to indicate he feeling nobody say we even think of try laugh frank as he stop mount upward in spiral and head away toward the north it be a glorious view that they have now spread out beneath and around they neither of the bird boy ever tire of such wonderful sight and although by now it have become a old story they enjoy it as much as ever even if they former sensation of awe have give way to one of familiarity they could see the entire outline of beautiful lake sunrise with its many cove and point jut out the water glisten in the sunlight as the morning breeze fan it gently why yes there be the little lake steamboat call the mermaid pass along the northern border of the lake on the way between the town of cranford on the shore opposite bloomsbury and head toward a small lumbering camp far up the left bank possibly to deliver supplies after which she would point she nose down toward the home town which be of more importance than any other station on lake sunrise the boy do look back dear though the scene around home must ever be for they it be characteristic of these lad that once they put they shoulder to the wheel or in other word they hand to the plow they would not allow themselves to be discourage by thought of the home tie that account for much of the success that have be they portion in the past they could for the time be forget that there be any such place as home and in this way they avoid the weakness that such thought be apt to bring along in they train forward they way lay toward those forbid wild far to the north where few town could be find and pretty much all the country be a vast wilderness fill with picturesque forest wild swamp and rugged hill it be just the country where desperate law breaker would choose as a hiding-place after they have commit some crime and expect a warm pursuit ordinary method would never find they save through a mere chance but when one can copy the eagle and mount to dizzy height with a pair of powerful glass he can see almost everything that be go on for mile and mile around provide he have a skilled companion along to manage the aeroplane or balloon and that be destine to be the greatest value of these winged messenger in future year since it have be prove that they be not so very dangerous after all in the line of drop explosive upon battleship or fortify place somewhere up yonder frank they be probably hide and feel perfectly safe from pursuit venture andy who be sweep the marine glass around and examine the country ahead with more than common interest look how old thunder-top stand out today remark frank turn for just a instant to glance upward toward the leave where the high mountain tower its heavily wooded side look as gloomy as ever and the white cliff that make the summit inaccessible to human foot appear almost dazzling in the glittering light of the undimmed morning sun and say there be we old friend the eagle that have a nest up there and give I such a warm time when we first reach the top andy cry as he focus he glass on a sweeping pair of huge bird that be head they way as if mean to investigate and find out what manner of rival this could be invade they native element they know too much to bother with a aeroplane by now declare frank laughing again why i be think those bird have hardly grow new feather in place of the lot they lose that time they fight we so savagely the memory appear to amuse he cousin also for he could be hear laugh heartily even above the purr of the now steadily go motor that send the propeller whiz around so rapidly for there be one fore and aft as be the case with all biplane the engine be behind the pilot and he companion tell I if you can remember be that other aeroplane head straight up the lake the last you see it in the early morning light frank ask that be right frank but then i could not say just how long they keep along that same course when those hundred of old crow come sailing along on the wind caw to beat the band and go every-which-way i lose sight of the biplane after that it would have to be just guess work but we have get a good pointer to start with insist frank they would not be so apt to head toward the south east or west because in those direction there be plenty of town and village and these could report see a strange biplane pass over so give the police a clue no chance be ten to one they keep right on toward the north and there be where we have get to do all we search today we can just comb the whole district over and anything that look like the steal aeroplane be sure to catch we attention from this height do not you think so andy i reckon it will frank but the only thing bother I be that thing may have work all right with the rascal and by now they be away off so far distant that we 'll never in the wide world get in touch with they the more the pity well it be never be a habit of ours to own up beaten till we have do everything under the sun to win out and andy we have only start as yet the field be before we you know with a whole day 's supply of gas to push we on if we want to keep go so i be not ask any favor and expect to do just my level best to find out where the bank robber have go and if we hunt around a whole lot without get tab on the pair why we can drop down somewhere in a town and get in touch with bloomsbury headquarters the chief as much as promise that he would leave word there to put we wise to anything that have be learn by way of the telephone from other place and give a clue in that way we might take a fresh spurt you know just so andy agree the other bend he head to watch how some part of the machinery be do its duty for that be always the weak link in modern aviation nearly everything depend on the engine fulfil its part perfectly andy continue to make use of the pair of glass that magnify object in the far distance so wonderfully that a man could have be recognize easily a mile away and perhaps much further if the air be real clear now and then he turn they to the right the beautiful lake always attract he very much like a magnet would whenever he have a chance to look out over its glisten bosom and there be the little steamer just as frank have say why he could even distinguish todd pemberton up in the pilothouse grasp he wheel and guide he charge among the shoal that be chart in the northern end of the lake as dangerous that be for green hand at the tiller or wheel of a boat propel by sail steam or gasolene they be move in a line that would carry they up along the shore and consequently every minute they draw nearer the small lake steamer that be head toward they passenger could be see on its deck and possibly every eye be glue just at that particular moment on the aeroplane that be buzz go steadily northward perhaps it might have be the first time some of these people have ever see such a interesting object but in the region around bloomsbury it be by now a common sight with such enterprising young air pilot as the bird boy and percy carberry in the field almost every decent day all at once frank be hear to utter a exclamation turn you glass straight ahead and see what that can be flutter among the bush at norton 's point andy he call out hastily when the other have swing around and cover the region speak of he quickly give the desire information somebody seem to be shake a handkerchief or something else white he observe and it do not look like just wave at the steamer either for they do it after a system as we would signal with wigwag flag there i count seven time he do it then come a halt and one two three time another halt and once more he start in this time three four five and then stop now what do you suppose the fellow means by that and who can he be wave to frank you would expect it might be some one out on the lake can you see any small boat in sight andy or any one wave back from another point not a thing as far as i can see reply the boy with the marine glass suppose you try the steamer then suggest frank meaningly immediately andy give a exclamation of astonishment i see a signal move frank and it seem to be copy the one on shore he hasten to remark excitedly where do it come from the passenger that i see push up against the rail and stare at we be any of they interested do you think continued frank who just then could not turn he head to look but must depend on he chum well no answer andy it seem to come from the pilothouse and must be todd pemberton himself chapter ix the pilot of the mermaid so it be todd pemberton be it remark frank i think it 'll pay we to slow down a little and look into this white rag-waving business goodness gracious you can not be think that todd be in touch with the bank robber can you frank andy exclaimed astounded apparently at the very think of such a thing oh i be not up to that point of say anything -- yet but all the same it be what i call interesting you know the other reply and from this andy could easily guess that while frank might have notion about the matter he do not care to commit himself so early in the game yes that be so andy reply still have he eye glue to the binoculars what be do now continue frank nothing that i c 'n see reply the other no more white handkerchief wave around the point eh andy not a bless thing and todd 's quit too guess they have come to some sort of a understanding wish i know what seven three five mean something pretty interesting i 'll be bind andy go on to mutter half to himself well we can only guess and that be the extent of it frank be say in a rather serious tone as though he believe there might be more in connection with the little affair than a mere exchange of civility how about todd pemberton frank ask the boy with the glass well you know he as well as i do perhaps better return he cousin i mean be not there once something against he i know frank that my guardian sign a paper about get todd he position with the steamboat company this last spring they always get he to sign everything go he be so good-natured and what you call a easy mark yes they come to my father too and he put he name down i remember as near as i can say it be a petition to ask the company to give todd the position of pilot and state the belief of all those who sign that he would make good he use to be a pilot on lake sunrise and before that on one of the great lake but frank why the petition if he be able to fill the place you would think all he have to do be to make application and then jump in well it seem to be pretty generally know about bloomsbury that todd have not always be as straight as he be today and lot of people believe he would never hold he place a week but he be have it all summer now and seem to be give satisfaction all right frank go on to say but there be a past you mean todd have go the pace and use to drink and gamble i suppose perhaps now he even use to herd with a tough set how about that frank it be so all right todd get down pretty low and be even a hobo i hear before he take a brace and come back to bloomsbury to make a man of himself again gee i be real sorry to hear that andy mutter what that he reform demand the cousin in pretended surprise shuck no but about he have be a tramp because do not you see frank it make thing look black for todd remember do not you about what the chief say when he speak of the yegg know so much about thing that he think they must have have inside information and that somebody familiar with bloomsbury way help they figure it all out look bad for todd that be what frank to hear andy talk you would think that the party in question must have be a personal friend at least when in truth he only know todd pemberton to speak to as he do a thousand other people in and around the home town by that you mean you be afraid he be fall in with some old companion in crime and be tempt or force to join they in this raid on the bank be the way frank put the matter direct you have cover what i do believe as sure as my name 's andy bird well let I say that i think the same way you do frank go on to remark good cry andy in a delighted tone sometimes we agree and again we have different mind but in this case it look like we might be on the same raft take another good squint at the point andy and see if you can pick up that man again the fellow who be do all that tall wigwagging i be look frank what d'ye see there now the other continued nothing -- that be there be stone and moss and tree and perhaps bird fly around this way and that but never the first sign of a human being can i discover anywhere frank still we know there be one man there at least perhaps a pair of they hide somewhere around that desolate place why norton 's point be i guess about the meanest and loneliest place of all the disston swamp lumber company nobody hardly ever go there except to shoot snipe and woodcock in the fall and yet we happen to know there be one person hide out there and that he know todd pemberton for they have be exchange signal through the wigwag code look suspicious frank do not you think look like it might pay to investigate a little closer andy they be by this time pass over the identical strip of country where andy have watch the signal wave by look almost directly down he could see between the tall tree as only a aviator ever have a chance of do you know what i be hope to discover frank he remark as he continue to scan every part that be at all expose by opening among the tree percy 's lose biplane i take it come the prompt reply yes because they could not very well have land without a certain amount of open space we know how hard it be to drop into a hole and worse still to climb up out of one do not we have the toughest of time down there in that south american forest find open spot where we could land with some chance of ever get out again without cut tree down that be as big around as a young house but i do not hear you shout out that you have make any sort of discovery up to now andy well no for a fact i have not but frank i wish you could take the glass and let I hold the wheel for a minute you can tell I just as well i think reply the other it be about the sandy beach in front of the point remark andy what ail it then frank inquire see he cousin hesitate why andy go on to say you know how powerful this glass be and how it show up the smallest of thing when the sun be just right it be do that now i can look down on the sand spit at the point and for a lonely spot where hardly a man ever come from November to June it look pretty well trample up to I trample by man or animal the pilot inquire i think by two-legged animal answer the one who hold the powerful lens to he young eye and it strike I that perhaps the biplane come down right there early this morning it be head this way when i see it and not so very high up though that flock of crazy crow knock I out of watch it for some time do you mean it fall there that they have a accident of some kind andy might be that and then again perhaps they drop down on purpose p ` rap they mean to have another warm session around bloomsbury before skip out of this section for good with the aeroplane to make a quick get-away they might think of some rich haul they want to gather in be i away off in my guess frank or do you kind of lean the same way i think you be get pretty close to the truth andy and that be a fact reply the other but it would clinch it if you could only glimpse the biplane hide away somewhere down there under the brush or the tree that be what i have be hope for return andy a little fretfully but so far without meet any success that you could notice but what ought we to do about it frank go on and take a wide sweep around come the steady reply perhaps we might run across another lead clue and then this one would look foolish we would be sorry then that we think so bad of todd perhaps after all he be only make signal to one of the man connect with the log camp up on the point for something or other he allow the motor to work at the reduce speed that it have be carry on ever since quit the home field where the workshop and the hangar stand andy still continue to use the glass as though he have not quite give up all hope of make some sort of discovery once however they have leave the northern end of the lovely lake behind they for good and only the forest lay below frank quickened matter somewhat truth to tell he hardly know what to think and whether what they have witness could really have any bearing on the solution of the puzzle or not certainly if the hunt be only keep up in automobile that require fairly decent road to allow of they get along there be not much chance of the authority ever discover the conceal hobo thief for they could not get within a mile of the shore up there at norton 's point by such method the only way it could be reach be by boat or possibly through the means of a aeroplane such as the bird boy be now use few place but could be spy upon when one have the means for pass over the most inaccessible thicket and rocky hill after a time they have go many mile occasionally a small hamlet be see below and then would come once more the wood that extend over such a large space of territory in this part of the country this be generally because of the swampy nature of the ground which prevent farm operation be carry on while the difficulty of get the log out of the bog have deter lumber thus far andy have do he part of the work faithfully he have scour the territory over which they pass and never do a break occur however small but he clap he eye upon it and examine the open space thoroughly there be rockford ahead and we have pass over the whole stretch of swamp and forest suppose now we drop down on the common and get bloomsbury on the long distance phone perhaps they might have some news they could give we and as andy at once agree to the proposal for he be thirsty anyhow and want a drink of soda water the worst kind frank begin to descend gracefully they have about half the population of the place gaping at they as they finally land on the big green frank ask he cousin to stay by the machine while he seek police headquarters and ask to get in touch with the home town he have no sooner make the connection and hear some one answer he after he tell who he be when there be send along the wire some information that rather give frank a shock because of its nature and the fact that it seem to fully dispose of the theory he and he cousin have already form chapter x hear over the wire luckily the center of interest remain around the odd look aeroplane with the metal pontoon underneath its body so that frank be allow to walk away almost unnoticed when he have secure the important information he inquire for and which be lead he to the drug store nearest the town green true a aviator have land in rockford on one or two occasion for some reason or other in time past since the bird boy could not remember have do so possibly it may have be percy carberry anxious to enjoy the stare of the good people and pose as a great fellow but this be a type of air machine with which none of they be familiar and as so much space be be take up even in the local papers with the account of the wonderful doings of daring navigator of the upper current it be only natural that some bright boy should speedily guess what manner of craft the chance visitor to rockford must be hey that be a hyderplane mister be not it demand one sharp-eyed chap after he have glimpse the construction of the aluminum pontoon that be just keep from contact with the ground by the bicycle wheel have you ever see one before ask andy desirous of keep up friendly relation with the crowd for he know how important that might prove since as yet no man wear a blue uniform have put in a appearance and should any hoodlum choose to play rough house or try to be too familiar with the apparatus there be always a chance that some damage might be do no i be not but i see a picture of that ` ere coffyn feller a-flyin ' down on the hudson river nigh new york and she look a heap like this here shebang come the quick response well you guess right that time for that be what it be call a hydroplane because it can be navigate on the water as well as in the air and if you 'll please stand back so as not to bother with anything because the least handling may put the whole machine out of tune i 'll be glad to tell you something about how we manage to use it as a boat andy know how to manage and he exert himself to entertain the crowd while frank be absent keep they interest arouse by little story of thing that have happen to birdmen in recent time and which be of course well know to he from the fact that both the cousin keep in close touch with all that go on in the world of aviation all the while andy be keep one anxious eye out for the sign of a blue uniform and brass button while new addition keep arrive constantly to swell the eager crowd gather on the park green in the end he be vastly relieve to discover a policeman hurry up look as serious as though he expect to discover a fight or two youngster match pet rooster to the delight of the gather host for since the fly machine lay on the ground it be mostly conceal from he view and he would never have know what it be anyway of course when he arrive on the scene and take command andy quickly gain he favor by a little subtle flattery and after that feel that he be as he himself express it on easy street meanwhile frank have proceed direct to the drugstore on the corner about two block away from the end of the green where they have tell he he could talk over the long distance phone with bloomsbury he be please to find that they have a regular booth in the store for he know of numerous case where the phone simply stand on a little stand and everybody could hear what the subject of the talk might be especially one side of it once closet in the booth he hasten to ask for connection with police headquarters at bloomsbury there be some little delay as though these long distance call might be of rare occurrence in the local central but finally he receive notice that connection have be make and he be at liberty to start he message hello this bloomsbury frank ask first of all in a cautious way yes come the reply distinctly enough and be this police headquarters yes this be frank bird speaking and we be over in rockford get that frank continued yes again come the reply from the party at the other end chief waller ask we before we leave bloomsbury to keep in touch with headquarters and that you would supply we with any new information that might come to hand while we scour the country overhead look for sign of the man who rob the bloomsbury bank last night and escape in percy carberry 's biplane who be this i be talk to please officer green frank oh be that you joe i do not recognize you voice over the wire frank go on to say you hear what the chief say about give we the latest news do not you joe i certain do frank answer the man at the other end of the wire we have cover quite a large territory up to now and think we have run across a clue but we want to make sure before put the bloodhound of the law on the scent get that frank be wise to the fact that officer green take himself and he position on the local police force very seriously true he have never do anything very great to distinguish himself beyond once stop a runaway horse that some people say be too decrepit to have go twenty pace further and rescue a little pet dog that have fall into the lake from a wharf but then he believe in himself and read up all the thrilling story of police achievement that be publish in the new york papers satisfy that sooner or later the day be bind to come when he would be able to prove himself a grand hero and that be just why artful frank use that phrase bloodhound of the law for he know that it would cause joe green to puff up with pride and feel more kindly disposed than ever toward the speaker he gauge matter exactly right too it seem for when the police officer speak again it be with additional eagerness good for you frank all bloomsbury expect the bird boy to do the old town proud again many the time have you do it in the past we all know and when you feel dead sure that you have get track of the desprit villain who loot we town bank all you have to do be to give the police the signal and they 'll throw a drag-net around the hang-out of the yegg that be what we be here for that be what we draw we salary for to protect the citizen of bloomsbury against danger by fire flood robber and the like frank know only too well how officer green like to talk especially when once start on the subject of he exalted office and accordingly he think it time to cut he short before he could get launch on the sea of police duty tell I have you learn anything new since we leave he ask why yes we have just have a man in here who have hear about the robbery and that it be suspect the thief have escape by means of the biplane belong to the carberry boy he think as how we might be glad to know that he would sight a fly machine just after daybreak why yes that ought to be a important piece of news remark frank wonder whether it would corroborate that which the farm hand felix bogg have already contribute to the fund of knowledge concern the movement of the flee yeggman i think it be and i be only wait right now to forward it to the chief as soon as he call I on the wire from hazenhurst or some other place where he be apt to turn up come over the wire from the home town do not cut I off yet central call out frank hastily as he think he detect a uneasy movement which be doubtless a sigh give by the girl who possibly have she ear to the wire drinking in what be be say : i be not near do talk yet hello joe yes i be here frank what more do you want to ask I come from mile away and in imagination he could see officer green crouch at the telephone stand as he remember it at police headquarters in bloomsbury feel the importance of he relation with the public as a genuine guardian of the peace why it be of considerable importance to we to know in which direction the aeroplane be go at the time this party sight it frank go on to say and i hope he tell you that which he do without my ask reply officer green quickly though you may be sure i would have do the same before let he leave because i be on to the fact that it would be a pretty good pointer oh he think of it himself do he the young aviator shoot back well that be pretty bright of he and show that he be a fellow to take notice and now please tell I what he say about the direction in which the biplane be head at the last instant he could see it far away in the distance exactly southwest frank this give frank a sudden jar because it upset the theory he and andy have be form concern the escape bank robber they have believe the two man have go almost directly north southwest you say joe he ask wish to make assurance doubly sure he say exactly southwest and as he keep repeat that word a number of time there be not a bit of chance that i would get it mixed you can depend on it frank and if you be away up at rockford seem to I you 'll have to make a big change of base right soon if you want to get in touch with they raskil frank 's mind be in somewhat of a whirl he wonder whether the farm hand felix bogg could have be mistake in what he have say though andy too have see the biplane and note the direction of its flight but perhaps this farmer or whoever he might turn out to be have discover the fugitive fly machine at a much later time after the two man have change the course of they flight i suppose you might as well tell I who the party be from whom you get you news joe he remark though without any particular object in view since he could hardly expect to hunt the other up and ask more question and then come the answer that give frank quite a thrill as he grasp the peculiar significance of it all why you know he all right frank say officer green glibly he be the pilot of the little lake steamer and he name 's todd pemberton chapter xi compare note he must have hurry up to headquarters then as soon as he land because we see the mermaid cross the northern end of the lake bind for the lumber camp before head for bloomsbury how about it joe frank go on to ask as soon as he have recover from he surprise after hear that particular name mention say he hear about the robbery come over the wire in officer green 's ponderous tone and the fact of the raskil skip out with the carberry boy 's biplane as soon as he put foot ashore and think that the police might like to know what he have see he just run all the way here which i take it be mighty thoughtful of todd declare frank drily but if he speak sarcastically the fact be not know to the man at the other end i tell he so and compliment he on he zeal in assist the course of justice the other continue which be all the more remarkable you know frank because to tell the truth todd himself be once a bad egg until he reform and get he present job it do he great credit sure it do he go away after let you know that if you hope to capture the thief you would have to chase southwest and not north do not he joe oh yes about ten minute ago i reckon but i assure he that if we do succeed in capture the rogue he would not be forget in the division of the reward that be sure to be offer by the bank for the recovery of the money and security that be take not to speak of the five hundred young carberry have say he would pay for the recovery of he biplane and the arrest of the thief that be nice of you joe but only what might be expect because you heart be as big as a bushel basket frank go on to say and when you tell todd that how do he take it why he just chuckle and look at I kind of funny and say he never hope to take any of the hard-earned reward money that the police be justly entitle to because of they activity reply the other it be plain to be see that todd be a generous fellow but i be oblige to you joe for give I this information because you see we have now get some foundation to build on goodbye joe with that frank ring off he know that he might chat with the gossipy police officer in bloomsbury for at least fifteen minute but what be the use when he already know all the other have to tell and the news that have come over the wire be of considerable importance too he smile as he hurry out of the drugstore not even wait to quench he thirst at the soda fountain though a short time before he as well as andy have complain of feeling so exceedingly dry but then all that be now forget in this excitement connect with the latest development in the robbery case it be back to the village green now with frank the crowd be greater than ever and he quickly see there would be no opportunity for any communication between himself and he cousin until they have leave for the upper realm where surround only by silence they could converse while the busy motor hum and the aeroplane head as they will either high above the hill or skirt the top of the forest tree accordingly frank address himself to the arduous task of get away without any mishap he as well as andy have long since learn that it be the part of wisdom to gain the good will of a curious crowd in that manner many friend be raise up who be only too willing to lend a help hand he quickly select half a dozen fellow who look as though they might be of more than ordinary importance among the boy of rock-ford these he particularly pick out and ask they to assist the police officer to keep the crowd back until they could get a good start at the same time explain that a clear passage would have to be make ahead and that anyone get in the way might not only be seriously injured but wreck the machine as well proud to have be thus honor the six boy proceed to push back the gaping crowd and when frank give the word also assist in start the hydroplane on its way a salvo of loud cheer ring out when they start and this burst into a furious chorus as the well balanced aeroplane presently leave the ground to start upward into the air i be glad that be over with say andy when they be safely off the ground and the shout of rockford 's enthusiastic population begin to grow fainter in the distance same here echo frank you never know what will happen when a crowd be push all around you every fellow eager to just say he have hold of a fly machine there be always one or two of the lot ready to hang on and risk they life just to see how it feel to be carry up on a aeroplane they be the kind i be most afraid of well do you get police headquarters in bloomsbury frank no trouble about that and we old friend officer green be in charge during the absence of the chief the other bird boy answer anything new develop since we leave ask andy just one thing and joe think it mean a whole lot frank go on to say which be what inquire the other a man come hurry in and tell how he have see a fly machine contain two party just after daybreak and make directly toward the southwest andy what do you think of that now for news he cousin give a whistle whew important if true he vouchsafe tersely that sound as if you have some trouble believe it chuckle frank well consider what i see myself i would have to know the name of this party first before i would believe anything he say andy go on oh you know he alright fact be we be speak of the same not a great while back frank observe quietly do not make I start in guess frank because we have be talk of a dozen people but tell I right out who it be andy plead the pilot of the mermaid andy gee do you mean todd pemberton exclaim the other just he and no one else why he be that anxious to let the police know he have see a aeroplane steer away straight into the southwest early this morning that as soon as he warped he boat to the wharf todd like a public-spirited citizen hike away for headquarters as fast as he could run hardly wait long enough to understand about the bank be rob and percy 's biplane be use by the thief as a means of make a quick get-away andy turn he head and look in he cousin 's face public-spirited citizen go hang he say contemptuously after what we see frank it be easy for we to understand just what it be make todd want the police to do all they hunting away off in the southwest yes what do you think be he object ask frank as he hold the aeroplane just about five hundred foot above the level ground cover by forest as in most place around to the north of bloomsbury though occasionally they run across farm that look like oasis in the dessert why that be as plain as the nose on my face reply andy and nobody ever have any trouble about see that i guess todd want to get in a little bit of assistance for he friend the hobo who loot the bank and he could do they the best thing ever by turn suspicion in nearly the opposite quarter if chief waller could be assure that the last see of the biplane before it vanish in the distance it be head into the southwest of course he would take all he man off in that direction and the bank robber hide perhaps around the northern end of lake sunrise would be free to do whatever they want do i hit about the same guess that you do frank you have just echo what i have in mind return he cousin only i have have more time to think it over and perhaps go a little further than you could as how demand the other promptly just as frank know he would why you know it strike we as queer that these fellow should want to hang out within twenty mile of the town where they would just make a successful raid on the bank it would stand to reason that they would be only too glad to cut for it after get possession of percy 's fine new aeroplane and by keep on north reach lake ontario and perhaps fly across to canada where they would be safe yes sure we talk that over before frank and come to the conclusion that either they would meet with some sort of accident to the biplane and have to hold over till the fellow who use to be a aviator repair the same or else that they have some other robbery in mind and want to make a double killing of it before skip out all right you can see then that if chief waller and about all he man get on a warm clue that lead they off to the southwest for a day or so it would leave thing open for the carry out of this second scheme when andy hear he cousin say this so gravely he seem more startled than ever say i believe you have go and strike the truth just as you nearly always do old fellow not by luck but by figure it out to get the coast clear then this sly todd pemberton mean to go on bring in important news and keep poor old chief waller work up to top-notch speed chase around down there after shadow yes that must be the game they have get in hand and perhaps that be what all those wave of handkerchief mean between the pilot of the little mermaid and the fellow we could not see who be hide in the bush on norton 's point he be undoubtedly there just to give todd the high sign when the boat pass both of we speak of the fact that we would never know the steamboat to keep so far north when make the run from cranford across the lake up to the lumber camp on we northwest side but now we can understand why he want to make sure he partner in crime be ready for he to do he little share in the game which be to send the police on a wild goose chase and leave bloomsbury next to unprotected tonight but whatever in the wide world frank do you think they mean to try next i could not guess in a year be the reply of the boy who manipulate the lever of the hydroplane so dextrously it might be any one of a dozen or two game the bank be not the only institution in bloomsbury carry a lot of money in the safe and then there be several rich man we happen to know who keep a little fortune about the house in the way of money jewelry or curio for all we know these yegg may even have a eye on you house or mine because they could make a pretty good haul there whew be all andy say just then but he mind be undoubtedly fill with startling idea chapter xii at the hoskin farm well andy go on to remark presently i see you be turn back again in the direction of the head of the lake i hope frank you do not mean to go all the way to bloomsbury and put the police in possession of the few fact we have succeed in pick up that be not my calculation at all reply the other in the first place we suspect a good deal but up to now we have not get very much positive evidence on which to find a case i would like to know a little more before i get the chief on the wire and put he wise then when we get near the northern end of the lake perhaps you 'll think it best to make a landing somewhere and prowl around on foot finding out what we can andy continued eagerly for he have become much work up by this time and be hope that fortune would be as kind to they as on a previous occasion which all bloomsbury remember very well if we can only find a decent opening where we could make a get-away again that be the only thing that bother I frank reply now i remember notice a field near what seem to be a lonely farmhouse in fact there be a number of open place there and they seem to have canada thistle grow in clump all a-bloom as if the farmer have give up cultivate and let thing just go to rack and ruin i be never up there myself but from what i have hear my father say i rather think that must be the hoskin place they say he consult some fortune teller a couple of year ago who tell he he would some day discover a gold mine on he property that would make he a millionaire and ever since the farmer have spend about all he time digging here and there but up to now without any success at all why yes i remember hear a lot about the queer old farmer myself frank go on to say he be get a wife and a half-grown daughter name sallie i meet she at a country dance last winter and she be a pretty nice sort of a girl now we have be on the move a good while andy and perhaps we might manage to make the hoskin farm around the dinner hour a bully good idea too frank and do not you forget it cry the other with considerable show of enthusiasm now i just bolt what little breakfast i get this morning and already i feel hungry enough to eat nearly anything and speak generally these country people do set a great table though i do not know how it will be with the hoskin because if they have be neglect they farm to chase around after rainbow they probably will not be any too flush with supplies but any port in a storm and i guess we 'll be able to get fill up if only we can make a landing and find the farm as i figure it out hoskin ' place would not be over a mile or so directly above norton 's point andy the pilot of the expedition continue thoughtfully yes andy say encouragingly and perhaps now we might happen to run on some sort of a little clue there for instance one of those yeggman may have wander around and buy some egg or milk from the farmer 's folk because if they have be camp out in the wood they have have to eat all the while you know a good idea frank and we 'll ask if we be lucky enough to happen around the lonely farm about meal time i be go to make it a point to be there and as we have get some time to kill meanwhile let 's hop over to that nice landingplace at the foot of old thunder top and overhaul the machine again there be a few thing i would like to tinker with because i be not quite pleased with the way they work and you know andy i be a regular crank about have a motor run like a watch well i be get that way mighty fast thanks to you hint and the knowledge of how it pay when you be take you life in you hand every time you go up in one of these heavier-than-air outfit be what the other bird boy observe with what be a thoughtful look for he because as a rule andy appear to be a merry chap and laugh much of the time within half a hour they have successfully land at the place indicate and which have witness the come and go of the young aeronaut on numerous occasion here at least they could remain and take thing easy while wait for the morning to slip along so that eleven would roll around little danger of they be bother by curious person here indeed the boy have never yet know a solitary man or boy to come around the place they could look up while lie there on they back and watch the fleecy cloud sail swiftly past the lofty crown of the rocky mountain and how vividly there come into they mind memory of lively time which they themselves have experience up there on the summit of old thunder top they speak of they now as they lay stretch out on the soft turf and watch the two white head eagle soar far up in the blue heaven around and around in circle without ever seem to flap they great wing once the young aviator have engage in a terrible conflict with those two mighty bird on the crown of the mountain where they have land with they aeroplane and be look upon as intruder by the eagle possibly under the belief that they entertain hostile intention toward the fledgling in they nest that be build amidst the crag close to the tip of the lofty peak frank and andy often speak of that thrilling episode but never without some sort of little shiver because it have be a serious time with they since one blow from those powerful wing might have topple they over the edge of the dizzy height and send they to they death but they have succeed in beat they feather antagonist off by the aid of club which they wield with vigor and after the eagle learn that no harm be intend to they young by these bold navigator of the upper air current they come to have more respect for the strange winged thing that come hum up from the earth on more than one occasion when eleven o'clock come around the boy be off again and head toward the northern end of the lake of course they keep close down to the treetop because once they discover the opening they would wish to drop into it as easily as possible suddenly andy who be on the lookout while frank pay more attention to the easy working of the motor and the steering of the hydroplane utter a exclamation of satisfaction i see it dead ahead he remark in a satisfied tone we make a bee line to the place from the foot of the mountain frank and unless i be away off in my guess the farmhouse lie over yonder beyond the tree so nobody 's apt to see we come down and we can make any sort of yarn we want to explain just why we be here right now we can do that all right without tell anything that be not so reply the other aviator the farmer do not know we though sallie will and on that account we must be careful what we say but the dinner 's the main thing just now and at the same time we 'll try and pick up a little information if farmer hoskin happen to know anything that would interest two fellow of we stamp he pass over the opening once to make sure that it contain all the necessary requisite for a successful landing and also a launching of the airship then make a graceful sweep back again frank allow the aeroplane to drop lightly to the ground it land in almost the center of the field and both boy see that they might get away again without a great amount of trouble fine be the comment of the pilot as he jump to the ground and bent over to detach some part of the machinery without which the motor as andy always say would not move worth a cent this he often take with he just as a chauffeur might the spark plug of a automobile render it helpless unless the would-be thief be prepare to supply the deficiency off-hand which be a remote possibility that never worry frank now for grub announce the hungry andy lead off in the direction where he have reason to believe the farmhouse lay frank always declare that andy have a most wonderful nose for a meal that be prepare and could spot a camp a mile away just by the smell of frying onion or coffee cooking at any rate he prove to be a successful pilot on the present occasion for in a short time they be pass through a abandon grain field where the bee and butterfly be swarm about the many lavender color flower of the great clump of thistle and the smoke from the farmhouse kitchen arise just over a little knoll tell you so say andy as they draw near the house and catch fragrant odor of cooking in the air upon they knock a girl come to the open door and recognize frank immediately as a boy she have meet at the country dance the precede winter but nothing she say would indicate that the hoskin live here away from the world as they do with the head of the house spending all he time hunting for that treasure-trove he still believe in have hear anything to speak of about the wonderful thing the bird boy have be do lately frank be glad of this and he just casually mention that they chance to find themselves near the farm and wonder if they could get dinner there so the good housewife be bring out and with true country hospitality she immediately invite both boy to sit down with they although say that they be not as well supply with the good thing that use to be see on they table before father take to bore those horrid hole all over the place think to strike a coal vein or perhaps a silver mine he be off now and would not show up until night for the farm be one of vast dimension and covered mile of territory but we have a boarder say sallie as they sit down at the table sometimes he be here to meal and again he get so far away chase he butterfly that he just carry what he call a snack in he pocket such a queer little man he be too with he brown glass on and always run this way and that with he little net in which he capture the butterfly that come to the thistle on we old barren field perhaps he 'll turn up while you be here i would like you to meet professor whiteside who be from a big college he tell we and spend he vacation in the way he like sometimes i think he be a little off up here and she touch she head as she say this and that perhaps he get hurt worse than he think the time he meet with the accident that cripple he arm somehow andy look up when he hear about that broken arm to find he cousin give he the wink while he eyebrow be elevated in a suggestive way just as much as to say : now here 's something mighty interesting already that would pay we to look into because we know of another fellow who be trouble with a cripple arm and he name happen to be casper blue chapter xiii the butterfly collector the dinner pass off without the odd little professor show up although sallie say it be nothing unusual for he and that he be liable to appear at any time carry he little white hand-net and a small handbag in which he claim to keep the trophy of the chase that have be run down during he last campaign frank want to get a chance to confer with he chum and as soon as he could conveniently withdraw from the table give andy a nod he go out on the porch where he could look down the lane that lead to the poor road which in turn after many trial and tribulation merge into the main pike andy join he there a minute later with a question in he eye professor whiteside be what frank remark and a butterfly collector at that andy go on to say with cut sarcasm that sound pretty rich to I he cousin continue i wonder now could it be possible that the other man we have hear of lately casper blue be play a smart trick on these honest people who would never dream that he could be anything else than he claim it would give he a splendid chance to wander around just whenever and wherever he want to go and nobody to ask question then when he get hungry why he could drop in at the farm perhaps he do not like camp out as well as the other fellow perhaps he health be too delicate to stand rough it or he might have any one of a dozen other reason for carry on this way always provide that this be casper blue andy be brimful of excitement he manner would forcibly remind one of the nervous tension that seize upon the hound when the scent grow strong and they anticipate come in sight of they quarry at any moment we be take a good deal for grant seem to I remark frank of course but then see how queer it be that this man who call himself a college professor and collector of bug and butterfly should just happen to drop in here at the hoskin farm where the thistle grow so wild and the moth and other thing be to be find by thousand we never hear of he in town that i can remember and then he be small in size together with a stiff arm that be injure in a accident well be not casper blue knock out of he job as a air pilot by he arm fail he when he have to handle the lever like a flash or have he aeroplane turn upside-down frank i tell you i just feel dead sure it be we man and that we have find the clue we want the first thing well if we could manage to get a peep into he room perhaps we would run across something worth while frank suggest we might pretend to be deeply interested in butterfly ourselves remark andy even if we do not really know one kind from another and perhaps if you give sallie a sly hint that you would be tickle to see what sort of a collection she professor have with he she would let we look in he room we 'll make the try anyhow say frank firmly but think of this casper blue be able to carry out the part of a learn professor would you that be something most yeggman would find a pretty hard proposition do not you say frank well stop and think a little andy be the other 's reply to this from all account this man be not just a common everyday hobo he use to be know as something of a aviator before he meet with that accident that disable he arm and make it impossible for he to go up again and the fact be i seem to remember have see that name mention among a list of airman who have be either kill or knock out by accident happen to they that be all right frank but it take a pretty smart man to carry out a part like he be do do not larry tell we that this same casper blue have once be a actor before he take to the air for a living ask frank you be right he do that same thing but somehow it seem to have slip my mind but you never forget a single thing do you frank and if he use to be a actor why of course casper would find it easy to play this part perhaps he be just enjoy it the best you ever hear of some people be never happy unless they be hoodwink other let 's go back and find sallie and get to talk about butterfly and gypsy moth and all sort of thing in that line we can think of suggest frank then she 'll believe we be head over ear interested in what she boarder be do and if i give she a little hint she may ask we to step in and take a peek at he room of course we might not pick up anything worth while there and then again there be always a little chance we could it be worth while i think declare andy who seldom disagree with any proposition he cousin advance simply because frank be usually so wise that he succeed in cover the whole ground the very first thing so they once more leave the porch though both boy look down the lane before go in to make sure that the queer little butterfly collector be not come in time to interfere with they immediate plan sallie be just tidy up the diningroom when they find she the good woman of the house seem to have go into the kitchen where she be preserve some sort of fruit or make catsup to judge from the fragrant odor that come float out from that part of the farmhouse naturally sallie be only too willing to enter into conversation again with two such attractive look and bright boy as frank and andy bird she must have be aware of the fact that they be favorite among the girl of bloomsbury and of course also know something about they be aviator although both or ` they have shun that subject carefully while at the dinner table and so frank manage to gradually steer the conversation around to the subject of bug collection he tell of a friend he once have who be daffy along that line and would rather capture some queer look old night-flying hairy moth with a death 's - head sign on he front than enjoy the finest supper or listen to the best play that allow andy to venture the suggestion that he have take considerable interest in butterfly himself and always want to see a collection that be worth while of course he do not have to explain that the only interest he ever do have in the matter be when as a very small boy he use to chase after the flutter insect as they go from flower to flower until show by he mother how cruel it be to destroy the life of such wonderfully beautiful thing that he could not restore again sallie take the bait andy know from the eager light that flash upon she face and when he see she step over to a window and look quickly down the lane he turn to he cousin and make a grimace as much as to say see how she fall to my little game will you old fellow well say sallie flit back again professor whiteside have not get a very large collection and the new specimen he gather day after day he keep in some place because he have no time just now to do anything with they he say but come up with I and i 'll show you the little case he bring with he sure we will and i be glad of the chance to see what valuable butterfly look like andy go on to remark he say this little collection be a very rare one and worth a awfully large sum of money sallie go on to remark in something of a confidential tone as if get the boy ready to be surprise when they look upon the possession of the industrious professor and oh if you could only hear all the queer thing he be be tell we that happen to he in foreign land when he be spend ever so much money and long weary month find these very rare specimen why i just stand there and look at they and wonder how people can be so foolish when it seem to I i have see much prettier butterfly right out there in we field where the thistle be bloom it seem that the room they have give the wonderful man of science be on the ground floor and open off the parlor the two boy follow sallie in and note she rather awed manner 5 evidently the professor whether he turn out to be a fraud or the genuine article have succeed in arouse both she admiration and wonder the room be plainly yet comfortably furnished but evidently the professor like so many other learn savant do not know such a thing as order exist for thing be simply topsy-turvy he just will not let we sweep in here or do the least thing explain sallie as if she fear the boy would blame she for the look of the room you know he be so queer and he say we might lose something that he value very highly think it be not worth keep but here be the little case contain those almost priceless specimen he collect abroad she lead they to a table on which a small case rest lean against the wall frank take one look apparently the sight affect he strangely for immediately he bent over closer as though to feast he eye on those costly trophy which the college professor have collect in foreign land andy see that he cousin be evidently have some sort of a silent laughing fit for he shake all over though not utter a single sound what ail you frank he whisper take advantage of sallie have to hurry out of the room as she mother 's voice be hear call she in the kitchen i be tickled to death to meet a old friend again that be all reply frank do you mean to tell I you have see this wonderful collection before demand the other like a flash as it be i most certainly do and if you stop to think andy i guess you 'll say the same or perhaps now you do not happen to examine the case as closely as i do that day last spring when we cross over to cranford to pick up a few rare stamp for we collection at snyder 's old curio store why bless I i really believe you be right i seem to remember see it in the show window now when we be look at the little basket of coin andy hasten to remark there be not the least shadow of a doubt about it add frank some time or other when the notion come to this man to play the part of a butterfly collector which perhaps the sight of the thing bring to he mind he just step into snyder 's store and buy the old collection why it have not get a single specimen that you can not find a thousand of any day you look through August and September right around here you mean frank right on this farm in fact reply the other with a wide grin think of the nerve of this learn scientist bring this here and tell that it represent the result of year of difficult research you do not wonder now that i just have to snicker do you andy chapter xiv a clue that look bad do not it frank andy go on to remark as he first glance at the bogus collection of rare specimen and then eye he cousin humorously one thing be sure no man would go to the trouble and expense of buy even a dollar case of common butterfly unless he have some deep object in view and you know that andy this so-called professor must be a fraud even if he do not turn out to be the man we think he be perhaps he want to find out whether hoskin have discover that wonderful gold mine well you need not grin about it because stranger thing have happen i guess now andy cease laughing and turn to look around the room i wonder -- he begin and then stop short now i can finish you sentence for you say frank you wonder if we could make any important discovery if we look around here a bit while sallie be help she ma do up some fruit jar or something like that perhaps it would not be just the right thing suggest andy in confusion under ordinary condition it certainly would not he cousin go on to say but when you have get a pretty good idea that you be deal with a slippery hobo actor past-aviator and now a bank burglar and cracksman in general why that put a different face on the matter do not you see my boy all right let 's take a look say andy easily convinced that since they be really work hand in glove with the police authority they have a perfect right to prowl around in anybody 's room and pick up such valuable information as could be find afloat but after all they find nothing that look like incriminate evidence the fact of the matter be that the professor do not seem to own any sort of wardrobe whatever and have nothing belong to he save the clothes on he back the little case of butterfly which frank believe he have buy for a dollar over in cranford at the curio dealer 's shop and a few bottle hold some strong smell acid which possibly be use to either kill the capture butterfly so they would not beat they wing out or else to preserve certain specimen of bug he expect to run across in he hunt nothing do say andy with considerable of disgust and disappointment in he voice come here remark he cousin softly hello do not tell I you have find something and andy cross the floor in more or less haste he find frank bend over a table at which there be write material -- pen envelope paper and a blotter what be do have you find the gentleman 's notebook lie carelessly around and which we can peep into eh frank not at all come the reply i be only look at this blotter whatever be there funny about that demand the other in puzzle tone as he glance first at the object in question and then up at the face of he chum it be a new one or nearly so you see and somebody have be write heavily and then press the blotter over it frank go on and if you could read backwards now you might make out what they say be that it frank oh that part be as easy as fall off a log i hold it up to the look glass here see if you can make it out andy hardly have the other look than he start to read interject remark of he own as he proceed some word miss look like frank let 's see ` car on siding -- ` rive at 11 pm wed he say keep low and trust to he -- throw -- track mum ' that be all i can make out because he do not sign any name it seem whatever do you make of all that stuff frank first of all frank pull out a pencil and copy the mark upon a piece of paper which he thrust into he pocket he might miss the blotter if i crib it and take the alarm he explain as he hasten to put the article in question back on the table lest sallie come in at any minute and discover what they be do take liberty in the room of the boarder and then she would have to be tell everything which might work out badly frank fear but i reckon you have get some sort of idea what that write means frank pursue the other bird boy who once he start on a subject could no more be shake off than a bulldog of course i have and it be give I something of a shock too let I tell you andy first of all you may know that this very day be Wednesday the day he mention there to be sure it be but frank can all this have some reference to another crime they mean to commit i be afraid it do come the reluctant reply tell I what he mean by ` car siding track mum ' and all that of course i can understand that he warn the fellow he be send the message to to keep quiet what car can he mean do you think they aim to steal some one 's expensive car now -- that they have go and wreck percy 's biplane and must have another mean for get away but frank simply shake he head at that oh you be away off you base there andy he speak of a car on a siding and that can only refer to a railroad car now i happen to know that they expect the pay-car to be along some time today or tonight and it always lie there on that jeffrey siding until they have pass out thousand of dollar to the man who call bloomsbury they headquarters do you see now what it must mean andy andy gasp and then exclaim once more you have go and see through the riddle that knock I silly frank that be just what it must mean -- the pay-car would offer fat pickings all in cash and they have hold up they flight to canada just to try and gobble it oh what a slick game with todd give false information and perhaps just lead the police further and further away from bloomsbury tonight so as to leave the pay-car next to unprotected yes and do not he go on like this ` he say keep low and trust to he ' that must mean todd do not you think i read it that way reply he cousin tersely as he rub he chin in a reflective fashion for they be now grapple with a dangerous problem and frank be only too well aware of the fact that a slip might upset all calculation as well as possibly endanger they life since they be deal with reckless man and no boyish rival like percy carberry and sandy hollingshead do you think this be mean for the other one of the bank thief andy go on to ask it could hardly have be for any one else andy there must have be more to the letter but the rest dry before he blot it and that fellow be in hide somewhere perhaps watch the biplane and ready to fight before let it be retake because they depend on it for they get-away to the great lake and canada andy further observe yes just as you say the other remark and now since we have learn this much frank what be we go to do about it -- try and find where the steal biplane be and do something so as to make it no good for they purpose or just slip away go round a little like we be just out for a spin and get back to bloomsbury put they wise neither just yet anyhow the older bird boy remark not the first because it would be take big chance if as we believe one of the robber be conceal near where the steal biplane may happen to be lie partly hide with dead leaf so it could not be notice from above and he would be apt to do something we would find unpleasant and as for go back and tell we 'll have to be mighty careful there and why frank well to begin with even the wall have ear they say and if the police be suddenly call back from they hunt to the southwest the fact might get to the robber and you know what would happen then oh say andy shrug he shoulder i suppose they would just throw this second job up and cut stick for canada as fast as they could make the aeroplane spin which would be too bad for chief waller and joe green and the rest of that bunch at headquarters who be already figure on how they 'll spend they reward money they hope to get when the bank pay for rounding-up the two thief but perhaps if we just tell we father andy they might get a few bold man together and lay a beautiful trap for the fellow so that when they break into the pay-car they would be make prisoner bully idea that frank and i hope you decide to carry it out just to think what a pleasant surprise it would be for we butterfly collector expect that he be go in to gather in another lot of plunder and then to hear a voice say to he : ` hand up you be we prisoner ' oh would not i like to be johnny-on-the-spot when that happen wonder if they would not let we have a part in the proceedings after we bring the news that upset the plan of the yeggman that will do for just now andy because here come sally again let 's be gaping at the wonderful collection that almost cost the professor he very life in all sort of hot country as well as a whole pocket full of money -- if you do not care what you say and when the farmer 's daughter do enter the room a minute later she see the two boy stand there a rapt look of admiration and envy on they face as they stare at the little case of common local butterfly which possibly some boy have gather together and then dispose of for a song while the young aviator have in this fashion about decide on they plan of action they see no reason for any hurry the day be still long and when they feel like start toward home it would take they but a very short time to get there meanwhile there seem to be some sort of fascination hold they to the neighborhood of the hoskin ' farm and when they go away a little later it would be with the idea of hang about and see if the odd little professor might not come along both of they think they would like to look at he the man who be capable of play such a clever game as this must surely be worth see then again the fact that casper blue once upon a time have be a daring birdman have something to do with this interest on the part of frank and he cousin because there be always a certain fellow feeling between those who be engage in the same dangerous pursuit but possibly andy on he part be hope secretly that by spy around they might be able in some way to learn where the yeggman have hide the plunder they have take from the loot bloomsbury bank chapter xv when casper come back although the bird boy have more than once before prove that they possess all the courage and daring a successful aviator must have in order to accomplish the difficult task hourly present to he for solution it must not be think that they be reckless to any degree andy might be slightly incline that way but frank be a exceedingly careful navigator of the air and by degree he influence be even affect he younger cousin as example always will when however a situation suddenly arise that absolutely require a display of daring these young air pilot be there with the punch as andy term it they have learn how to volplane earthward from a dizzy height with absolute safety when condition be just right and necessity require a quick descent on a few occasion frank have even be know to hazard what be know as the death dip but it be only when there happen to be a good reason for take such chance and not merely in a spirit of dare-deviltry such as many show aviator employ just to send a shiver of dread through the spectator and then laugh recklessly at the fear they boldness have arouse of course they might have decide to immediately return to bloomsbury and give information concern the extent of they discovery since come to the hoskin ' farm perhaps that would have be the wisest move they could make but both boy be rather oppose to carry it out just then the afternoon be wholly before they and who could tell what change of plan the two yeggman might make before the come of the night should they get wind of the presence of the bird boy in the vicinity possibly they would take alarm and hurry to they conceal biplane make for the far north with all haste and in this way if no one know of they departure the intended ambuscade that night in the vicinity of the railroad pay-car would be lay in vain that be really what the boy fear the most -- that they quarry slip off in secret when they be far away frank be indeed try to figure out whether it would not be best after all for he to stay by the hydroplane on guard as it be while andy by use a horse if the hoskin happen to still possess such a animal manage to get to another farm where they be up-to-date enough to have a telephone in the house by means of which he could get in touch with dr bird or judge lawson in bloomsbury then again there be always a slight chance that this pretended professor might have see they descend while he be wander around once a airman and just by instinct as it be the eye be almost constantly search the heaven perhaps for a glimpse of other adventurous craft or it may be sign that give warning of treacherous wind gather storm or similar thing that must always be of intense interest to a aviator and so while casper blue have long since give up take hazard in a fly machine to indulge in even more dangerous business as a bank robber still habit would cling tightly and thus he might have see more than the ordinary man could have do of course even though he seek the hydroplane and find it lie there in the field he could not very well make any use of it so long as frank hold the missing part in he possession but he could in a spirit of maliciousness so utterly destroy the plane and even injure the powerful little kinkaid engine that it would be practically fit only for the scrap-heap afterwards and that be give frank more or less concern even while he continue to linger at the farmhouse because andy wish to prowl around a little while longer in hope of get some clue to the location of the cache where the thief have hide they plunder sallie see nothing strange in this apparent desire of andy to hang around she be rather a pretty little thing and of course know it so that she may have believe the witchery of she attraction have more or less to do with the matter even when frank ask so many queer question about the absent boarder sallie be not wise enough to understand that the boy be much more concerned about how professor whiteside amuse himself where he favorite lounge place seem to be and all that rather than in she pretty face and merry laugh she mother must have count on have she assistance in carry on she task of put up preserve in the kitchen for once more she call to sallie to come and lend a hand for a few moment this leave the two boy alone again and give they a chance for exchange view which they be not slow to do i guess he do not keep it around here in this room or anywhere close by be andy 's first remark frank chuckle on hearing this oh i see that you have get you mind set on recover what be take from the bank you be a mercenary fellow andy but then since we father have more or less interest in the same bank which be go to be mighty badly cripple if the cash and security be not recover sooner or later why i can not blame you much i would like to run across the loot myself more than i can tell you i be only afraid that if the man be take prisoner to night when they come to clean out the pay-car after it arrive in bloomsbury they 'll not have this other stuff with they and will refuse to tell where it be hide that will be just as bad for the bank as if they would get away to canada with the swag as the chief call it i wish i know how we could track this casper blue to where the other yegg be hide near the biplane and watch they until we see where they have the cache after that we could just hang around and when they start in a power-boat perhaps for bloomsbury with todd pemberton at the wheel we could do something to make the biplane useless to they and then toward evening put for home ourselves frank listen while the other run all of this off and evidently he be more or less amuse at what he hear it be plain to be see that you have be do some tall thinking and plan all this while andy he remark but you 'll admit i guess that if there be any way to carry out my scheme it would be a jim dandy idea the other persist of course but that be where the trouble lie even if casper do come back we never could track he through the wood and around the swamp without he sooner or later discover that he be be follow because we be not clever at that sort of thing and once he get wind of we be after he chance be he would lay some trap with he mate into which both of we would tumble headlong andy scratch he head and a look of doubt come upon he face h be i would not like that one little bit and that be a fact frank he admit candidly if we fall into they hand and be kick around and then leave tie up like a pair of mummy from the pyramid of egypt while they go and clean out that pay-car and sail away for canda -- oh excuse I if you please anything but that the laugh would sure be on the bird boy i do not mind pose once in a while as a hero but it would jar I a whole lot to know that people be point I out and tell how nicely these wonderful bird boy have be take in and do for by a couple of travel yegg have it you own way frank and do not pay any attention to my silly scheme you idea be all right andy but the only trouble be they be too strong for a couple of boy to carry out i think we would be wise to play safe more game be win in the long run that way than by be dashing and venturesome of course you be right and as i have have my little fling and get it out of my system let 's work along the sensible line you lay out frank that be just like andy he might occasionally seem to yearn to break loose and take a wild flight but on second sober thought he nearly always come back to he cousin 's way of think sallie still remain in the kitchen so that they be able to keep on talk without any fear of be interrupted or overheard i be wonder if percy will ever have the chance to handle he farman biplane again andy go on to remark he seem to set a great store by it to offer such a nice fat reward for its return and it be so brand new that he have not have much of a chance to try it out be not he mad though when he come race along in that car look for chief waller he look as red as a turkey gobbler just to think that while he be up there with three of he crony try to injure we machine those yegg be fix it all up so that they could get he biplane if they miss ours it be a rich joke on perc oh i hope he get it back again safe and sound say frank life would be rather tame for we around home here if we do not have percy to think about for a long time now he be keep we guess and we would feel a little lonely if he give up fly guess you be right there frank it would seem humdrum like if we do not have to think of he every little while and what new scheme he be plan to get the better of the bird boy and say some of he game kind of dazzle a fellow if only there be not so much meanness about 'em when perc get to hate a fellow he do not stop half way but go the whole hog why more than a few time he be give we a big scare try to do some stunt that would make we look small and at the risk of send we all down a thousand or two foot after all i be begin to believe i would sleep sounder if percy carberry take to some other play and let aeroplane alone well he seem just as wild about they as ever and so i reckon he 'll just keep on bother we to the end of the chapter but what be you look at andy and frank also turn he eye down toward the fringe of quince tree that mark the old lane lead to the barnyard from the road i think i see some one come over there and if it turn out to be we good friend the profess p ` rap we would be wise to skip out before he sight we frank here let 's step back out of sight anyhow so as to be ready to slip away if it be we man and frank draw he companion around the corner of the house from which point they could still keep watch over the lane half a minute later andy whisper : there i see he again frank and as sure as anything it must be casper he be a little man wear brown glass to keep the bright sun from he eye and yes he be carry a butterfly catcher 's net over he shoulder shall we disappear i think that would be we best move andy and lucky enough we have get the chance to slip around here and get back of the barn before he come along with which the two boy hasten to follow out the plan suggest chapter xvi throw off the mask do you think he see we frank ask andy after they have find a place where they could peep around a corner without be discover well that be more than i can say the other reply we take every precaution and unless he have mighty sharp eye he could not have glimpse we and you think it be safe for we to stay here eh frank certainly reply the other we be in a position to make a move any old way from here there be not one chance in ten of he come around the corner and if he do make a show of do that why we can be sit here play mumble-de-peg or something like that just as if we do not care whether school keep or not bully for that who care for expense look frank i be right you see for it be the little profess after all yes sure enough careful now andy and do not let he see you peep that would give the whole thing away quicker than anything else they have both select position where they could see without attract attention and it be with considerable eagerness that they fasten they eye on the figure of the small wiry man who be saunter along toward the farmhouse carry a butterfly-net across one shoulder while with he other hand he hold a queer-shaped black case which as sallie say contain he more recent capture in the way of beautiful and rare moth and insect that be he stiff arm frank see how he move it -- the one hang down i mean with black box -- good gracious now i wonder -- h ` sh whisper frank not so loud he might hear you not with the rooster crow like they be say andy confidently but just glimpse the black box would you frank i be look return the other he call it the receiver for he new butterfly but look more like a kodak to I andy go on but d'ye know what i think frank tell I whisper the other still watch the professor who have come to a stop at some little distance away and seem to be busily engage look back of he as though lay out plan for a afternoon campaign among the bright winged butterfly why how easy for he to tear out the inside work of a camera box like that and make use of it for a better purpose see andy go on to say oh now you have get a bright thought for a fact frank send back careful not to raise he voice above that cautious pitch well it could be do and i guess that little black box would hold about all the money and security that the bank lose they say the thief only pick out the papers they could dispose of and leave all the rest which would indicate that the second yegg must have be in the banking line some time or other and know what be what h ` sh he be come on again lie low now andy accordingly both of they remain perfectly motionless as the professor advance toward the house have he show any disposition to head toward that particular corner frank be ready to assume a attitude of indifference and appear to be engage in some boyish game with he jack knife toss it up in the air and cause the point of the long blade to stick upright in the ground but the small man with the brown glass and the butterfly net make straight for the front porch of the house and pass in at the door just as though he feel perfectly at home there well what next remark andy for reply the other beckon and start hurriedly to gain the shelter of the woodsh near by what be this for question andy when they be once more crouch down in a position where they could not be easily see stop and think answer the other if he just happen to look out of a window on this side of the house he would see we easily and we suspicious action would tell he we be on to he game now even if he look he will not see anything huh and do we stay here all afternoon just do nothing while p ` rap he be take a nap indoors grumble the other who want to be move and be never satisfy when not in action wait be all frank would say perhaps he could see further ahead than he cousin and guess something of what be likely to occur they have not take pain to warn sallie or she mother to keep from mention the fact of they happen around and chance be that as soon as casper blue hear that the bird boy have drop in he would become immediately suspicious on question the girl he would be apt to learn how curious frank and andy have seem about he and sallie might even admit that they have ask to see he wonderful collection of rare and costly butterfly well if such a thing do occur of course the keen-witted man would immediately know that the cat be out of the bag realize that there must be a great hue and cry throughout the entire county just then with reference to the yegg who have loot the bank he could easily imagine what have bring these boy here through association with todd pemberton casper must have learn a whole lot with regard to frank and he cousin be a aviator himself he would naturally take a immediate interest in boy who have give such a good account of themselves in the field of aeronautics the attempt to steal the hydroplane in the first place before they turn to percy carberry 's biplane prove that they know all about the bird boy and so learning of they presence would immediately give casper warning that he hideout be no longer a secret but that the net of the law must be close around he what then would he like a desperate man attempt to capture these venturesome lad so as to keep they from inform the authority at bloomsbury either that or else he would think that since the game be up and they could no longer loiter in the neighborhood of the arouse district in order to carry out the second part of the great scheme they have better take to the aeroplane and vanish from view leave no trail behind by means of which they could be follow frank have say all this in he mind when he lay there and wait to see what would turn up he feel that they could surely afford to linger for some time if there be any chance of learn whether the yeggmen mean to change they plan or proceed to carry out they original scheme all seem quiet at the farmhouse sallie have come out on the porch and look rather disappoint to find that the two boy have strangely vanish she stand there glance around in a puzzle manner for several minute and then with a pretty shrug of she shoulder and a pout of she lip whirl about and go back into the house again wow say andy in a low tone she be get it in for you frank because you drop out of sight without even so much as say goodbye but the other be think of weightier matter than the humor of a little coquette he wonder whether sallie would run across the professor and ask he if he have meet two boy down the lane which remark would excite he suspicion and lead to other question now on he part if nothing happen inside of half a hour frank be of a mind to try the plan that have come to he -- send andy off to try and reach some other farm where they would have a telephone while he himself remain to keep watch that might necessitate take sallie into they confidence for they would need to ask question and perhaps borrow a horse on second thought frank be now a little sorry he have not see fit to tell the girl all she seem to be fairly clever and could possibly keep a secret at any rate the chance of discovery would not be nearly so serious as now when in she ignorance she be likely to blurt out all about the boy have be there without know that in so do she might be assist clever yeggman to avoid arrest the seconds move along and change into minute if the professor have come to a window on that side of the house to look anxiously around he must have be careful not to expose himself for though frank have keep a keen lookout he have fail to see anything of he it be get very much of a bear to andy he change he position restlessly several time as though he wish frank would make some sort of a move he hardly care what its nature so long as it mean action but although andy could not see it at that moment there be lively enough time ahead of they to please even he impetuous nature and the passage of every minute bring the crisis closer and closer once frank believe he hear loud voice inside the farmhouse and at the same time some one be certainly hurry back and forth but then possibly that might be only sallie obey another call from the kitchen where the good woman be so busily engage with she canning operation something like twenty minute must have pass since the boy make they change of base to andy it be much longer for he feel the time pass as though it have leaden wing then frank watch see some one come hastily out of the front door pass quickly down to the path and move away in the direction of the lane he be go off frank exclaimed andy all excitement just as though he half expect that he companion would give the word that mean a immediate pursuit yes keep quiet andy but he 'll give we the slip do not you see persist the other let he then we can not help it you can see that he be make quite a change in he look as though he be throw the mask off and do not expect to play the part of a collegeman and a bug collector any more frank whisper that be so he have not get the brown glass on and that old butterfly net be miss but frank just notice will not you how he hang to that little camera-like black box say perhaps i be right after all perhaps casper blue be carry all that stuff crib from the bloomsbury bank inside the same the two boy crouch there behind the woodsh and by cautiously peep around the corner could watch the late boarder of the hoskin hurry down the lane as though he have receive a hasty summons from the president of he college demand a immediate return he seem uneasy and suspicious for several time he turn he head and look this way and that as though half expect to discover some person ready to dispute he departure and frank also note the way one of he hand have of keep in the pocket of he short coat just for all the world as though he might be grasp some sort of pistol that be conceal there chapter xvii sallie ride bareback and now what be we next move demand andy who generally find it very nice to let frank do all the planning though capable of take hold himself when force to do it fortunately frank have a great way of figure out what he would do under certain condition this give some sort of assurance when difficulty arise for there be little time lose in fix thing up so as to have a program no use try to follow after he to begin with he declare why do you say that he cousin want to know first of all it would be a bad business because he be on he guard and a desperate man frank go on to explain you can see that he be ready to pull out a weapon of some sort at the first warning and we settle that we do not want to fall into the hand of these two bad man so we 'll have to arrange thing along a different line and anyhow there be no terrible hurry because i rather guess they have get the biplane hide some distance away from here it would take half a hour perhaps much more before they could get out and we can reach we craft in a few minute if push yes that be all so frank but go on and tell I the rest i be think that we ought to try and let we folk know how thing be go with we so that if we have to cut out after these yegg aviator they 'll know where we have go suppose now you hunt sallie up and try to explain it all to she just as fast as you can who I oh well i guess i can do it if i have to but what will you be do all that time frank i want to write a message to either you father or else judge lawson whichever she can get on the phone reply the other immediately hunting in he pocket for pencil and paper which he make it a habit to carry around with he always she -- say do you mean sallie frank no other you must coax she to saddle up a horse and make for the nearest neighbor where they have get a phone get that andy but do you think she will ask the other dubiously i be dead sure of it come the confident reply sallie have a touch of romance in she make-up and besides shell be so mad to think of that man deceive she mother that she 'll want to have he catch get along with you now andy and fix it all up inside of ten minute i 'll have the message write out by that time so she can start if there be such a thing as any kind of a horse around this wreck of a farm and so andy glad at least to have something to do hurry toward the house to look for the country girl leave alone frank continue to write as plainly as he could what he want those in bloomsbury to know about matter in general he use as few word to cover the case as possible but give the lead point even to state he fear that the scoundrel who have rob the bank and be plot to also make a descent on the pay-car of the railroad that night have now take the alarm and would be off in the steal biplane in that event frank want the police in bloomsbury to know that he and andy have start in pursuit though what they could do to apprehend the rogue of course he be in no position to declare by the time he have this finish to he satisfaction he hear voice near by and be glad to see he cousin come accompany by sallie the girl look duly excite just as frank have expect there be a thousand question in she eye but he cut all this short we can not stop to tell you any more now sallie but we promise to drop in again after it be over and explain all that seem queer to you now here be the message that we want to get to bloomsbury the worst kind and as quick as you could get on a horse and ride to the nearest neighbor who have a phone in the house you 'll do this for we will not you sallie few people could say no to frank once he wear that win smile and sallie immediately declare that she be ready to do anything he suggest to think of that little scoundrel fool we all and pretend to be a college professor she remark indignation flash from she black eye i hope you have get a horse say frank sticking to the business in hand oh yes we have one leave that might do sallie answer then let 's get he saddle right away frank go on can not she snap back be not such a thing as a saddle around here any more but i be a country girl you know and i can ride bareback all right a halter 's the only bridle i want frank give I the message and i 'll see that it get to somebody in bloomsbury and here be some money sallie the other go on what do you think -- there might be something to pay you know and we can not afford to take chance when there be so much at stake thank you a thousand time for help we out sallie now please get the horse i would like to see you start before we pull out because we may have to chase after these fellow in we aeroplane if they take a notion to fly away the girl hasten to lead the way into the stable where they do find a apology for a horse which she immediately unhitch and lead outside hope she do not happen to run across that man on the way because he might wonder what be take she off like that and do something to turn she back what if he find you message on she frank and andy as he say this turn a anxious gaze upon he cousin but frank shake he head i see he dodge out of the lane and take to the wood he remark as though he know of a short-cut across lot to the place where he friend and the biplane be hide no danger of he see sallie so do not mention it to she wait i 'll give you my hand to help you up sallie but the country girl have lead the horse alongside the drinking trough and be on he back in a jiffy long before frank could come across goodbye and good luck boy she call back as she give the horse a switch with the end of the halter and be off at a lumbering pace they stand there a minute or so watch the girl fly down the lane she turn around once and wave she hand at they while she long hair blow behind in a cloud frank would not soon forget the sight of sallie hoskin go to carry the news to a point where it could be telephone in to town -- news that would cause a tremendous wave of excitement to pass over the whole of bloomsbury hurrah that be do and well do too frank i say exclaimed andy turn on he cousin with a face that plainly say what be next on we program before we pull out i guess we owe it to the good woman to tell she something of the truth for i do not believe she know a single thing about it from sallie or the professor so come along to the kitchen with I andy then we 'll chase off to where we leave we aeroplane and stand ready for anything that may happen the two of they quickly reach the kitchen door inside they find mr hoskin tire look and red of face still busily engage with she canning operation for peach be ripe and tomato need immediate attention if she hope to lay away she customary stock for the come winter she come to the door where it be cooler a look of rise curiosity on she patient face and frank start in to tell what he think necessary she be at first much worry to learn that she have be innocently harbor a criminal under she humble roof but frank soon allay she fear on that account he also tell she how sallie have consent to ride over to a neighbor to send a telephone message for he so that the good woman might not be worry over she absence and now have do what he consider he duty frank begin to think it might be the part of wisdom for himself and he cousin to consider they own affair and make for the spot where they hydro-aeroplane lay in the field oh i do hope they be catch say the farmer 's wife just to think of that easy talk little man be a desperate criminal i shall be afraid to stay all alone in the house after this listen frank somebody 's shout out there what if both of those yegg be come back to get we andy have clutch the sleeve of he cousin 's coat when say this but frank do not need to be tell that something like excitement be bear down upon they oh it be jerry my husband exclaim mr hoskin just then and he seem to be dreadfully excite too listen to he call to I i wonder what could have happen what if he be go and cut himself badly always digging and make hole in the ground since that silly old fortune teller say he would find a mine on the farm and here he come too just then a figure come stagger around the corner of the house it be the old farmer plainly tremendously excite and although weak and almost out of breath from run try to tell she something it be there jennie -- find it wife -- be not have all my work for nothin ' i tell you a vein of hard coal think enough to make we all rich d'ye hear that jennie girl rich gimme a drink of water for i be nigh dead from runnin ' to tell you the great news who be these boy wife where 's sallie at frank would have like very much to remain and hear the particulars of the farmer 's good luck in locate a vein of coal on he property but time would not permit he only hope hoskin be not mistake for trace of coal have be know to exist around that neighborhood for some time though up to now none have be find in pay quantity for mining purpose come on andy we 'll have to be skip out please tell you husband all you know about what be happen mr hoskin hope you have strike it rich sir with that frank hurry off andy trail behind the farmer stare after they as though hardly know what to make of it all but they could hear the good woman begin to explain and have no doubt she would be able to satisfy he reasonable curiosity for the time be the bird boy must forget all about what lay in the past because it be the future that should interest they wholly they have reach a point in the hunt where perhaps a sudden change of plan would be necessary particularly if those they follow have take the alarm and be ready to shake the dust of this section of the country from they shoe away from the farmhouse hurry the two young aviator make as near a bee line for the field where they have leave they aeroplane as they could possibly manage and all the while search the sky for sign of the other fly machine chapter xviii a aeroplane chase here it be and everything seem all right remark andy as they reach the field and find the hydro-aeroplane just where they have leave it yes no one have disturb a thing which i think be lucky for we frank go on to say as he proceed to put back the small part he have take away with he and thus place the machine in perfect condition for business andy move about look to see that all obstacle threaten to interfere with a successful launching be remove from in front of the wait aeroplane so minute pass until at least ten have creep by since they come frank have everything tune up and know of not the least chance where he could improve the condition of plane or motor for all seem to be as nearly perfect as they could be make both boy cast frequent glance aloft and as a rule toward that particular quarter where they presently expect to see something move they be key up to a pretty lively pitch of excitement though frank do not show it half as much as he younger cousin who be always affect this way then suddenly andy call out : there she rise frank oh look at they bore up will you in that corkscrew spiral way tell I that casper blue do not know he business perc will never get as much out of he biplane as that old and experienced aviator mean to be we go to follow suit frank get aboard come the prompt answer and it be almost laughable to see how nimbly andy obey this order frank lose no time in start and they go away with a rush pass over the abandon field that be now give up pretty much to thistle and burdock with a sprinkling of iron-weed it be rather rough sledding to be sure and as the bicycle wheel pound over the turf the boy have to hold on to keep they seat but when sufficient momentum have be acquire frank elevate the fore plane and immediately there be the greatest relief feel for they begin to rise in the air and all that terrible bumping stop for good the change be wonderful and it feel as though they be glide on velvet we be off exclaimed andy exultantly frank say nothing he do not possess quite the same sanguine nature that he cousin have andy seldom allow thought of possible disaster to annoy he but on the other hand frank be always try to head off trouble he realize that with this launching of they new hydro-aeroplane they would be enter upon a extra hazardous game the outcome of which no one could foresee the two man whom they expect to follow must be desperate fellow who would resort to almost any hazard rather than allow themselves to be catch and it be not a amateur aviator like percy carberry who be oppose to they now but one who have have long experience in the art of harness a fly machine to do he bidding once they leave the ground behind they frank start to spiral upward much in the same way the other have do one thing he be glad of and this be the presence of andy alongside casper blue might be a daring air pilot but with he companion a perfect greenhorn in all that pertain to the art he would be more or less handicap a sudden incautious movement on the part of the novice might prove the undoing of the precious pair once they have rise to a certain height and the aeroplane be turn so as to follow the other air craft which be speed away head directly into the north of course those aboard must know that they be be chase they could not have fail to see the hydroplane -lrb- as it be generally call though the true word to cover it would be hydro-aeroplane -rrb- even before it leave the field once they start to ascend well we be off at last comment andy in a satisfied tone when the course have be take and they be follow directly after the fugitive air craft and let 's hope we 'll come out of this adventure as luckily as we have on other occasion remark sober frank wonder if perc happen to be look this way right now andy go on to say chance be that he be get he old field glass level and be search the heaven right along in hope of locate he lose machine and say if he do glimpse this fine parade right now can not you see he turn green with envy to think of another glorious chance come to the hate bird boy oh my oh I but it would be gall and wormwood to perc just as like as not he would take a fit but frank be not give any time to such thought as these more serious affair engage he attention when once he leave the firm footing of the solid earth and invade the upper current where up to lately man have never travel save in a drift balloon he always put levity aside and pay strict attention to business the panorama below they be constantly change and the boy could not but admire the picture thus present to they gaze no matter how often one may go up a thousand foot or more above the earth it be next to impossible to weary of the wonderful scene that keep pass constantly in review as the buzz motor keep carry the aeroplane along over plain valley hill forest river and village or town that chance to lie in the route to andy it be all somewhat in the nature of a grand picnic for he nature be not one to contemplate peril at a distance have he and frank just come out for a hour 's spin he could not have show more delight as they go whirling through space with that rival flier a mile or two ahead do you think we be gain on they ask andy after some time have elapse and the country below begin to get unfamiliar prove that they have now come beyond the range of any previous trip take to the northward of bloomsbury i do not know for sure reply he cousin sometimes i think we be and then again i be a little in doubt suppose you get the glass out and see what they be do andy well i be a great one forget all about that bully marine glass as he say this andy hasten to feel for the article in question which be always keep handy because there never could be any tell when they might want to use it in a hurry go slow no use rock the boat sing out the pilot who be forever caution he companion with regard to quick motion when seat in such a delicately balanced contraption as a biplane it be a good thing that we have get that new fool-proof contrivance that mr wright invent on this machine right now because only for that you would be give I more than a few scare when you swing from one side to the other so quickly a minute later and andy who have be look through the glass speak again it be a little hard to cover they steadily because they keep rise and dip just like we be but i can see that little casper blue and the man alongside of he be a much larger chap of course it be casper who be pilot the biplane remark frank yes and he know the rope let I tell you i do not believe there be many professional birdman today who can go ahead of that man i only wish you could take a squint through here and watch how he manipulate the lever in spite of that stiff arm of he only for that and he would still be in the harness and do stunt that would have beachy left far behind either that or else he would be bury remark frank drily oh well the less we have to say about that the better i 'll feel frank if you be go in for aviation at all you have just get to forget all about be in constant danger though i hope i 'll never get so i 'll be reckless like perc carberry but frank sure we seem to be pick up a little on that crowd and from the way they keep look back all the while i guess they know it too perhaps we be frank go on to say but if i really think so i would cut down a peg or two in we speed at that andy set up a howl at least he voice he objection well that be a queer stunt for you to do i must say frank here we be chase after we game and the very first time we believe we be gain some you inform I you mean to cut down we speed be that the way to win the game tell I but we do not want to come up with they while we be boom along like this you understand venture frank as he gently move a lever just a trifle this sort of racing be a lot different from what you would do on the ground down there suppose we do come abreast of that biplane right now what good would that do we could we put out a hand and arrest the yeggman would not it be more likely that such desperate man as these must be would try some sort of game look to disable we craft and send we tumble down to we death no excuse I from come to close quarter up here with such hard case honest now andy if they begin to circle around as if they mean to turn on we i would think it my duty to run oh exclaim andy you mean you would coax 'em to follow we back to bloomsbury and then give themselves up be that it frank oh but you be a cunning chap sure you be but on the level now what be we game if it do not mean we be go to overtake 'em i 'll tell you andy we ought to keep follow after they as far as we can and in that way learn where they drop if we get a chance to send down a occasional message to be send on to bloomsbury so much the better i have write several such out and have the cord to tie they to weight give a chance when we be pass over some town perhaps we can get one such message send on home even that would tell they where we be and what the chance be great game frank suppose you let I have those message and i 'll be amusing myself get the same ready to heave when you say the word we c 'n play that this be a war game and we have be send out to drop bomb on the fortification of the enemy we have do it with rock and we can throw pretty straight so it seem to I we ought to get some sort of fun out of it all around frank tell he where he could find the write message in he outer pocket and for some time andy be quiet busy himself in fasten some sort of anchor to each piece of paper sufficient to carry it earthward despite the breeze that at the time might be blow all at once andy notice that they be go quite slowly in comparison with the pace they have lately be hit up what be happen frank he exclaim almost alarmed lest some accident have befall the reliable little motor which up to now have never fail they no matter how great the call upon its resource why be we slow up be there something go wrong and must we own up to be beat look ahead at the biplane be all that frank reply chapter xix drop a bomb oh we have start to swoop down on they honest to goodness i do not believe they be more 'n half as far ahead as they be frank cried andy thrill by the sight of the other biplane be so near just about that say frank quietly the busy motor have decrease its merry hum so that they could talk without raise they voice very much then you must have let out a extra kink do you frank when i be busy with my bomb demand the other oh no come the answer the fact of the matter be andy they have drop off a lot of they speed and that be how we cover space quicker something go wrong with percy 's new gnome engine then have it and he blow he horn so about what wonder it be go to do huh and andy chuckle in he boyish delight no i do not believe that be the reason they have slacken they speed andy try to save gasolene then pursue the other hardly that either andy oh now i see what you mean frank the poor old greenhorn 's get cold foot and be make casper slow down he think that there be less chance of a tumble if the speed be reduce just as if that could make any particular difference i reckon you be away off yet persist frank then for goodness ' sake will not you tell I what they have cut notch out of they speed for because i be all ball up and bless if i can think of another thing oh look at that frank sure as anything i see a puff of smoke then there must be something the matter with they engine and they be get scared i would not be surprise a mite to see they settle right away and try to land well you see smoke all right and if you would listen sharp you would have hear a sassy little bark at the same time andy a what frank call it a snarl then take up you glass andy and look while i drop out even a little more of we speed so we 'll fall back further hardly have andy clap the glass to he eye than he give vent to a exclamation of mingled amazement and alarm that greenhorn be look this way frank and as sure as goodness he be point at we right now oh he do something then for i see another puff of smoke and it come right from he hand why he be shoot at we frank that must be a gun he be get in he hand and he be try to hit we if we motor do not keep up such a constant whirl we might have hear the whine of that lead when it go singing past we yes perhaps we might frank go on to say composedly but what can we do demand the other nervously nothing more than decrease we own speed as often as they do and play the game of tag backwards if they get go it too strong why just as i say before i 'll turn tail and head back toward bloomsbury daring they to follow which you can be sure they will not because we town be a mighty unhealthy place just now for casper blue and he pal there he fire again that make three time he be try it frank and i guess he can try the other three without do we any damage andy you believe that do you ask the one speak to sure thing frank reply positively why it would be one chance in ten thousand that he could strike any part of we aeroplane at that distance go as both of we be and with only a revolver i would be willing to let he blaze away all day without be a bit afraid but i be bind that the two air craft must keep at least this distance apart the man in the other airship do fire three more time but without any success whatever and as though the rival navigator realize that frank 's tactic would effectually prevent he come into closer contact with the pursue craft he no longer try to close in but increase he speed be quickly about the old distance away whereupon frank bird also hit up the pace cautiously that be the ticket cry out andy presently i guess we be hold we own again now for a little while i begin to be afraid that they be go to just make we take they dust and give we the merry ha-ha vanish in the distance but now i know you have get the twist of the thing down fine frank and can haul up on the biplane or drop back just as you feel like for a long time they keep on neither say anything for talk be always more or less of a effort when speed along in a aeroplane with the wind striking one in the face frank have have no time to fully adjust the muffler which he usually wear about he neck when about to soar to a dizzy height so he would have to do the best he could and besides there be little chance of the other aeroplane venture to bear upward to any unusual degree all the effort of the bank thief be direct toward make they escape he do have he goggles adjust however which be a good thing since he eye must have water very much from the cold air and this be consider a ever present source of danger to one who manipulate the lever of a mile-a-minute aeroplane we seem to have drop a good deal lower frank remark andy after another space of time have elapse yes remark the pilot tersely and i be look now for a good chance to make use of one of my bomb do not you think it be about time to try the scheme out andy continue just as you feel like reply frank then at the very next town or place that look like it have telephone connection with the outside world i be go to have a try might have do it when we pass over that last place where the people be all wave thing up at we and we could just hear a confused shout i bet you frank they just think this be a regular air contest with a prize offer to the winner well it be observe the other if we win we take back we prisoner and on the other hand if they come out first best they get away to canada with they liberty and they plunder yes it be a race all right andy a test of skill and endurance and perhaps the best man will win then i know who that will be declare andy enthusiastically do not be too sure warn frank though it must have pleased he to know that he possess the fullest confidence of he cousin and chum who have be he constant companion on so many expedition and must understand he like a book what if they keep everlastingly at it and night come on ask andy presently well there be the moon though i do not like chase along this way after sundown and if we be put to it we have get we fine search-light you must remember frank reply there i believe we be go to pass right over another town frank it do look that way for a fact admit the other casper do not see any reason why he should bother change he set course due north because he happen to pass a few town away up here in the northern end of the state let the people stare all they want to he be be use to have crowd gape at he you know and rather like it besides if he get away what do it matter andy prepared himself for the little job he have on hand as he have practice throw stone from the aeroplane while at a great height just to see how near he could come to hit a certain place far below so as to ascertain what chance aviator would have of make bomb tell in war time the boy believe he would be able to drop he message pretty accurately in some open place close to where the townspeople be cluster and see it fall some one would be sure to hurry over to secure the mysterious object here go we old broken wrench which have be hang around so long declare andy as lean carefully over he measure distance with he eye and suddenly let the object slip take care to make all allowance for they speed this be more of a trick than most boy would suppose the next time you be on a speeding electric car throw a stone at a telegraph pole just as you be pass it and see how much beyond the missile will alight because of the momentum it receive because of the fact of its start from the move car andy have this pretty well figure out and know just when to launch he weighted message he turn he head and try to follow it downward as well as he be able because of the flutter white paper it be go straight there frank i do believe he exclaim as he manage to get the powerful glass up to he eye and fairly follow the progress of the message though quickly lose it again yes and the crowd there on the green must see it come because already a bunch of boy have start to jump that way they 'll find it easy enough frank now what d'ye think of that for a successful bomb throw good enough for you andy be the hearty response and we 'll have to take it as a sign that we be go to come out of this scrape as we generally do with we color fly frank usually allow himself to feel the fullest belief in he own ability at the same time he always wish to avoid over-confidence again time pass on and the hum of the busy motor be the only sound that come to the ear of the two young aviator they be again make nearly full speed though andy feel pretty confident that have it be necessary for frank to coax a additional unit or two of hurry from the gallant little kinkaid engine it would respond to he effort my but we must have cover a lot of distance since we start be the next remark from andy how long do you suppose we have be go frank look and see it be just five minute after one when we leave the field on the hoskin farm andy two hour frank now what d'ye think of that why i never would have believe it if you would tell I do you think my watch have jump on ahead no because we have be hustle right along all of that time i guess andy keep everlastingly at it and head due north all the while say andy as straight as a die they never vary they course even a little bit as far as i could see the pilot declare but we have cover a awful lot of apace frank i guess you be right there admit the one address and frank if we keep on this way and nothing happen we ought to sight the big lake away ahead there inside of ` half a hour more i should think andy venture to say and he be thrill when he companion turn toward he just at that moment go on to say : perhaps in less time than that andy with the glass you might glimpse it even now chapter xx over land and sea be you josh I frank demand the other bird boy as he swing eagerly around so as to fix he glass upon the far off horizon ahead of they i certainly be not andy but please be more careful how you move you give I a punch in the rib just then that send a cold shiver all over I do not forget that we be not stretch out on the ground under a apple tree take a afternoon doze well what do you see frank i do believe you be right about that lake business exclaim andy then you can see it ask the other himself more than anxious because of the fact that the flee bank robber who have steal the biplane of percy carberry apparently intend to escape over the line into canada even if to accomplish they purpose they have to daringly cross lake ontario many mile wide a feat as yet only successfully do by one or two bold flier of national repute i sure can and the way we be head it be a dead open-and-shut thing that we be just go to swing out over the water before another hour pass whew andy finish he sentence with this significant exclamation it be as though not only the novelty of the thing but its thrilling nature stagger he the bird boy have fly under many strange condition but as yet they have not make a water flight there be and always must be a vast difference between pass over the land with its forest hill valley plain city and village to start out over a wide stretch of inland sea with only the tumble wave far below and new as well as untried current of air to meet and conquer more than a few time andy bird have express a wish to have just such a experience it would be a novelty something entirely new in they line and which would give they possibly delightful thrill but now that the chance seem open up before they he find himself view it with considerable apprehension as well as delight of course it make considerable difference that they should be chase after a desperate pair of rascal rather than simply try to accomplish a flight from united state territory to that belong to canada there be always the chance that these man might turn upon they and succeed in do something to injure the hydroplane cause it to drop into the midst of that inland sea strange how small thing often insist upon thrust themselves forward when some sort of peril threaten the very first thing andy seem to think about be the fact that they do not happen to have any life preserver aboard the craft not that there be one chance in a thousand they would ever need such thing around bloomsbury though there be lake sunrise to be reckon with but just then it strike the boy that every well equip aeroplane ought always to carry a couple of rubber ring along which in moment of dire necessity could be blow full of air and would serve to sustain wreck aviator until help come he even decide to mention this fact to he cousin after this voyage be conclude it loom up as large as the rock of gibralter just then even as a dream may at the moment of awake but which later on begin to lose its realistic effect until it seem next door to silly they do not show the least sign of change they course do they frank andy remark after another spell of time have pass not that you could notice reply the other composedly andy derive more or less comfort from this way he chum have of keep he head even under the most try condition when he own nerve be fairly quiver with excitement it always steady andy to turn and see that frank be as cool and calm as though nothing be amiss more than a few time in the past it have cause the more hot-headed bird boy to conquer he own weakness and do himself credit in some difficult feat that become necessary example be a splendid thing to lead any boy along safe road word may be forget in the try moment but when he actually see the thing do before he very eye it be indelibly impressed upon he mind about how long will it be before we get there andy ask again for he be forever want to know when he have any misgiving about he own capacity for reach a reasonable conclusion do you mean before we leave the land and commence we voyage across the lake frank inquire yes that be it -- more than half a hour at the speed we be go now continue the other just about i should say frank reply after carefully measure distance with he eye we be up pretty high and can cover a tremendous range you know so we first glimpse the lake when we be a long way off it may be all of forty mile away right now and as we must be clipping along at the rate of eighty with the breeze favorable behind we why half a hour ought to see we there andy fall silent again many time do he eye travel from the distant water to the earth below they and then follow this up with a uneasy stare at the other aeroplane that be fly along far ahead of they the whole solution of the problem of course lay in the hand of the man who control the destiny of that steal biplane would he really have the nerve to attempt a flight across that great body of fresh water aim to land on foreign shore from which he could not easily be extradite frank seem to think that such be undoubtedly the intention of casper blue the little man who have be actor aviator and yeggman in turn during the course of he adventurous life he have already prove beyond any doubt that he be a capable airman even though he do have a cripple arm never have the bird boy see a aeroplane handle with more extraordinary skill and dash than be the one that have be steal from the hangar of percy carberry no unless something unexpected happen to disturb the plan of the fugitive yeggman inside the next half hour they plainly mean to launch out on a voyage across the lake possibly thousand of foot above its surface and perhaps among the very cloud not once do andy dream of ask he cousin whether in this event he consider it the part of wisdom for they to follow the man who be doubly risk they life in this mad effort to escape with they booty he know frank only too well to doubt he willingness to undertake such a trip as this in time go by and especially when they be down in south america with they aeroplane seek professor bird who have be lose with the balloon in which he be conduct experiment on the isthmus they have bravely face just as serious peril as this promise to be yes and wrench victory from the jaw of apparent defeat more than once hence it be a foregone conclusion that if casper blue attempt the difficult feat of fly across the lake after be in the air several long hour the two bird boy be determine to keep follow after he it seem like a game of conquer which andy remember so well where the rival aviator dare to go they must follow or acknowledge he superiority as a bold airman something neither of they feel like do frank have figure it all out while he be speed along so smoothly so far as he could see everything be work as easily as could be the motor never miss and be run like a charm just as though it could keep this up everlastingly in a endurance test and besides the wind what there be of it at present seem to favor they most positively because it be at they back so far as appearance go the condition be ideal for the cross of the great lake that be now show up ahead most grandly andy draw in big breath and try to keep from quiver with delight mingle with just a little nervousness here be a new experience about to come to they and one that they be not apt to soon forget as a boy andy delighted in novel sensation and as a ambitious aviator he yearn to experience all the glorious possibility that open up to the one who have the pluck and the nerve to attempt they they could see a town in plain sight though they have gradually ascend since andy cast he bomb so successfully perhaps he little game of open communication with the earth below have be observe by one of those in the lead airship and in order to prevent another attempt this gradual ascent have be immediately carry out but frank fully expect to see the rival aeroplane begin to drop as they draw near the border of the fresh water sea since just then there be no squally wind near the surface of the water which they wish to avoid by remain thousand of foot high the chance be that casper blue would soon commence to use he deflect rudder and begin to descend in wide spiral or else with the daring of a old and skilled air navigator shut off power and volplane down in a slant that would thrill any spectator as nothing else could until the require distance have be cover when he would again bring the shooting aeroplane on a level basis and resume he forward progress whatever he do frank be ready to imitate he have the fullest confidence in he own ability to accomplish the most difficult feat that would be require steady yourself now andy he caution because they be go to change the go pretty soon i take it better put that glass away and be ready to give I a lift if i need it watch and see if they do not drop down closer to the water it would be a wise thing to do i take it for in case of accident the spill would not be so bad all right frank just as you say reply the other accustomed to look to he cousin for the word of command when a emergency or a crisis come along he fasten the precious glass in they rigid case where they would be safe so long as the aeroplane remain above the surface of the water or do not fall to the ground in a serious wreck then andy pay attention to a number of small but very important matter that have always be give over into he charge at time like this the bird boy have be comrade so long that they work together like a well oiled machine the ball team that have play in company for a season can accomplish feat that would be utterly impossible to a nine that have be bring from various club even though each player might have be a star in he respective team so it be with frank and andy they have grow to know each other 's point so well that when the moment come it often seem as though they instinctively form a single unit with that exceedingly bright brain possess by frank do all the piloting of the combination they be all ready for the business in hand long before the border of the big water be reach frank have look around he several time and he cousin seem to know instinctively that he be endeavor to decide as to whether the wind be apt to hold as it chance to be at the time or increase in velocity should they drop to lower level it be rather awe inspiring to see that vast gulf of glistening water stretch as far as the eye could reach in three direction north east and west from the high altitude which they still occupy they could not tell whether the lake be calm or wave roll along its surface the wester sun glitter from its bosom as though it might be streak with gold and altogether it be a sight that neither of the boy would soon forget to andy in particular it appeal with vigor he nature be more inclined to worship at the shrine of the romantic than would be the case with the practical frank to andy that vast sheet of water seem mysterious profound fill with secret of argosy that be launch on its breast century ago when only the bark canoe of the red man have ever be wed to its water in imagination the boy could even then see the barque of the early explorer those bold man who have push thither from across the ocean and risk they life in order to learn what the new country hold for brave heart perhaps have he still grip the glass in he hand and care to look earthward before leave the shore for that adventurous cruise andy might have see many a group of wonder people all watch the flight of those hurry ship of the upper air current and even wave hat and handkerchief in the endeavor to attract the attention of the bold navigator whom they suppose to be engage in a race for a wager but there be now no longer time for anything like this and all they attention must be concentrate upon the one thing that mean so much to they -- the safety of the delicate craft in which they be now about to entrust they very live for a voyage the like of which few airman have ever enter before already have the other aeroplane sail away and be even now hang over the inland sea that lay fully four thousand foot below its further shore hide in what seem to be a cloud though it might prove to be a rise fog fate to engulf both pursue and pursue air craft in its baffling fold and turn the comedy of the race into a tragedy goodbye old land sing out andy when they seem to suddenly pass out over the water leave the shore of new york behind frank say not a word but no doubt he feeling be just as strong as those of he companion and so they have now embark on what seem to be the last leg of the strange chase with the future lie before they as mystifying as that fog bank lie far away to the north chapter xxi over the boundary line it be with the queerest possible feeling that andy see the land slip away and realize that they be at last launch upon the water part of the voyage it seem as though they have cast loose from they safe mooring and be adrift upon a uncharted sea when compare he feeling with other aviator in later time he learn that every one of they have experience exactly similar sensation the first time they pass out of touch of land and find the heave sea alone beneath they it be a sort of air intoxication andy even call it sea-sickness though doubtless most of it come from imagination alone there they go frank he call out not ten minute later the land be far behind they now and still in the other three direction they see only the level surface of the great lake he exclamation be call out by a sudden change in the method of advance adopt by those in the lead aeroplane instead of keep along in a direct line the biplane have uptilt and be now shooting downward in what seem a terribly perilous way just as though the pair of precious scoundrel have take a notion to end the pursuit by seek a plunge into the water but both boy know differently and that this be only a volplane adopt by experienced and rash aviator as a means of reach the lower air current more rapidly than by slow spiral or else undertake when have engine trouble that threaten destruction frank be ready to follow suit it would not be the first time by long odds that the bird boy have accomplish this speedy method of descend from high altitude there be always a exhilaration about the clever trick that appeal irresistibly to they nature though frank would never have attempt it unless reasonably sure that the condition be favorable for success hold fast andy he remark quietly the hum of the motor suddenly cease and with its cessation the hydroplane be turn head-on toward the surface of the lake four thousand foot below down they go plunge toward what seem to be instant destruction but a steady hand be at the wheel and the pilot know just what be necessary to do at the proper instant in order to bring this rapid descent to a stop and right the airship on a level keel but there be no time just then to note what the rival aeroplane might be do whether the experienced airman in charge manage to stop that downward plunge before reach the surface of the lake or fail go to he death be a matter that do not concern they now since they have they own affair to look after to tell the truth andy 's heart seem to be in he throat as they make the drop as yet they have never try out the new hydroplane in a trick of this sort and hence really do not know just how it might act though frank must have be pretty confident else he would never have attempt it give the choice the bird boy would easily have decide to descend from they lofty height by means of the much safer if slower spiral each circle see the aeroplane lower than before but since the reckless man in the other air craft lead the way frank have choose to follow he believe that he could accomplish any feat that be possible to casper blue especially now that the old air navigator have a handicap in the way of a cripple arm the water seem rush up to meet they so it look to andy whose anxious gaze be fasten upon the lower depths as they dip down in that terrific swoop but then he have see the same thing when over the land so that in itself this do not daunt he oh that exclamation seem to be force from andy 's lip when he feel frank give a quick turn to the lever that cause the deflect rudder to again resume a normal position the drop of the aeroplane be bring to a gradual stop and when immediately afterwards the buzz of the motor announce that the propel power be again at work it be no wonder that the nervous boy express he relief by give vent to that cry there be a world of gratitude back of that word it can be set down as certain for no matter how confident andy might have be concern he cousin 's ability to accomplish wonder the new hydroplane be as yet untried in many thing now he even dare take he awed gaze from the heave water beneath the framework of the aeroplane and give a think to those whom they have chase overland and water for nearly three hour bully for casper blue he make the riffle too he be all to the good be the way the impulsive andy announce he discovery to frank who just then could not spare even a second to take he attention off the working of the motor after all it be not so very strange that the boy should express himself in this way true the man he be praise be now a criminal and they seek to effect he arrest in some manner as yet vague and uncertain but it be not in this light andy view he just then as a birdsman casper blue have prove that he still possess the nerve and skill to direct a daring flight and that all the trick know to celebrated flier be at he finger 's end any one who have risk he life up among the cloud must always respect such a valiant spirit even though aware that the object of he admiration have in other way forfeit the esteem of all honorable man there be the biplane move along on a level keel and not more than two hundred foot above the water and still the course hold due north show that the desperate man who be thus flee from arrest have not the slightest intention of change they plan what do you think of she now andy ask the pilot with a quiver of pride in he voice you must mean we new craft i take it frank and i want to say that she be a real peach if ever there be one we never volplan as easy as that in we life and that be a fact why it be like slide downhill on a sled with never a single bump on the way i could do that all day and never get enough dangerous business all the same remark frank and doubly so when you do not happen to be well acquaint with you machine a single hitch and we would have strike the water at a terrible rate but all the same we do not frank the other go on jubilantly for now that this peril be of the past andy could be he old self again and they do just as well remark frank always ready to give credit even though it might be to a rival for he nature be generous to a fault well that biplane be easier to manage than we hydroplane with the pontoon underneath andy go on to say grudgingly for no one could ever convince he that frank have he superior as a air pilot and he would sooner go up to a record height of fifteen thousand foot in company with he cousin than accompany the most famous man live it look like we might be book for canada frank he go on to say a minute later after they have fall into the new stride comfortably and be rush forward on a level stretch with the surface of the lake close at hand i should not wonder come the noncommital reply now andy know he cousin like a book perhaps it be something in the word or on the other hand there may have be a undercurrent of doubt in the way frank speak that arouse the other 's suspicion what be it frank he demand for i reckon you see something that be all a blank to I take I in will not you oh i be wonder what would happen if they have a accident away out on the lake that be all admit the other well in that event i guess it would be up to the bird boy to play the rescuer act for all it be worth but frank do you think this new machine of ours could climb up off the water with four aboard would not that be the limit to tell you the truth andy i do not know because we have never have the chance to try it out with only two of we aboard you know how easy she climb three passenger she could hoist but four might faze she we can only wait and see if ever the chance come to make the test but you would not hesitate about try the same i know frank of course not the other remark confidently and especially when it might mean life or death to a poor fellow away out here on the lake mile from land if we could not rise we might still be able to float like a duck and hope that some boat would come to the rescue in the end that would be just the same do you know say andy i see a tug pull out at full speed from the little city on the shore of the lake close to where we leave land and somehow i seem to have a idea they know all about we and mean to keep in touch with we as long as they can to be handy in case of accident perhaps now my message be phone to bloomsbury and see about where we must be head if we keep on a northerly course they have wire up here to watch out for we how about that frank be i silly to figure that way i do not see why you should be andy in fact just as soon as you mention about the tug i begin wonder if somehow these good people do not know who we be and what we be chase after the biplane for they have to speak unusually loud in order to hear even though they head be close together at the time for the propeller be whirling with a hiss and the hum of the motor add to the noise but then it be all a merry racket that chime in well with the spirit of the young aviator and which give they much the same pleasure that the splash through the foam water of a ninety-foot racing yacht must awaken in the heart of a enthusiastic skipper when he know that every sail be draw to the limit and all thing be work well have you figure out what we ought to do if by good luck we all get over to the other side safe and sound go on andy we 'll have to leave that be the reply frank make no use cross a bridge till you come to it you know andy but they 'll be safe then frank i be afraid so even if i do not pretend to be up in all the international law connect with the passing of a thief from united state territory to canada but be not that a measly shame ejaculate the indignant andy to think of a robber be able to turn and put he finger to he nose and wiggle 'em at we just because he happen to cross the boundary line it ought not to be that way frank of course not and i guess lot of abler chap than you and I have think the same but there it stand and the two country will not get together to change the law even a little bit every year dozen of embezzler light out across the border for canada where they can spend they money and start for europe if they feel like it then perhaps it be the money they take with 'em that the canadian like though i would not like to believe such a thing venture andy hardly that but both country be jealous about bring back political offender i have hear judge lawson say more than once but do not let 's talk any more 'n we can help andy we have get we hand full as it be watch those fellow and keep ready to match any trick they try this serve to give andy a new cause for concentrate he attention on the flee biplane once more as yet the pilot of the lead airship have not divert from he set course but if he be as tricky as they have reason to believe there be always a chance that he might engineer some scheme sooner or later look to shake off he pursuer here in the middle of the great lake where possibly no mortal eye could witness the deed so as to appear against he later on with the wind aft of course the further they advance the larger grow the wave and andy notice that they be now of quite respectable size though be directly above he could not tell much about it only that in many spot he see the white cap break and this serve as a pointer would the hydroplane be able to ride such a sea in safety in case necessity compel they to alight upon its swell bosom frank do not seem to doubt it for he have the utmost confidence in the ability of those aluminum pontoon to sustain a great weight without sink what they would possibly have to fear more than anything else be the chance of a capsize and of course this would spell disaster as much as anything else once they overtake a sailing schooner that be speed along with a fair breeze possibly those aboard think they be make most excellent time with everything in they favor but the aeroplane speed past the vessel almost as though it be a toy craft a faint cheer be hear from those aboard who could be see wildly wave head-gear or red handkerchief just as though what they consider a novel air race have be engineer especially for they amusement when andy take occasion to look backward again in a short time he be amaze to discover how far distant the sail of the schooner seem and it be this incident more than anything else that give he to understand just what amazing speed the aeroplane be put in they mad race across the inland sea but while up to now the voyage have be without incident worthy of mention or accident of any kind it could hardly be expect that this immunity would continue to the very end the splendid good fortune that have hover over both airship be apt to be bring to a sudden termination at any moment as frank well know chapter xxii a hydroplane rescue all this while andy 's nerve have be strain to a high pitch and it be not at all singular therefore that when the anticipate event come to pass he give vent to a loud cry looky frank they be go to drop something must have happen to the motor or else a plane guy break to cripple they be what he almost shriek frank be watch though he have not utter a single sound he know that the half expect crisis be now upon they at least he heart find cause for rejoice that if a accident have to happen it affect the other aeroplane rather than they own it be much easier to bear watch another 's trouble than to bear you own what andy have say be the truth for the craft they be chase after have take a sudden dip and be flutter downward if you have ever see a cripple bird try hard to keep afloat you can have a pretty good conception of how that biplane drop lower and lower toward the water that it do not fall like a lump of lead speak volume for the magnificent management of the pilot who control the lever and whose long experience have teach he just what to do in such a dreadful emergency as this frank have instantly cut off much of they power though they still continue to sweep onward toward the place of the catastrophe and be rapidly draw near the fall aeroplane both boy stare at the terrible picture of the descend biplane near the heave surface of the lake it seem very serious indeed for any one to drop in this way and yet how much more dangerous to fall upon land where the wreck aviator would stand a good chance of broken limb even though they save they neck then a cry from the impulsive andy tell that the biplane be in the water if the engine have break loose there be a pretty fair chance that the craft with its long extended plane would float and even bear up the two aviator perhaps the quick-witted casper blue have look out for just such a contingency and find a way to free the framework from the dead weight of the motor frank have all he could do to manipulate he own craft for in order to alight successfully even as a wild duck do he must make a turn and head up into the wind that mean the passage of a certain length of time and meanwhile who could say what might not be happen to the imperil man on the other hand andy could not tear he horrified gaze away from the wreck of the fall biplane and it be really upon he that the navigator must depend for he information as to how thing be go fortunately andy could talk as well as look no matter if he tongue do show a decide inclination to cleave to the roof of he mouth with horror he manage to find a way to make it wag it float frank sure it float he ejaculate presently even as the other be in the act of make a sweeping curve and skilfully duck a squally puff of wind turn back over the course they have just cover to sink down upon the heave water when he find the chance yes they must have kick the engine overboard that make three poor old perc have lose do not it there they be both of 'em squattin ' in the middle of the wreck just as cool as you please awaitin ' for we to call in and take 'em off hope it do not sink before we c 'n get back if either one can not swim they would go down like a stone now you be around frank and we be head straight for the place hurrah hold hard there and we 'll lend you a helpin ' hand he even wave toward the two man by now pretty well submerge in the water but who seem to be still cling to the float aeroplane as though recognize that they position might be much more desperate should they cut loose from that buoy frank be watch closely to pick out a favorable opportunity to alight well do he know the chance he and he chum be take in thus drop upon the heave surface of such a tremendous body of water as lake ontario it be true that they have successfully perform this operation many time with they other hydroplane but that be upon the much calmer water of little sunrise lake where the sea never arise heavy enough to imperil the float aircraft it would be much more perilous now under these condition but frank have make up he mind to attempt the rescue of those in the water and be not to be easily daunt when the right opening come he allow the hydroplane to dip gently down make sure that there be as little violence as possible in the drop because of the chance of bury the forward propeller under or lose he balance upon which so much depend andy know what he be expect to do and be nimbly endeavor to swing he weight this way or that after they have launch on the wave so as to keep the pontoon on a even keel and prevent a disastrous spill for once this occur the hydroplane would be of little more advantage than the wreck biplane which barely uphold the two clinging man and be evidently sink lower under the strain with each pass second until the end must be in sight at least they have drop safely the pontoon have be cleverly adjust so as to bear a just proportion of the weight and they do they duty faithfully and well in this great crisis of course the next thing be to try and work closer to the sink biplane and take the man aboard one at a time that would be a risky proceeding require all the skill that frank could bring to the front in the first place he have choose to drop beyond the wreck of percy 's biplane this he have purposely do in the hope that the wind might drift they down upon the other aircraft a minute 's observation convinced frank however that if they wait for this to happen the frail support which be buoy casper blue and he mate up would have go under long long before they could get within touch already the second man be shriek for they to hurry because he could feel himself slowly but surely sink and he let they know that he could not swim a stroke plainly then they must do something to quicken thing if they mean to be of any service to the two rogue thus bring to a sudden halt just when escape have seem most bright frank remember he engine but would it work under such strange condition as this he quickly see that the rear propeller be half bury in the water and if it turn at all would have to churn thing just as though they be in truth a queerly fashion boat instead of a airship intend to mount to lofty height and vie with the eagle in he circle above the cloud quickly then he start to make the trial and andy see he movement comprehend what he must have in mind for he swing out in such fashion as to preserve a balance and thus help thing along as far as lay in he power what a sensation of relief that hum of the faithful little kincaid engine bring in its train as it once more take up the burden of its busy song why it seem to andy as though he could almost shout in sudden relief when he hear it first and see the water fly from the partly submerge propeller but frank be wise enough not to turn on full speed know what a terrific strain this condition of affair must be upon the entire fabric flimsy at best and if anything give way it be all over with they for if a chain be only as strong as its weakest link a heavier-than-air fly machine certainly come under the same category we be go it frank shout andy when he see that they speed have increase several hundred per cent and that they be now head straight for the partly submerge air navigator it never occur to andy that either of the man might offer the slightest objection to be rescue frank look a little further ahead but even he could hardly believe that casper blue would prefer to drown rather than be save what frank be really concern himself about more than anything else be how he could stow away the two fellow once they find a chance to climb aboard the hydroplane and whether he could get enough impetus from the engine with such a unusual load to rise from the water once he elevate he plane hurry oh hurry i be go down cry the larger man casper never say a word possibly be a swimmer he do not feel the same degree of terror that he companion experience then again he may have be coolly figure on how he might turn the rescue to he own advantage in some way for he seem to have that little black box slung over he back by means of the strap and it be easy to understand that it must as andy have guess contain something of considerable more value than a mere camera now they be close in the hydroplane round-up be be carry out in what seem to be a successful manner and if all go well during the next few minute the drift fugitive would be haul aboard by andy who stand ready to act the part of gallant rescuer to the king 's taste it happen by mere accident that they be on that side of the sink wreck where the larger man clung and this be just as it should have be since he seem more in need of help at least in far greater distress of mind than the smaller man get ready andy warn the pilot i 'll shut off the power if it seem best but it may keep we on a more even keel if we move along i be go to try and get hold and then pull he aboard hope we do not have a spill though the other send back as he brace himself as best the condition allow frank give one little turn to the rudder for he be afraid that they might get past without come in reach then the gap be complete and andy lean over manage to get hold of the sink man by the collar of he coat there be where the greatest danger lay when a man or a boy have the terror of drown press in upon he heart he be usually a most unreasonable be and will even clasp he intended rescuer about the neck and prevent he from carry out he plan that might have work well only for this blundering take it easy you yell andy as he see the man clutch hold of the framework of the hydroplane and struggle desperately to work he way along to where the other be if you give we half a chance we 'll save you all right but upset we and well all like as not go down together slower i tell you or i 'll give you this to teach you something this be not a ocean liner d'ye understand let up whether it be the excited word of the boy the manner in which he flourish that short steel bar or he ferocious look that bring the excited man to he sens no one could ever say but he do relax some of he frantic movement and begin to act more within reason this presently give andy the opportunity he want to stretch out a help hand and get a firm grip of the other 's coat collar after which he exert himself to the utmost to assist he to climb aboard what with he own weight and the fact that he clothes be drip with water the addition of the new passenger cause the delicately construct and already heavily freighted hydroplane to sink more deeply frank in that supreme moment realize that it would be almost a hopeless task to think of once more fly with such a cargo aboard possibly the best they could do would be to keep afloat and hope that the pursue tug might come up with they before the darkness set in and they could all be rescue now that the first of the imperil airman have be haul aboard there remain but casper blue himself the wreck have not as yet sink wholly since relieve from the weight of the heavy man it seem to possess enough buoyancy to remain on the surface of the water but this could be only for a short time the plane would soon be thoroughly soak and then the end must come when the clinging man would find himself deprive of all support and must swim or go down he have something of a half defiant look on he small sunburned face as he see andy try to draw the wreck toward he with the evident intention of give he the next opening perhaps he be half inclined to take he chance as he be rather than allow these two boy to make he a prisoner frank have he mind make up he figure that both man have be long enough in the water to have they weapon well soak so that they would be in no condition to threaten they rescuer the box make he pass it up first or we leave he here he call out to andy as the latter be about to reach out and lay hold of the smaller man casper blue glare almost savagely at frank for the moment the bird boy even think the enraged man would hurl defiance back at they and declare that he prefer take he chance with the wreck rather than give up the spoil but just then it happen fortunately that the remnant of the biplane begin to settle more positively than before warn he that it be folly to pin any hope on its buoy he up more than a few minute at most here take it he snarl hand up the box which andy immediately pass over to he cousin before he would stretch out he hand again to render the defeat yeggman any assistance then casper blue be draw aboard and lower still sink the buoyant hydroplane until both propeller be almost wholly submerged beneath the surface of the heave billow that come roll on steadily and remorselessly chapter xxiii bring to book -- conclusion what time be it frank ask andy who w as breathing very hard after he recent exertion in help both man to get a footing on the hydroplane i think pretty close to four o'clock reply the other though he make no attempt to take out the little nickel watch he always carry nowadays the fact of the matter be that frank do not dare trust casper blue he could see that the little man be a desperate character and that he do not view the prospect of be make a prisoner and take back to bloomsbury with any great show of enthusiasm in fact it be a most unpleasant proposition for the bank thief to contemplate at all and so frank be watch he closely he have before start on this dangerous air flight that have end so far from home and under such singular condition place a little pistol in he pocket though hardly under the belief that he would have any occasion to make use of it but he be now determine not to let this man get the upper hand he could see that various desperate plan must be form in that scheming brain of the one-time aviator and now yeggman and frank be constantly on the watch so that he might not be catch nap four o'clock repeat andy that would mean at least two more hour before the sun set would not it and even after that it might stay light enough another hour for they to see we if they steam along you mean the people aboard that tug do not you ask casper blue sneeringly yes they seem to be chase after we and i only hope they do keep move reply andy because they must have see the accident that be if they have any sort of a marine glass aboard which i reckon they do and i suppose now you think there might be officer aboard that same tug the other go on to say oh we do not know anything about that andy remark carelessly but if they come along after a while it would save we from a lot of worry just think if the night set in and the four of we weigh this poor old hydroplane down like we be what a time we would have before another morning come around it would like as not rise if there be only two aboard would not it casper ask quickly and before andy could understand what he question mean he have reply to it sure thing frank and myself have leave the water many a time in a less powerful hydroplane than this have not we frank well turn about be only fair say casper fiercely why i do not understand what you mean by that complain andy two 's company four a crowd so please skip out of this both of you boy my pal and I can run this shebang and just take my word for it we mean to do the same get that straight both of you now jump i tell you and lively or i might be tempt to let she go and that would be a shame after the way you rescue the two of we overboard with you andy gape when he see that the man have actually draw out a revolver and be aim the same directly at he here quit that will you he demand feel a flush of alarm for even a seasoned veteran of many battle do not fancy have such a threatening weapon thrust under he nose jump then d'ye hear consarn you shout the man menacingly wave he pistol take a header and over you go both of you i be a desperate man and not to be fool with p ` rap you c 'n keep afloat on that wreckage long enough for the tug to come up and pull you in but no matter over you go one way or the other just wait a bit casper say a quiet voice and turn he head the man see that frank have he cover very neatly you must know that you weapon have be soak and would not go off the chance be besides i do not believe there be a single cartridge in the chamber throw it overboard do you hear casper or i may be tempt to cripple that other arm of yours no doubt frank be speak the exact truth when he declare he belief that the revolver have not be charge since the time when casper empty it at the pursue airship in the hope of either frightening the boy aviator or else do some sort of damage he stare hard at frank for half a minute then with some muttered word as if he realize the folly of but up against fate throw the useless weapon far out on the heave surface of the lake after that a dense silence fall upon they the man be too down-heart to want to talk and there be little that the boy have to communicate because they be now in a position where they could do absolutely nothing to help themselves and must depend entirely upon the come of the tug a hour pass and it seem very long all of they be more or less wet because of the splash wave but as the air be balmy they care little for such a thing as that if only the tug would show up innumerable time do andy stretch he neck and look toward the quarter in which it must appear if it come at all but the hour begin to extend far into a second one and as yet there be nothing see that bring with it a ray of hope worse still the sea be gradually get more and more tempestuous it seem to andy though the sky remain absolutely clear and there be not a sign of a storm if that have be a fog in the far distance which frank have sight the breeze must have long ago dissipate it entirely lower sink the sun until it be now not more than half a hour above the horizon if its stay could be measure in the way of minute and seconds oh if only the friendly tug would come in sight amidst the foam-crested wave it be really get to be too much of a good thing try to keep the hydroplane from keel over with those wave break against the frail plane if this keep up much longer frank be very much afraid that percy carberry would not be the only boy in bloomsbury to mourn the loss of a airship when therefore andy give a sudden shout and announce that he believe he have see the smoke of the tug wreathing above the wave all of they look considerably relieve even casper himself for on second thought the yeggman must have decide that it be better to be alive and in prison than dead and under the water of lake ontario in five minute they could all see the smokestack of the powerful tug and for fear lest it should pass by and not do they any good they shout hoarsely in unison they hear we exclaim andy whose position somehow allow he to see better than any of the other yes they have change they course and be head this way now it be all right frank we have win out i guess but frank be keep a eye on the two man he do not mean to give they even the slightest chance to play a trick in the eleventh hour frank bird be a pretty hard fellow to catch nap he usually have he eye open and especially when he know there be danger around the tug come boom on and they could see that there be quite a number of people aboard what if some of they be from bloomsbury suggest andy at which he cousin laugh you do not stop to think twice before you make that break andy he remark tell I by what conveyance could they have get to the lake ahead of we when we come through by lightning express at the rate of nearly a hundred mile a hour at time but i can see they be expect to take charge of we friend here because there be a officer aboard just keep where you be casper you goose be cook and there be no need of make matter worse the man settle back again with a growl and then burst out into a reckless laugh small difference it make i guess boy how the thing 's do so long as we have get to go to the lock-up you might just as well have the credit for the job as anybody and man to man now i want to say that i be full of admiration for the fine way you handle that hydroplane of yours if so be you be the bird boy i have be hear so much about you have get the making of crack-a-jack aviator in you that be about all from I now the tug come alongside and the two man be assist aboard where the police officer see that they be promptly iron we get the word from bloomsbury and you father hire this tug right away andy bird to follow you out on the lake if so be you keep after the rascal say a tall gentleman with a white mustache who they afterwards learn be the mayor of the city on the lake shore now what can we do for you please stand by and let 's see if we can get away answer frank if not we 'll have to go on board and tow the hydroplane behind but since relieve of so much extra weight the pontoon have rise again and i expect she 'll go and she do with the very first effort begin to move over the surface of the water in the lee of the tug then as frank hasten to elevate the plane the airship start to mount and when free from the lake a mighty cheer break from the lip of those aboard the small vessel even casper blue join in give the brave lad they just due frank carefully start back toward the american side of the lake he do not know whether the capture have be make on the canadian side or not and as the question be never raise even in the trail of the bank robber it be never wholly clear in he mind when they reach land it be early night and save that the wind have lull considerably they would not have be able to get in for a long time after that as there be no need of they hurry homeward frank and andy consent to stay over as the guest of the mayor who be more than pleased to have the famous bird boy stop under he roof but first frank make sure to send a message to each of they home as well as to chief waller who would have to come on and get the two bold man who have break into the bloomsbury bank and about clean out the vault and not content with one haul be plan to rob the pay-car when it stop in bloomsbury to settle with a large number of employee center there doubtless that must have be a season of considerable excitement in the home town and the name of frank and andy bird be cheer to the echo by the crowd of town boy larry and elephant would lead around burn red light and firing off roman candle purchase with money supply by dr and professor bird the happy father of the two young hero on the follow day chief waller be on hand with one of he man to escort the prisoner back to the town where they latest crime have be commit frank have already send the little camera box with its valuable contents just as he have receive it from casper blue to the president of the bank by express not care to hold it any longer in he hand than be absolutely necessary about noon the condition be favorable the bird boy sail away amidst the cheer of half the little city and head directly south on a bee line for home fortunately enough no further adventure overtake they on they way there and as they come have be announce they find the whole town in a uproar and come near be mob such be the desire of every man woman boy and girl to have the honor of shake hand with they percy be on hand too with a thousand question concern the fate of he precious biplane and bemoan the fact that he seem to be the most unlucky fellow who have ever attempt to bring honor to bloomsbury but there be precious few who sympathize with he and everybody know that all he have to do be to demand that he mother advance the ready cash to buy another flier and it be sure to be forthcoming but there be other lively time in store for frank and andy bird although neither of they suspect it just then and believe that a period of calm would likely follow they hydroplane round-up what the nature of these exploit be
