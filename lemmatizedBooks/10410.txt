knight and lisa 's sister it have come at last the moment i have be think about for day i be go to have he all to myself the only person in the world i ever love he have ask I to sit out two dance and that make I think he really must want to be with I not just because i be the pretty girl 's sister but because i be myself lisa drummond be what i be -- queer and plain i can not bear to think that man like girl for they beauty yet i can not help like man better if they be handsome i do not know if ivor dunda be the handsomest man i ever see but he seem so to I i do not know if he be very good or really very wonderful although he be clever and ambitious enough but he have a way that make woman fond of he and man admire he too he look straight into you eye when he talk to you as if he care more for you than anyone else in the world : and if i be a artist painting a picture of a dark young knight start off for the crusade i should ask ivor dunda to stand as my model perhaps he expression would not be exactly right for the pious young crusader for it be not at all saintly really : still i have see just that rapt sort of look on he face it be generally when he be talk to di : but i would not let myself believe that it mean anything in particular he have the reputation of have make lot of woman fall in love with he this be one of the first thing i hear when di and i come over from america to visit lord and lady mountstuart and of course there be the story about he and maxine de renzie everyone be talk of it when we first arrive in london my heart beat very fast as i guide he into the room which lady mountstuart have give di and I for we special den it be separate by another larger room from the ballroom but both door be open and we could see people dance i tell he he might sit by I on the sofa under di 's book shelf because we could talk better there usually i do not like be in front of a mirror because -- well because i be only the pretty girl 's sister but to-night i do not mind my cheek be red and my eye bright sit down you might almost take I for a tall girl and the way my gown be make do not show that one shoulder be a little higher than the other di design the dress i think if i be not pretty i do look interesting and original i look as if i could _ think _ of thing and as if i could feel and i be feel i be wonder why he have be so good to I lately unless he care of course it might be for di 's sake but i be not so queer-looking that no man could ever be fascinate by I they say pity be akin to love perhaps he have begin by pity I because di have everything and i nothing and then afterwards he have find out that i be intelligent and sympathetic he sit by I and do not speak at first just then di pass the far-away open door of the ballroom dancing with lord robert west the duke of glasgow 's brother thank you so much for the book i say -lrb- he have send I a book that morning -- one he would hear I say i want -rrb- he do not seem to hear and then he turn suddenly with one of he nice smile i always think he have the nicest smile in the world : and certainly he have the nicest voice he eye look very kind and a little sad i will he hard to love I it make I happy to get it i go on it make I happy to send it he say do it please you to do thing for I i ask why of course you do like poor little I a tiny bit then i could not help add -- even though i be different from other girl perhaps more for that reason he say with he voice as kind as he eye oh what shall i do if you go away i burst out partly because i really mean it and partly because i hope it might lead he on to say what i want so much to hear suppose you get that consulship at algier i hope i may he say quickly a consulship be not a very great thing -- but -- it be a beginning i want it badly i wish i have some influence with the foreign secretary say i not tell he that the man actually dislike I and look at I as if i be a toad of course he be lord mountstuart 's cousin and brother-in-law as well and that make he seem quite in the family do not it but it be not as if i be really related to lady mountstuart i be never sorry before that di and i be only step-sister -- no not a bit sorry though she mother have all the money and bring it to my poor father but now i wish i be lady mountstuart 's niece and that i have some of the coax ` girly ' way di can put on when she want to get something out of people i would make the foreign secretary give you exactly what you want even if it take you far far from I with that he look at I suddenly and he face grow slowly red under the brown you be a very kind imp he say imp be the name he invent for I i love to hear he call I by it kind i echo one be not kind when one -- like -- people i saw by he eye then that he know but i do not care if only i could make he say the word i long to hear -- even because he pity I because he have find out how i love he and because he have really too much of the dark-young-crusader-knight in he to break my heart i make up my mind that i would take he at he word quickly if he give I the chance and i would tell di that he be dreadfully in love with I that would make she writhe i keep my eye on he and i let they tell he everything he see there be no doubt of that but he do not say the word i hope for a moment or two he be silent and then gaze away towards the door of the ballroom he speak very gently as if i have be a child -- though i be older than di by three or four year thank you imp for let I see that you be such a staunch little friend say he now that i know you really do take a interest in my affair i think i may tell you why i want so much to go to algier -- though very likely you have guess already -- you be such a ` intuitive ' girl and besides i have not try very hard to hide my feeling -- not as hard as i ought perhaps when i realize how little i have to offer to you sister now you understand all do not you -- even if you do not before i love she and if i go to algier -- do not say any more i manage to cut he short i can not bear -- i mean i understand i -- do guess before it be true i have guess but i would not let myself believe i hope against hope he be so much kinder to I than any other man ever take the trouble to be in all my wretched embittered twenty-four year of life di might have tell I i go gasp on rather than let there be a long silence between we just then i have enough pride not to want he to see I cry -- though if it could have make any difference i would have grovel at he foot and wet they with my tear but she never do tell I anything about herself she be so unselfish and so fond of you that probably she like better to talk about you instead he defend she and then i feel that i could hate he as much as i have always hate di deep down in my heart at that minute i should have like to kill she and watch he face when he find she lie dead -- out of he reach for ever besides he hurry on i have never ask she yet if she would marry I because -- my prospects be not very brilliant she know of course that i love she -- and if you get the consulship you 'll put the important question i cut he short try to be flippant yes but i tell you tonight because i -- because you be so kind i feel i should like to have you know kind yes i have be too kind but if by put out my foot i could have crush every hope of he for the future -- every hope that be in which my stepsister diana forrest have any part -- i would have do it just as i trample on ant in the country sometimes for the pleasure of feeling that i -- even i -- have power of life and death i swallow hard to keep the sob back i be never very strong or well but now i feel broken ready to die i be glad when i hear the music stop in the ballroom there i say the two dance you ask I to sit out with you be over i be sure you be engage for the next yes imp i be to di no i have number 13 with she thirteen unlucky number any number be lucky that give I a chance with she the next one come now be with mr george allendale oh yes the actor manager 's wife she go everywhere and lord mountstuart like theatrical celebrity this house ought to be very serious and political but we have every sort of creature -- provide it be a amusing or successful or good-looking one by the way use maxine de renzie to come here when she be act in london at george allendale 's theater that be before di and i arrive on the scene you remember i remember oh yes she come here it be in this house i meet she first off the stage i believe what a sweet memory be not mr george awfully jealous of she husband when he have such a fascinating beauty for he lead lady i never hear that she be you need not look cross with I i be not say anything against you gorgeous maxine of course not nobody could but you must not call miss de renzie ` my maxine ' please imp i beg you pardon i say you see i have hear other people call she that -- in joke and you dedicate you book about lhassa that make you such a famous person to she do not you no what make you think that he be really annoyed now and i be please -- if anything could please I in my despair why everybody think it it be dedicate to ` mr ' as if the name be a secret so -- ` everybody ' be very stupid then ` mr ' be a old lady my god-mother who help I with money for my expedition to lhassa otherwise i could not have go and she be not of the kind that like to see she name in print now where shall i take you imp because i must go and look for mr allendale i 'll stay where i be thank you i say and watch you dance -- from far off that be my part in life you know : watch other people dance from far off when he be go i lean back among the cushion and i be not sure that one of my heart attack would not come on i feel horribly alone and desert and though i hate di and always have hate she ever since the tiny child and she mother -lrb- a beautiful rich young californian widow -rrb- come into my father 's house in new york she do know how to manage I better than anyone else when i be in such mood i could have scream for she as i sit there helplessly look through the open door : and then at last i see she as if my wish have be a call which have reach she ear over the music in the ballroom she have stop dance and with she partner -lrb- lord robert again -rrb- enter the room which lay between we den and the ballroom probably they would have go on to the conservatory which can be reach in that way but i cry she name as loudly as i could and she hear only a moment she pause -- long enough to send lord robert away -- and then she come straight to I he must have be furious : but i do not care for that i have be want she badly but when i see she so bright and beautiful look as if she be the joy of life make incarnate i should have like to strike she hard first on one cheek and then the other deepen the rose to crimson and leave a ugly red mark for each finger have you a headache dear she ask in that velvet voice she keep for I -- as if i be a thing only fit for pity and protection it be my heart say i it feel like a clock run down oh i wish i could die and end it all what be the good of I -- to myself or anyone do not talk like that my poor one she say shall i take you upstairs to you own room no i think i should faint if i have to go upstairs i answer yet i can not stay here what shall i do what about uncle eric 's study di ask she always call lord mountstuart ` uncle eric ' though he be not she uncle she mother and he wife be sister that be all : and then there be the other sister who marry the british secretary for foreign affair a cousin of lord mountstuart 's that family seem to have a craze for american girl but lord mountstuart make a exception of I he be civil of course because he be a abject slave of di 's and she refuse to come and pay a visit in england without I : but i give he the shiver i know very well : and i take a impish joy in make he jump i be sure he will not be there this evening di go on when i hesitate he be play bridge with a lot of dear old boy in the library or be half a hour ago come let I help you there it be only a step she put she pretty arm round my waist and lean on she i walk across the room out into a corridor through a tiny bookroom where odd volume and old magazine be keep into lord mountstuart 's study it be a nice room which he use much as he wife use she boudoir the library next door be rather a show place but the study have only lord mountstuart 's favorite book in it he write there -lrb- he have write a novel or two and think himself literary -rrb- and some picture he have paint in different part of the world hang on the wall : for he also fancy himself artistic in one corner be a particularly comfortable cushiony lounge where i suppose the distinguished author lie and think out he subject or dream they out and it be to this that di lead I she settle I among some fat pillow of old purple and gold brocade and ask if she should ring and get a little brandy no i say i shall feel better in a few minute it be so nice and cool here you look better already exclaim di soon when you have lie and rest awhile you 'll be a different girl ah how i wish i _ could _ be a different girl i sigh a strong well girl and tall and beautiful and admire by everyone -- like you -- or maxine de renzie what make you think of she asked di quickly ivor be just talk to I of she you know he call I he ` pal ' and tell I thing he do not tell everybody he think a great deal about maxine still she would be a difficult woman to forget if she be as attractive off the stage as she be on what a pity we do not come in time to meet here when she be play in london with george allendale everybody use to invite she to they house it seem ivor be tell I that he first meet she here and that it be such a pleasant memory whenever he come to this house i suppose that be one reason he like to come so much no doubt say di sharply he get so fascinate talking of she i go on he almost forget that he have a dance with mr allendale of course maxine have make a great hit and all that but she do not stand quite as high as she do now since she be become the fashion in pari perhaps she have nothing except she salary then whereas she must have save up a lot of money by this time i have a idea that ivor would have propose to she when she be in london if he would think she success establish nonsense di break out she cheek very pink as if ivor be the kind of man to think of such a thing he be not very rich and he be very ambitious it would be bad for he to marry a poor girl or a girl who be not well connect socially he _ have _ to think of such thing i watch the effect of these word with my eye half shut for of course di have all she mother 's money two hundred thousand english pound and through the mountstuart and she aunt who be marry to the foreign secretary she have get to know all the best people in england besides the king and queen have be particularly nice to she since she be present so she have the run of they special set as well as the political and artistic and old-fashioned exclusive one ivor dunda be a law unto himself she say and he have plenty of good connection of he own he 'll have a little money too some day from a aunt or a god-mother i believe anyway he and miss de renzie have nothing more than a flirtation aunt lilian tell I so she say maxine be rather proud to have ivor dangle about because everyone like he and because he travels and he book be be a lot talk about just then naturally he admire she because she be beautiful and a very great actress -- oh you aunt lilian would make little of the affair i laugh she flirt with he herself why lisa aunt lilian 's over forty and he be twenty-nine forty be not the end of the world for a woman nowadays she be a beauty and a great lady ivor always want the best of everything she flirt with he and he with she di laugh too but only to make it seem as if she do not care you would better not say such silly thing to uncle eric she say stare at the pattern of the cornice be not those funny gargoyley face up there i never notice they before but oh -- about mr dunda and maxine de renzie -- i do not think really that he trouble himself much about she any more for the other day i -- i happen to ask what she be play in paris now and he do not know he say he have not be over to see she act as it be too far away and he be afraid when he be not too busy he be too lazy he _ say _ so to you of course but when he spend Saturday to Monday at folkestone with the godmother who be go to leave he she money how easy to slip over the channel to the fair maxine without anyone be the wiser why should not he slip or slide or steam or sail in a balloon if he like laugh di but not happily you be look much better lisa you have quite a color now do you feel strong enough to go upstairs i would rather rest here for awhile since you think lord mountstuart be sure not to come say i these pillow be so comfortable then perhaps by and by i shall feel able to go back to the den and watch the dancing i should like to keep up if i can for i know i sha not sleep and the night will seem so long very well say di speak kindly though i know she would have like to shake I i be afraid i shall have to run away now for my partner will think I so rude what about supper oh i do not want any and i shall have go upstairs before that i interrupted go now i do not need you any more ring and send for I if you feel badly again yes -- yes by this time she be at the door and there she turn with a remorseful look in she eye as if she have be unkind and be sorry even if you do not send i shall come back by and by when i can to see how you be she say then she be go and i nestled deeper into the sofa cushion with the feeling that my head be so heavy it must weigh down the pillow like a stone she be afraid of miss number 13 with ivor i say to myself well -- she be welcome to it now i do not think she 'll enjoy it much -- or let he oh i hope they 'll quarrel i do not think i would mind anything if only i be sure they would never be nearer to each other i wish di would marry lord robert perhaps then ivor would turn to I oh my god how i hate she -- and all beautiful girl who spoil the life of woman like I a shiver fit shake I from head to foot as i guess that the time must be come for number 13 they be together perhaps what if in spite of all ivor should tell di how he love she and they should be engage at that thought i try to bring on a heart attack and die for at least it would chill they happiness if when lady mountstuart 's ball be over i should be find lie white and dead like elaine on she barge i be hold my breath with my hand press over my heart to feel how it be beat when the door open suddenly and i hear a voice speak chapter ii lisa listen someone turn up the light i 'll leave you together say lord mountstuart and the door be close what could that mean i wonder i have suppose the two man have come in alone but there must have be a third person who could it be have lord mountstuart be arrange a tête-à-tête between di and ivor dundas the thought be like a hand on my throat choke my life out i must hear what they have to say to each other without stop to think more i roll over and let myself sink down into the narrow space between the low couch and the wall sharply pull the clinging fold of my chiffon dress after I then i lay still my blood pound in my temple and ear and in my nostril a faint musty smell from the oriental stuff that cover the lounge i could see nothing from where i lay except the side of the couch the wall and a bit of the ceiling with the gargoyley cornice which di have mention when she want to seem indifferent to the subject of we conversation but i be listen with all my might for what be to come better lock the door if you please dunda say a voice which give I a shock of surprise though i know it well instead of di it be the foreign secretary who speak we will not run the risk of interruption he go on with that slow clear enunciation of he which most oxford man have and keep all they life especially man of the college that be he -- balliol i tell mountstuart that i want a private chat with you beyond that he know nothing nor do anyone else except myself you understand that this conversation of ours whether anything come of it or not be entirely confidential i have a proposal to make you 'll agree to it or not as you choose but if you do not agree forget it with everything i may have say my service and my memory be both at you disposal answer ivor in such a gay happy voice that something tell I he have already talk with diana -- and that in spite of I she have not snub he i be honor -- i will not say flatter for i be too much in earnest -- that you should place any confidence in I i lay there behind the lounge and sneer at this speech of he of course i say to myself he would be ready to do anything to please the foreign secretary since all the big plum he ambition crave be in the gift of that man frankly i be in a difficulty and it have occur to I that you can help I out of it better than anyone else i know say the smooth trained voice it be a little diplomatic errand you will have to undertake for I tomorrow if you want to do I a good turn i will undertake it with great pleasure and carry it through to the best of my ability reply ivor i be sure you can carry it through excellently say the foreign secretary still fence it will be good practice if you succeed for -- any future duty in the career which may be open to you he be bribe he with that consulship i think begin to be very curious indeed as to what i might be go to hear my heart be not beat so thickly now i could think almost calmly again i thank you for you trust in I say ivor a little diplomatic errand repeat the foreign secretary in itself the thing be not much : that be on the face of it and yet in its relation with other interest it become a mission of vast importance incalculable importance when i have explain you will see why i apply to you indeed i come to my cousin mountstuart 's house expressly because i be tell you would be at he wife 's ball my regret be that the news which bring I in search of you do not reach I earlier for if it have i should have come with my wife and have get at you in time to send you off -- if you agree to go -- to-night as it be the matter will have to rest till to-morrow morning it be too late for you to catch the midnight boat across the channel across the channel echo ivor you want I to go to france yes one could always get across somehow say ivor thoughtfully if there be a great hurry there be -- the greatest but in this case the more haste the less speed that be if you be to rush off order a special train and charter a tug or motor boat at dover as i suppose you mean my object would probably be defeat i come to you because those who be watch this business would not be likely to guess i have give you a hand in it all that you do however must be do quietly with no fuss no sign of anything unusual go on it be natural i should come to a ball give by my wife 's sister whose husband be my cousin no one know of this interview of ours : i believe i may make my mind easy on that score at least and it be equally natural that you should start on business or pleasure of you own for paris to-morrow morning also that you should meet mademoiselle de renzie there mademoiselle de renzie exclaim ivor off he guard for a instant and show plainly that he be take aback be not she a friend of yours ask the foreign secretary rather sharply though i could not see he i know exactly how he would be look at ivor he keen gray eye narrow he clean-shaven lip draw in the long well-shaped hand of which he be say to be vain toy with the pale malmaison pink he always wear in he buttonhole yes she be a friend of mine ivor answer but -- a ` but ' already perhaps i would better tell you that the mission have to do with mademoiselle de renzie and directly with no one else she have act as my agent in paris indeed i do not dream that she dabble in politics and you should not dream it from any word of mine mr dunda if it be not necessary to be entirely open with you if you be to help I in this matter but before we go any further i must know whether mademoiselle de renzie 's connection with this business will for any reason keep you out of it not if -- you need my help say ivor with a effort and i beg you will not suppose that my hesitation have anything to do with miss de renzie herself i have for she the greatest respect and admiration we all have return the foreign secretary especially those who know she best among she many virtue she be one of the few woman who can keep a secret -- she own and other she be a magnificent actress -- on the stage and off and now i have you promise to help I i must tell you it be to help she as well : therefore i owe you the whole truth or you will be handicap for several year mademoiselle de renzie have do good service -- secret service you must understand -- for great britain by jove maxine a political spy ivor break out impulsively that be rather a hard name be not it there be better one and she be no traitor to she country because as you perhaps know she be polish by birth i can assure you we have much for which to thank she cleverness and tact -- and beauty for we sake i be sorry that she be serve we interest professionally for the last time for she own sake i ought to rejoice as she be engage to be marry and if you can save she from come to grief over this very ticklish business she 'll probably live happily ever after do you know of she engagement no reply ivor i saw miss de renzie often when she be act in london a year ago but after she go to pari -- of course she be very busy and have crowd of friend and i have only cross once or twice since on hurry visit so we have not meet or write to each other -lrb- very good reason i think bitterly behind my sofa you have be busy too -- fall in love with diana forrest -rrb- it have not be announce yet but i think as a old friend you might have be tell i believe mademoiselle want to surprise everybody when the right time come -- if the poor girl be not ruin irretrievably in this affair of ours be there really serious danger of that the most serious if you can not save she not only will the _ entente cordiale _ be shake to its foundation -lrb- and i say nothing of my own reputation which be at stake -rrb- but she future happiness will be break in the crash and -- she say -- she will not live to suffer the agony of she loss she will kill herself if disaster come and though suicide be usually the last resource of a coward mademoiselle de renzie be no coward and i be inclined to think i should come to the same resolve in she place tell I what i be to do say ivor evidently move by the foreign secretary 's strange word and he intense earnestness you will go to pari by the first train to-morrow morning without mention you intention to anyone you will drive at once to some hotel where you have never stay and be not know i will find means of inform the lady what hotel you choose you will there give a fictitious name -lrb- let we say george sandford -rrb- and you will take a suite with a private sitting-room that do you will say that you be expect a lady to call upon you and will see no one else you will wait till mademoiselle de renzie appear which will certainly be as soon as she can possibly manage and when you and she be alone together sure that you be not be spy upon you will put into she hand a small packet which i shall give you before we part to-night it sound simple enough say ivor if that be all it be all yet it may be anything but simple would you prefer to have I call at she house and save she come to a hotel i would willingly do so if -- no as i tell you should it be know that you and she meet those who be watch she at present ought not to suspect the real motive of the meeting so much the better for we : but we must think of she after four o'clock every afternoon the young frenchman she be engage to be in the habit of go to she house and stop until it be time for she to go to work he dine with she but do not drive with she to the theater as that would be rather too public for the present until they engagement 's announce he adore she but be inconveniently jealous like most latin it be practically certain that he be hear you name mention in connection with hers when she be in london and as a frenchman invariably fail to understand that a man can admire a beautiful woman without be in love with she you call at she house might give mademoiselle maxine a _ mauvais quart d'heure _ i see but if she send he away and come to my hotel -- she 'll probably make some excuse about be oblige to go to the theater early and thus get rid of he she be quite clever enough to manage that then as you own name will not appear on any hotel list in the papers next day the most jealous heart need have no cause for suspicion at the same time if certain person whom mademoiselle -- and we too -- have to fear do find out that she have visit ivor dunda who have assume a false name for the pleasure of a private interview with she interest of even deeper importance than the most desperate love affair may still we 'll hope be guard by the pretext of you old friendship now you understand thoroughly i think so reply ivor very grave and troubled i know by the change in he manner out of which all the gaiety have be slowly drain i will do my very best if you be sacrifice any important engagement of you own for the next two day you will not suffer for it in the end remark the foreign secretary meaningly no doubt ivor see the consulship at algier dance before he eye bind up with a engagement to di just as a slice of rich plum cake and white bride cake be tie together with bow of satin ribbon sometimes in america i do not want he to have the consulship because get that would perhaps mean get di too thank you say ivor and what hotel shall you choose in paris ask the foreign secretary it should be a good one i do not need to remind you where mademoiselle de renzie could go without danger of compromise herself in case she should be recognize in spite of the veil she be pretty certain to wear yet it should not be in too central a situation shall it be the élysèe palace ask ivor that will do very well reply the other after reflect for a instant and i could have clap my hand in what ivor would call my impish joy when it be settle for the élysèe palace be where lord and lady mountstuart stop when they visit pari and they would be talk of run over next day with lord robert west to look at a wonderful new motor car for sale there -- one that a rajah have order to be make for he but die before it be finish lady mountstuart always have one new fad every six month at least and she latest be to drive a motor car herself lord robert be a great expert -- can make a motor i believe or take it to piece and put it together again and he would be insist for day that she would be able to drive this rajah car she have promise that if not too tired she would cross to pari the day after the ball take the afternoon train via boulogne as she would not be equal to a early start now i think how splendid it would be if she should see maxine at the hotel with ivor the foreign secretary be advise ivor to wire the élysèe palace for room without any delay as there must be no hitch about he meeting maxine once it be arrange for she to go there any misunderstanding would be fatal he go on as solemnly as if the safety of maxine 's head depend upon ivor 's trip i only wish i could have get you off to-night and in that case you might have go to she own house early in the morning she be in a frightful state of mind poor girl but it be only to-day that the contents of the packet reach I and be show to the prime minister then it be just before i hurry round here to see you that i receive a cypher telegram from she warning I that count godensky -- of whom you have probably hear -- a attaché of the russian embassy in pari somehow have come to suspect a -- er -- a game in high politics which she and i have be play she last accord to present intention as i tell you i have a idea that this man who be well know in pari society propose to mademoiselle de renzie refuse to take no for a answer and bore she until she perhaps be goad into give he a severe snub godensky be a vain man and would not forgive a snub especially if it have get talk about he would be a bad enemy : and mademoiselle seem to think that he be a very bitter and determine enemy apparently she do not know how much he have find out or whether he have actually find out anything at all or merely guess and ` bluff ' but one thing be unfortunately certain i believe every boat and every train between london and paris will be watch more closely than usual for the next day or two any known or suspect agent would not get through unchallenged but i can see no reason why you should not nor i answer ivor laugh a little i think i could make some trouble for anyone who try to stop I caution above all remember you be in training for a diplomatic career what if you should lose the packet i be go to give you i prophesy that in twenty-four hour the world would be empty of maxine de renzie : for the circumstance surround she in this transaction be peculiar the most peculiar i have ever be entangled in perhaps in rather a varied experience and they intimately concern she fiancé the vicomte raoul du laurier -- raoul du laurier exclaim ivor so she be engage to marry he yes do you know he i have friend who do he be in the french foreign office though they say he be more at home in the hunting field or write play -- which do not get produce quite so but they will get produce some day for i believe he be a extremely clever fellow in he way -- in everything except the diplomatic ` trade ' which he father would have he take up and get he into through heaven know what influence no du laurier 's no fool and be say to be a fine sportsman as well as almost absurdly good-looking mademoiselle maxine have plenty of excuse for she infatuation -- for i assure you it be nothing less she would jump into the fire for this young man and grill with a joan of arc smile on she face this would have be pleasant hearing for ivor if he would ever be really in love with maxine but i be oblige to admit to myself that he have not for he do not seem to care in the least on the contrary he grow a little more cheerful i can see that du laurier 's be in the french foreign office might make it rather awkward for miss de renzie if she -- if she be be rather too helpful to we he say exactly and thereby hang a tale -- a sensational and even romantic tale almost complicate enough for the plot of a novel when you meet mademoiselle to-morrow afternoon or evening if she care to take you into she confidence in reward for you service in regard to some private interest of she own which have get themselves wildly mix up with the gravest political matter she be at liberty to do so as far as i be concerned for you be to be trust and deserve to be trust you may say that to she from I if the occasion arise i hope with all my heart that everything may go smoothly if not -- the _ entente cordiale _ may burst like a bomb i -- who have make myself responsible in the matter with the clear understanding that england will deny I if the scheme 's a failure -- shall be shatter by a fly fragment the favorite actress of paris will be asphyxiate by the poisonous fume and you though i hope no worse harm may come to you will mourn for the misfortune of other you responsibility will be such that it will be almost as if you carry the destructive bomb itself until you get the packet into the hand of maxine de renzie good heaven i shall be glad when she have it say ivor you can not be gladder than she -- or i and here it be reply the foreign secretary i consider it great luck to have find such a messenger at a house i could enter without be suspect of any motive more subtle than a wish to eat a good supper or to meet some of the prettiest woman in london i would have give a great deal to see what he be give ivor to take to maxine and i be half tempt to lift myself up and peep at the two from behind the lounge but i could tell from they voice that they be stand quite near and it would have be too dangerous the foreign secretary who be rather a nervous man and fastidious about a woman 's look never could bear I : and i believe he would have think it almost as justifiable as drown a ugly kitten to choke I if he know i would overhear he secret however ivor 's next word give I some inkling of what i wish to know it be importance evidently do not consist in bulk he say lightly i can easily carry the case in my breast pocket pray put it there at once and guard it as you would guard the life and honor of a woman say the foreign secretary solemnly now i must go and look for my wife it be better that you and i should not be see together one never know who may have get in among the guest at a crush like this i will go out at one door and when you have wait for a few minute you can go by way of another a moment later there be silence in the room and i know that ivor be alone what if i speak and startle he all that be impish in I long to see how he face would look but there be too much at stake not only would i hate to have he scorn I for a eavesdropper but i have already build up a great plan for the use i could make of what i have overhear chapter iii lisa make mischief when ivor be safely out of the room my first thought be to escape from behind the lounge and get upstairs to my own quarter but just as i have sit up very cramped and wretched with one foot and one arm asleep lord mountstuart come in again and down i have to duck he have bring a friend who be as mad about old book and first edition as he a stuffy elderly thing who have never see lord mountstuart 's treasure before as both be perfectly daft on the subject they must have keep I lie there a hour while they fuss about from one glass-protected book-case to another murmur admiration of caxton or discuss the value of a mazarin bible with they nose in a lot of old volume which ought to have be eat up by moth long ago as for I i should have be delighted to set fire to the whole lot at last lord mountstuart -lrb- whom i have nickname stewey -rrb- remember that there be a ball go on and that he be the host so he and the other duffer potter away leave the coast clear and the door wide open it be just my luck -lrb- which be always bad and always have be -rrb- that a pair of flirt idiot for whom the conservatory or we den or the stair be not secluded enough must need be prying about and spy that open door before i have conquer my cramp and get up from behind the sofa the dim light commend itself to they silliness and after hesitate a minute the girl -- whoever she be -- allow herself to be draw into a room where she have no business to be then to make bad worse they select the lounge to sit upon and i have to lie closely wedge against the wall with pin and needle prick all over my cramped body while some man i do not know propose and be accept by some girl i shall probably never see they continue to sit make a tremendous fuss about each other until voice be hear off as they say in the direction for theatricals whereupon they spring up and hurry out like guilty thing upon a fearful summons by that time i be more dead than alive but i do manage to crawl out of my prison and creep up to my room by a back stairway which the servant use but it be very late now and people be go even the young one who love dancing as soon as i be able i scuttle out of my ball dress and into a dress gown also i undo my hair which be my one beauty and let it hang over my shoulder stream down in front on each side so that nobody would know one shoulder be higher than the other it be not that i be particularly anxious to appear well before di -lrb- though i have enough vanity not to like the contrast between we to seem too great even when she and i be alone -rrb- but because i want she to think when she come to my room that i would be there a long time i be sure she would come and peep in at the door to steal away if she find I asleep or to enquire how i feel if i be awake by and by the handle of the door move softly just as i have expect and see a light di come in it be late and she have dance all night but instead of look tired she be radiant when she speak she voice be as gay and happy as ivor 's have be when he first come into lord mountstuart 's study with the foreign secretary i say that i be much better and have have a nice rest that if i have not want to hear how everything have go at the ball i should have be in bed and asleep long ago everything go very well say she i think it be a great success do you dance every dance i ask work up slowly to what i mean to say except a few that i sit out i can guess who sit they out with you say i ivor dundas and one be number thirteen be not it how do you know he tell I he be go to have thirteen with you oh you need not try to hide anything from I he tell most thing to he ` imp ' be he nice when he propose he do not propose i 'll give you the sapphire bracelet lady mountstuart give I if he do not tell you he love you and ask if there would be a chance for he in case he get algier i would not take you bracelet even if -- if -- but you be a little witch lisa of course i be i exclaimed smile though i have a sickening wrench of the heart and i suppose you forget all he fault and failing and say he could have you algier or no algier i do not believe he have all those fault and failing you be talk about this evening say di with she cheek very pink he may have flirt a little at one time woman have spoil he a lot but -- but he _ do _ love I lisa and he do love maxine i laugh he do not he never love she i -- you see you put such horrid thought into my head that -- that i just mention she name when he say to-night -- oh when he say the usual thing about never have care seriously for anyone until he see I only -- it seem treacherous to call they ' _ usual _ ' because -- when you love a man you feel that the thing he say can never have be say before in the same way by any other man to any other woman only perhaps by the same man to another woman i mocked at she try to act as if i be tease in fun lisa you _ can _ be hateful sometimes she cry it be only for you good if i be hateful now i say i do not want to have you disappoint when it be too late i want you to keep you eye open and see exactly where you be go it be the truest thing ever say that ` love be blind ' you can not deny that you be in love with ivor dunda i do not deny it she answer with a proud air which would i suppose have make ivor want to kiss she and you do not deny it to he no i do not but thanks to you i put he upon a kind of probation i wish i have not now i wish i would show that i trust he entirely i know he deserve to be trust and to-morrow i shall tell he -- i do not think i should commit myself any further till day after to-morrow say i drily indeed you could not if you want to unless you write or wire you will not see he to-morrow yes i shall she contradict I open those big hazel eye of hers that look positively black with excitement he be go to the duchess of glasgow 's bazaar because i say i should most likely be there : and i will go -- but he will not how can you know anything about it i do know everything and i 'll tell you what i know if you 'll promise I two thing what thing that you will not ask I how i find out and that you 'll swear never to give I away to anybody of course i would not ` give you away ' as you call it but -- i be not sure i want you to tell I i have faith in ivor i would rather not hear story behind he back oh very well then go to the duchess 's to-morrow i snapped and wear you prettiest frock to please ivor when just about that time he 'll be arrive in pari to keep a very particular engagement with maxine de renzie di grow suddenly pale and she eye look violet instead of black i do not believe he be go to paris she exclaim i know he be go and i know he be go especially to see maxine it can not be he tell I to-night he would not cross the street to see she i -- i make it a condition -- that if he find he care enough for she to want to see she again he must go of course : but he must give up all thought of I if i be to reign i must reign alone well then on think it over he probably do find that he want to see she no for he love I just as much when we part only half a hour ago yet at least two hour ago he would arrange a meeting with maxine for to-morrow afternoon you be dream i be never wider awake : or if i be dream you can dream the same dream if you 'll be at victorium station to-morrow or rather this morning when the boat train go out at 10 o'clock i will be there cry di change from red to white and you shall be with I to see that you be wrong i know you will be wrong that be a engagement say i at 10 o'clock victorium station just you and i and nobody else in the house the wiser if i be right and ivor 's there shall you think it wise to give he up he might be oblige to go to pari suddenly for some business reason without mean to call on maxine de renzie -- in which case he have probably write I but -- at the station i shall ask he straight out -- that be if he be there as i be sure he will not be -- whether he intend to see mademoiselle de renzie if he say no i 'll believe he if he say yes -- you 'll tell he all be over between you he would know that without my tell after we talk last night and whatever happen you will say nothing about have hear maxine 's name from I nothing di answer and i know she would keep she word ivor dunda ' point of view chapter iv ivor travel to pari it be rather a startling sensation for a man to be catch suddenly by the nape of the neck so to speak and pitch out of heaven down to -- the other place but that be what happen to I when i arrive at victorium station on my way to pari i have take my ticket and hurry on to the platform without too much time to spare -lrb- i would be warn not to risk observation by be too early -rrb- when i come face to face with the girl whom at any other time i should have like best to meet : whom at that particular time i least wish to meet : diana forrest the imp -- lisa drummond -- be with she : but i see only di at first -- di look a little pale and harass but beautiful as always only last night i have tell she that pari have no attraction for I i have say that i do not care to see maxine de renzie : yet here i be on the way to see she and here be di discover I in the act of go to see she of course i could lie and i suppose some man even man of honor would think it justifiable as well as wise to lie in such a case when explanation be forbid but i could not lie to a girl i love as i love diana forrest it would have sicken I with life and with myself to do it : and it be with the knowledge in my mind that i could not and would not lie that i have to greet she with a conventional good morning be you go out of town i ask with my hat off for she and for the imp whose strange little weazened face i now see look over my tall love 's shoulder it have never before strike I that the imp be like a cat but suddenly the resemblance strike I -- something in the poor little creature 's expression it must have be or in she greenish gray eye which seem at that moment to concentrate all the knowledge of old and evil thing that have ever come into the world since the day of the early egyptian -- when a cat be worship no i be not go out of town di answer i come here to meet you in case you should be leave by this train and i bring lisa with I who tell you i be leave i ask hope for a second or two that the foreign secretary have confide to she something of he secret -- guess ours perhaps and that my unexpected inexplicable absence might injure I with she i can not tell you she answer i do not believe you would go even though i get you letter by the eight o'clock post this morning i be glad you get that i say i post it soon after i leave you last night why do not you tell I when we be bid each other good-bye that you would not be able to see I this afternoon instead of wait to write frankly and honestly i say -lrb- for i have to say it -rrb- just at the moment and only for the moment i forget about the duchess of glasgow 's bazaar that be because after i decide to drop in at the bazaar something happen which make it impossible for I to go in my letter i begged you to let I see you to-morrow instead and now i beg it again do say ` yes ' i 'll say yes on one condition -- and gladly she reply with a odd pale little smile that you tell I where you be go this morning i know it must seem horrid in I to ask but -- but -- oh ivor it _ be not _ horrid really you would not think it horrid if you could understand i be go to paris i answer begin to feel as if i have a cold potato where my heart ought to be i be oblige to go on business you do not say anything about paris in you letter this morning when you tell I you could not come to the duchess 's say di look like a beautiful unhappy child she eye big and appealing she mouth proud you only mention ` a urgent engagement which you would forget ' i think that would be enough to explain in a hurry i tell she lamely so it be -- so it would have be she falter if it have not be for -- what we say last night about -- pari and then -- i can not explain to you ivor any more than it seem you can to I but i do hear you mean to go there and -- after we talk i could not believe it i do not come to the station to find you i come because i be perfectly sure i would not find you and want to prove that i have not find you yet -- you be here and though i be here you will trust I just the same i say as firmly as i could of course i 'll trust you if -- if what if you 'll tell I just one little tiny thing : that you be not go to see maxine de renzie i may see she i admit but -- but at least you be not go on purpose this drive I into a corner without be disloyal to the foreign secretary i could not deny all personal desire to meet maxine yet to what suspicion be i not lay myself open in confess that i deliberately intend to see she have swear by all thing a man do swear by when he wish to please a girl that i do not wish to see maxine and would not see maxine you say you would trust I di i remind she for heaven 's sake do not break that promise but -- if you be break a promise to I a promise worse then because i do not ask you to promise i have too much faith in you for that i believe you when you say you do not care for -- anyone but I i have tell lisa it do not matter we speak like this before she i ask you to wait for my promise for a little while until i could be quite sure you do not think of miss de renzie as -- some people fancy you do if you want to see she i say you must go and you laugh at the idea yet the very next morning by the first train you start only because i be oblige to i hazard in spite of the foreign secretary and he precaution but i be punish for my lack of they by make matter worse instead of better for myself oblige to she echo then there be something you must settle with she before you can be -- free the guard be shut the carriage door in another minute i should lose the train and i must not lose the train for she future and mine as well as maxine 's i must not dearest i say hurriedly i be free there be no question of freedom yet i shall have to go i hold you to you word trust I not if you go to she -- this day of all day the word be wring from the poor child 's lip i could see by sheer anguish and it be like death to I that i should have to cause she this anguish instead of soothing it you shall you must i command rather than implored good-bye darling -- precious one i shall think of you every instant and i shall come back to you to-morrow you need not you need never come to I again she say white lip and the guard whistle wave he green flag do not dare to say such a cruel thing -- a thing you do not mean i cry catch at the closed door of a first-class compartment as i do so a little man inside jump to the window and shout reserve do not you see it be reserve which explain the fact that the door seem to be fasten i step back my eye fall on the label to which the man point and would have try the handle of the next carriage have not two man rush at the door as the train begin to move and dexterously open it with a railway key they throw themselves thus in my way would have lose I my last chance of catch the move train have i not dash in after they if i could choose i would be the last man to obtrude myself where i be not wanted but there be no time to choose and i be thankful to get in anywhere rather than break my word besides my heart be too sore at leave diana as i have have to leave she to care much for anything else i have just sense enough to fight my way in though the two man with the key -lrb- not the one who have occupy the compartment first -rrb- now yell that it be reserve and would have push I out if i have not be too strong for they i have a dim impression that instead of join with the newcomer the first man who would have keep the place to himself before they entrance seem willing to aid I against the other they be once foist upon he he appear to wish for my presence too or else he merely desire to prevent I from be dash onto the platform and perhaps kill for he thrust out a hand and try to pull I in at the same time a guard come along protest against the unseemly struggle and the carriage door be slam shut upon we all four when i get my balance and be able to look out the train have go so far that diana and lisa have be sweep away from my sight it be like a bad omen and the fear be cold upon I that i have lose my love for ever at that moment i suffer so atrociously that if it have not be too late i fear i should have sacrifice maxine and the foreign secretary and even the _ entente cordiale _ -lrb- provide he have not be exaggerate -rrb- for di 's sake and love 's sake but there be no go back now even if i would the train be already travel almost at full speed and there be nothing to do but resign myself to the inevitable and hope for the best someone it be clear have try to work mischief between diana and I and there be only too many chance that he have succeed could it be bob west i ask myself as i half-dazedly look for a place to sit down among the litter of small luggage with which the first occupant of the carriage have strew every seat i know that bob be as much in love with di as a man of he rather unintellectual unimaginative type could be and he have not show himself as friendly lately to I as he once have : still i do not think he be the sort of fellow to trip up a rival in the race by a trick even if he could possibly have find out that i be go to pari this morning will not you sit here sir a voice break into my thought and i see that the little man have clear a place for I next he own which be in a corner face the engine thank he absent-mindedly i sit down and begin to observe my travel companion for the first time so far they face have be mere blur for I : but now it strike I that all three be rather peculiar that be peculiar when see in a first-class carriage the man who have reserve the compartment for himself and who have remove a bundle of golf stick from the seat to make room for I do not look like a typical golfer nor do he appear at all the sort of person who might be expect to reserve a whole compartment for himself he be small and thin and weedy with little blinking pink-rimmed eye of the kind which ought to have have white lash instead of the sparse jet black one that rim they he forehead though narrow suggest shrewdness as do the expression of those light color eye of he which be set close to the sharp slightly up-turned nose he hair be so black that it make he skin seem singularly pallid though it be only sallow and a mean rabbit mouth work nervously over two prominent tooth though he clothes be good and new they have the air of have be buy ready make and in spite of he would-be smart get up the man -lrb- who might have be anywhere between thirty and thirty-eight -rrb- look somewhat like a ex-groom or bookmaker masquerade as a swell the two intruder who have violate the sanctity of the reserved compartment by means of they railway key be both bigger and more manly than he who have a right to it one be dark and probably jewish with a heavy beard and moustache in the midst of which he sensual and cruel mouth pout disagreeably red the other be puffy and flush with a brick-coloured complexion deeply pit by smallpox they also be flashily dress with horsey necktie and conspicuous scarf-pin as i glance at the pair they be talk together in a low voice with a open newspaper hold up between they but the man who have help I in against they will sit silent stare out of the window and uneasily finger he collar not one of the trio be apparently pay the slightest attention to I now that i be seat nevertheless i thought of the large long letter-case which i carry in a inner breast pocket of my carefully button coat i would not attract attention to the contents of that pocket by touch it to assure myself that it be safe but i have do so just before meet di and i feel certain that nothing could have happen to it since i fold my arm across my chest glance up to see where the cord of communication might be find in case of emergency and then reflect that these man be not likely to be dangerous since i have follow they into the compartment not they I this thought be reassure as they be three to one if they combine against I and the train be unfortunately not entirely a corridor train therefore have assure myself that i be not among spy bent on have my life or the secret i carry i forget about my fellow-traveller and fall into gloomy speculation as to my chance with diana i have be love she thinking of little else but she and my hope of she for many month now but never have i realize what a miserable empty world it would be for I without di for my own as i do now when i have perhaps lose she not that i would allow myself to think that i could not get she back i would not think it i would force she to believe in I to trust I even to repent she suspicion though appearance be all against I and heaven know how much or when i might be permit to explain i would not be a man if i take she at she word and let she slip from I no matter how many time that word be repeat so i tell myself over and over yet a voice inside I seem to say that nothing could be as it have be that i would sacrifice my happiness to please a stranger and to save a woman whom i have never really love di be so beautiful so sweet so use to be admire by man there be so many who love she so many with a thousand time more to offer than i have or would ever have : how could i hope that she would go on care for I after what have happen to-day i wonder she have not say in actual word last night that she would marry I whereas this morning she have almost say she never would i should have nobody to blame but myself if i come back to london to-morrow to find she engage to lord robert west -- a man who as he brother have no child might some day make she a duchess sorry to have seem rude just now sir say one of the two railway-key man suddenly remind I of he unnecessary existence hardly know what i be about when i shove you away from the door I and my friend be afraid of miss the train so we push -- instinct of self-preservation i suppose and he chuckle as if he have get off some witticism anyhow i apologise nothing intentional ` pon my word thanks no apology be necessary i reply as indifferently as i feel that be all right then finish the jewish-faced man who have speak he turn to he companion and the two resume they conversation behind the newspaper : but i now become conscious that they occasionally glance over the top at they neighbor or at I as if they whole attention be not take up with the news of the day any interest they might feel in I provide it have nothing to do with a certain pocket they be welcome to : but the little man be apparently not of the same mind concern himself he nervously twitch hand on the upholstered seat-arm which separate he place from mine attract my attention which be then draw up to he face he be so sickly pale under a kind of yellowish glaze spread over he complexion that i think he must be ill perhaps suffer from train sickness in anxious anticipation of the horror which might be in store for he on the boat presently he pull out a red-bordered handkerchief and unobtrusively wipe he forehead under he check travel cap when he have do this i see that he hair be leave streak with damp and there be a faint purplish stain on the handkerchief observe which with evident dismay he stuff the big square of coarse cambric hastily into he pocket the little beast must dye he hair i think contemptuously perhaps he be a albino really he eye look like it with that he throw a frightened glance at I which cause I to turn away and spare he the humiliation of know that he be observe but immediately after he make a effort to pull himself together pick up a book he have lay down to wipe he forehead and hold it so close to he nose that the print page must have be a mere blur unless he be very near-sighted thus he sit for some time yet i feel that no look throw by the other two be lose on he he seem to know each time one of they peer over the newspaper and when at last the train slow down by the admiralty pier all he nervousness return he small thin hand freckle on they back hover over one piece of luggage after another as if he could not decide how to pile the thing together naturally i have not bring my man with I on this errand therefore i have let my suitcase go into the van that i might have both hand free and i have nothing to do when the train stop but jump out and make for the boat nevertheless i linger folding up a newspaper and tear a article out of a magazine by way of excuse for it be not my object to be catch in a crowd and hustle perhaps by some clever wretch who might be lie in wait for what i have in my pocket it seem impossible that anyone could have learn that i be play messenger between the british secretary for foreign affair and maxine de renzie : still the danger and difficulty of the apparently simple mission have be so strongly impressed on I that i do not intend to neglect any precaution i linger therefore and the jewish-looking man with he heavy-faced friend linger also for some reason of they own they have no luggage except a small handbag each but these they open at the last minute to stuff in they newspaper and apparently to review the other contents presently when the first rush for the boat be over and the porter who have come to the door of we compartment have go away empty-handed i would have get out have i not catch a implore glance from the little man who have reserve the carriage perhaps i imagine it but he pink-rimmed eye seem to say for heaven 's sake do not leave I alone with these other would you be so very kind sir he say to I to beckon a porter as you be near the door i find after all that i sha not be able to carry everything myself i do as he ask and there be so much confusion in the carriage when the porter come that in self-defence the two friend get out with they bag i also descend and would have follow in the wake of the crowd if the little man have not call after I he have lose he ticket he say would i be so extremely oblige as to throw a eye about the platform to see if it have fall there i do oblige he in this manner without avail but by this time he have find the miss treasure in the fold of he travel rug and scramble out of the carriage attend by the porter i have secure for he he would have walk by my side towards the boat have i not drop behind a few step think -- as always -- of the contents of that inner breast pocket he and i be now at the tail-end of the procession hastening boatward or almost at the tail for there be but four or five other passenger -- a family party with a fat nurse and cry baby -- behind we as i approach the gangway i see on deck my late travel companion the jewish man and he friend regard we with interest then just as i be about to step on board almost on the little man 's heel there come a cry apparently from someone ahead : look out -- gangway 's fall in a instant all be confusion the fat nurse behind I scream as the nervous fellow in front leap like a cat intent on save himself no matter what happen to anyone else and fling I against the woman with the baby two or three excitable frenchman just ahead also attempt to turn thus nearly throw the little man onto he knee the large bag which he carry hit I across the shin in he terror he almost embrace I as he help himself up : the nurse as she stumble pitched forward onto my shoulder and if i have not seize the howling baby it would certainly have fall under we foot my bowler be knock over my eye and though a officer of the boat cry the reassuring intelligence that it be a false alarm -- that the gangway be all right and never have be anything but all right i could not readjust my hat nor see what be go on until the fat nurse have obligingly retrieve she charge without a word of thanks my first thought be for the letter-case in my pocket for i have a horrible idea that the scare might have be get up for the express purpose of rob I of it but i could feel its outline as plainly as ever under my coat and decide thankfully that after all the alarm have have nothing to do with I i have wire for a private cabin think it would be well to be out of the way of my fellow-passenger during the cross : but the weather have be rough for a day or two -lrb- it be not yet the middle of April -rrb- and everything be already engage therefore i walk the deck most of the time always conscious of the unusual thickness of my breast pocket the little man pace up and down too though he yellow face grow slowly green and he would have be much better off below lie on he back as for the two other they also remain on deck talk together as they lean against the rail but though i pass they now and again i notice that the little man invariably avoid they by turn before he reach they pitch at the gare du nord i regret that i have not carry my own bag because if i have it would have be examine on the boat and all bother would have be over but rather than run any risk in the crowd throng the _ douane _ i decide to let the suitcase look after itself and send down for it with the key from the hotel later again the little man be close to my side as i go in search of a cab for all he thing have be go through by the custom house officer in mid-channel so that he too be free to depart without delay he even seem to cling to I somewhat wistfully and i half think he mean to speak but he do not save for a good evening sir as i separated myself from he at last he have stick rather too close elbow to elbow but i have no fear for the letter-case as he be on the wrong side to play any conjurer 's trick with that the last i saw of the fellow he be walk toward a cab and look uneasily over he shoulder at he two late travel companion who be get into another vehicle near by i go straight to the élysée palace hotel where i have never stop before -- a long drive from the gare du nord -- and claim the room for which mr george sandford have wire from london the suite engage be a charming one and the private salon almost worthy to receive the lovely lady i expect nor do she keep I wait i have have time only to give instruction about send a man with a key to the station for my luggage to say that a lady would call to reach my room and to draw the curtain over the window when a knock come at the salon door i be in the act of turn on the electric light when this happen but to my surprise the room remain in darkness -- or rather in a pink dusk lend by the color of the curtain the lady have arrive monsieur announce the servant as monsieur expect she she have come up without wait but i regret that something have go wrong with the electricity all over the hotel it be but just now discover at time for turn on the light otherwise lamp and plenty of candle would have be provide though no doubt the light will fonctionne properly in a few minute if monsieur permit i will instantly bring he a lamp no thank you i say hurriedly for i do not wish to be interrupt in the midst of my important interview with maxine if the light come on it will he all right : if not i will put back the curtain and it be not yet quite dark show the lady in into the pink twilight of the curtained room come maxine de renzie whose tall and noble figure i recognize in its plain close-fitting black dress though she wide brim hat be drape with a thickly embroidered veil that completely hide she face while long graceful lace fold fall over and obscure the bright auburn of she hair one moment i say let I push the curtain back the electricity have fail no no she answer better leave they as they be the light may come on and we be see from outside why -- as she draw nearer to I and the servant close the door i think i recognize that voice it be ivor dunda no other say i do not the -- be not you warn who would be the man to come no she reply only the assume name of the messenger and place of meeting be wire it be safer so even though the telegram be in a cypher which i trust nobody know -- except myself and one other but i be glad -- glad it be you it be clever of -- he to have send you no one would dream that -- no one would think it strange if they know -- as i hope they will not -- that you come to pari to see I oh the relief that you have get through safely nothing have happen you have -- the paper nothing have happen and i have the paper i reassure she no adventure to speak of on the way and no reason to think i have be spotted anyway here i be and here be something which will put a end to you anxiety and i tap the breast of my coat meaningly thank god breathe maxine with a thrilling note in she voice which would have do she great credit on the stage though i be sure she be never further in she life from the thought of act after all i have suffer it seem too good to be true give it to I quick ivor and let I go i will i say but you might seem to take just a little more interest in I even if you do not really feel it you know you might just say ` how have you be for the last twelve month ' oh i do take a interest and i be grateful to you -- i can not tell you how grateful but i have no time to think either of you or myself now she say eagerly if you know everything you would understand i know practically nothing i confess still i do understand i be only tease you forgive I i ought not to have do it even for a minute here be the letter-case which the foreign -- which be give to I to bring to you wait she exclaim still in the half whisper from which she have never depart wait it will he better to lock the door but even as she speak there come a knock loud and insistent with a spring she fling herself on I she hand fumble for the pocket i have tap suggestively a moment ago i let she draw out the long case which i have be guard -- the case i have not once touch since leave london except to feel anxiously for its outline through my button coat at least whatever might be about to happen she have it in she own hand now neither of we speak nor make a sound during the instant that she cling to I the faint well-remembered perfume of she hair she dress in my nostril but as she start away and i know that she have the letter-case the knock come again then before i could be sure whether she wish for time to hide or whether she would have I cry come in without seem to hesitate the door open for a second or two maxine and i and a group of figure at the door be mere shadow in the ever deepen pink dusk : but i could scarcely have count ten before the long expect light spring up i have turn it on in more than one place : and a sudden brilliant illumination show I a tall commissary of police with two little gendarme look over he shoulder i throw a glance at maxine who be still veil and be relieve to see that she have find some means of put the letter-case out of sight have ascertain this i sharply enquire in french what in the devil 's name the commissary of police mean by walk into a englishman 's room without be invite and not only that but what under heaven he want anyway he be far more polite than i be ten thousand pardon monsieur he apologise i knock twice but hear no answer enter think that perhaps after all the salon be unoccupied important business must be my excuse i have to request that monsieur dunda will first place in my hand the gift he have bring from london to mademoiselle de renzie i have bring no gift for mademoiselle de renzie i prevaricate boldly but the man 's knowledge of my name be ominous if the pari police have contrived to learn it already as well as to find out that i be the bearer of something for maxine it look as if they know enough to play the game in they own way -- whatever that might be perhaps i should say the thing which mademoiselle lend -- to a friend in england and monsieur have now kindly return amend the commissary of police as politely as patiently as ever really i do not know what you be talk about i say shrugging my shoulder and look bewildered -- or hope that i look bewildered all the while i be wonder desperately if this mean ruin for maxine or if she would still find some way of save herself but all i could do for she at the moment be to keep calm and tell as many lie as necessary i have not be able to lie to diana but i have no compunction about do it now if it be to help maxine the worst be that i be far from sure it would help she i trust monsieur that you do not wish to prevent the french police from do they duty say the officer he tone become peremptory for the first time should you attempt it i should unfortunately be compel to order that monsieur be search you seem to forget that you be deal with a british subject say i who be offend against the law of a friendly country he cap my word you can complain afterwards monsieur but now -- why do not you empty you pocket mr dunda suggest maxine lightly yet contemptuously and show they that you have nothing in which the police can have any interest i suppose the next thing they propose will be to search I i deeply regret to say that will be the next thing mademoiselle unless satisfaction be give to I return the commissary of police maxine throw back she thick veil and if this be the first time these man have ever see the celebrated actress off the stage it seem to I that she beauty must almost have dazzle they thus suddenly display for maxine be a gloriously handsome woman and never have she be most striking more wonderful than at that moment when she dark eye laugh out of she white face and she red lip smile as if neither they nor the great eye have any secret to hide look at I she say throw back she arm in such a way as to bring forward she slender body in the tight black sheath of the dress which be of the fashion which i think woman call princess it fit she as smoothly as the glove that cover she arm to the elbow do you think there be much chance for concealment in this dress she ask i have not a pocket you see no self-respecting woman could have in a gown like this i do not know in the least what sort of ` gift ' my old friend be suppose to have bring I be it large or small i 'll take off my glove and let you see my ring if you like monsieur le commisaire for i have be teach as a servant of the public to be civil to my fellow servant even if they should be unreasonable no you do not want to see my ring let I oblige you by take off my hat then i might have put the thing -- whatever it be -- in my hair as she speak she draw out she hatpin still laugh in a half scornful half good-natured way she be bewitching as she stand smile with she black hat and veil in she hand the ruffle wave of she dark red hair shadow she forehead meanwhile fire by she example i turn out the contents of my pocket : a letter or two a flat gold cigarette case a match box my watch and a handkerchief : also in a outer pocket of my coat a small bit of crumpled paper of which i have no recollection : but as one of the gendarme politely pick it up from the floor where it have fall and hand it to I without examine it mechanically i slip it back into the pocket and think no more of it at the time there be too many other thing to think of and i be wonder what on earth maxine could have do with the letter-case she have have no more than two seconds in which to dispose of it hardly enough it seem to I to pass it from one hand to another yet apparently it be well hide now be you satisfied she ask now that we have both show you we have nothing to conceal or would you like to take I to the police station and have some dreadful female search I more thoroughly still i 'll go with you if you wish i will not even he indiscreet enough to ask question since you seem inclined to do what we have no need to do -- keep you own secret all i stipulate be that if you care to take such measure you 'll take they at once for as you may possibly be aware this be the first night of my new play and i should be sorry to be late the commissary of police look fixedly at maxine for a moment as if he would read she soul no mademoiselle he say i be convince that neither you nor monsieur be conceal anything about you person i will not trouble you further until we have search the room maxine could not blanch for already she be as white as she will be when she lie in she coffin but though she expression do not change i see that the pupil of she eye dilated actress that she be she could control she muscle but she could not control the beating of the blood in she brain i feel that she be conscious of this betrayal under the gaze of the policeman and she laugh to distract he attention my heart ache for she i thought of a meadow-lark manoeuvering to hide the place where she nest lie poor beautiful maxine in spite of she pride she high courage the veneer of hardness which she experience of the world have give she be infinitely pathetic in my eye and though i have never love she though i do love another woman i would have give my life gladly at this minute if i could have save she from the catastrophe she dread chapter v ivor do what he can for maxine how long a time do you think i have be in this room monsieur she ask before you -- rather rudely i must say -- break in upon my conversation with my friend you have be here exactly three minute reply the commissary of police as much as that i should have think less we have to greet each other after have be part for many month and still in the three minute you believe that we have time to concoct a plot of some sort and to find some safe corner -- all the while in semi-darkness -- for the hiding of a thing important to the police -- a bomb perhaps you must think we very clever i know that you be very clever mademoiselle perhaps i ought to thank you for the compliment she answer allow anger to warm she voice at last but this be almost beyond a joke a woman come to the room of a friend both of they be so place that they prefer she call not to be talk about for that reason and for the woman 's sake the friend choose to take a name that be not he -- as he have a right to do yet just because that woman happen unfortunately to be well-known -- she face and name be public property -- she be follow she be spy upon humiliate and all no doubt on account of some silly mistake or malicious false information ah it be shameful monsieur i wonder the police of pari can stoop to such stupidity such meanness when we have find out that it be a mistake the police of paris will apologise to you mademoiselle through I say the commissary until then i regret if we duty make we disagreeable to you then turn to he two gendarme he direct they to search the room begin with all possible place in which a paper parcel or large envelope might be hide within ten metre of the spot where mademoiselle and monsieur have stand talk together when the police open the door maxine do not protest again with she head up and a look as if the three policeman be of no more importance to she than the furniture of the room she walk to the mantelpiece and stand lean she elbow upon it weariness disgusted indifference be in she attitude but i guess that she feel herself actually in need of the physical support the two gendarme move about in noiseless obedience they face expressionless as mask they do not glance at maxine give themselves entirely to the task at which they have be set but they superior officer do not once take he eye from the pure profile she turn scornfully towards he i know why he watch she thus and thought of a foolish child 's game i use to play twenty year ago at little-boy-and-girl party : the game of hide-the-handkerchief while one search for the treasure those who know where it be stand by say : now you be warm now you be hot -- boil hot now you be cool again now you be ice cold it be as if we be five player at this game and maxine de renzie 's white deathly smile face be expect to proclaim against she will : now you be warm now you be hot now you be ice cold there be a table in the middle of the room with one or two volume of photograph and brightly-bound guide book of pari upon it as well as my hat and glove which i have toss down as i come in the gendarme pick up these thing examine they lay they aside peer under the table peep behind the silk cushion on the sofa open the door and drawer of a bric-à-brac cabinet and a small write desk lift the corner of the rug on the bare polished floor and finally bow apology to maxine for disturbing she take out the log from the fireplace where the fire be ready for lighting and pry into the vase on the mantel also they shake the silk and lace window curtain and move the picture on the wall when all this have be do in vain the pair confess with shrug of the shoulder that they be at a loss during the search which have be conduct in silence i have a curious sensation cause by my intense sympathy with maxine 's suffering i feel as if my heart be the pendulum of a clock which have be jar until it be uncertain whether to go on or stop once when the gendarme be peer under the sofa or behind the sofa cushion a gray shadow round maxine 's eye make she beautiful face look like a death-mask in the white electric light which do not fail now or spare she any cruelty of revelation she be smile contemptuously still -- always the same smile -- but she forehead appear to have be sprinkle with diamond dust i see that dewy sparkle and wonder sickeningly if the enemy see it too but i have not long to wait before be satisfy on this point the keen-eyed frenchman give no further instruction to he baffled subordinate but cross the room to the sofa stand stare at it fixedly then grasp the back with he capable-looking hand instead of begin at once a quest which he gendarme have abandon he search the face of the tortured woman unflinching in courage she seem not to see he but it be as if she have suddenly cease to breathe she bosom no longer rise and fall the only movement be the visible knock of she heart i feel that in another moment if he find what she have hide she heart would knock no longer and she would die for a second i wildly count the chance of overpower all three man stunning they into unconsciousness and give maxine time to escape with the letter-case but i know the attempt would be useless even if i could succeed the noise would arouse the hotel people would come other policeman would rush in to the help of they comrade and matter would be worse with we than before the frenchman have look at maxine and see that tell-tale beating of she bodice deliberately lay the silk cushion on the floor then push he hand down between the seat and the back of the sofa he move it along the crevice inch by inch i watch the hand which look cruel to I as that of a executioner i think maxine watch it too suddenly it stop it have find something the other hand spring to its assistance both work together grope and prying for a few seconds : evidently the something hide have be force deeply and firmly down then up it come -- a dark red leather case which be neither a letter-case nor a jewel-case but might be use for either my heart almost stop beat in the intense relief i feel for this be not the thing i have come from london to bring maxine i could hardly keep back a cry of joy but i do keep it back for suspense and anxiety have leave I a few grain of sense voilum grunt the commissary of police i say that you be clever mademoiselle but it would have be as well for all concern if you have spare we this trouble you alone be to blame for the trouble answer maxine i never see that thing before in my life i be astonish that there be no ring of satisfaction in she voice it sound hard and defiant but there be no triumph in it no joy that so far she be save -- as if by a miracle rather be she tone that of a woman at bay fight to the last but without hope nor do i ever see it before i echo she word she glance at I as if with gratitude yet there be no need for gratitude i be not lie for she sake but speak the plain truth as i think that she must know for the first time the commissary of police condescend to laugh i suppose you want I to believe that the last occupant of this room tuck some value possession down into a safe hiding place -- and then forget all about it that be likely be it not you shall have the pleasure mademoiselle -- and you monsieur -- of see with I what that careless person leave behind he he have lay the thing on the table and now he tap it aggravatingly with he hand but the strain be over for I i look on with calmness and be amaze when at last maxine fly to he no longer scornful tragically indifferent in she manner but implore -- a weak agonized woman for the love of god spare I monsieur she sob you do not understand i confess that what you have there be mine i have hold myself high in my own eye and the eye of the world because i -- a actress -- never take a lover but now i be like the other this be my lover there be the price i put on my love now monsieur i ask you on my womanhood to hold what be in that leather case sacred i feel the blood rush to my face as if she have strike I across it with a whip my first thought to my shame be a selfish one what if this become know this thing that she have say and diana should hear then indeed all hope for I with the girl i loved would be over my second thought be for maxine herself but she have seal my lip since she have choose the way i could only be silent mademoiselle it be a grief to I that i must refuse such a prayer from such a woman but duty before chivalry i must see the contents of that case say the commissary of police she catch he hand and rain tear upon it no -- no she implore if i be rich i would offer you thousand to spare I i have be extravagant -- i have not save but all i have in the world be yours if -- there can be no such ` if ' mademoiselle the man break in and wrenching he hand free he open the case before she could again prevent he out fall a cascade of light a diamond necklace it flash to the floor where it lay on one of the sofa cushion send up a spray of rainbow color _ sacré bleu _ mutter the frenchman under he breath for whatever he have expect he have not expect that but maxine speak not a word shear of hope as in spite of she prayer and tear the leather case be tear open she be shear of strength as well and the beautiful tall figure crumple like a flower break on its stalk she would have fall if i have not catch she hold she up against my shoulder when the cataract of diamond spring out of the case however i feel she limp body straighten itself i feel she pulse leap i feel she begin to _ live _ she have drunk a draught of hope and life and fortify by it be gather all she scattered force together for a new fight if fight she must again the commissary of police turn the leather case wrong side out it be empty there have be nothing inside but the necklace : not a card not a scrap of paper where then be the document crestfallen he put the question half to himself half to maxine de renzie what document she ask too wise to betray relief in voice or face hearing the heavy tone see the shame face the hanging head that lay against my shoulder who -- know a little less than i do of the truth -- would have dream that in she soul she thank god for a miracle even i would not have be sure have i not feel the life steal back into she half-dead body the contents of the case be not what i come here to find admit the enemy i do not know what you come to find but you have make I suffer horribly say maxine you have be very cruel to a woman who have do nothing to deserve such humiliation all pleasure i might have take in my diamond be go now i shall never have a peaceful moment -- never be able to wear they joyfully i shall have the thought in my mind that people who look at I will be say : ` every woman have she price there be the price of maxine de renzie ' you need have no such thought mademoiselle the man protest we shall never speak to anyone except those who will receive we report of what we have hear and see in this room will not you search further ask maxine since you seem to expect something else -- you would not have have time to conceal more than one thing mademoiselle say the policeman with a smile that be faintly grim besides this case be what you do not wish we to find you be a great actress but you could not control the dew which spring out on you forehead or the beating of you heart when i touch the sofa so i know : i have be watch you for that there have be a error and i can only apologise i do not blame you but those who send you say maxine let I lead she to a chair into which she sink limply i be thankful you do not tell I these diamond be contraband in some way i be not sure but it would end in that not at all mademoiselle i wish you joy of they it be you who will adorn the jewel not they you again i apologise for myself and my companion we have but do we duty i have a enemy who must have contrived this plot against I exclaim maxine as if on a sudden thought it be say that ` hell have no fury like a woman scorn ' but what of a man who have be scorn -- by a woman he know i want all my strength for to-night -- the night of the new play -- and he will be hope that this have break I but i will not be break if you would atone monsieur for you part in this scene you will go to the theater this evening and encourage I by you applause all three bow the commissary of police lately so relentless murmured compliment it be all very french and after what have pass give I the sensation that i be in a dream chapter vi ivor hear the story they be go they have close the door behind they i look at maxine but she do not speak with she finger to she lip she get up tremble still and walk to the door she open it suddenly to look out nobody be there they may have go into you bedroom to listen at that door she whisper i take the hint and go quickly into the room adjoining turn on the light emptiness there : but i leave the door open and the electricity switch on they might change they mind or be more subtle than they wish to seem maxine throw herself on the sofa gather up the necklace from the cushion where it have fall and lift it in both hand press the glittering mass against she lip and cheek thank god thank god -- and thank you ivor best of friend she say brokenly in so low a voice that no ear could have catch she word even if press against the keyhole then let the diamond drop into she lap she fling back she head and laugh and cry together oh ivor ivor she pant between she sob and hysterical gust of laughter the agony of it -- the agony -- and the joy now you be wonderful good precious ivor -- dear friend -- saint at this i laugh too partly to calm she and pat gently the hand with which she have nervously clutch my sleeve heaven know i do not deserve one of those epithet i say i 'll just stick to friend not deserve they she repeat not deserve they when you have save I -- i do not yet understand how -- from a horror worse than death -- oh but a thousand time worse for i want to die i mean to die if they have find it i should not have live to see to-morrow morning tell I -- how do you work such a miracle how do you get this necklace that mean so much to I -lrb- and to one i love -rrb- and how do you hide the -- other thing i do not know anything about this necklace i answer stupidly i do not bring it you -- _ do not bring it _ no at least that red leather thing be not the case i carry when the fellow pull it out from the sofa i see it be not what i would have so i thank we lucky star and would have try to let you know that all hope be not over if i would dare to catch you eye or make a signal maxine be suddenly calm the tear have dry on she cheek and she eye be fever-bright ivor you can not know what you be talk about she say in a changed voice that red leather case be what you take out of you breast pocket and hand to I when i first come into the room at the sound of the knock i push it down as far as i could between the seat and back of the sofa and then run off to a distance before the door open you _ do _ bring the necklace knowingly or not and as it be the cause of all my trouble in the beginning i need not tell you of the joy i have in see it apart from the heavenly relief of be spare discovery of the thing i fear now when you have give I the other packet which you hide so marvellously i can go away happy i stare at she feeling more than ever like one in a dream i give you the only thing i bring i say it be in my breast pocket inside my coat i take it out and put it in you hand there be no other thing look again in the sofa it must be there still this red case be something else -- we can try to account for it later it all come through the light not work if it have not be dusk you would have see that i give you a dark green leather letter-case -- quite different from this though of about the same length -- rather less thick and -- frantically she begin ransack the crevice between the seat and back of the sofa but nothing be there we might have know there could be nothing or the commissary of police would have be before we with a cry she cut I short at last throw up she hand in despair she be deathly pale again and all the light have go out of she eye leave they dull as if she have be sick with some long illness what will become of I she stammer the treaty lose my god -- what shall i do ivor you be kill I do you know -- you be kill I the word treaty be new to I in this connection for the foreign secretary have not think it necessary that he messenger should be wholly in he secret -- and maxine 's yet hear the word bring no great surprise i know that i have be cat 's - paw in some game of high stake but it be of maxine i think now and the importance of the loss to she not the national disaster which it might well be also wait i say do not despair yet there be some mistake perhaps we shall be able to see light when we have thrash this out and talk it over i know i have a green letter-case it never leave my pocket i thought of it and guard it every moment could those diamond have be inside it could the foreign secretary have give I the necklace _ instead _ of what you expect no no she answer with desperate impatience he know that the only thing which could save I be the document i would send he i wire that i must have it back again immediately for my own sake -- for he -- for the sake of england ivor think again do you want I to go mad i will think i say try to speak reassuringly give I a moment -- a quiet moment -- a quiet moment she repeat bitterly when for I each second be a hour it be late and this be the night of my new play soon i must be at the theater for the make-up and dress of this part for the first act be a heavy business i do not want all pari to know that maxine de renzie have be ruin by she enemy let we keep the secret while we can for other ' sake and so gain time for we own if all be not lose -- if you believe still that there be any hope oh save I ivor -- somehow my whole life be in this let you understudy take you part to-night while we think and work i suggest you can not go to the theater in this state for a actress there be no such word as ` can not ' she say bitterly i could play a part to the finish and crawl off the stage to die the next instant yet no one would have guess that i be die i have no understudy what use to have one what audience would stop in the theater after a announcement that they maxine 's understudy would take she place every man and woman would walk out and get he money back no for the sake of the man i love better than my life or twenty life -- the man i have either save or ruin -- i 'll play tonight if i go mad or kill myself to-morrow do not ` think quietly ' ivor think out aloud and let I follow the workings of you mind we may help each other so let we go over together everything that happen to you from the minute you take the letter-case from the foreign secretary up to the minute i come into this room i obeyed begin at the very begin and tell she all except the part that have to do with diana forrest she have no concern in that i tell she how i have sleep with the green letter-case under my pillow and have wake to feel and look for it once or twice a hour how when morning come i have be late in get to the train : how i have struggle with the two man who try to keep I out of the reserved compartment into which they be intrude how the man who have a right to it after wish to prevent my enter help I in the end rather than be alone with the pair who have force themselves upon he how he have stumble almost into my arm in a panic during the confusion after the false alarm on the boat 's gangway how he have walk beside I and seem on the point of speaking later in the gare du nord how i have avoid and lose sight of he but how i have many time covertly touch my pocket to be sure that through all the letter-case be still safe there maxine grow calmer though not i think more hopeful as i talk and at last she fold up the diamond neatly in the red case which she give to I put that into the same pocket she say and then pass you hand over you coat as you do often before now do it feel exactly as if it be the green letter-case with which you start out yes i think it do i answer doubtfully i be afraid i should not know the difference this _ may _ be a little thicker than the other but -- i can not be sure and you see i never once have a chance to unbutton my coat and look at the thing i have in this inner pocket it would have attract too much attention to risk that and as a matter of fact i be especially warn not to do it i could trust only to the touch but even grant that by a skill almost clever enough for sleight of hand -- a skill which only the smartest pickpocket in europe could possess -- why should a thief who have steal my letter-case give I instead a string of diamond worth many thousand of pound if he want to put something into my pocket of much the same size and shape as the thing he steal so that i should not suspect my loss why do not he slip in the red case _ empty _ instead of contain the necklace _ this _ necklace too of all thing in the world murmur maxine lose in the mystery it be like a dream yet here -- by some miracle -- it be in we hand and the treaty be go the treaty be go i repeat miserably it be maxine herself who have speak the word which i merely echo yet it almost kill she to hear they from I no doubt it give the dreadful fact a kind of inevitability she fling herself down on the sofa with a groan she face bury in she hand my god what a punishment she stammer i have ruin the man i risk everything to save i will go to the theater and i will act to-night my friend but unless you can give I back what be lose when to-morrow morning come i shall be out of the world do not say that i implored sick with pity for she and shame at my failure all hope be not over yet it can not be i 'll think this out there must be a solution there must be a way of lay hold of what _ seem _ to be go if by give my life i could get it i assure you i would not hesitate for a instant now : so you see there be nothing i will not do to help you only i wish the path could be make a little plainer for I -- unless for some reason it be necessary for you to keep I in the dark the word ` treaty ' i hear for the first time from you i do not know what i be bring you except that it be a document of international importance and that you would be help the british foreign secretary -- perhaps great britain as a power -- in some ticklish maneuver of high politics he say that so far as he be concern you might tell I more if you like he leave it to you that be he message then i will tell you more maxine exclaimed it will be better to do so i know that it will make it easier for you to help I the document you be bring I be a treaty -- a quite new treaty between japan russium and france : not a copy but the original england have be warn that there be a secret understanding between the three country unknown to she there be no time to make a copy and i steal the real treaty from raoul du laurier to whom i be engage -- whom i adore ivor as i do not know it be in I to adore any man you know he name perhaps -- that he be under secretary in the foreign office here in paris oh i can read in you eye what you be think of I now you can not think worse of I than i think of myself yet i do the thing for raoul 's sake there be that in my defense -- only that i do not understand i say try not to show the horror of maxine 's treachery to a man who love and trust she which i could not help feeling how could you -- except that i have betray he but i 'll tell you everything -- i 'll go back a long way then you 'll pity I even if you scorn I too you 'll work for I -- to save I and he for year i have help the british government oh i will not spare myself i have be a spy sometimes against one power sometimes against another when there be anything to do against russium i be always glad because my dear father be a pole and you know how pole feel towards russium russium ruin he life and strip it of everything worth have not only money but -- oh well that be not in this story of mine i will not trouble you or waste time in the tell only when i be a very young girl i be already the enemy of all that be russian with a big debt of revenge to pay and i have be pay it slowly do not think that the money i have have for my work -- hateful work often -- have be use for myself it be be for my father 's country -- poor sad country -- every shilling of english coin as a actress i have support myself and as a actress it have be easier for I to do the other secret work than it would have be for a woman lead a more sheltered life mingle less with distinguish person of different country or unable to be eccentric without cause scandal as for france she be the friend of russium and i have not a drop of french blood in my vein so at least i have never be treacherous to my own people oh i have make some great _ coup _ in the last eight or nine year ivor for i begin before i be sixteen and now i be twenty-six once or twice england have have to thank I for give she news of the most vital importance you be shock to hear what my inner life have be if i be shock no doubt the feeling would be more than half conventional one hardly know how conventional one 's opinion be until one stop to think say i once i glory in the work maxine go on but that be before i fall in love you and i have play a little at be in love but that be to pass the time both of we be flirt i would never meet raoul then and i have never really love any man except he it come at first sight for I : and when he tell I that he care he say it have begin when he first see I on the stage so you see it be as if we be mean for each other from the moment i give he my promise i promise myself that the old work should be give up for ever : raoul 's _ fiancée _ raoul 's wife should not be the tool of diplomatist besides as he be a frenchman he wife would owe loyalty to france which maxine de renzie never owe i want -- oh how much i want -- to be only what raoul believe I just a simple true-hearted woman with nothing to hide it make I sick to think that there be one thing i must always conceal from he but i do the best i could i vow to myself that i would break with the past and i write a letter to the british foreign secretary who have always be a good friend of mine i say i be engage and hope to begin my life all over again in a different way though he might be sure that i would know how to keep he secret as well as my own oh ivor to think that be hardly more than a week ago i be happy then i feel twenty year older now a week ago you have be engage only a week i break in not many day more i guess i hope long ago that raoul care but he would not have tell I even the day he do tell if he have not lose he head a little he have not mean to speak it seem for he be poor and he think he have no right but what be a man worth who do not lose he head when he love a woman i adore he for it we decide not to let anyone know until a few week before we could marry as i do not care to have my engagement gossip about for month on end there be reason why -- more than one : but the man of all other whom i do not want to know the truth find out or rather suspect what have happen the very day when raoul and i come to a understanding -- count godensky of the russian embassy he call and be let in by mistake while raoul be with I and just as he must have see by we face that there be something to suspect so i saw by he that he do suspect oh a hateful person i have refuse he three time there be some man so vain that they can never believe a woman really mean to say ` no ' to they count godensky be one of those and he be dangerous too i be afraid of he since i have care for raoul though i use to be afraid of no one when i would only myself to think of raoul be go away that very night he have a errand to do for a woman who be a dear and intimate friend of he dead mother you must know of the duchesse de montpellier well it be for she : and raoul be like she son she have no child of she own i do not know she i say but i have see she a charming look woman about forty-five with a gloomy-faced husband -- a fellow who might be rather a tartar to live with they be point out to I at monte carlo one year in the casino where the duchess seem to be enjoy herself hugely though the duke have the air of be drag in against he will no doubt he have be -- or else he be there to fetch she out poor dear she be a dreadful gambler it be in she blood i she lose i do not know how much at monte carlo on a ` infallible system ' she have she be afraid of she husband though she love he immensely and lately a craze she be have for bridge have cost she so much that she dare not tell the duke who hate she gambling she confess to raoul and beg he to help she -- not with money for he have none but by take a famous and wonderful diamond necklace of hers to amsterdam sell the stone for she there and have they replace with paste it be all to be do very secretly of course so that the duke should not know and raoul hate it but he could not refuse he have no idea of tell I this story that day when he ` lose he head ' while we be bid each other good-bye before he journey he do not mention the name of the duchess but say only that he have leave and be go to holland on business but while he be away a _ dreadful _ thing happen -- the most ghastly misfortune -- and as we be engage to be marry he feel oblige when he come back to let I know the worst what be the dreadful thing that happen i ask as she pause press she hand against she temple the necklace be steal from raoul by a thief who must have be one of the most expert in the world can you imagine raoul 's feeling he come to I in despair ask my advice what be he to do he dare not appeal to the police or the duchess 's secret would come out and he could not bear to tell she of the loss not only because it would be such a blow to she as she be depend on the money from the sale of the jewel but because she know that he be in some difficulty and _ might _ be tempt to believe that he would only pretend the diamond be steal -- while really he would sell they for he own use as she be fond of he and trust he probably she would have think no such thing i try to comfort maxine but certainly it be a rather bad fix rather bad fix oh you laconic creature englishman all you think of be to hide you feeling behind icy word as for I -- well there be nothing i would not have do to help he -- nothing my life would have be a small thing to give i would have give my soul and already a thought come flash into my mind i begged raoul to wait and say nothing to the duchess who do not even know yet that he would come back from amsterdam the think in my mind be about the commission from you secretary for foreign affair as i tell you i would just send he word in the usual cypher and through the usual channel that i could not do what he want he would offer I eight thousand pound to undertake the service and four more if i succeed i believe i could succeed if i try and with the few thousand i would save up and sell such jewel as i have i could make up the sum raoul have be tell to ask for the necklace then he could give it to the duchess and she need never know that the diamond have be steal all that night i lay awake think think next day at a time when i know raoul would be work in he office i go to see he there and cheer he up as well as i could i tell he that in a few day i hope to have eighteen or twenty thousand pound in my hand -- all for he to let he have the money would make I happier than i would ever be at first he say he would not take it from I -- i know he would say that but at last after i would cry and beg and persuade he consent only it be to be a loan and some how some time he would pay I back in that office there be several great safe and when we have grow quite happy and gay together i make raoul tell I which be the most important of all -- where the really sacred and valuable thing be keep he laugh and point out the most interesting one -- the one he say which hold all the deepest secret of french foreign diplomacy i be sure then that the thing i have to get for the british foreign secretary must be there though it be such a new thing that it could not have be anywhere for long ` there be three key to that safe ' say raoul ` one be keep by the president one be always with the foreign secretary this be the third ' and he show I a strange little key different to any i have see before ` oh do let I have a peep at these wonderful papers ' i plead with he before come i have plan what to do round my throat i wear a string of imitation pearl which i would put on for a special purpose but they be pretty and so well make that only a expert would know they be not real raoul be not a expert so at the moment he fit the key into the lock of the safe to open the door i give a sly little pull and break the thread make the pearl roll everywhere about the floor he be quite distressed forget all about the key in the lock and fly to pick up the pearl as if each one be worth at least a thousand franc while he be busy find the lose bead i whip out the key take a impression of it on a piece of wax i have ready conceal in my handkerchief and slip it back into the lock while he be still on he hand and knee on the floor then he open the safe-door for a moment just to give I the peep i have beg for but not long enough for I to touch anything even if i would dare to try with he stand there enough though to show I that the document be neatly arrange in label pigeon-hole and to see they general character color and shape that same day a key to fit the lock be be make and when it be ready i make a excuse to call again on raoul at the office not that a very elaborate excuse be need the poor fellow trust I as he trust himself or more be only too glad to have I come to he even in that sacred place now the thing be to get he away but i would make up my mind what to do in another office upstairs be a friend of raoul 's -- the one who introduce we to each other and i would make up a message for he which i begged raoul to take and bring he friend to speak to I he go and i believe i might count on five minute to myself no more -- but those five minute would have to be enough for success or failure the instant the door shut behind raoul i be at the safe the key fitted i snatch out a fold document and open it to make quite quite certain it be the right one for a mistake would be inexcusable and spoil everything it be what i want -- the treaty newly make between japan russium and france -- the treaty which you foreign secretary think he have reason to believe be a secret one arrange between the three country without the knowledge of england and to the prejudice of she interest the one glance i have give I the impression that the document be nothing of the kind but quite innocent affect trade only yet that be not my business i have to send it to the foreign secretary who want to know its precise nature and whether england be be deceive in place of the treaty i slip into its pigeon-hole a document i would bring with I -- just like the real thing no one open the safe on other business would suspect the change that have be make my hope be to get the treaty back before it should be miss you see i be betray raoul to save he do you understand i understand you must have persuade yourself that you be justified but good heaven maxine i could not help break out it be a awful thing to do i know -- i know but i have to have the money -- for raoul and there be no other way to get it you remember i would refuse till the diamond be lose and would have refuse even if raoul have nothing to do with the french foreign office but let I go on tell you what happen i have time enough i have even a minute or two to spare and fortunately for I the man i would send raoul to find be out i look at my watch pretend to be surprised and say i must go at once i could not bear to waste a second in hurry the treaty off so that it might the more quickly be on its way back i have not come to visit raoul in my own carriage but in a cab which be wait as raoul be take I to it count godensky get out of a motor-brougham and see I if only it have be anywhere except in front of the foreign office i tell myself there be no reason why he should guess that anything be wrong but i be in such a state of nerve that as he raise he hat and he eyebrow i fancy that he imagine all sort of thing and i feel myself grow red and pale what a fool i be -- and how weak but i could not help it i do not wait to go home i write a few line in the cab and send off the packet register in time i hope to catch the post -- but after all it do not come out from the post office there be godensky again in he motor-brougham _ that _ could have be no coincidence a horrid certainty spring to life in I that he would follow my cab from the foreign office to see where i would go why could not i have think of that danger i have always think of thing and guard against they yet this time this time of all other i seem fate but if godensky have know what you be do the game would have be up for you before this i say he do not know of course only -- if he want to be a woman 's lover and she will not have he he be she enemy and he be the enemy of the man who _ be _ she lover he be too clever and too careful of he own interest to speak out prematurely anything he might vaguely suspect for it would do he harm if he prove mistaken he would not yet i think even warn those whom it might concern to search and see if anything in raoul 's charge be out of order or miss but what he would do what i think he have do be this have some idea as he may have that my relation with certain important person in england be rather friendly and see I come from the foreign office to go almost straight to the post it might have occur to he to try and learn the name of my correspondent he have influence -- he could perhaps have find out : but if he do it would not have help he much for naturally my dealings with the british foreign secretary be always well under cover -- hence a delay sometimes in he receive word from I what i send can never go straight to he as you may guess godensky would guess that too : and he would have perhaps inform the police very cautiously very unofficially and confidentially that he suspect maxine de renzie of be a political spy in the pay of england he would have advise that my movement be watch for the next few day : that english agent of the french police be warn to watch also on they side of the channel he would have argue to himself that if i would send any document away with raoul 's connivance or without i would be want it back as soon as possible and he would have mention to the police that possibly a messenger would bring I something -- if my correspondence through the post be find to contain nothing compromise oh there have be eye on I and on every movement of mine i be sure see how efficient though quiet the method have be where you be concern they -- the police -- know the name of the man i be to meet here at this hotel and if as godensky must have hope any document belong to the french government have be find on you or I everything would have play into he hand raoul would have be ruin he heart break and i -- but there be no word to express what i would have suffer what i may yet have to suffer godensky would be praise for he cleverness as well as secure a satisfactory revenge on I for refuse he the only thing which rejoice I now be the thought of he blank disappointment when he get the news from the commissary of police you do not believe then i ask that godensky have have any hand in the disappearance of the treaty i would believe it if it be not for the necklace be put in its place even if count godensky could have know of raoul 's mission with the diamond and get they into he own hand he would not have let they get out again with every chance of they go back to raoul and thus save he from he trouble he would do nothing to help but everything to hinder there lie the mystery -- in the return of the necklace instead of the treaty you have no knowledge of it you tell I yet you come to I with it in you pocket -- the necklace steal from raoul du laurier day ago in amsterdam or on the way there you be certain it be the same certain as that you be you and i be i and i be not out of my mind yet -- though i soon shall be unless you somehow save I from this horror i be go to try i say do not give up hope i wish though that you have not to act to-night so do i but there be no way out of it and i must go now to the theater or i shall be late : my make-up 's a heavy one and take a long time i can not afford to have any talk about I and my affair to-night whatever come afterwards raoul will be in a box and at the end of the first act he 'll be at the door of my dressing-room the agony of see he of hear he praise my act and say dear trust loving word that would make I almost too happy if i have not betray he ruin he career for ever maybe not i say and anyhow there be the necklace that be something yes that be something will godensky be in the audience too i ask i be sure he will he could not keep away but he may be late he will not come until he be have a long talk with the commissary of police and try to thrash matter out if only you theory 's right then -- if he have not dare yet to throw suspicion on du laurier and if the loss of that letter-case with its contents be as much of a mystery to he as it be to we we have a little time before we still : we be comparatively safe for a few hour we be as safe answer maxine with a kind of desperate calmness as if we be in a house with gunpowder store underneath and a train lay to fire it but -- she break off bitterly why do i say ' _ we _ ' to you all this can be no more than a regret a worry you know that be not just i reproach she i be in this with you now heart and soul i speak no more than the truth when i say i would give my life if necessary to redeem my failure already i have give something but -- what have you give she catch I up quickly my hope of happiness with a girl i love as you love du laurier i answer then regret my word and would have take they back if i could for she have a heavy enough burden to bear already without help I bear mine i do not understand she say do not think of it you can do nothing and i do not grudge the sacrifice -- or anything i hurry on yet i will think of it if i ever have time to think of anything beyond this tangle but now it must be _ au revoir _ save I save raoul if you can ivor what you can do i do not know i be grope in darkness yet you be my one hope for pity 's sake come to my house when the play 's over to tell I what you have do if you have be able to do anything be there at twelve i promise thank you i shall live for that moment now give I the diamond and i 'll go i do not want you to be see with I outside this room i give she the necklace and she be at the door before i could open it chapter vii ivor be late for a appointment i be glad to be alone for as i have say i want to think quietly maxine have take the diamond but she have slip the necklace into the bosom of she dress press it down through the rather low-cut opening at the throat and have therefore leave the leather case i pick the thing up from the table where she have throw it and examine it carefully for the first time it have not be originally intend as a jewel-case that be clear and as maxine 's voice have ring unmistakably true when she deny all previous knowledge of it to the police i judge that the diamond have not be in it when the duchess entrust they to du laurier he would almost certainly have describe to maxine the box or case which have be steal from he and if the thing pull out from the sofa-hiding-place have recall he description she must have betray some emotion under the keen eye of the commissary of police the case which it seem i have bring to pari look as if it might have be make to hold a peculiar kind of cigar much longer than the ordinary sort within on either side be a partition and there be a silver clasp on which the hallmark be english english silver i say to myself thoughtfully the three man who have travel in the carriage with I from london to dover be all english of the trio only the nervous little fellow who have reserve the compartment for himself have find the smallest possible opportunity to steal the treaty from I and exchange for it this red leather case contain a diamond necklace worth twenty thousand pound if he possess the skill and quick deftness of a conjurer or a marvellously clever professional pickpocket as well as the incentive of a pay spy he might conceivably have do the trick at the moment of alarm on the boat 's gangway not afterwards for when he have press near I in the gare du nord he have be on the wrong side but for my life i could not guess the motive for such a exchange suppose he a spy employ to track and rob I of what i carry why should he have make I a present of these rare and precious diamond would the bribe for which he use he skill reach anything like the sum he could obtain by sell the stone i be almost sure it would not and therefore have the diamond it would have be far more to he advantage to keep they than to stuff they into my pocket simply to fill up the space where the case with the treaty have lie there would not have be time yet for the real diamond to have be copy in amsterdam therefore it would be useless to build up a theory that the stone give I might be false besides i remind myself if the man be a spy whose business be to watch and be near I why have not he wait to see what i would do where i would go instead of take a compartment carefully reserve it and trust to such a unlikely chance as that i might force myself into it with he even if the three man have be in some obscure way play into each other ' hand i could not see how they game have be arrange to catch I maxine and i have talk for a long time but not two hour have pass yet since i see the last of the little rat of a man in the railway-station though i could not understand any reason for he trick I still i tell myself that nobody else could have do it and i decide to go back at once to the gare du nord there i might still be able to find some trace of the little man and of my two other fellow-traveller if through a porter or cabman i could learn where they have go i might have a chance even now of get back the steal treaty i have bring with I from london a loaded revolver warn by the foreign secretary that to do so would be a wise precaution and i be ready to make use of it if necessary i be begin to be very hungry but that be a detail of no importance for i have no time to waste in eat i go to the railway-station and look about until i find a porter whose face i have see when i get out of the train he have in fact appear under the window of my compartment offer himself as a luggage carrier and have be close behind I when my late travel companion walk by my side question he appear not to remember but he wit be sharpen by the gift of a franc he reflect and recall not only my feature but the feature of the little man whom he describe with sufficient accuracy what have become of _ le petit monsieur _ he be not certain but fancy he have eventually drive away in a cab accompany by two other gentleman he recollect this circumstance because the face of the cabman be one that he know and it be now again in the station for the _ voiture _ have return would he point out the _ cocher _ to I he would and do receive a second franc for he pain the cab driver prove to be a dull and surly fellow like many another _ cocher _ of pari but the clink of silver and the sight of it mellow he i begin by say that i be in search of three friend of mine whom i be to have meet when the boat train come in but whom i have unfortunately miss i ask he to describe the man he have drive away from the station at that time and though he do it clumsily betray a irritating lack of observation when it come to detail still such information as i could draw from he sound encourage he remember perfectly well the place at which he have deposit he three passenger and i decide to take the risk of follow they when i say risk i mean the risk that the man i be start to chase might turn out not to be the man i wish to follow besides as they have be drive to neuilly the distance be so great that if i go there in a cab and find at last that i have make a mistake i should have waste a great deal of valuable time on the wrong tack if the driver have remember the name of the street and the number of the house at which he have pause i would have hire a motor and flash out to the place in a few minute but despite a suggest bribe he could say no more than that when he have come to a certain place one of he passenger have call turn down the next street to the leave he have do so and in front of a house almost midway along that street he have be bid to stop he have not bother to look at the name of the street but though he be not very familiar with that neighborhood various landmark would guide he to the right place when he come to pass they again have hear all he have to say i reluctantly make up my mind that i could do no better than take the man as my conductor and accordingly with a horse already tire i drive to neuilly there the landmark be not deceive as i be half afraid they would be and in a quiet street of the suburb we stop at last before a fair-sized house with light in many window evidently it be a _ pension _ of the man-servant who answer my ring i enquired if three english gentleman have lately arrive he reply that they have and be dine would monsieur give himself the pain of wait a few minute until dinner should be over my answer be to slip a five franc piece into the servant 's hand and suggest that i should be show at once into the dining-room without wait my idea be to catch my bird while they feed and take they by surprise lest they fly away if i pounced upon they in the midst of a meal at least they could not escape before be recognize by I : and as to what should come after recognition the moment of meeting must decide the five franc piece work like a charm i be promptly usher into the dining-room and standing just inside the door i sweep the long table with a quick eager glance about eighteen or twenty people be dine but though several be unmistakably english i see no one who resemble my travel companion everyone turn and stare there be no face of which i have not a good view in a low voice i ask the servant which be the new arrival of whom he have speak he point they out and add that though they have come only that day from england they be old patron well know in the house as i linger deeply disappointed the elderly proprietor of the _ pension _ who superintend the comfort of he guest trot fussily up to enquire the stranger 's business in he dining-room i explain that i have hope to find friend and be so polite that i contrived to get permission for my cabman to have a peep through the crack of the door when he have identify he three passenger all hope be over i have follow the wrong man there be nothing to do but go back to the gare du nord and question more porter and cabman nobody could give I any information worth have it seem yet the little man must have leave the station in a vehicle of some sort as he have a great deal of small luggage since i could learn nothing of he or he movement however and dare not because of maxine and the british foreign secretary apply to the police for help i determine to lose no more time before consult a private detective a man whose action i could control and to whom i need tell only as much of the truth as i choose without fear of have the rest drag out of I at my own hotel i enquired of the manager where i could find a good private detective get a address and motor to it the speed brace my nerve fortunately -lrb- as i think then -rrb- monsieur anatole girard be at home and able to receive I i be show into the plain but very neat little sitting-room of a flat on the fifth floor of a big new apartment house and be impress at first glance by the clever face of the dark thin frenchman who politely bid I welcome it be cunning as well as clever no doubt : but then i tell myself it be the business of a person in monsieur girard 's profession to be cunning i introduce myself as mr sanford the name i have be tell to give at the élysée palace hotel this seem best as it be in the hotel that i have be recommend to monsieur girard and complication might arise if george sandford suddenly turn into ivor dunda besides as there be a good many thing which i do not want bring to light sandford seem the man to fit the situation later he could easily disappear and leave no trace i say that i have be rob of a thing which be of immense value to I but as it be the gift of a lady whose name must not on any account appear in the case i do not wish to consult the police all i ask of monsieur girard 's well-known ability be the discovery of the suppose thief whom i thereupon describe i add the fact that we have travel together mention the incident at the gangway and explain that i have not suspect my loss until i arrive at the élysée palace hotel girard listen quietly evidently realize that i talk to he from behind a screen of reserve yet not seek to force I to put aside that screen he ask several intelligent question very much to the point and i answer they -- as seem best when he touch on point which i consider too delicate to be handle by a stranger even a detective in my employ i frankly reply that they have nothing to do with the case in hand shrug he shoulder almost imperceptibly yet expressively he take my refusal without comment and merely bow when i say that if the scoundrel could be unearth within twenty-four hour i would pay a hundred pound : if within twelve a hundred and fifty : if within six two hundred i add that there be not a second to waste as the fellow might slip out of pari at any minute but whatever happen monsieur girard be to keep the matter quiet the detective promise to do he best -lrb- which be say to be very good -rrb- hold out hope of success and assure I of he discretion on the whole i be please with he he look like a man who thoroughly know he business and have it not be for the solemn warning of the foreign secretary and the risk for maxine i would gladly have put more efficient weapon in girard 's hand by tell he everything by the time that the detective have be prime with such fact and detail as i could give it be past ten o'clock i could see my way to do nothing more for the moment and as i be half famished i whiz back in my hire automobile to the élysée palace hotel there i have food serve in my own sitting-room lest george sandford should chance inconveniently upon some acquaintance of ivor dunda in the restaurant i do not hurry over the meal for all i want now be to arrive at maxine de renzie 's house at twelve o'clock and tell she my news -- or lack of news she would be there wait for I i be sure no matter how prompt i might be for though in ordinary circumstance after the first performance of a new play either maxine would have go out to supper or invite guest to sup with she she would have accept no invitation give none for to-night she would hurry out of the theater probably without wait to remove she stage make-up and she would go home unaccompanied except by she maid maxine live in a charming little old-fashioned house set back in its own garden a great find in a good quarter of pari and she house could he reach in ten minute ' drive from my hotel i would not go as far as the gate but would dismiss my cab at the corner of the quiet street as it would not he wise to advertise the fact that mademoiselle de renzie be receive a visit from a young man at midnight fifteen minute would give I plenty of time for all this : therefore at about a quarter to twelve i start to go downstairs and in the entrance hall almost run against the last person on earth i expect to see -- diana forrest she be not alone of course but for a second or two i see no one else there be none other except she precious and beautiful face in the world and for a wild instant i ask myself if she have come here to see I to take back all she cruel word of misunderstanding and to take I hack also but it be only for a instant -- a very mad instant then i realize that she could not have know i be to be at the élysée palace hotel and that even if she have she would not have dream of come to I as common sense sweep my brain clear i see near the precious and beautiful face other face : lady mountstuart 's lord mountstuart 's lisa drummond 's and bob west 's they be all in evening dress the lady in charming wrap which appear to consist mostly of lace and chiffon and evidently they have just come into the hotel from some place of amusement the beautiful face which have be pale grow rosy at sight of I though whether with amazement or anger or both i could not tell lisa smile look more impish even than usual but it be plain that the other lord mountstuart among they be surprise to see I here goodness be it you or you ghost exclaim lady mountstuart in the soft accent of californium which have never change in spite of the long year of she married life in england if it have be my ghost it would have vanish immediately to save di from embarrassment and also to prevent any delay in get to maxine 's but unfortunately a flesh and blood young man must stop for conventional politeness before he can disappear no matter what press i say how do you do to everyone add that i be as surprised to see they as they could be to see I i even grin civilly at lord robert west though find he here with di look particularly pleased with himself make I want to knock he down oh it be a plan as far as mounty and lord robert and i be concerned explain lady mountstuart of course lord robert ought to have be at the duchess 's bazaar this afternoon but then he will not show up at such thing even to please he sister and di and lisa be to have represent I there to-day and to-morrow be the only day all three of we could possibly steal to get away and look at a most wonderful motor car make for a rajah who die before it be ready lord robert certainly know more about automobile than any other human being do and he think this be just what i would want di have the most horrid headache this morning poor child and be not fit for the fatigue of a big crush so as she be a splendid sailor i persuade she to come with we -- and lisa too of course we catch the afternoon train to boulogne and have such a glorious cross that we actually all have the courage to dress and dine at madrid -- be not it plucky of we but we be collapse now and have come back early as we must inspect the car the first thing to-morrow morning and do a heap of shopping afterwards if you be collapse i must not keep you stand here a moment i say anxious for more than one reason to get away di be not look at I half turn from I purposely i do not doubt she have begin a conversation with bob west who beam with joy over she kindness to he and she apparent indifference to I ` collapse ' be a exaggeration perhaps laugh lady mountstuart but instead of keep we stand here come up to we sitting-room and have a little talk -- and whisky and soda yes do come dunda she husband add thank you both i stammer try not to look embarrassed but -- i know you be all tired and -- and perhaps you have some nice engagement pipe lisa it be too late for respectable british young man to have engagement in naughty pari say lady mountstuart laughing again -lrb- she look very handsome when she laugh and know it -rrb- be not that true mr dunda it depend upon the engagement i manage to reply calmly but then as di suddenly turn and look straight at I with marked coldness the blood spring up to my face i begin to stammer again like a young ass of a schoolboy i be afraid that i -- er -- the fact be i _ be _ engage a matter of business i wish i could get out of it but i can not and -- er -- i shall have to run off or i will be late good-bye -- good-bye then i mumble something about hope to see they again before they leave paris and escape know that i have make a horrid mess of my excuse di be laugh at something west say as i turn away and though perhaps he remark and she laugh have nothing to do with I my ear burn and there be a cold lump of iron or something that feel like it where my heart ought to have be now be lord robert 's time to propose -- now when she believe I faithless and unworthy -- if he but know it and i be afraid that he would know it i get out into the open air feeling half-dazed as one of the under porter call I a cab i give the name of a street in the direction but at some distance from maxine 's lest ear should hear which ought not to hear : and it be only when we be well away from the hotel that i amend my first instruction even then i mention the street lead into the one where i be due not the street itself _ depêchez vous _ i add for i have delay eight or ten minute longer than i ought and this have upset the exactness of my calculation the man obey nevertheless instead of reach the top of maxine 's street at two or three minute before twelve as i have intend it be nearly ten minute past when i get out of my cab at the corner : and when i come to the gate of the house a clock somewhere be strike the quarter hour after midnight maxine de renzie 's part chapter viii maxine act on the stage and off how i get through the play on that awful night i do not know when i go onto the stage to take up my cue soon after the beginning of the first act my brain be a blank i could not remember a single line that i have to say i could not even see through the dazzling mist which float before my eye to recognize raoul in the box where i know he would be sit unless -- something have happen but presently i be conscious of one pair of hand clap more than all the rest yes raoul be there i feel he love reach out to I and warm my chill heart like a ray of sunshine that find its way through shadow i must not fail for he sake i must not fail i never have fail and i would not now -- above all not now it be the thought of raoul that give I back my courage and though i could not have say one word of my part before i come on the stage to answer that first cue by the time the applause have die down enough to let I speak each line seem to spring into my mind as it be need then i get out of myself and into the part as i always do but have fear not to do to-night the audience be mine to play with as i like to make laugh to make cry and clap its hand or shout brava-brava yet for once i fear it fear that great crowd of people out there as a lion tamer must at some time or other fear one of he lion what if they know all i have do the question flash across my brain what if a voice in the auditorium should suddenly shout that maxine de renzie have betray france for money english money how these hand which applaud would tingle to seize I by the throat and choke my life out still with these thought murmur in my head like a kind of dreadful undertone i go on a actress can always go on -- till she break i think that she can not be bent as other woman can : and i envy the woman who have not have to learn the lesson of harden themselves it seem to I that they must suffer less at last come the end of the first act but there be five curtain call five time i have to go back and smile and bow and look delighted with the ovation i be have then when the time come that i could escape i meet on the way to my dressing-room man carry big harp and crown basket and bunch of flower which have be send up to I on the stage i push past hardly glance at they for i know that raoul would be wait there he be radiant with he unselfish pride in I -- my big handsome lover look more like the apollo belvedere come alive and dress in modern clothes than like a ordinary diplomatic young man from the foreign office but then of course he be really quite out of place in diplomacy since he can not exist on a marble pedestal or some old master 's canvas he ought at least to be a poet or a artist -- and so he be at heart not one but both and a dreamer of beautiful dream as beautiful and noble as he own clear-cut face which might be cold if it be not for the eye and lip there be people about and we speak like mere acquaintance until i would lead raoul into the little boudoir which adjoin my dressing-room then -- well we speak no longer like mere acquaintance that be enough to say and we have five minute together before i be oblige to send he away and go to dress for the second act the touch of raoul 's hand and those lip of he that be not cold give I strength to go through all that be yet to come there be something almost magical in the touch -- just a little little touch -- of the one we love best for a moment we can forget everything else even if it be death itself wait just round the corner i have flirt with more than one man sometimes because i like he and it amuse I -- as with ivor dunda -- sometimes because i have to win he for politic reason but i never know that bless feeling until i meet raoul du laurier it be a heavenly rest now to lay my head for a minute on he shoulder just shut my eye without speak a word i think -- for i be wear out body and soul with the strain of keep up and hide my secret -- that when i be dead the best paradise would be to lean so on raoul 's shoulder never move for the first two or three hundred year of eternity but as the peaceful fancy cool my brain back dart remembrance like a poisonous snake i remind myself how little i deserve such a paradise and how my lover 's dear arm would put I away in a kind of unbelieving horror if he know what i have do and how i have betray he trust in I for ten year i would be a political spy -- yes but i owe a grudge to russium which i would promise my father to pay : and france be russium 's ally besides it seem less vile to betray a country than to deceive a man you adore who adore you in return we woman be true as truth itself to those we love for they we would sacrifice the greatest cause always i have know this and i have think that i could prove myself truer than the truest if i ever love yet now i have betray my lover and sell he country and realize what i have do as i hardly have realize it till this moment i suffer torture in he arm even if by something like a miracle we be save from ruin nothing on earth could wash the stain from my heart which raoul believe so good so pure what can be more terrible for a woman than the secret knowledge that to hold a man 's respect she must always keep one dark spot cover from he eye such a woman need no future punishment she have all she deserve in this world my punishment have begin and it would always go on through my life with raoul i know even if no great disaster come into the heart of my happiness would come the thought of that hidden spot how often oh how often would i feel that think stir like a black bat i could no longer rest with my eye shut at peace after the storm i shudder and sob though my lid be dry and raoul try to soothe I think it be but my excitement in play for the first time a heavy and exacting part he little guess how heavy and exact it really be darling he say you be wonderful and how proud i be of you -- how proud i be i think it would be impossible to worship you more than i do but i love you a thousand time more than ever to-night it be true i know i could see it in he eye hear it in he voice since he dreadful misfortune in lose the diamond since i have comfort he for they loss and insist on give he all i have to help he out of he trouble he have see in I the angel of he salvation to-night he heart be almost break with love for I who so ill deserve it now i have news for he which would make he long to shout for joy if i choose i could tell he that the jewel be safe he would love I still more passionately in he happiness which i have give than in he grief and i would take all he love as if it be my right hide the secret of my treachery as long as i could but how long would that be how could i be sure that the theft of the treaty have not already be discover and that the avalanche of ruin be not on its way to blot we for ever out of life and love the fear make I nestle nearer to he and cling tightly because i say to myself that perhaps i might never be in he arm again : that this might be the last time that he eye -- those eye that be not cold -- might look at I with love in they as now suppose all these people out there have hate and hiss I instead of applaud i ask would you still be proud of I still care for I i would love you better if there could be a ` better ' he answer hold I very close you know dearest one most beautiful one that i be a jealous brute i can not bear you to belong to other -- even to the public that appreciate you almost as much as you deserve to be appreciate of course i be proud that they adore you but i would like to take you away from they and adore you all by myself why if the whole world turn against you there would be a kind of joy in that for I i would be so glad of the chance to face it for you to shield you from it always then what _ be _ there would make you love I less i go on dwelling on the subject with a dreadful fascination as one look over the brink of a precipice nothing on god 's earth -- while you keep true to I and if i be not true -- if i deceive you why i would kill you -- and myself after but it make I see red -- a blaze scarlet -- even to think of such a thing why should you speak of it -- when it be beyond possibility thank heaven i know you love I or you would not make such noble sacrifice to save I from ruin i shiver : and i shall not be colder when they lay I in my coffin i wish that i have not look over that precipice down into blackness why dwell on horror when i might have five minute of happiness -- perhaps the last i should ever know i remember the piece of good news i have for raoul i would have tell he then but he go on say to I so many thing sweet and bless to hear that i could not bear to cut he short lest never after this should he speak word of love to I then -- long before it ought so it seem -- the clock in mydressing-room strike and i know that i have not another instant to spare on some first night i might have be willing to risk keep the curtain down -lrb- though i be rather conscientious in such way -rrb- but to-night i want more than anything else to have the play over and to get home by midnight or before so that my suspense might be end and i might know the worst -- or best i must go you must leave I dear i say but i have some good news for you when there be time to explain and a great surprise i can not give you a minute until the last for you know i have almost to open the third and fourth act but when the curtain go down on my death scene come behind again i sha not take any call -- after die it be too inartistic be not it and i never do i 'll see you for just a few more minute here in this room before i dress to go home for a few minute raoul catch I up but afterwards you promise I long ago that i should have supper with you at you house -- just you and i alone together -- on the first night of the new play my heart give a jump as he remind I of this promise never before have i forget a engagement with raoul but this time i have forget there have be so many miserable thing to think of that they have crowd the one pleasant thing out of my tortured brain i draw away from he involuntarily with a start of surprise you would forget exclaimed raoul disappoint and hurt only for the instant i say because i be hardly myself i be tired and excited unstrung as i always be on first night but -- would you rather not be bother with I he ask wistfully as i pause to think what i should do he eye look as if the light have suddenly go out of they and i could not bear that it might too soon be strike out for ever and by I do not say ` bother ' i reproach he that be a cruel word the question be -- i be wear out i do not think i shall be able to eat supper my maid will want to put I to bed the minute i get home poor old marianne she be such a tyrant when she fancy it be for my good it generally end in my obey she -- seldom in she obey I but we 'll see how i feel when the last act 's over we 'll talk of it when you come here -- after my death i try to laugh as i make that wretched jest but i be sorry when i make it and my laugh do not ring true there be a shadow on raoul 's face -- that dear sensitive face of he which show too much feeling for a man in this work-a-day strenuous world -- but i have little time to comfort he it will be like come to life again to see you i say and now good-bye no not good-bye but _ au revoir _ i send he away and fly into my dressing-room next door where marianne be grow very nervous and aimlessly shift my make-up thing on the dress table or fuss with some part of my dress for the next act there be a letter for you mademoiselle say she the stage-door keeper just bring it round but you have not time to read it now a wave of faintness sweep over I suppose ivor have have bad news and think it best to warn I without delay i must read the letter i insist give it to I at once occasionally marianne -lrb- who have be with I for many year and be old enough to be my mother -rrb- argue a matter on which we disagree : but something in my voice i suppose make she obey I with extraordinary promptness then come a shock -- and not of relief i recognize on the envelope the handwriting of count godensky i know that i be not a coward yet it be only by the strongest effort of will that i force myself to open that letter i be afraid -- afraid of a hundred thing but most of all i be afraid of learn that the treaty be in he hand it would be like he to tell I he have it and try to drive some dreadful bargain nerve myself as i suppose a condemn criminal must nerve himself to go to the guillotine or the gallows i open the letter for as long as i might have count one two slowly the paper look black before my eye as if ink be spill over it blot out the word : but the dark smudge clear away and show I -- nothing except that if alexi godensky hold a trump card i be not to have a sight of it until later when he choose my dear maxine -lrb- he begin he letter though he have never be give the right to call I maxine and never have dare so to call I before -rrb- i must see you and talk to you this evening alone this for you own sake and that of another even more than mine though you know very well what it be to I to be with you perhaps you may be able to guess that this be important i be so sure that you _ will _ guess and that you will not only be willing but anxious to see I to-night if you never be before that i shall venture to be wait for you at the stage door when you come out yours in whatever way you will alexi if anything could have give I pleasure at that moment it would have be to tear the letter in little piece with the writer look on then to throw those piece in he hateful face and say that be you answer but he be not look on and even if he have be i could not have do what i wish he know that i would have to consent to see he that he need have no fear i would profit by my knowledge of he intention to order he send away from the stage door i would have to see he but how could i manage it after refuse -- as i must refuse -- to let raoul go home with I raoul be come to I after my death scene on the stage at the very least he would expect to put I into my carriage when i leave the theater even if he go no further yet there would be godensky wait and raoul would see he what could i do to escape from such a _ impasse _ chapter ix maxine give back the diamond i try to answer the question to decide something but my brain feel dead i can not think now i must trust to luck -- trust to luck i say to myself desperately as marianne dress I by and by i 'll think it all out but after that my part give I no more time to think i be not maxine de renzie but princess hélène of hungarium whose tragic fate be even more sure and swift than miserable maxine 's when princess hélène have die in she lover 's arm however -lrb- die as maxine have not deserve to die -rrb- and i be able to pick up the tangled thread of my own life where i would lay they down the question be still cry out for answer and must somehow be decide at once first there be raoul to be put off and get out of the way -- raoul my best beloved whose help and protection i need so much yet must forego and hurt he instead the stage-door keeper have order to let he come behind and so he be already wait at the door of my little boudoir by the time hélène have die the curtain have go down and maxine de renzie have be able to leave the stage as we go together into the room he catch both my hand crush they tightly in he and kiss they over and over again but he face be pale and sad and a new fear spring up in my heart like a sudden live flame among red ash what be it raoul -- why do you look like that i ask while inside my head another question sound like a shriek what if some word have come to he in the theater -- about the treaty then i could have cry as a child cry with the snap of the tension when he answer : it be only that terrible last scene darling i have see you die in other part but it never affect I like this perhaps it be because you do not belong to I in those day or be it that you be more realistic in you act to-night than ever before anyway it be awful -- so horribly real it be all i could do to sit still and not jump out of the box to save you prince cyril be a poor chap not to thwart the villain i should have kill he in the third act and then hélène might have be happily marry instead of die i believe you would have kill he i say i know i should it be a mistake not to be jealous i admit that i be jealous but such jealousy be a compliment to a woman my dearest not a insult how you feel thing i exclaimed even a play on the stage -- if the woman i love be the heroine will you ever be blasé like the rest of the man i know i laugh though i could have sob never i think it be not in I do you despise I for my enthusiasm i only love you the more i say wonder every instant in a kind of horrid undertone how i be to get he away i admit i be not make for diplomacy he go on i wish i have money enough to get out of it and take you off the stage away into some beautiful peaceful world where we need think of nothing but we love for each other and the good we might do other because of we love and to keep we world beautiful would you go with I ah if i could i sigh if i could go with you to-morrow away into that beautiful peaceful world but-who know meanwhile -- meanwhile you do not mean to send I away from you he plead in a coax way he have which be part of he charm and make he seem like a boy you do not know what it be after that scene of you death on the stage where i could not get to you -- where another man be you lover -- to touch you again alive and warm you own adorable vivid self you _ will _ let I go home with you in you carriage anyhow as far as the house and kiss you good-night there even if you be so tired you must drive I out then i would have give all my success of that night and more to say yes but instead i have to stumble into excuse i have to argue that we must not be see leave the theater together -- yet until everyone know that we be engage as for let he come to I at home if he dream how my head ache he would not ask it i almost break down as i say this and poor raoul be so sorry for I that he immediately offer to leave I at once it be a great sacrifice though to give up what i have be look forward to for day he say and to let you go from I to-night of all night why to-night of all night i ask quickly my coward conscience frightening I again only because i love you more than ever and -- it be a stupid feeling of course i suppose all the fault of that last scene in the play -- yet i feel as if -- but no i do not want to say it you must say it i cry well if only to hear you contradict I then i feel as if i be in danger of lose you it be just a feeling -- a weight on my heart nothing more rather womanish be not it not womanish but foolish i say shake off the feeling as one wake up from a nightmare think of to-morrow meeting then will be all the sweeter as i speak it be as if a voice echo mine say different word mockingly if there be any meeting -- to-morrow or ever i shut my ear to the voice and go on quickly : before we say good-bye i have something to show you -- something you 'll like very much wait here till i get it from the next room marianne be tidy my dressing-room for the night bustling here and there a dear old comfortable dependable thing she be delighted with my success which she know all about of course but she be not in the least excited because she have loyally expect I to succeed and would have think the sky must be about to fall if i have fail she be as placid as she be on other less important night far more placid than she would have be if she have know that she be guard not only my jewellery but a famous diamond necklace worth at least five hundred thousand franc there it be under the lowest tray of my jewel box i have feel perfectly safe in leave it there for i know that nothing on earth -- short of a bomb explosion -- could tempt the good creature out of my dressing-room in my absence and that even if a bomb do explode she would try to be blow up with my jewel box clutch in she hand say nothing to marianne who be brushing a little stage dust off my third act dress with my back to she i take out tray after tray from the box -lrb- which always come with we to the theater and go away again in my carriage -rrb- until the electric light over the dress table set the diamond on fire really i say to myself they be wonderful stone i have no idea how magnificent they be not that there be a great many of they the necklace be compose of a single row of diamond with six flat tassel depend from it but the smallest stone at the back where the clasp come be as large as my little finger nail and the largest be almost the size of a filbert all be of perfect color and fire extraordinarily deep and faultlessly shape as well as flawless besides the necklace have a history which would have make it interesting even if it have not be intrinsically of half its value with the first thrill of pleasure i have feel since i know that the treaty have disappear i lift the beautiful diamond from the box and slip they into a small embroidered bag of pink and silver brocade which lay on the table it be a foolish but pretty little bag which a friend have make and send to I at the theater a few night ago and be intend to carry a purse and handkerchief but i have never use it yet now it seem a convenient receptacle for the necklace and i suddenly plan out my way of give it to raoul at first earlier in the evening i have mean to put the diamond in he hand and say see what i have for you but now i have change my mind because he must be induce to go away as quickly as possible -- quite quite away from the theater so that there would be no danger of he see count godensky at the stage door i be not sorry that raoul be jealous because as he say he jealousy be a compliment to I and it be possible only for a cold man never to be jealous of a woman in my profession who live in the eye of the world but i do not want he to be jealous of the russian and he would be horribly jealous if he think that he have the least cause if i show he the diamond now he would want to stop and talk he would ask I question which i would rather not answer until i would see ivor dunda again and know better what to say -- whether truth or fiction still i wish raoul to have the necklace to-night because it would mean all the difference to he between constant gnawing anxiety and the joy of deliverance let he have a happy night even though i be send he away even though i do not know what to-morrow might bring either for he or for I i tie the gold cord of the bag in two hard knot and go out with it to raoul in the next room this hold something precious i say smile at he and make a mystery you 'll value the something i know -- partly for itself partly because i -- because i have be at a lot of trouble to get it for you when you see it you 'll be more resign not to see I -- just for tonight but you be to write I a letter please and describe accurately every one of you sensation on open the bag also you may say in you letter a few kind thing about I if you like and i want it to come to I when i first wake up to-morrow morning so go now dearest and have the sensation and write about they i shall be think of you every minute asleep or awake why may not i look now ask raoul take the soft mass of pink and silver from I in the nice clumsy way a big man have of handle a woman 's thing because -- just _ because _ but perhaps you 'll guess why by and by i say then i hold up my face to be kiss and he bundle the small bag away in a inside pocket of he coat as carelessly as if it hold nothing but a handkerchief and a pair of glove be careful i could not help exclaim but i do not think he hear for he have I in he arm and be kiss I as if he know the fear in my heart -- the fear that it might be for the last time chapter x maxine drive with the enemy when raoul be go i make marianne hurry I out of the cloth-of-gold and filmy tissue in which the unfortunate princess hélène have die and into the black gown in which the almost equally unfortunate maxine have come to the theater i do not even stop to take off my make-up for though the play be a unusually short one and all the actor and actress have follow my example of prompt readiness for all four act it lack twenty minute of twelve when i be dress i have to see count godensky get rid of he somehow and still be in time to keep my appointment with ivor dunda for which i know he would strain every nerve not to be late my electric carriage would be at the stage door and my plan be to speak to godensky if he be wait if possible learn in a moment or two whether he have really find out the truth and then act accordingly but if i could avoid it i mean in any case to put off a long conversation until later i have draw my veil down before walk out of the theater yet godensky know I at once and come forward evidently he have be watch the door good-evening he say a hundred congratulation he put out he hand and i have to give he mine for my chauffeur and the stage-door keeper -lrb- to say nothing of marianne who follow I closely -rrb- and several stage-carpenter with other employés of the theater be within see and hear distance i want no gossip though that be exactly what might best please count godensky i get you note i answer in russian though he have speak in french what be it you want to see I about something that can not be tell in a moment he say something of great importance i be very tired i sigh can not it wait until to-morrow i try to draw he and to a certain extent i succeed you would not ask that question if you guess what -- i know he reply be it a bluff or do he know -- not merely suspect -- something i do not understand you i say quietly though my lip be dry shall i mention the word -- _ document _ he hint really i be sure you will not regret it if you let I drive home with you mademoiselle i can not do that i answer and i can not take you into my carriage here but i 'll stop for you and wait at the corner rue eugène beauharnais then you can go with I until i think it best for you to get out very well he agree but send you maid home in a cab i can not talk before she yes you can she know no language except french -- and a little english she always drive home with I this be true but if i have be talk to raoul i would perhaps have give the dear old woman she first experience of be send off by herself in that case she would not have mind for she like raoul admire he as a dream of a young man and already suspect what i have not yet tell she -- that we be engage but with count godensky force upon I as a companion i would not for any consideration have part with marianne three or four minute after start i be give instruction to my chauffeur where to stop and almost immediately afterwards godensky appear he get in and take the place at my left marianne silent but doubtless astonished face we on the little front seat now i exclaimed please begin quickly do not force I to be too abrupt he say i would spare you if i could you speak as if you grudge I every moment with you yet i be here because i love you oh please monsieur i break in you know i have tell you that be useless but everything be change since then perhaps now even you mind will be change that happen with woman sometimes i want to warn you of a great danger that threaten you maxine perhaps late as it be i could save you from it if you would let I save I from what i ask temporise you be very mysterious count godensky and i be mademoiselle de renzie except to my very intimate friend i be you friend always maybe you will even permit I to speak of myself as you ` intimate friend ' when i have do what i hope to do for you in -- in the matter of a certain document which have disappear i be quiver all over but i have not lose hope yet i think that some woman feeling as i do would have faint but it would have be better for I to die and be out of my trouble for ever than to let myself faint and show godensky that he have strike home be quiet be cool be brave now if never again i say to myself and my voice sound perfectly natural as i exclaimed : oh the ` document ' again the one you speak about when we first meet to-night you rouse my curiosity but i do not in the least know what you mean the loss of it be know he say ah it be a lose document as you will be lose maxine if you do not come to I for the help i be only too glad to give -- on condition let I tell you what they be would not it be more to the point if you tell I what the document be and how it concern I i parry he determine to bring he to bay be not _ you _ evade the point far more than i the document -- which you and i can both see as plainly before we eye at this instant as though it be in -- let we say you hand or -- du laurier 's if he be here -- that document be far too important even to name within hearing of other ear marianne 's but i tell you she can not understand a word of russian one can not be sure we can never tell in these day who may not be -- a spy there be a stab for I but i would not give he the satisfaction of show that it hurt he want to confuse I to put I off my guard but he should not they say one judge other by one 's self i laugh count godensky if you throw out such lurid hint about my poor fat marianne i shall begin to wonder if it be not _ you _ who be the spy since you trust you woman so implicitly then he go on i 'll tell you what you want to know the document i speak of be the one you take out of the foreign office the other day when you call on you -- friend monsieur le vicomte du laurier dear I i exclaimed you say you want to be my friend yet you seem to think i be a kleptomaniac i can not imagine what i should want with any dry old document out of the foreign office can you yes i can imagine say godensky drily pray tell I then also what document it be for joke apart this be rather a serious accusation if i make any accusation it be less against you than du laurier oh you make a accusation against he why do you make it to I as a warning or because you do not dare make it to anyone else dare i have not accuse he thus far because to do so would brand you name with he ah i say you be very considerate i do not pretend to be considerate -- except of myself i have wait and hold my hand until now because i want to see you before do a thing which would mean certain ruin for du laurier i love you as much as i ever do even more because in common with most man i value what i find hard to get to-night i ask you again to marry I give I a different answer from that you give I before and i 'll be silent about what i know what you know of the document you mention i ask my heart drum a echo of its beating in my ear yes but -- i think you say that its loss be already discover -lrb- oh i be keep myself well under control though a mistake now would surely cost I more than i dare count -rrb- for half a second he be take aback at a loss what answer to make half a second -- no more yet that hardly perceptible hesitation tell I what i have be play with he to find out discover by I he explain that be by I and one person over whom i have such a influence that he will use he knowledge or -- forget it accord to my advice there be no such person i say to myself but i do not say it aloud quickly i name over in my mind such man in the french foreign office as be in a position to discover the disappearance of any document under raoul du laurier 's charge there be several who might have do so some above raoul in authority some below but i be certain that not one of they be a intimate friend of count godensky 's if he have suspect anything the day he meet I come out of the foreign office he might of course have hint he suspicion to one of those man -lrb- though all along i would believe he too shrewd to risk the consequence the ridicule and humiliation of a mistake -rrb- : but if he have speak it would be beyond he power to prevent matter from take they own course independent of my decision and he action i believe now that what i have hope be true he be bluff he want I to flounder into some admission and to make he a promise in order to save the man i love i be only a woman he have argue no doubt -- a emotional woman already work up to a high pitch of nervous excitement perhaps he have expect to have easy work with I and i do not think that my silence after he last word discourage he he imagine I writhe at the alternative of give up raoul or see he ruin and he believe that he know I well enough to be sure what i would do in the end well he say at last quite gently my eye have be bent on my lap but i glance suddenly up at he and see he face in the light of the street lamp as we pass count godensky be not more mephistophelian in type than any other dark thin man with a hook nose keen eye heavy brow a prominent chin and a sharply wax military moustache train to point upward slightly at the end but to my fancy he look absolutely devilish at that moment still i be less afraid of he than i have be since the day i steal the treaty well i say slowly i think it be time that you leave I now that be you answer you can not mean it i do mean it just as much as i mean to refuse you the three other time that you do I the same honor you ask I to hear what you have to say to-night and i have hear it so there be no reason why i should not press the electric bell for my chauffeur to stop and -- do you know that you be pronounce du laurier 's doom to say nothing of you own no i do not know it then i have not make myself clear enough that be true you have not make yourself clear enough in what detail have i fail because -- in the detail of the document i have tell you i know nothing about it you have tell I you know everything yet -- so i do prove that by say what it be -- to satisfy my curiosity i have explain why i can not do that -- here then why should you stay here longer since that be the point to my mind you understand before you come into my carriage that i have no intention of let you go all the way home with I count godensky suddenly laugh and the laugh frighten I -- frighten I horribly just as i have begin to have confidence in myself and feel that i have get the best of the game chapter xi maxine open the gate for a man you be afraid that du laurier may find out he say but he know already know what that i expect to have the privilege of go to you house with you all that i have gain seem worthless those quiet sneering word of he almost crushed I on the load i have struggle to bear without fall they lay one feather too much my voice break you -- devil i cry at he you dare to tell raoul that opposite on she narrow little seat marianne stir uneasily till now we tone have be quiet and she could not understand one word we say she be the soul of discretion and a triumph of good training in she walk of life but she love I more than she love any other creature on earth and now she could see and hear that the man have drive I to the brink of hysteric she would have like to tear he face with she nail or choke he i think if i have give she the word i believe she would have try with all she strength -- which be not small -- and a very good will to kill he i be dimly conscious of what she restlessness mean and vaguely comfort too by the thought of she supreme loyalty but i forget marianne when godensky answer my question yes i tell he it be the truth and i have always understand that you make a great point of never do anything which you consider in the least risqué so why should i suppose you would rather du laurier do not know you might already have mention it to he he would not believe you i exclaimed desperately and my only hope be that i might be right as a matter of fact he do not seem to at first so i at once understand that you have not speak of we appointment but it be too late to atone for my carelessness and i do the next best thing : justified my veracity i suggest that if he do not take my word for it he might stand where he could see we speak together at the stage door and -- ah i be glad of that i cut in then he see that we do not drive away together you jump at conclusion just like less clever woman i hardly think you would receive I into you carriage at the theater so i take the precaution of warn du laurier that he need not expect to see that you would suggest a place for I to meet you i say when i know it i would inform he if he choose to wait about somewhere for a few minute raoul du laurier would scorn to spy upon I i break out how hard you be on spy and how little knowledge of human nature you have after all if you do not understand that a man suddenly out of he head with jealousy will do thing of which he would be incapable when he be sane the argument silence I i know -- i have know for a long time -- that jealousy could rouse a demon in raoul and only to-night he have remind I that he be a jealous brute i remember what answer he have make when i ask he what he would do if i deceive he he say that he would kill I and kill himself after as he speak the blood have stream up to he forehead and stream back again leave he pale a flash like steel have shoot out of he eye -- the dear eye that be not cold it be true as this cruel wretch remind I raoul would do thing under the torture of jealousy that he would cut off he hand sooner than do when he own sweet poet-nature be in ascendancy as a proof of what i say godensky go on du laurier do wait do hear from I the place where you be to stop and pick I up and if it would not be the worst of form to bet i would bet that he find some way of get there in time to see that i have tell the truth you coward i stammer on the contrary a brave man i have hear that du laurier be a fine shot and that very few man in pari can touch he with the foil so you see -- you want to frighten I i exclaimed you misjudge I in every way my only answer be to tell marianne to press the button which give the signal for my chauffeur to stop instantly the electric carriage slow down then come to a standstill my man open the door and count godensky submit to my will nevertheless he be far from be in a submissive mood as i do not need to be remind by the tone of he voice when he say au revoir nothing could have be more polite than the word or he way of speak they as he stand in the street with he hat in he hand but to I they mean a threat and as a threat they be intend my talk with godensky at the stage door my pause to pick he up and my second pause to set he down have all take time of which i have have little enough at the start if i be to meet ivor dundas when he arrive it be two or three minute after midnight or so my watch say when we draw up before the gate of my high-walled garden in the quiet rue d'hollande a little while ago i have be ready to seize upon almost any expedient for keep raoul away from my house to-night but now after what i have just hear from godensky i pray to see he wait for I nobody -lrb- except ivor concern whom i would give order -rrb- would be let in so late at night during my absence not even raoul himself so if he have come to reproach I or break with I he would have to stand outside the lock gate till i appear i look for he longingly but he be not there there be to be sure a motor brougham in the street for a wonder -lrb- usually the rue d'hollande be as empty as a desert after eleven o'clock -rrb- but a girl 's face peer out at I from the window -- a impish curiously abnormal little face it be -- extinguish the spark of hope that spring to life as i catch sight of the carriage it be stand before the closed gate of a house almost opposite mine and the girl seem somewhat interested in I but i be not at all interested in she and i hate be stare at as if i be something in a museum the gate be always keep lock at night when i be at the theater but marianne have the key and we let ourselves in when we come for only old henrus sit up and he be grow a little deaf a moment and we be inside the chauffeur spin away to the garage usually i be newly delighted every night with my quaint old house and its small but pretty garden to which it seem delightful to come home after hour of hard work at the theater but to-night though a cheerful light shone out from between the draw curtain of the salon the place look inexpressibly dreary even forbid to I i feel that i hate the house though i have choose it after a long search for peacefulness and privacy how gloomy how dead be the street beyond the high wall with all its window close like the eye of corpse there be a moist depress smell of earth after long-continued rain in the garden no wonder the place have be to let at a bargain for a long term there have be a murder in it once and it have stand empty for twelve or thirteen of the fifteen year since the almost forget tragedy i have be the tenant for two year now -- before i become a star with a theater of my own in paris i have have no fear of the ghost say to haunt the house indeed i remembered thinking and say that the story only make the place more interesting but now i say to myself that i wish i have never speak so lightly perhaps the ghost have bring I bad luck i feel as if the murder must have happen on just such a still brooding damp night as this maybe it be the anniversary if i only know i go indoors marianne follow henrus very thin very precise wither like a winter apple have fall into a doze in the hall where he have sit hope to hear the stop of my carriage he rise up bow and blinking just as he have do often before and would often again -- if life be to go on for I in the old way he regret not have hear mademoiselle would mademoiselle take supper no mademoiselle would not take supper she want nothing and henrus might go to bed i thank mademoiselle when i have close the house but i do not want the house close i say i shall sit up for awhile it be hot -- close and stuffy i may like to have the window open the visitor mademoiselle expect do not arrive perhaps -- if he come marianne or i will let he in but he may not come now it be so late when henrus have go i tell marianne that she might go too i do not want she to wait if the person i have expect should call it be a very old friend in fact mr ivor dunda whom marianne must remember in london he be to call -- if he do call -- only on a matter of business which would take but a few minute to get through and possibly he would not even come into the house if the gate-bell ring i would answer it myself and speak with mr dunda perhaps in the garden then i would let he out and come straight upstairs marianne might go to bed if she wish i do not wish unless mademoiselle particularly desire I to do so say she i do not rest well when i have not be allow to undress mademoiselle sit up then in you own room and wait there for I till i ring for you i reply i sha not be late whether mr dunda come or do not come suppose the gate-bell should ring and mademoiselle should go yet it should not be the monsieur she expect but another person whom she would not care to admit i know of what she be think and of whom there be no fear of that no fear of any kind i answer she take off my cloak and go upstairs reluctantly carry my jewel box i walk into the drawing-room which be light and look very bright and charming with its many flower and frame photograph and the delightful loui quinze furniture which i have so enjoy pick up here and there at antique shop or at private sale i flung myself on the sofa but i could not rest in a moment i be up again move about look at the clock compare it with my watch wonder what could have happen to make ivor fail in keep he promise to be prompt on the hour of twelve of course a hundred harmless thing might have keep he but i think only of the worst and be work myself up to a frenzy when at last i hear the gate-bell i have be in the house no more than twelve or fourteen minute but it seem a hour and i give a sob of relief as i rush out down the garden path to let my visitor in fumble a little at the lock always a little difficult if one be in a hurry i ask myself what if as marianne have suggest it be not ivor dunda but someone else -- raoul perhaps -- or the man who have be in she mind : godensky but it be ivor what news i question he my voice sound queer and far away in my own ear i do not know whether you 'll call it news or not though plenty of thing have happen i be awfully sorry to be late -- i would not let he finish stand there but take he by the arm and draw he into the garden push the gate shut behind he as i do so yet i forget to lock it and naturally it do not occur to ivor that it ought to be fasten once inside in the garden i be go to make he begin again as i have tell marianne i would but suddenly i bethought myself that he might have be follow that there might be watcher behind that high wall watcher who would try to be listener too and whose ear would be very different from old henrus 's come into the house i say in a low voice before you begin to tell anything then when we be inside i could not even wait for he to go on of he own accord and in he own way the treaty i ask have you get hold of it unfortunately no but you have hear of it oh _ say _ you have hear something if i have not it be not because i have sit down and wait for news to come i go back to the gare du nord after you leave I to try and get on the track of the man who travel with I in the train to dover but i be send off on the wrong scent and waste a lot of time worse luck -- i 'll tell you about it later if you care to hear detail then when that game be up i do what i wish i would do at first find out and consult a private detective say to be one of the best in paris -- you tell you story -- _ my _ story -- to a detective i gasp no certainly not i say i would lose something of value give I by a lady whose name i could not bring into the affair i be george sandford too not mr dunda i describe my travel companion tell all that happen on the way and offer big pay if he could find they quickly -- especially the little fellow he hold out hope of spot they to-night so do not be desperate my poor girl the detective chap seem really to think he would not have much difficulty in track down we man and even if he be part with the treaty we can find out what he be do with it no doubt girard say -- girard i catch ivor up be you detective 's name anatole girard and do he live in rue du capucin blanc yes do you know he i know too much of he i answer bitterly be not he clever after all far too clever i would rather you have go to any other detective in paris -- or to none why what be wrong with he ivor begin to be distressed only that he be a personal friend of my worst enemy -- the man i speak of to you this evening -- count godensky i have hear so from godensky himself who mention the acquaintance once when girard have just succeed in a case everybody be talk about by jove what a beastly coincidence exclaim ivor horribly disappoint at have do exactly the wrong thing when he have try so hard to do the right one yet how could i have dream of it you could not i admit hopelessly nothing be you fault all that be happen would have happen just the same no matter what messenger the foreign secretary have send to I it be fate and it be my punishment still even if godensky and girard be friend ivor try to console I it be not likely that the count have talk to the detective about you and the affair of the treaty he may have go to he for help in find out thing he could not find out himself hardly i should say until there would be time for he to fear failure no the chance be that girard will have no inner knowledge of the matter i have put into he hand and if he be a man of honor he be bind to do the best he can for I as he employer have you see du laurier yes at the theater nothing bad have happen to he yet but that brute godensky have make dreadful mischief between we if only i would know that you would be so late i might have explain everything to he i be very sorry say ivor so humbly and so sadly that i pity he -lrb- but not half as much as i pitied myself even though i have not forget that hint he have let drop about a great sacrifice -- a girl he love whom he have throw over somehow to come to I -rrb- i make every effort to be in time it seem a piece with the rest of my horrible luck to-day that i be prevent i hope at least that du laurier know about the necklace he do by this i answer yet i be afraid he will not be in a mood to take much comfort from it -- thanks to that wretch you know raoul have not a practical bone in he body he will think i have deceive he and nothing else will matter i must -- but i break off and lay my hand on ivor 's arm what be that i whisper do you hear anything then ivor shake he head and we both listen it be a step outside on the gravel path say i my heart begin to knock against my side i forget to lock the gate somebody have come into the garden what if it should be raoul -- what if he have see we shadow on the curtain mechanically we move apart ivor make a gesture to reassure I on account of the position of the light he be right we shadow could not have fall on the curtain as we stand listen there come a knock at the front door it be raoul 's knock i be sure of that if only ivor have arrive a quarter of a hour earlier at the time appoint i should have hurry he away before this so that i might write to raoul but now i could not think what to do for the best -- what to do that thing might not be make far worse instead of better between raoul and I i have suffer so much that my power of quick decision on which i would so often prided myself vaingloriously seem go it be raoul i say what shall i do let he in of course and introduce I do not act as if you be afraid say that i come to see you on important business concern a friend of yours in england and have to call after the theater because i be leave pari by the first train in the morning no use why not when a man love a woman he trust she no man of latin blood i think and raoul 's already angry he have the right to be -- or would have if godensky have be tell he the truth and i refuse to let he come here i say i be go straight to bed i be so tired he be knock again hide yourself and i 'll let he in oh _ why _ do you stand there look at I like that go into that room and i pointed then push he towards the door you can get through the window and out of the garden -- softly -- while raoul and i be talk if you insist say ivor but you be wrong the best thing -- go -- go i tell you do not argue i know best i cut he short in a sharp whisper push he again this time he make no more objection but go into the adjoining room my boudoir the key be in the door i turn it in the lock snatch it out and drop it into a bowl of flower on a table close by that do i fly out of the drawing-room into the little entrance hall and open the front door there stand raoul he face dead white and very stern in the light of the hall lamp i have never see he like that before i know why you be here i begin quickly before he could speak count godensky tell I what he say to you i -- hope you would come be this why you wish to know what i would do if you deceive I he ask with the bitterest reproach in eye and voice no for i have not deceive you i answer i have not deceive you now if you love I you would believe I raoul i put out my hand and take he he give mine no pressure but he let I draw he into the house for god 's sake give I back my faith in you if you can he say it be death to lose it i come here want to die after you would kill I as you say perhaps i could not keep away i have to come if you have any explanation for the love of heaven tell I what it be you know I and you know godensky -- yet you need a explanation of anything evil say of I by he in this way i hope to disarm raoul but he have be half-mad i think and be scarcely sane now such a power have jealousy over he better self do not play with I he exclaim i can not bear it you send I away yet you have a appointment with godensky you take he into you carriage and now -- marianne be in the carriage if i could have have you with I i should have pack she off by herself alone that i -- might be alone with you oh raoul it be not _ possible _ you believe that i could lie to you for godensky 's sake -- a man like that if i would care for he why should not i have accept he instead of you could i have change so quickly do you think i do not think i be not able to think i can only feel he answer then -- feel sure that i love you -- no man but you -- now and always oh maxine he stammer be i a fool or wise to let myself believe you you be wise i answer as firmly as if i deserve the full faith i be claim from he as my right if you would not believe without my insist without my explain and defend myself i would tell you nothing but you _ do _ believe just because you love I -- i see it in you face and thank god for it so i 'll tell you this count godensky hate I because i could not and would not love he and he hate you because he think i love you he -- i pause for a second a wild thought have flash like the light of a beacon in my brain if i could say something now which when the blow fall -- if it do fall -- might come back to raoul 's mind and convince he instantly that it be godensky not i who have steal the treaty and broken he if i could make he believe the whole thing a monstrous plot of godensky 's to revenge himself on a woman who have refuse he by cleverly implicate she in she lover 's ruin by throw guilt upon she while she be in reality innocent if i could suggest that to raoul now while he ear be open i might hold he love against the world no matter what happen afterward it be a mad idea and a wicked one perhaps but i be at my wit ' end and desperate though not guilty of this one crime which i would shift upon he shoulder if i could as a means of escape from the trap he have help to set godensky be capable of it and guilty of other i be sure which have never be bring home to he i believe that he too be a spy just as i be and far worse because if he be one he betray he own country while i never have do that never would all these thought rush through my head in a second and i think that raoul could hardly have notice the pause before i begin to speak again he -- godensky -- would do anything to part you and I i say there be no plot too sly and vile for he to conceive and carry out against I -- and you no lie too base for he to tell you -- or other -- about I he send I a letter at the theater -- soon after you would leave I the first time in it he say that i must give he a few minute after the play unless i want some dreadful harm to come to _ you _ -- something concern you career that frightened I though i might have guess it be only a trick indeed i do guess but i could not be sure so i see he i do not want you to know -- i tell you that frankly raoul because i would tell you not to come home with I i hope you would not find out that i mean to let count godensky drive part of the way back with I and marianne i run the risk and -- the very thing happen which i ought to have know would happen as for what he have to tell I it be nothing only vague hint of trouble from which he as one of a inner circle might save you if i -- would be grateful enough the scoundrel break out raoul convince now he eye blaze i 'll -- he stop suddenly but i know what have be on he lip to say he mean to send a challenge to count godensky i must prevent he from do that no raoul i say as if he have finish he sentence you mus not fight for my sake you must not do not you see it be just what he would like best it would be a way of do I the most dreadful injury think of the scandal oh you _ will _ think of it when you be cooler for you i would not fear much for i know what a swordsman you be and what a shot -- far superior to godensky and with right on you side but i would fear for myself promise you will not bring this trouble upon I i promise he answer oh my darling what would not i promise you to atone for my brutal injustice to a angel how thankful i be that i come to you to-night i mean not to come i be afraid of myself and what i might do but at last i could not hold out against the something that seem force I here in spite of all resistance do you forgive I as a reward for you promise i say smile at he through tear that would come because i be wear out and because i know that it be i who need he forgiveness not he mine now be you happy again i ask yes i be happy he say though on the way to this house i do not dream that it would be possible for I to know happiness any more in this world and even at you gate -- he stop suddenly and he face change i wait a instant but see that he do not mean to go on i could not resist question he i have to know what have happen at my gate even at the gate -- what i ask nothing i be sorry i speak i want to show you how completely i trust you now by not speak of that but this reticence of he only make I more anxious to hear what he have be go to say i be afraid that i could guess but i must have it from he lip and be able to explain away the mystery which when it recur to he in the future might make he doubt I even though in this moment of exaltation he do not doubt yes speak of it i say all the more because it be nothing for it _ can _ be nothing i want to punish myself for ask a explanation about godensky by not allow you to explain this other thing insist poor loyal repentant raoul then -- at the time -- it make all the rest seem worse a thousand time worse but i see through black spectacles now i see through rose-coloured one i would rather you see through you own dear eye without any spectacles you must tell I what you be think of dear for my own sake if not yours well -- if you will know but remember darling i be go to put it out of my mind i 'll ask you no question i 'll only -- tell you the thing itself as i say i do not come here directly after see godensky get into you carriage i wander about like a madman -- and i think of the seine oh -- you must indeed have be mad i be but that something save I -- the something that drive I to find you i walk here by roundabout way but always come nearer and nearer as if be draw into a whirlpool at last i be in this street on the side opposite you house i have not make up my mind yet that i would try to see you i do not know what i would do i stand still and try to think it be very black in the angle between two garden wall where the big plane tree sprout up you know nobody who do not expect to find a man would have notice I in the darkness i have not be there for two minute when a man turn the corner walk very fast as he pass the street lamp just before reach the garden wall i see he plainly -- not he face but he figure and he be young and well dress in travel clothes i think he look like a englishman he go straight to you gate and ring a moment later someone i could not see who open the gate and let he in involuntarily i take a step forward with the idea of follow -- of push my way in to see who he be and who have open the gate but i be not quite mad enough to act like a cad the gate shut oh maxine there be evil and cruel thought in my mind i confess it to you -- but how they make I suffer i stand as if i be turn to stone and i only wish that i might be for a stone know no pain just then a motor cab go slowly along the street stop in front of you gate there be two woman in it i could see they by the light of the street lamp though not as plainly as i would see the man and they appear to be argue very excitedly about something whatever it be it must have be in some way concern with you or you affair because they be tremendously interested in the house they both look out and one point several time even if i would intend to go in i would not have go while they be there but the very fact that they _ be _ there rouse I out of the kind of lethargy of misery i would fall into i wonder who they be and if they mean you harm or good when they have drive away i make up my mind that i would see you if i could i try the gate and find it unlock i walk in and -- there be light in these window i know you could not have go to bed yet though you would say you be so tired there be death in my heart then for you and for I maxine for -- the gate have not open again and -- i know what you think i break in my heart beat so now that my voice shake a little though i struggle to seem calm you say to yourself ` it be maxine who let the man in he be with she now i shall find they together ' yes raoul admit but i do not try the handle of the door as i have of the gate i ring i could not bring myself to take you unawares do you think still that i let a man in and hide he when i hear you ring i ask -lrb- for a instant i be incline to tell the story ivor have advise I to tell but i see how excited raoul be i see how in paint the picture for I he live through the scene again and in spite of himself suffer almost as keenly as he have suffer in the experience i see how he suspicion of I come crawl into he heart though he strive to lash they back i dare not bring ivor out from the other room if he be still there he be too handsome too young too attractive in every way if raoul have be jealous of count godensky whom he know i have refuse what would he feel towards ivor dunda a stranger whose name i have never mention though he be receive at my house after midnight i be thankful i have not take ivor 's advice and introduce the two man at first for in he then mood raoul would have listen to no explanation he and i would never have arrive at the understanding we have reach now and not have be frank at first i must be secret to the end -rrb- the very ask of such a bold question -- do you think i let a man in and hide he help my cause with raoul no he say i can not think it i will not and do not think it and you need tell I nothing i love you and so help I god i will not distrust you again just as it enter my mind to risk everything on the chance that ivor have by this time find he way out i hear or fancy i hear a faint sound in the next room he be there still instead of throw open the door as it have occur to I to do say let we look for the man and make sure no one else let he in i laugh out abruptly as if on a sudden thought but really to cover the sound if it should come again oh raoul i exclaimed in the midst of the laughter with which i surprise he you be take this too seriously a thousand time i thank you for trust I in spite of appearance but -- after all _ be _ they so much against I you seem to think i be the only young woman in this house marianne poor dear be old enough it be true but i have a _ femme de chambre _ and a _ cuisinière _ both under twenty-five both pretty and both engage to be marry -lrb- this be true ah what a comfort to speak the truth to he -rrb- do not it occur to you that at this very moment a couple of lover may be sit hand in hand on the seat under the old yew arbor can not you imagine how they start and try to hold they breath lest you should hear as you open the gate and come up the path forgive I murmured raoul in the depths of remorse again shall we go and look or shall we leave they in peace leave they in peace by all mean the man will be slip away soon no doubt both thérèse and annette be good little girl do not let 's bother about they you will be send I away soon too and i shall deserve it brute that i be you be so tired and i -- oh i be better now i say of course i must send you away by and by but not quite yet first i want to ask if you be not glad when you see the jewel jewel echo raoul what jewel you do not mean to say you have not yet open the little bag i give you at the theater i exclaimed raoul look half ashamed dearest do not think I ungrateful he say but before i have a chance to open it i meet godensky and he tell I -- that lie it light a fire in my brain i forget all about the bag and have not think of it again till this minute at last i laugh with sincerity oh raoul raoul you be not fit for this work-a-day world well i be glad after all that i shall be with you when you see what that little insignificant bag which you have forget all this tune have in it take it out of you pocket and let 's open it together for the moment i be almost happy and that raoul would be happy i know he hand go to the inner pocket of he coat into which i have see he put the brocade bag but it do not come out again it grope and he face flush good heaven maxine he say i hope you be not in earnest when you tell I that bag hold something very valuable to we both for i have lose it you know i have be almost mad i have my handkerchief in that pocket i must have pull it out and -- my knee seem to give way under I i half fall onto a sofa raoul i say in a queer stifle voice the bag have in it the duchess de montpellier 's diamond ivor dunda ' part chapter xii ivor go into the dark never have i be catch in a situation which i like less than find myself long after midnight lock by maxine de renzie into she boudoir while within hear she do she best to convince she lover that no stranger have come on she account to the house i have never before visit she in paris though she have describe she little place there to I when we know each other in london and in grope about try to find another door or a window in the dark room i run constant risk of make my presence know by stumble against the furniture or knock down some ornament i dare not strike a match because of the sharp rasping noise it would make and i have to be as cautious as if i be tread with bare foot on glass although i know that maxine be pray for I to be out of the house and i be as far from wish to linger as she be to have I stay only by a miracle do i save myself once or twice from upset a chair or a tall vase of flower on my way to a second door which be lock on the other side at last however i discover a window and congratulate myself that my trouble and maxine 's danger be nearly over the room be on the ground floor though rather high above the level of the garden i think that i could easily let myself down but when i have slip behind the heavy curtain -lrb- they be draw and feel smooth like satin -rrb- it be only to come upon a new difficulty the window which open in the middle like most french window be tightly close with the catch securely fasten and as i begin slowly and with infinite caution to turn the handle i feel that the window be go to stick perhaps the wood have be freshly paint : perhaps it have swell in any case i know that when the two sash consent to part they would make a loud protest after the first warning squeak i stop in the next room maxine raise she voice -- to cover the sound i be sure then it have be worse even than i fancied i dare not begin again i would grope about once more and see if i could hit upon some other way out which possibly i have miss no there be nothing no other window except a small one which apparently communicate with a pantry and even if that have not seem too small for I to climb through it be fasten on the pantry side what to do i do not know it would be a calamity for maxine if du laurier should hear a sound and insist on have the door open after she have give he the impression -lrb- if she have not say it in so many word -rrb- that there be no stranger in the house probably she hope that by this time i be go but how could i go i feel like a rat in a trap : and if i have be a nervous woman i should have imagine myself stifle in the small hot room with its closed door and window as it be i be uncomfortable enough my forehead grow damp as in the first moment of a turkish bath and absent mindedly i feel in pocket after pocket for my handkerchief it be not to be find i must have lose it at the hotel or the detective 's or in the automobile i have hire in a outside pocket of my coat however i chance upon something for the existence of which i could not account it be a very small something : only a bit of paper but a very neatly fold bit of paper and i remember how it have fall from my pocket onto the floor and a gendarme have pick it up at ordinary time i should most likely not have give it a second thought but to-night nothing unexpected could be dismiss as insignificant until it have be thoroughly examine i put the paper back and as i do so i hear maxine give a exclamation apparently of distress i could not distinguish all she say but i think that i catch the word diamond for a moment or two she and du laurier talk together so excitedly that i might have make another attack on the window without great risk and i be meditate the attempt when suddenly the voice cease a door open and shut there be dead silence except for a footfall overhead which sound heavier than maxine 's perhaps it be she maid 's for a few seconds more i stand still await development but there be no sound in the next room and i decide to take my chance before it should be too late i jerk at the window which yield with a loud squeak that would certainly have give away the secret of my presence if there have be ear to hear but all be still in the drawing-room adjoining and i drop down on to a flower bed some few foot below then i skirt round to the front of the house walk stealthily on the soft grass and would have make a noiseless dash for the gate have i not see a stream of light flow out through the open front door across the lawn i check myself just in time to draw back without be see by a woman and a tall man move slowly down the path they be maxine and no doubt du laurier they speak not a word but walk with they head bent as if deeply absorb in search for something on the ground down to the gate they go open it and pass out only half close it behind they so that i know they mean presently to come back again i should have be thankful to escape but the chance of meet they be too imminent accordingly i wait and it be well i do for as they reappear in three or four minute they could not have go far enough to be out of sight from the gate there be witchcraft in it maxine say as she and she lover pass within a few yard of I where i hide behind a little arbor du laurier 's answer be lose to I but he voice sound despondent evidently they have mislay something of importance and have small hope of find it again i could not help be curious as well as sorry for maxine that a further misfortune should have befall she at such a time but the one and only way in which i could help she at the moment be to get away as soon as possible they have leave the gate unlock and i draw in a long breath of relief when i be on the other side i hurry out of the street lest du laurier should by any chance follow on quickly : and my first thought be to go immediately back to my hotel where girard might by now have arrive with news i be just ready to hail a cab crawl by at a distance when i remember the bit of paper i would find and put back into my pocket it occur to I to have a look at it by the light of a street lamp near by and the instant i have straighten out the small crumpled wad i guess that here be a link in the mystery the paper be a leaf tear from a note-book and closely cover on both side with small uneven writing do with a sharp black pencil the handwriting be that of a uneducated person and be strange to I i could not make out the word by the light of the tall lamp so i light a wax match from my match-box and protect the flame in the hollow of my hand begin study the strange message the three first word send my heart up with a bind on board the ` queen ' i have cross the channel in the queen and this beginning alone be enough to make I hope that the bit of paper might do more than any detective to unravel the mystery i be take big risk because i have get to i read on it be my only chance and if you find this i bet i can trust you you be a gentleman and you save my life and a lot more besides by get into that railway-carriage when the other chap do the minute i see they i thot i be do for but you stop there game i be a jewler 's assistant carry property worth thousand for my employer from the first i know 'twa bind to be a ticklish job on this bote i be safe for the villion who would have murder and rob I in the train if it have not be for you be there will not have a chance but when i get to pari it will be the worst and no hope for the jewl follow as i be if i have not already thot of a plan to save they through you a honest gentleman far above temptashun i know who you be for i have see you photo in the papers so what i do be this : to try a ventriloquist trick which have offen bin of use in my carere just as folk be on the boat 's gangway thro ' make that disturbance and a little skill i have get by do amatoor conjuring to amuse my wife and famly i be able to slip the case of my employer 's jewl into you breast pocket without you know and i have to take away what you have in not that i want to rob one who have do good by I but because if i would leave it the double thickness would have surprise you and you would probably have pull out my case to see what it be then my fat would have bin in the fire with certin person look on and you in danger as well as I which would not be fare i have get you case in my pocket as i write but i will not open it because it may have you sweetart 's letter in you can get you property again by bring I my master 's which be fare exchange i can not call on you for i do not know where you going and dare not hang round to see on account of the danger i run and need to meet a pal of mine who will help I i must get to he at once if i be spare to do so for which reason i write out this explanashun the best i can do be to slip it in you pocket which i shall try when in the railway stashun at paris you see how i trust you as a gentleman to bring I the jewl come as soon as you can and get you own case instead call at 218 rue fille sauvage avenue morot back room top floor left of passage express my gratitood in advance i be yours trustfully jm jeweler 's messenger p -- for heaven 's sake do not fale and ask the concerge for name of gestre if it have not be for my rage at not have read this illuminating little document earlier i should have feel like shout with joy as it be my delight be temper with enough of regret to make it easier to restrain myself but for the fear that du laurier might be still with maxine i should have rush back to she house for a moment just long enough to give she the good news but in the circumstance i dare not do it lest she should curse instead of bless I : and besides as there be still a chance of disappointment it might be better in any case not to raise she hope until there be no danger of dash they again the best thing be to get the treaty back without a second of delay as for the detective who be perhaps wait for I at the hotel he would have to wait longer or even go away disgust -- nothing make much difference now maybe when once i have the treaty in my hand i might send a messenger with a few cautious word to maxine no matter how late the hour she be certain not to be asleep the cab i have see crawl through the street have disappear long ago and no other be in sight so i walk quickly on hope to find one presently it be now so late however that in this quiet part of paris no carriage of any sort be ply for hire finally i make up my mind that i should have to go all the way on foot but i know the direction of the avenue morot though i would never hear of rue de la fille sauvage and as it be not more than two mile to walk i could reach the house i want to find in half a hour a few minute more or less ought not to matter much since j m be sure to be await I with impatience therefore the thing which bother I most be the effect likely to be produce on the man when i could not hand he over the diamond in exchange for the treaty of course i do not believe that jm be a jeweller 's messenger though possibly i might have be less incredulous if maxine have not tell I the true history of the diamond and what have happen in holland as it be i have very little doubt that the rat of a man i have chance to protect in the railway carriage be no other than the extraordinarily expert thief who have relieve du laurier of the duchess 's necklace follow out a theory which i work up as i walk i think it probable that the fellow have be help by confederate whom he have contrived to dodge evade they and sneak off to london in the hope of cheat they out of they share of the spoil follow by they dread they vengeance i fancy he flit from one hiding-place to another not daring to separate himself from the jewel at last determine to escape disguise from england where the scent have become too hot reserve a first-class carriage in the train to dover and travel with a golfer 's kit strike with panic at the last moment on see the very man he flee to avoid close on he heel and open the door of he reserved carriage with a railway key all this be merely deduction for so far as i have see jm 's travel companion have not even accost he still the theory account for much that have be puzzling and make it plausible that a man should be desperate enough to trust he treasure to a stranger -lrb- know only through photo in the newspaper -rrb- rather than risk lose it to those he have betray i resolve to use all my power of diplomacy to extract from jm the case contain the treaty before he learn that he be not to receive the diamond in its place and i have no more than vaguely map out a plan of proceeding before i arrive in the avenue morot thence i soon find my way into the rue de la fille sauvage a mean street to which the queer name seem not inappropriate the house i have to visit be a ugly big box of a building with room advertise to let as i could see by the light of a street lamp across the way which gleam bleakly on the line of shut window behind narrow iron balcony the large double door from which the paint have peel in patch be close but i ring the bell for the concierge and after a delay of several minute i hear a slight click which mean that the door have open for I i pass into a dim lobby to be challenge by a sleepy voice behind a half open window the owner of the voice keep himself invisible and be no doubt in the bunk which he call he bed only a stern sense of duty as concierge wake he up enough to demand mechanically who it be that the strange monsieur desire to visit at this late hour i reply accord to instruction i wish to see monsieur gestre monsieur gestre be away murmur the voice behind the little window i think quickly gestre be probably the pal whom jm have be in such a hurry to find very well say i i 'll see he friend the englishman who arrive this evening i have a appointment with he ah i understand i remember be it not that monsieur have be here already he now return as he mention that he might do again my thought make haste to arrange themselves the monsieur who have call have probably also arrive late after the concierge have go to bed in he dim box and become too drowsy to notice such detail as the difference between voice especially if they be those of foreigner perhaps if i explain that i be not the person who have say he would come again but another the man behind the window would consider I a complication and refuse to let I pass at such a hour without a fuss and of all thing a fuss be what i least want -- for maxine 's sake and because of the treaty i decide to seize upon the advantage that be offer I quite right i say shortly i know the way and so begin to mount the stair flight after flight i go up meet no one and on the fifth floor i find that i have reach the top of the house there be no more stair to go up on each of the floor below there have be a dim light -- a jet of gas turn low but the fifth floor be in darkness someone have put out the light either in carelessness or for some special reason there be several door on each side of the passage but i could not be sure that i have reach the right one until i would light a match when i be sure i knock but no answer come he can not be out i say to myself cheerfully he be get tire of wait and drop asleep that be all i knock again silence and then for a third time loudly keep on until i be sure that if there be anyone in the room no matter how sound asleep i must have wake he after all he have go out but perhaps only for a short time surely he would soon come back lest he should miss the keeper of the diamond i have very little hope that even on the chance of my arrive while he be away he would have leave the door open nevertheless i try the handle and to my surprise it yield that must be because the lock 's broken and only a bolt remain i think so he have to take the risk all the better this look as if he would be back any minute he would not like give the enemy a chance to find he lair and step into it before he it be dark in the room and i strike another wax match just inside the threshold but i have hardly time to get a impression of bareness and meanness of furnish before a draught of air from a open window blow out the struggle flame and at the same instant bang the door shut behind I chapter xiii ivor find something in the dark there be a strong smell of paraffin oil in the room and from somewhere at the far end come a faint tap tap sound which might be the light knock of a window-blind or the rap of a signalling finger if i could steer my way to the window and pull back the draw curtain i might be able to let in light enough to find match on mantelpiece or table then what good luck if i should discover the case contain the treaty and go off with it before jm come back it be not he and he be a thief : therefore i should be do he no wrong and maxine de renzie much good by take it if he have leave it behind not too well hide when he go out guide in the darkness by a slight breeze which still come through the window though the door be now shut i shuffle across the uncarpeted floor grope with hand hold out before I as i move in a moment i brush against a table then strike my shin on something which prove to be the leg of a chair lie over-turned on the floor i push it out of the way but have go on no more than three or four step when i catch my foot in a rug which have get twist in a heap round the fall chair i disentangled myself from its coil only to slip and almost lose my balance by step into some spill liquid which lay thick and greasy on the bare board the warm hopefulness which i have bring into this dark silent room be chill and die now i be afraid there be be a struggle here i think and if there have be a struggle -- what of the treaty there seem to be a good deal of the spill liquid for as i feel my way along more anxious than ever for light the floor be still wet and slippery and then in the midst of the puddle i stumble over a thing that be heavy and soft to the touch of my foot a queer tingle like the sting of a thousand tiny electric needle prickle through my vein for even before i stooped and lay my hand on that barrier which be so heavy and yet so soft as it stop my path i know what it would prove to be it be as if i could see through the dark to what it hide but though there be no surprise leave there be a shock of horror as my finger touch a arm a throat a upturned face and my finger be wet as i know my boot must be and i know too with what they be wet i be ashamed to say that after the first shock of the discovery my impulse be to get away and out of the whole business in which for reason which concerned other even more than myself it would be unpleasant to be involve just at this time especially i could go downstairs now past the sleep concierge and with luck no one need ever know that i have be in this dark room of death but as quickly as the impulse come it go i must stop here and search for the treaty no matter what happen until i have find it or make sure it be not to be find i must not think of escape if there be match in the room well and good if not i must go elsewhere for they and come back it be a grim task but it have to be do somehow i get to the mantelpiece and there luckily among a litter of pipe and bottle and miscellaneous rubbish i do lay my hand on a broken cup contain a few match i strike one which show I on the mantel a end of a candle stand up in a bed of its own grease i light it and not until the flame be burn brightly do i look round there be but a faint illumination yet it be enough to give I the secret of the room i might have see all at a glance as i come in before the light of my last match be blow out by the wind have not the door as i open it form a screen between I and the dead man on the floor he lay in the midst of the wildest confusion in fall he have drag with he the cover of a table and a glass lamp which be smash in piece the spill oil mingle with the stream of he blood a chair have be overturn and a broken plate and tumbler with the tray that have hold they be half hide in the fold of a disorder rug but this be not all the struggle for life do not account for the condition of other part of the room papers be scatter over the floor : the drawer of a old escritoire have be jerk out of place and they contents strew far and near the door of a wardrobe be open and a few shabby coat and pair of trousers throw about with the pocket wrong side out or tear in rag a chest of drawer have be ransack and a narrow hospital bed strip of sheet and blanket the stuffing of the mattress pull into small piece the room look as if a whirlwind have sweep through it and as i force myself to go near the body i see that it have not be leave in peace by the murderer the blood-stained coat be open the pocket of the garment turn out like those in the wardrobe and all the clothing disarrange evidently by hand which search for something with frenzied haste and merciless determination the cunning forethought of the wretched man have avail he nothing i could imagine how joyously he have arrive at this house believe that he have outwit the enemy i picture he disappointment on not find the friend who could have help and support he i see how he have plan to defend himself in case of siege by lock and bolt the door -lrb- both lock and bolt be break -rrb- i fancy he drive by hunger to search he friend 's quarter for food and fearfully begin a supper in the midst of which he have probably be interrupt almost i could feel the horror with which he must have tremble when step come along the corridor when the door be try and finally break in by force without any cry of he be hear i guess how he have rush to the window open it only to stare down at the depths below and return desperately to stand at bay to protest to the avenger that he have not the jewel that he have be deceive that he be innocent of any intention to defraud they that he would explain all make anything right if only they would give he time but they have not give he time they have punish he for rob they of the diamond by rob he of he life they have make he pay with the extreme penalty for he treachery and yet in the flicker candle-light the stricken face blood-spattered though it be seem to leer slyly as if in the knowledge that they have be cheat in the end the confusion of the room promise badly for my hope nevertheless there be a chance that the murderer intent only on find the diamond or some letter relate to they disposal might if they find the treaty have hastily fling it aside as a thing of no value though the corridor of the house be light by gas this room have none and the lamp be break i have to depend upon the bit of candle which might fail while i still have need of it i separate it carefully from its bed of grease on the mantel and as i do so the waver light touch my hand and shirt cuff both be stain red and i turn slightly sick at the sight there be blood on my brown boot too and the gray tweed clothes which i have not have time to change since arrive in paris i tell myself that i must do my best to wash away these tell-tale stain before leave the room but first i would look for the treaty i begin my search by stir up the mass of scatter papers on the floor and in spite of the horror which grip I by the throat i cry hurrah when half hide by the twisted rug i see the miss letter-case it be lie spread open back uppermost and there come a instant of despair when i pounced on it only to find it empty but there be the treaty on the floor underneath and lucky it be that the searcher have throw it out for there be gout of blood on the letter-case while the treaty be clean and unspotted with a sense of unutterable relief which almost make up for everything endure and still to be endure i slip the document back into the pocket from which it have be steal at that moment a board creak in the corridor and then come a step outside the door my blood rush up to my head but it be not of myself i think it be of the treaty if i be to be catch here alone with the dead man my hand and clothing stain with he blood i should be arrest the treaty must not be find on I yet i must hide it save it i make a dash for the window and once outside standing on the narrow balcony i throw the candle-end into the room aim for the fire-place faint starlight sift through heavy cloud show I a row of small flower-pot stand in a wooden box hastily i wrap the treaty in a towel which hang over the iron railing lift out two of the flower-pot -lrb- in which the plant be dead and dry -rrb- lay the flat parcel i have make in the bottom of the box and replace the pot to cover and conceal it then i walk back into the room again a hand fumble at the handle of the door push it open with a faint creaking of the hinge then the light of a dark lantern flash diana forrest 's part chapter xiv diana take a midnight drive some people apparently understand how to be unhappy gracefully as if it be a kind of fine art i do not it seem too bad to be true that i should be unhappy and as if i must wake up to find that it be only a bad dream i suppose i have be spoil a good deal all my life everybody have be kind to I and try to do thing for my pleasure just as i have for they and i have take thing for grant -- except of course with lisa but lisa be different -- different from everyone else in the world i have never expect anything from she as i have from other all i have want be to make she as happy as such a poor little piteous creature could be and to teach myself never to mind anything that she might say or do but ivor -- to be disappoint in he to be make miserable by he i do not know it be possible to suffer as i suffer that day he go off and leave I stand in the railway-station i do not dream then of go to pari if anybody have tell I i would go i should have say no no i will not and yet i do i allow myself to be persuade i try to make myself think that it be to please aunt lilian but down underneath i know all the time it be not that really it be because i could not bear to do the thing i be accustomed to do every day i feel as if i should cry or scream or do something ridiculous and awful unless there be a change of some sort -- any change but if possible some novelty and excitement with people talk to I every minute perhaps too there be a attraction for I in the thought that i would be in pari while ivor be there i keep remind myself on the boat and the train that nothing good could happen that ivor and i could never be as we have be before that it be all over between we for ever and ever and through he fault but there at the bottom be the thought that i _ might _ have do he a injustice because he have beg I to trust he and i would not just suppose -- something in myself keep on say -- that we should by mere chance meet in paris and he should be able to prove that he have not come for maxine de renzie 's sake it would be too glorious i should begin to live again -- for already i would find out that life without loving and trusting ivor be not life at all he could not think i have follow he even if he do see I in pari because i would be with my aunt and uncle and lord robert west and i make up my mind to be very nice to lord bob much nicer than i ever have be if ivor happen to run across we anywhere then that very thing do happen in the strangest and most unexpected way but instead of be happier for see he i be ten time more unhappy than before -- for now the misery have no gleam of hope shine through its blackness that be what i tell myself at first but after we have meet in the hall of the hotel and ivor have seem confused and would not give up he mysterious engagement or say what it be though lisa chaff he and he _ must _ have know what i think i suddenly forget the slight he have put upon I instead of be angry with he i be _ afraid _ for he i could not have explain why unless it be the look on he face when he turn away from I no man would look like that who be go of he own free will to a woman with whom he be in love that same queer something whisper in my ear instead of feeling sick and sorry for myself and desperately angry with he it be ivor i feel sorry for i pretend not to care whether he stay or go and talk to lord robert west as if i would forget that there be such a person as ivor dunda i even turn my back on he before he be go still i seem to see the tragic look in he eye and the dogged set of he jaw it be just as if he be go away from I to he death and he face be like that of the man in millai ' picture of the huguenot lover i wonder if that girl have be broken-hearted because he would not let she tie round he arm the white scarf that might have save he it be strange how one 's mood can change in a moment -- but perhaps it be like that only with woman a minute before i would be try to despise ivor and to argue just as if i would be a match-making mamma to myself that it would be a very good thing if i could make up my mind to marry lord bob that it would be rather nice be a duchess some day and that besides perhaps ivor would be sorry when he hear that i be engage to somebody else but then as i say quite suddenly it be as if a sharp knife have be stick into my heart and turn round and round i would have give anything to run after ivor to tell he that i love he dreadfully and would trust he in spite of all you look as pale as if you be go to faint say lisa in she little high-keyed voice which though she do not speak loudly always reach to the farthest corner of the biggest room i do think it be unkind of she to call everyone 's attention to I just then for even stranger hear and turn to throw a glance at I as they pass it must be the light i say for i do not feel in the least faint that be a fib because when you be as miserable as i be at that minute you heart feel cold and heavy as though it could hardly go on beating but i feel that if ever a fib be excusable that one be i be a little tired though i go on none of we get to bed till after three last night and this day though very nice of course have be rather long i think if you do not mind aunt lil i 'll go straight to my room when we get upstairs we all go up together in the lift but i say good-night to the other at the door of the pretty drawing-room at the end of uncle eric 's suite sha not i come with you ask lisa but i say no it be something new for she to offer to help I for she be not very strong and have always be the one to be pet and watch over by I though she be a few year older than i be aunt lilian have bring she maid without whom she can not get on even for a single night but lisa and i have leave ours at home and aunt lil have offer to let morton help we as much as we like i have not be shut up in my room for two minute therefore when morton knock to ask if she could do anything but i thank she and send she away i have not yet begin to undress but be stand in the window look along the champ élysées brilliant still with electric light and full of carriage and motor-car bring people home from theater and dinner-party or take they to restaurant for supper down there somewhere be ivor go farther away from I every moment though last night at about this time he have be tell I how he love I how i be the one girl in the world for he and always always would be here be i remember in spite of myself every word he have say hearing again the sound of he voice and see the look in he eye as he say it there be he go to the woman for whose sake he have be willing to break with I but be he go to she i ask myself if not when they have chaff he he might easily have mention what he engagement really be know as he must have know exactly how he make I suffer still -- why have he look so miserable if he do not care what i think and be really ready to throw I over at a call from she the whole thing begin to appear more complicate more mysterious than i have feel it to be at first when i be smart with my disappointment in ivor and tingle all over with the humiliation he seem to have put upon I oh to know to _ know _ what he be do at this minute i whisper half aloud because it be comforting in my loneliness to hear the sound of my own voice to _ know _ whether i be do he the most awful injustice -- or not just then at the door between my room and lisa 's next to mine come a tap and instantly after the handle be try but i have turn the key thinking that perhaps this very thing might happen -- that lisa might wish to come and not wait till i would give she permission she do that sort of thing sometimes for she be rather curious and impish -lrb- ivor call she imp -rrb- and if she think people do not want she that be the very time when she most want they oh di do let I in she exclaim for a second or two i do not answer never in my life have i like poor lisa less than i would like she for the last four and twenty hour though i would tell myself over and over again that she mean well that she be act for my good and that some day i would be grateful instead of longing to slap she as i could not help do now but always before when she have irritated I until i have nearly forget my promise to she father -lrb- my step-father -rrb- always to be gentle with she in thought and deed i have feel such pang of remorse that i have try to atone even when there be not really anything to atone for except in my mind i be afraid that if i refuse to let she come in she would go to bed angry with I and when lisa be angry she generally have a heart attack and be ill next day di be you there she call again without answer i go to the door and unlock it she come in with a rush i feel perfectly wild as if i must do something desperate she say so do i but i do not mean to let she know that i be go out she go on if i do not i shall have a fit out i repeat you can not it be midnight can not there be no such word for I as ` can not ' when i want to do anything and you ought to know that say she it be only be ill that ever stop I and i be not ill to-night i feel as if electricity be flow all through I make my nerve jump and i believe you feel exactly the same way you eye be as big as half-crown and as black as ink i _ be _ a little nervous i confess and i could not help think it odd that lisa and i should both be feel that electrical sensation at the same time perhaps it be in the air maybe there be go to be a thunder-storm there be cloud over the star and a wind come up maybe it be partly that maybe not say she but there be one thing i be sure of _ something be go to happen _ do you feel that too i break out before i would stop to think then i wish i have not but it be too late to wish lisa catch I up quickly ah i _ know _ you do she cry look as eerie and almost as haggard as a witch something _ be _ go to happen come go with I and be in it whatever it be no i say and you must not go either but she be weird she seem to lure I like a strange little siren with all a siren 's witchery though without she beauty my voice sound undecided and i know it of course i be not ask you to wander with I in the night hand in hand through the street of pari like the two orphan say lisa i be go to have a closed carriage -- a motor-brougham one belong to the hotel so it be quite safe it be order already and i shall first drive and drive until my nerve stop jerk and my head throb if you will not drive with I i shall drive alone but there 'll be no harm in it either way i do not know you be so conventional as to think there could be where 's you brave independent american spirit i be not conventional i say yes you be live in england have spoil you you be afraid of thing you never use to be afraid of i be not afraid of thing and i be not a bit changed i say you only want to ` dare ' I i want you to go with I it would be so much nicer than go alone she beg suppose i get ill in a hire cab i might you know but i _ can not _ stay indoors whatever happen if we be together it would be a adventure worth remember very well i say i 'll go with you not for the adventure but rather than have you make a fuss because i try to keep you in and rather than you should go alone good girl exclaim lisa quite pleasant and purr now that she have get she way though if i would refuse she would probably have cry she be terrifying when she cry great deep sob seem almost to tear she frail little body to piece she go deadly white and sometimes end up by a fit of tremble as if she be in a ague have you really order a motor cab i ask yes say she i ring for a waiter and send he down to tell the big porter at the front door to get I one then i give he five franc and say i do not want anybody to know because i must visit a poor sick friend who have write to say she be in great trouble but wish to tell no one except I that she would come to paris i should not have think such a elaborate story necessary to a waiter i remark toss up my chin a little for i do not like lisa 's subterranean way but this time she do not even try to defend herself let 's get ready at once she say i be go to put on my long travel cloak to cover up this dress and wear my black toque with a veil i suppose you 'll do the same then we can slip out and down the ` service ' stair the carriage be to wait for we at the side entrance i look at she try to read she secretive little face lisa be you plan to go somewhere in particular do something you want to ` spring ' on I when it be too late for I to get out of it how horrid of you to be so suspicious of I you _ do _ hurt my feeling i have not have a inspiration yet so i can not make a plan but it will come i know it will i shall _ feel _ where we ought to go to be in the midst of a adventure -- oh without be mix up in it so do not look horrified i tell you that something be go to happen and that i want to be in it well i mean to be when the inspiration come we put on we dark hat and long travel cloak i pin on lisa 's veil and my own then she peep to see if anyone be about but there be nobody in the corridor we hurry out and as lisa already know where to find the ` service ' stair we be soon on the way down at the side entrance of the hotel the motor-cab be wait and when we be both seat inside lisa speak in french to the driver who wait for order i think you might take we to the rue d'hollande drive fast please after that i 'll tell you where to go next be this you ` inspiration ' i ask i be not sure yet why and she voice be rather sharp for no particular reason i be a little curious that be all we drive on for some minute in silence i be sure now that lisa have be play with I that all along she have have some special destination in she mind and that she have she own reason for want to bring I to it but what use to ask more question she do not mean I to find out until she be ready for I to know she have tell the man to go quickly and he obey he rush we round corner and through street after street which i have never see before -- quiet street where there be no cab and no gay people come home from theater and dinner at last we turn into a particularly dull little street and stop be this the rue d'hollande lisa enquire of the driver jump quickly up and put she head out of the window _ mais oui mademoiselle _ i hear the man answer then stop where you be please until i give you new order i should have think this be the sort of street where nothing could possibly happen say i wait a little and maybe you 'll find out you be mistake if nothing do and we be not amuse we can go on somewhere else she have not finish speak when a handsome electric carriage spin almost noiselessly round the corner it slow down before a gate set in a high wall almost cover with creeper and though the street be dimly light and we have stop at a little distance i could see that the house behind the wall though not large be very quaint and pretty a unusual sort of house for pari it seem to I scarcely have the electric carriage come to a halt when the chauffeur in neat dark livery jump down to open the door and quickly a tall slim woman spring out follow by another elderly and stout who look like a lady 's maid i could not see the face of either but the light of the lamp on we side of the way shone on the hair of the slim young woman in black who get down first it be gorgeous hair the color of burnish copper i have hear a man say once that only two woman in the world have hair of that exact shade : jane hading and maxine de renzie my heart give a great bind and i guess in a instant why lisa have bring I here though how she could have learn where to find the house i do not know oh lisa i reproach she how _ could _ you it really _ be _ a inspiration i be sure of that now she say quietly though i could tell by she tone that she be try to hide excitement you never see that woman before except once on the stage yet you know who she be you jump as if she have fire a shot at you i know by the hair i answer i might have foresee this would be the kind of thing you would think of -- it be like you you ought to be grateful to I for think of it say lisa it be entirely for you sake and it be quite true it be a inspiration to come here this afternoon in the train i read a interview in ` femina ' with maxine de renzie about the new play she be produce to-night there be a picture of she and a description of she house in the rue d'hollande now you have satisfy you curiosity you have see she back and she maid 's back and the garden wall i say more sharply than i often speak to lisa i shall tell the driver to take we to the hotel at once i know why you want to wait here but you sha not -- i will not i be go away as quickly as i can she catch my dress as i would have lean out to speak to the driver she manner have suddenly change and she be all softness and sweetness and persuasiveness di dearest girl _ do not _ be cross with I please do not misunderstand she implore i love you you know even if you sometimes think i do not i want you to be happy -- oh wait a moment and listen i have be so miserable all day know you be miserable and i have feel horribly guilty for fear after all i would say too much of course if you would guess where i mean to come you would not have stir out of the hotel and it be better for you to see for yourself unless ivor dundas come here with a motor-cab as we do he could hardly have arrive yet so if he do come we shall know if he _ do not _ come we shall know too think how happy you 'll feel if he _ do not _ i 'll apologise to you then frankly and freely and i suppose you would not mind apologise to he if necessary he may be in the house now i say more to myself than to lisa if he be he 'll come out and meet she when he hear the gate open there it be open now the maid 's unlock it no there be nobody in the garden i can not stop here and watch for he like a spy i say not like a spy but like a girl who think she may have do a man a injustice it be for _ he _ sake i ask you to stay and if you will not i must stay alone if you insist on go away i 'll get out and stand in the street either until ivor dundas have come or until i be sure he be not come but how much better to wait and see for yourself you know i can not go off and leave you stand here i answer and i can not leave you sit in the carriage and walk through the street alone i might meet -- i would not finish my sentence but lisa must nave guess the name on my lip the only thing to do then be for we to stop where we be together say lisa for stop i must and shall in justice to myself to ivor dunda and to you you could not force I away even if you want to use force which you know be out of the question i say desperately but why have you conscience begin to reproach you for try to put I against ivor you seem to have no scruple whatever last night and this morning i have be think hard since then i want my warn to you either to be justified or else i want to apologise humbly for if ivor do not come to this house to-night in spite of he embarrassment when he speak about a engagement i shall believe that he do not care a rap about maxine de renzie i say no more but lean back against the cushion my heart beat as if it be in my throat and my brain throb in time with it i could not think or argue with myself what be really right and wise to do i could only give myself up and drift with circumstance a man have just come round the far corner whisper lisa be it ivor i can not make out he do not look we way thank heaven we be too far off for he to see we face i would rather die than have ivor know we be here i break out i do not think it be ivor lisa go on he be hidden himself in the shadow as if he be watch it be _ that _ house he be interested in who can he be if not ivor a detective perhaps why should a detective watch mademoiselle de renzie 's house i ask in spite of myself lisa seem a little confused as if she have say something she regret i do not know i be sure she answer hastily why indeed it be just a think the man seem so anxious not to be see oh -- keep back di do not look out for a instant till he be pass ivor be come now he be walk in a great hurry there he can not see you he be far enough away for you to peep and see for yourself he be at maxine de renzie 's gate it be all over then and no more hope he eye when they give I that tragic look have lie even as he lip have lie last night when he tell I there be no other woman in he world but I i will not look i stammer almost choke someone i can not see who be let he in the gate 's shut behind he let we go now i begged no no not yet cry lisa i must know what happen next we be in the midst of it indeed i hardly care what she do now ivor have come to see maxine de renzie and nothing else matter very much i have no strength to insist that we should go i wonder what the man in the shadow would do if he see we lisa say then she lean out on the side away from the hiding man and softly tell we chauffeur to go very slowly along the street this he do but the man do not move stop before that house behind the wall with the creeper direct lisa but i would not allow that no he shall not stop there i exclaimed lisa i forbid it you have have you way in everything so far i will not let you have it in this very well we 'll turn the corner into the next street to please you say lisa and she give order to the chauffeur again now stop she cry when we have go half way down the street out of sight and hearing of anyone in the rue d'hollande then in another instant before i have any idea what she mean to do she be out of the cab run like a child in the direction whence we have come i look after she hesitating whether or not to follow -lrb- for i could not bear to risk meeting ivor -rrb- and see that she pause at the corner she be peep into the rue d'hollande to find out what be happen there she will come back in a moment or two i say to myself wearily and sit wait for a little while she stand with she long dress gather up under she cloak : then she dart round the corner and vanish if she have not appear again almost at once i should have have to tell the driver to follow though i hate the thought of go again into the street where maxine de renzie live but she do come and in she hand be a pretty little brocade bag embroider with gold or silver that sparkle even in the faint light i see this lie in the street and run to pick it up she exclaim you might better have leave it i say stiffly perhaps mademoiselle de renzie drop it no i do not think so it be not in front of she house it may belong to that man who be watch then it do not look much like a thing that a man would carry about with he do it no i admit indifferently now we will go home do not you want to wait and see how long ivor dunda stop indeed i do not i cry i do not want to know any more about he and for the moment i almost believe that what i say be true very well say lisa perhaps we do know enough to prove to we both that i have not anything to reproach myself with and the less you think about he after this the better i sha not think about he at all i say but i know that be a boast i should never be able to keep try as i might i feel now that i could understand how people must feel when they be very old and weary of life i do not believe that i shall feel older and more tired if i live to be eighty than i feel then it be a slight comfort to know that we be on we way back to the hotel and that soon i should be in my room alone with the door shut and lock between lisa and I but it be only very slight i could not imagine ever be really pleased about anything again you will marry lord robert now i suppose chirped lisa and show ivor dunda that he have not spoil you life as she ask this question she be tug away at a knot in the ribbon that tie the bag she have find perhaps i shall i answer i might do worse i should think you might exclaim lisa oh do accept he soon i do not want ivor dunda to say to himself that you be broken-hearted for he lord bob be sure to propose to you to-morrow -- even if he have not already : and if he have he 'll do it again i see it in he eye all to-day he be die to speak at any minute if only he would get a chance with you alone you _ will _ say ` yes ' when he do will not you and have the engagement announce at once i 'll see how i feel at the time if it come i answer try to speak gaily but make a failure of it at last lisa have get the brocade bag open and be look in she seem surprise by what she see and very much interested she put in she hand and touch the thing whatever it be but she do not tell I what be there probably she want to excite my curiosity and make I ask but i do not care enough to humor she if the bag have be stuff full of the most gorgeous jewel in the world at that moment i should not have be interested in the least i see lisa give a little sidelong peep up at I to see if i be watch but when she find I look entirely indifferent she tie up the bag again and stow it away in one of the deep pocket of she travel cloak i be afraid that when we would arrive at the hotel and go up to we room lisa might want to stop with I and be vex when i turn she out as i feel i must do but she seem to have lose interest in I and my affair now that all doubt be settle she do not even wish to talk over what have happen but when i bade she good-night simply say good-night in return and let I shut the door between the room i suppose i think that the best thing i shall have to hope for after this until i grow quite old be to sleep and be happy in my dream but though i try hard to put away thought of all kind and fall asleep i could not my eye would not stay close for more than a minute at a time and always i find myself stare at the window hour after hour hope for the light chapter xv diana hear news it seem as if the night would never end if i have be vain and deserve to be punish for my vanity then i be well punish now i feel so ashamed and humiliate it must have be long after one when i go to bed yet i be thankful when dawn come and give I a excuse to get up after i have have a cold bath however i feel better and a cup of steam hot coffee afterwards do I good i be all dress when morton aunt lilian 's maid knock at my door to ask if i be up and if she could help I do my hair she ladyship send I she love and hope i have rest nicely she would be please to hear that i be look well look well i be glad to know that though it surprise I i stare at myself in the glass and wonder that so many hour of misery have make so little impression on my face i be rather paler than usual perhaps but my cheek be faintly pink and my lip red i suppose while one be young one can suffer a good deal and one 's face tell no secret we be to make a very early start to examine the wonderful motor-car which lord robert west have advise aunt lil to buy afterwards she and lisa and i have plan to do a little shopping because it would seem a waste of time to be in paris and bring nothing away from the shop but when i tap at lisa 's door -lrb- dread yet wish to have we first greet over -rrb- it appear that she have a bad headache and do not want to go with we to see the rajah 's automobile while i be with she aunt lil come in look very bright and handsome she be so sorry for lisa and not at all sorry for I -lrb- how little she guess -rrb- and before take I away with she promise to come back after it be settle about the car to see whether lisa be well enough by that time for the shopping expedition the automobile really be a magnificent animal as aunt lil say and it take she just two minute after examine it from bonnet to tool-box to make up she mind that she could not be happy without it it be sixty horsepower and of a world-renowned make but that be a detail _ any _ car could be powerful and well make every car should be or you would not pay for it but she have never see one before with such heavenly little arrangement for luggage and lunch while as for the gold toilet thing in a pale gray suède case they be beyond word and she must have they -- the motor also of course since it go with they so that be decide and she and i drive back to the hotel while the two man go to the automobile club of which lord bob be a honorary member if possible all formality be to be get through with the rajah 's agent and the car pay for at two o'clock when we be to meet the man at the ritz for luncheon they be to let we know whether everything have be successfully arrange : and if so aunt lil want the party to motor to calai in she new automobile instead of go by train lord bob would drive but he mean to hire a chauffeur recommend by the club so that he would not have to stop behind and see to get the car across the channel in a cargo boat aunt lil be very much excite over this idea as she always be over anything new and if i be rather quiet and uninterested she be too much occupy to notice lisa be look worse when we go back to she at the hotel but aunt lil do not notice that either she be always nice to lisa but she do not like she and it be only when you really care for people that you observe change in they when you be busy thinking of you own affair i advise lisa to rest in she own room instead of shopping as she would have the long motor run later in the day and a night journey but she be dress and seem to want to go out she have thing to do she say and though she do not buy anything when she be with we while we be at a milliner 's in the rue de la paix choose hat for aunt lil she disappear on some errand of she own and only come back just as we be ready to leave the shop whatever it be that she have be do it have interested she and wake she out of herself for she eye look brighter and she have spot of color on she cheek aunt lil find so much to do and be sure we could easily carry so many thing in the motor-car that it be a rush to meet uncle eric and lord bob at the ritz by two o'clock but we do manage it or nearly we be not more than ten minute late which be wonderful for aunt lil : and the short time that we would keep they wait be not enough to account for the solemnity of the two man 's face as they come forward to meet we something 's go wrong about the car exclaim aunt lil no the car 's all right say lord bob i have get you a chauffeur too and -- then what have happen you both look like thunder-cloud or wet blanket or something disagreeable it surely can not be because you be hungry that you be cross about a few minute have you see a newspaper to-day ask uncle eric a newspaper i should think not indeed we have have too many important thing to do to waste time on trifle why have the government go out ivor dundas have get into a mess here uncle eric answer look very much worry -- so much worry that i think he must care even more about ivor than i have fancy of course it be the most awful rot say lord bob but he be accuse of murder it be in the evening papers : not a word have get into the morning one uncle eric go on we have only just see the news since we come here to wait for you otherwise i should have try to do something for he as it be of course i must as a friend of he stop in pari and do what i can to help he through but that need not keep the rest of you from go on to-day as you plan what a awful thing exclaim aunt lil i will stay too if the girl do not mind poor fellow it may be some comfort to he to feel that he have friend on the spot standing by he i have get thousand of engagement -- we all have -- but i shall telegraph to everybody what about you lord bob i 'll stand by with you lady mountstuart say he he nice though not very clever face more anxious-looking than i have ever see it he blue wide-apart eye watch I rather wistfully dunda and i have never be intimate but he be a fine chap and i have always admire he he be sure to come out of this all right poor lord robert i have not much thought to give he then but dimly i feel that he anxiety be concern with I even more than with ivor of whom he speak so kindly though he have often show sign of jealousy in past day i feel stunned and almost daze if anyone have speak to I i think i should have be dumb unable to answer but nobody do speak or seem to think it strange that i have nothing to say i suppose you will not try to do anything until after lunch will you mountstuart lord robert go on to ask no we must eat and talk thing over say uncle eric we go into the restaurant i move as if i be in a dream ivor accuse of murder what have he do what could have happen but i be soon to know as soon as we be seat at a table where the lovely fresh flower seem a mockery aunt lil begin ask question for some reason uncle eric apparently do not like answer it be almost as if he have have some kind of previous knowledge of the affair of which he do not wish to speak but i suppose it could not have be that it be lord robert who tell we nearly everything and always i be conscious that he be watch I wonder if this be a cruel blow for I ask himself if he be speak in a tactful way of one who have be he rival there be that engagement of dunda ' last night which he be just go to keep when we see he say lord bob carefully but clumsily i be afraid there must have be something fishy about that -- i mean some trap must have be lay to catch he and it seem he be not suppose to be in paris -- though i do not see what that can have to do with the plot if there be one he be stop in the hotel under another name no doubt he have some good reason though there be nothing sly about dunda if ever there be a plucky chap he be one anyhow apparently he want to get hold of a man in paris he could not find for he call last evening on a detective name girard a rather well-known fellow in he line i believe it almost look as if dunda have make a enemy of he for he be be give evidence pretty freely to the police -- lose no time about it anyhow girard say he be follow up the scent tracking down the person he have be hire by dunda to hunt for and have at last come to the house where he be lodge when there he find dunda himself ransack the room cover with blood and the chap who be want lie dead on the floor he body hardly cold what time be all that enquire lisa sharply it be the first question she have ask between midnight and one o'clock i think the papers say answer lord bob well of course it be all nonsense exclaimed aunt lil impatiently french people be so sensational and they jump at conclusion so the idea of they daring to accuse a man like ivor dunda of murder they ought to know better they 'll soon be eat humble-pie and beg england 's pardon for wrongful treatment of a british subject will not they eric i be afraid there be no question of jump at conclusion on the part of the authority or of eat humble-pie uncle eric say the evidence -- entirely circumstantial so far luckily -- be dead against ivor and as for he be a british subject there be nothing in that if a englishman choose to commit a murder in france he be leave to the french law to deal with as if he be a frenchman but ivor have not commit murder cry aunt lilian horrify of course not but he be get to prove that he have not and in that he be worse off than if this thing happen in england english law suppose a man innocent until he be be prove guilty french law on the contrary presume that he be guilty until he be prove innocent in face of the evidence against ivor the authority could not have do otherwise than they have do for the first time in my life i feel angry with aunt lilian 's husband i do hate that cold stern sense of justice on which man pride themselves so much whether it be a affair of a friend or a enemy surely mr dunda must have be able to prove a -- a -- do not you call it a alibi ask lisa he do not try to reply lord bob he be simply refuse up to the present to tell what he be do between twelve o'clock and the time he be find except to say that he walk for a good while before go to the house where girard afterwards find he of course he deny kill the man : say the fellow have steal something from he on the boat cross from dover to calai yesterday and that after apply to the detective he get a note from the thief offering to give the thing back if he would call and name a reward say he find the room already ransack and the fellow dead when he arrive at the address give he that he be search for he property when girard appear on the scene could not he have show the note send by the thief ask aunt lil he do show a note but it do he more harm than good and he would not tell what the thing be the thief have take from he except that it be valuable it do look as if he be determine to make the case as black as possible against himself but then as i say before no doubt he have good reason he have no good luck anyhow sigh aunt lil who always like ivor rather not -- so far why one of the worst bit of evidence against he be that the concierge of this house in the rue de la fille sauvage swear that though dunda have not be in the place much above half a hour when the detective arrive he be there then _ for the second time _ that he admit it when he come the first visit he make accord to the concierge be about a hour before the second : the concierge be already in bed in he little box but not asleep when a man ring and a english-sounding voice ask for monsieur gestre on hearing that gestre be away the visitor say he would see the gentleman who be stop in gestre 's room by and by the englishman go out and on be challenge say he might come back again later after a while the concierge be wake up once more by a caller for gestre who announce that he would be before and now he vow that it be the same man both time though dunda deny have call twice if he could prove that he would be in the house no more than half a hour it might be all right for two doctor agree that the murder man have be dead more than a hour when they be call in but he can not or will not prove it -- that be he luck again -- and nobody can be find who see he in any of the street through which he mention pass the last moment that he can be account for be when a cabman who have take he up at the hotel just after he leave we set he down in the rue de courbvoie not so very far from the élysée palace then it be only between five and ten minute past twelve so he could easily have go on to the rue de la fille sauvage afterwards and kill he man at the time when the doctor say the fellow must have die it be a bad scrape but of course dunda will get out of it somehow or other in the end do _ you _ think he will eric ask aunt lil i hope so with all my heart he answer but he face show that he be deeply troubled and my heart sink down -- down as i realize more and more the danger in which ivor stand my resentment against he begin to seem curiously trivial nothing have happen to make I feel that i have do he a injustice in think he care more for maxine de renzie than for I -- indeed on the contrary everything go to prove he supreme loyalty to she whose name he have refuse to speak even for the sake of clear himself still now that the world be against he my soul rush to stand by he side to defend he to give he love and trust in spite of all down deep in my heart i forgive he even though he have be cruel and i yearn over he with a exceed tenderness more than anything on earth i want to help he and i mean to try indeed as the talk go on while that terrible meal progress i think i see a way to do it if lisa and i should act together i be so anxious to have a talk with she that i could hardly wait to get back to we own hotel from the ritz fortunately nobody want to sit long at lunch so it be not yet three when i call she into my room the man have go to make different arrangement about start for we be not to leave paris until they have have time to do something for ivor uncle eric go to see the british ambassador and aunt lilian have say that she would be busy for at least a hour write letter and telegram to cancel engagement we have have in london for awhile lisa and i be almost sure not to be interrupted but i speak out abruptly what be in my mind not wish to lose a minute i think the only thing for we to do i say be to tell what we know and save ivor in spite of himself how can anything you know save he she ask with a queer faint emphasis which i do not understand do not you see i cry that if we come forward and say we see he in the rue d'hollande at a quarter past twelve -- go into a house there -- he could not have murder the man in that other house far away it all hang on the time but you do not see he go in lisa contradict I i stare at she _ you _ do be not it the same thing no not unless i choose to say so and -- but you will choose you want to save he of course why because he be innocent because he be you friend no man be the friend of any woman if he be in love with another oh lisa do sophistry of that sort matter do anything matter except save he i do not consider she say in a slow aggravating way that ivor dundas have behave very well to -- to we family but i want you to understand this di if he be to be get out of this danger -- no doubt it be real danger -- in any such way as you propose it be for _ I _ to do it not you he 'll have to owe he gratitude to I and there be something else i can do for he perhaps -- i and only i a thing of value be steal from he it seem a thing he be anxious to get back at any price -- even the price of look for it on a dead man 's body well i think i know what that thing be -- i think i have it what do you mean i ask astonish at she and at she manner -- and she word i be not go to tell you what i mean only i be sure of what i be say -- at least that the thing _ be _ valuable worth risk a great deal for i learn that from expert this morning while you and you aunt be think about hat for a instant i be completely bewilder then suddenly a strange idea spring into my mind : that brocade bag you pick up in the rue d'hollande last night it be the first time i have think of it from that moment to this -- there have be so many other thing which seem more important lisa look annoyed i think she have count on my not remember or not connect she hint with the thing she have find in the street and that she have want to tantalise I i will not say whether i mean the brocade bag or not and whether if i do that i believe ivor drop it or whether there be another man mix up in the case -- perhaps the real murderer if i _ do _ decide to tell what i know and what i suspect it will not be to you -- unless for a very particular reason -- and it will not be yet awhile i be afraid that i almost hate she for a moment she seem so cold so calculate and sly i could not bear to think that she be my step-sister and i be glad that at least not a drop of the same blood run in we vein if you choose to keep silent for some purpose of you own i break out you can not prevent I from tell the whole story as _ i _ know it -- how i go out with you and all that i can not prevent you from do it but i can advise you not to -- for ivor 's sake she answer for he sake yes and for you own too if you care for he opinion of you at all for he sake because _ neither _ of we know when he come out of maxine de renzie 's house you _ would _ go away though i want to stay and watch he may not have be there more than five minute for all we can tell to the contrary in which case he would still have have time to go straight off to the rue de la fille sauvage and kill that man in accordance with the doctor ' statement about the death for _ you _ sake because if he know that you track he to maxine de renzie 's house he will not respect you very much and because he would probably be furious with you unable to forgive you as long as he live for injure the reputation of the woman he be risk so much to save he would believe you do it out of spiteful jealousy against she i grow cold all over and tremble so that i could hardly speak ivor would know that i be incapable of such baseness i be not sure he would hold you above it ` hell have no fury like a woman scorn ' -- and he _ have _ scorn you -- for a actress it be as if she have strike I in the face : and i could feel the blood rush up to my cheek they burn so hotly that the tear be force to my eye you see i be right do not you lisa ask you may be right in think i could do he no good in that way -- and that he would not wish it even if i could but not about the rest i say we will not talk of it any more i can not stand it please go back to you room now lisa i want to be alone very well she snap _ you _ call I in i do not ask to come then she go out with not another word or look and slam the door i could imagine myself compelling she to give up the brocade bag or offer she some great bribe of money thousand of pound if necessary lisa be a strange little creature she will do a good deal for money chapter xvi diana undertake a strange errand if i have not be tingle with anger against lisa who have seem to enjoy say needlessly cruel thing to I perhaps i would have be utterly discourage when she prick the bubble of my hope she have make I realize that the plan i have be useless perhaps worse than useless but in my desperate mood i catch at another i would try to see ivor and find out some other way of help he at all event he should know that i be for he not against he in this time of trouble perhaps this new idea be a mad one i tell myself perhaps i should not be allow to see he even in the presence of other but while there be a perhaps i would not give up without wait for a cooler or more cowardly mood to set in i almost run out of my room and downstairs for i have not take off my hat and coat since come in i have no knowledge of french law or police etiquette or anything of that sort but i know the french as a gallant nation and i think that if a girl should go to the right place beg for a short conversation with a accuse man as he friend a interview -- probably with a witness -- might possibly be grant the authority might think that we be engage for all i care i do not care about anything now except see ivor and help he if i could i hardly know what i mean to do at the beginning by way of get the chance i want until i have ask to have a motor-cab call for I then i suddenly think of the british ambassador a great friend of uncle eric 's and aunt lilian 's uncle eric have already be to he but i fancy not with a view of try to see ivor that idea have apparently not be in he mind at all anyway the ambassador would already understand that the family take a deep interest in the fate of ivor dunda and would not be wholly astonished at receive a call from I besides hearing of some rather venturesome escapade of mine when i first arrive in london he have once while visit uncle eric laugh a good deal and say that in future he would be surprise at nothing a american girl might do i tell the driver to go to the british embassy as fast as he could there i send in my name and the ambassador receive I at once i do not explain much but come to the point immediately and say that i want -- oh but want and need very much indeed -- to see ivor dundas could he would he help I to do that ought i to help you he ask would mountstuart and lady mountstuart approve yes i say firmly they would approve you see it be necessary then if it be necessary -- and i believe you when you say that it be he answer i 'll do what i can what he could do and do do be to write a personal letter to the chief of police in paris ask as a favor that he friend miss forrest a young lady relate through marriage to the british foreign secretary should be allow five minute ' conversation with the englishman accuse of murder mr ivor dunda i take the letter to the chief of police myself to save time and because i be so restless and excited that i must be do something every instant -- something which i feel might bring I nearer to ivor from the chief of police who prove to be a most courteous person i receive a order to give to the governor of the gaol or prison where they have put ivor this he explain would procure I the interview i want but unfortunately i must not hope to see my friend alone a warder who understand english would have to be present so far i have go into the wild venture without once think what it would be to find myself suddenly face to face with ivor in such terrible circumstance or what he would think of I for come in such a way now that we be no longer anything to each other -- not even friend but a kind of ague-terror creep over I while i sit wait in a ugly little bare stuffy reception room my head be go round and round my heart be pound so that i could not make up my mind what to say to ivor when he come then suddenly i hear the sound of footstep outside the door and when it open there stand ivor between two frenchman in blue uniform one of they walk into the room with he -- i suppose he must have be a warder -- but he stop near the door and in a second i have forget all about he he simply cease to exist for I when my eye and ivor 's have meet i spring up from my chair and begin to talk as quickly as i could stammer and confuse hardly know what i say but anxious to make he understand in the beginning that i have not come to take back my word of yesterday we be all so dreadfully sorry mr dunda i say i do not know if uncle eric have be here yet -- but he be do all he can and aunt lilian be dreadfully upset we be stay on in pari on account of -- on account of this so you see you have get friend near you and i -- we be such old friend i could not help try as hard as i could for a sight of you to -- to cheer you up and -- and to help you if that be possible i speak very fast not daring to look at he after the first but pretend to smooth out some wrinkle in one of my long glove my eye be full of tear and i be afraid they would go splash down my cheek if i even wink my lash i love he more than ever now and feel capable of forgive he anything if only i have the chance to forgive and if only _ only _ he really love I and not that other thank you a hundred time -- more than i can express he say with a faint quiver in he voice -- he beautiful voice which be the first thing that charm I after know he it _ do _ cheer I to see you it give I strength and courage you would not have come if you do not -- trust I and believe I innocent why of course i -- we -- believe you innocent of any crime i falter and of any lack of faith oh as for that how can -- but do not let 's speak of that what can it matter now it matter more than anything else in the world if only you could say that you will have faith i 'll try to say it then if it can give you any comfort not unless you mean it then -- i 'll try to mean it will that satisfy you it be better than nothing and i thank you again as for the rest you be not to be anxious everything will come right for I sooner or later though i may have to suffer some annoyance first annoyance i echo if there be nothing worse there will not be i shall be well defend it will all be show up as a huge mistake -- another warn against trust to circumstantial evidence be there nothing we can do then or -- that we would urge _ other _ to do i ask hope he would understand that i mean _ one _ other -- maxine de renzie i guess by he look that he do understand it be a look of gloom but suddenly a light flash in he eye there be one thing _ you _ could do for I -- you and no one else he say but i have no right to ask it tell I what it be i implored i would not if it do not mean more than my life to I he hesitate and then while i wonder what be to come he bent forward and speak a few hurry word in spanish he know that to I spanish be almost as familiar as english he have hear I talk of the spanish custom still exist in the part of californium where i be bear he have hear I sing spanish song we have sing they together -- one or two i have teach he but i have not teach he the language he learn that and three or four other at least as a boy when first he think of take up a diplomatic career they be so few word and so quickly speak that i -- remember the warder -- almost hope they might pass unnoticed but the man in uniform come nearer to we at once look angry and suspicious that be forbid he say to ivor then turn sharply to I what language be that spanish i answer he only bid I good-bye we have be -- very dear friend and there be a misunderstanding but -- it be over now it be natural he should not want you to hear he last word to I nevertheless it be forbid repeat the warder obstinately and though the five minute you be grant together be not over yet the prisoner must go with I now he have forfeit the rest of he time and must be report with this he order ivor to leave the room in a tone which sound to I so brutal that i should have like he to be shoot and the whole french police force exterminate to hear a little underbred policeman dare to speak like that to my big brave handsome englishman and to know that it would be childish and undignified of ivor to resist -- oh i could have kill the creature with my own hand -- i think as for ivor he say not another word except good-bye smile half sadly half with a twinkle of grim humor then he go out with he head high : and just at the door he throw I back one look it say as plainly as if he have speak : remember i know you will not fail I i do indeed remember and i pray that i should have pluck and courage not to fail but it be a very hard thing that he have ask I to do and he have say well in say that he would not ask it of I if it do not mean more than he life the word he have whisper so hastily and unexpectedly in spanish be these : go to the room of the murder alone and on the window balcony find in a box under flower-pot a fold document take this to maxine every moment count so it seem that it be always of she he think -- of maxine de renzie and i of all people in the world be to help he with she as i thought of this task he have set I and of all it mean it appear more and more incredible that he should have have the heart to ask such a thing of I but -- it mean more than he life and i would do the thing if it could be do because of my pride as i drive away from the prison a kind of fury grow in I and possess I i feel as if i have fire instead of blood in my vein if i have know that death or worse than death wait for I in the ghastly house to which ivor have send I i would still have go there my first thought be to go instantly and get it over -- with success or failure but calmer thought prevail i have not look at the papers yet my only knowledge of last night 's dreadful happening have come from uncle eric and lord robert west i have say to myself that i do not wish to read the newspaper account of the murder and of ivor 's suppose part in it i remember now however that i do not even know in what part of paris the house of the murder be i recall only the name of the street because it be a curiously grim one -- like the tragedy that have be act in it i could not tell the chaffeur to drive I to the street and house that would be a stupid thing to do i must search the papers and find out from they something about the neighborhood for there would surely be plenty of detail of that sort and i must do this without first go back to the hotel as it might be very difficult to get away again once i be there now nobody know where i be and i be free to do as i pleased no matter what the consequence might be afterwards pass a duval restaurant i suddenly order my motor-cab to stop have pay and send it away i go upstairs and ask for a cup of chocolate at one of the little deadly respectable-looking marble table also i ask to see a evening paper it be a shock to find ivor 's photograph horribly reproduce gaze at I from the front page the photograph be a old one which have be a good deal show in shop window much to ivor 's disgust at about the time when he return from he great expedition and publish he really wonderful book i have see it before i meet he and as it must have be on sale in pari as well as london it have be easy enough for the newspaper people to get it then there come the story of the murder build up dramatically hate it sicken by it i yet read it all i know where to go to find the house and i know that the murder have be commit in a back room on the top floor also i see the picture of the window with the balcony ivor be suppose -- accord to girard the detective -- to have try in vain to escape by way of this high balcony on hearing sound outside the door while busy in search the dead man 's room girard say that he have see he first by the light of a bull 's - eye lantern which he -- girard -- carry standing at bay in the open window there be a photograph of this window take from outside there be the balcony : and there be the balcony of another window with another balcony just like it on the adjoining house i look at the picture and judge that there would not be more than two foot of distance between the railing of those two balcony that would be my way to get there -- if i can get there at all i say to myself but there be hardly any if leave in my mind now i mean to get there by this time it be after five o'clock i leave the duval restaurant and again take a cab the first thing i do be to send a _ petit bleu _ to aunt lilian say that she be not to worry about I i would be hip and nervous and have go out to see a friend who be -- i would just find out -- stay in pari perhaps i should stop with the friend to dinner but at latest i should be back by nine or ten o'clock that would save a bother at the hotel -lrb- for aunt lilian know i have heap of american friend who come every year to pari -rrb- yet no one would know where to search for I even if they be incline next i drive to a street near the rue de la fille sauvage and dismiss my cab i ask for no direction but after one or two mistake find the street i want instead of go to the house of the murder i pass on to the next house on the leave -- the house of the balcony almost adjoining the dead man 's i ring the bell for the concierge and ask he if there be any room to let in the house i know already that there be for i could see the advertisement of _ chambre à louer _ stare I in the face : but i speak french as badly as i could make three mistake to every sentence and beg the man to talk slowly in answer I there be several room to be have it appear but it would have be too good to be true that the one i want should be empty after we have jabber awhile i make the concierge understand that i be a young american journalist employ by a new york paper i want to write up the murder of last night accord to my own idea and as of course the police would not let I go into the room where it happen the next best thing would be to take the room close to it in the house adjoining i want to be there only long enough to get the emotion the sensation i explain so as to make my article really dramatic would the people who occupy that room let it to I for a few hour long before bedtime they could have it back again if i get on well with my write the concierge to whom i give ten franc as a kind of retain fee be almost sure the occupant of the room -lrb- a old man and he wife -rrb- would willingly agree to such a proposal if i pay they well enough for they trouble in turn out would three loui be enough i ask the concierge -- whose eye brighten -- think that it would i know by he look that he would take a large commission for manage the affair as he quickly offer to do but that do not matter to I he confirm my idea that it would have be hopeless to try and get into the room of the murder itself even if i could have bear it say that the door and window too have be seal by the police who be also guard the house from curiosity seeker but he add that i could see the shut window from the balcony of the room i be go to hire i wait for he and play with he very unattractive baby while he go upstairs to make enquiry he be go for some time explain to the people but at last when my patience be almost too far strain he come back to say that monsieur and madame nissot have consent to go out of they room for the evening they be dine at the moment however and mademoiselle must be please to wait a few moment until they finish the meal and gather up a few thing which they could carry to a neighbor 's : book and work for they hour of absence the concierge politely suggest but that be to save my feeling no doubt for i be sure the husband and wife mean to make a parcel of any valuable which could possibly be carry off by a unscrupulous american journalist also they stipulate that payment must be make in advance to this i agree willingly and then -- i wait wait it be tedious but after all the tediousness do not matter much when i come to think of it it would be impossible to do the thing i have make up my mind to do till after dark maxine de renzie 's part chapter xvii maxine make a bargain we look everywhere in all possible place for the diamond necklace raoul and i and to he poor fellow its second loss seem overwhelming he do not see in glare scarlet letter always before he eye these two word : the treaty as i do -- for my punishment he be in happy ignorance still of that other loss which i -- i to whom he honor should have be sacred -- have inflict upon he he be satisfy with my story that through a person employ by I -- a person whose name could not yet be mention even to he -- the necklace have be snatch from the thief who have steal it he blame himself mercilessly for think so little of the brocade bag which i have give he at parting for let all remembrance of my word concern it be put out of he mind by he wicked jealousy as he repentantly call it for I he have nothing but praise and gratitude for what i have do for he he beg I to forgive he and he remorse for such a small thing comparatively -- wring my heart we search the garden and the whole street then come back to search the little drawing-room for the second time in vain it do seem that there be witchcraft in it as i say to raoul but at last i persuade he to go away and follow he own track wherever he have be since i give he the bag with the diamond it be just possible as it be so late and he way have lead he through quiet street that even after all this time the little brocade bag might be lie where he have leave it -- or that some honest policeman on he beat might have pick it up besides there be the cab in which he have come part of the distance to my house the bag might have fall on the floor while he drive : and there be many honest cabman in paris i remind he try to be as cheerful as i could so he leave I and i be deadly tired but i have no thought of sleep -- no wish for it when i have unlock the door of my boudoir and find ivor dundas go as i have hope he would be the next hope bear in my heart be that he might by and by come back or send -- with news hour after hour of deadly suspense pass on and he do not come or make any sign at five o'clock marianne who have flit about all night like a restless ghost make I drink a cup of hot chocolate and actually put I to bed my last word to she be : what be the use i can not sleep it will be worse to lie and toss in a fever than sit up yet i do sleep and heavily she will always deny it i know but i be sure she must have slyly slip a sleeping-powder into the chocolate i be far too much occupy with my own thought as i drink to please she to think whether or no there be anything at all peculiar in the taste be that as it may i sleep and when i wake suddenly start out of a hateful dream -lrb- yet scarcely worse than reality -rrb- to my horror it be nearly noon i be wild with fear lest the servant in they stupid but well-meant wish not to disturb I might have send important visitor away however when marianne come fly in in answer to my long peal of the electric bell she say that no one have be there be letter and one telegram and all the morning papers as usual after the first night of a new play my heart give a spring at the news that there be a telegram for i think it might be from ivor say he be on the track of the treaty even if he have not yet get hold of it but the message be from raoul and he have not find the brocade bag he do not put this in so many word but say i have not find what be lose or learn anything of it from ivor there be not a line and i think this cruel he might have wire or write I a note even if there be nothing definite to say he might unless -- something have happen to he there be that to think of and i do think of it with dread and a grow presentiment that i have not suffer yet all i be to suffer i determine to send a servant to the élysée palace hotel to enquire for he and despatch henrus immediately meanwhile as there be nothing to do after pretend to eat breakfast under the watchful eye of marianne i pretend also to read the newspaper notice of the play but each sentence go out of my head before i have begin the next i know in the end only that accord to all the critic maxine de renzie have surpass herself have be astonishingly great have do what no woman could do unless she throw she whole soul into she part how little they know where maxine de renzie 's soul have be last night and -- only god know where it might be this night out of she body perhaps -- the one way of escape from raoul 's hatred if he have come to know the truth of course the enquiry at the hotel be not for ivor dunda but for the name he have adopt there yet when my servant come back to I he have nothing to tell which be console -- rather the other way the gentleman have go out about midnight -lrb- i know that already -rrb- and have not return since henrus have be to the bureau to ask and it have strike he he admit to I on be catechise that he question have be answer with a certain reserve as if more be know of the absent gentleman 's movement than it be consider wise to tell my servant have not be long away though it seem long to I and he have delay only to buy all the evening papers which he think that mademoiselle would like to see as they be sure to be fill with praise of she great act it be on my tongue to scold he for stop even one moment when he have be tell to hurry but he look so pleased at he own cleverness that i have not the heart to dash he happiness i would however have push the papers aside without so much as glance at they if it have not suddenly occur to I that if any accident have befall ivor news of it might possibly have get into print by this time when i read what have happen -- how he be accuse of murder and while declare he innocence have be silent as to all those event which might have prove it my heart go out to he in a wave of gratitude here be a man a man loyal and brave and chivalrous as all man ought to be but few be he have sacrifice himself to the death no doubt to keep my name out of the mud into which my business have throw he and to save I from appear in raoul 's eye the liar that i be have ivor tell that he be with I after i have prevaricate -lrb- if i have not actually lie -rrb- to raoul about the midnight visitor to my house what would raoul think of I ivor be try to save I if he could and he have be try to save I when he go to the room of that dead man though how and when he have decide to go i know not if it be not for I he would be free and happy to-day my conscience cry out that the one thing to do be to go at once to the chief of police and say : monsieur this english gentleman they have arrest can not have commit a murder in the rue de la fille sauvage between twelve and one last night for he come to my house far away in the rue d'hollande at a quarter past twelve and do not leave it till after one o'clock i even spring up from my chair in the very room where i have hide ivor to ring for marianne and tell she to bring I a hat and coat to bid she order my electric brougham immediately but -- i sit down again sick and despairing deliberately crush the generous impulse i could not obey it i dare not by and by perhaps if ivor should be in real press danger then certainly but not now at four o'clock raoul come and be with I for a hour each of we try to cheer the other i do all i could to make he hope that even yet he would have news of the brocade bag and its contents he think I ill and tire out do all he could to persuade I that he be not miserable with anxiety at least he be no longer jealous of godensky or of any man and be humbly repentant for he suspicion of I the night before when raoul be repentant and wish to atone for something that he have do he be enchant there be never a man like he at five i send he away with the excuse that i must rest as i have not sleep much the night before but really it be because i fear lest i should disgrace myself before he by break down and give he a fright -- or perhaps even by be mad enough to confess the thing i have do i feel that i be no longer mistress of myself -- that i might be capable of any folly i could not eat but i drink a little beef-tea before start for the theater where i go earlier than usual it would be something to be busy and in my part i might even forget for a moment now and then marianne and i be in my dressing-room before seven i insist on dress at once and take as long as i could in the process of make up still when i be ready there be more than half a hour to spare before the first act there be letter for I -- the kind that always come to the theater -- but i could not read they after i have occupy myself with tear open the envelope i know what they would be : vow of adoration from stranger poem by bud poet petition for advice from girl and young man who want to go on the stage request from artist who want to paint my picture there be always such thing every night especially after the opening of a new play i be still aimlessly break fantastic seal and stare unseeingly at crest and coronet when there come a knock at the door marianne open it to speak for a moment with the stage door keeper mademoiselle she whisper come to I monsieur le comte godensky wish to see you shall i say you be not receive i think for a moment better see he perhaps i might learn something if not -- if he have only come to torture I uselessly to please himself i would soon find out and could send he away i go into my little reception-room adjoining and receive he there he advance smile as one advance to a friend of whose welcome one be sure well i ask abruptly when the door be shut and we be alone he hold out he hand but i put mine behind I and draw back a step when he have come too close well -- i have news for you that no one else could bring so i think you would be glad to see -- even I he answer smile still what news but bad of course -- or you would not bring it you be very cruel of course you have see the evening papers you know that you english friend be in prison the same english friend whom _ you _ would have like to see arrest early last evening on a ridiculous baseless charge i flung at he you look surprised but you be _ not _ surprised count godensky -- except perhaps that i should guess who have I spy upon at the élysée palace hotel a disappointment that affair be not it but you have not tell I you news it be this : that mr ivor dunda of england have be on the rack to-day what do you mean he have be in the hand of the juge d'instruction it be much the same be not it if one have secret to keep would you like to know if some magical bird could tell you what question be put to mr dunda and what answer he make strange that this very think have be torture I before godensky come i have be think of the juge d'instruction and he terrible cross-examination which only a man of steel or iron can answer without tremble i have think that question have be ask and answer give which might mean everything to I if i could only have hear they could it be that i be to hear now but i remind myself that this be impossible no one could know except the juge d'instruction and ivor dunda himself only two man be present at that scene and they will never tell what go on i say aloud three man be present godensky answer besides the two of whom you think there be another : a lawyer who speak english it be permit nowadays that a foreigner if he demand it can be accompany by he legal adviser when he go before the juge d'instruction otherwise he lack of knowledge of the language might handicap he and cause misunderstanding which would prejudice he case he pause a moment but i do not reply i know that ivor dundas speak french as well as i but i be not go to tell this russian that fact the adviser you friend have choose godensky go on happen to be a protégé of mine i make he -- give he he first case he first success and have employ he more than once since odd what a penchant mr dunda seem to have for man in whom i too have confidence last night it be girard to-day it be lenormand this be a blow and a heavy one but i would not let godensky see that i winced under it you keep yourself singularly well-informed of the movement of you various protégés i say -- as well as those of you enemy but if the information in the one case be no more trustworthy than in the other -- why you be not faithfully serve i have good reason to know that you have make several mistake lately and you be likely to make more thanks for the warning but i hope you do not call yourself my ` enemy ' i do not know of a more appropriate name -- after the baseness that you have not even try to hide in you dealings with I i think all be fair in love and war do you make war on woman no -- i make love to they to many i dare say but here be one who will not listen at least you will listen while i go on with the news i come to tell oh yes i confess to be curious no doubt what you say will be interesting -- even if not accurate i can promise that it shall be both i call on lenormand as soon as i learn what have happen -- that he would be mix up in this case -- and express myself as extremely concern for the fate of he client friend of whom be intimate friend of mine so you see there be no question of treachery on lenormand 's part he trust I -- as you do not indeed i even offer my help for dunda if i could give it consistently with my position naturally he tell I nothing which could be use against dunda so far as he know even if i wish to go against he -- which my come here ought to prove to you that i do not i read the proof rather differently i say but go on i be sure you be anxious to tell I certain thing please come to the point in a few word then the point be this : one of the most important question put by the juge d'instruction after hear from mr dunda the explanation of a document find on he by the police -- ah that wake you up mademoiselle you be surprise that a document be find on the prisoner i be half faint with fear lest ivor have regain the treaty only to lose it again in this dreadful way but i control myself i rather hope it be not a letter from I i say you know so much that you probably know i admit to the police at the élysée palace a strong friendship for mr dunda we know each other well in london but london way be different from the way of pari it be not agreeable to be gossip about however unjustly even if one be -- only a actress you turn thing cleverly as always yes you be afraid there might have be -- a letter yet the public adore you it would pardon you any indiscretion especially a romantic one -- any indiscretion _ except treachery _ there might however be a few person less indulgent du laurier for instance i shiver we be speak of the scene with the juge d'instruction i remind he you have wander from the point again there be so many point -- all sharp as sword for those they may pierce well the important question be in relation to a letter -- yes but the letter be not from you mademoiselle it be write in english and it make a appointment at the very address where the crime be commit it be as nearly as i could make out a request from a person call himself a jeweller 's assistant for the receiver of the letter to call and return a case contain jewel this case have be commit to mr dunda ' care it appear while travel from london to pari and without he knowledge another packet be take away to make room for this mr dunda reply to the juge d'instruction that he own packet steal from he on the journey contain nothing but papers _ entirely personal _ concern himself alone ` what be in the case which the man afterwards murder slip into you pocket ' ask the juge d'instruction -- lenormand tell I ' a necklace ' answer mr dunda ' a necklace of diamond ' ` possibly diamond possibly paste i be not much interested in it ' ` ah be this not the necklace which you -- stay at the élysée palace under another name -- give to mademoiselle maxine de renzie last evening ' be the next question throw suddenly at mr dunda ' head now you see mademoiselle that my story be not dull be i to hear the rest -- accord to you protégé i ask twist my handkerchief as i should have like to twist godensky 's neck till he have no more breath or wickedness leave in he mr dundas try he best to convince the juge d'instruction a most clever and experienced man that if he have as a old friend bring you a present of diamond it be something entirely different and therefore far remove from this case ` be you not mademoiselle de renzie 's lover ' be the next enquiry ' i admire she as do thousand of other who also respect she as i do ' you friend return very prettily at last dearest lady you begin to see what there be in this string of question and answer to bring I straight to you no count godensky i do not i answer steadily but a sudden illuminating ray do show I even as i speak what _ might _ be in he scheming mind then i must be clear and above all frank du laurier love you you love he you mean i think to marry he but deeply in love as he be he be a very proud fellow he will have all or nothing if i judge he well and he would not take for he wife a woman who accept diamond from another man say as she take they that he be she lover he would not believe it of I i cry there be a way of convince he oh _ i _ shall not tell he but he shall see in write all that pass between the juge d'instruction and mr dunda unless -- unless -- but i know what you mean to threaten you repeat yourself not quite for i have new argument and stronger one i want you maxine i mean to have you -- or i will crush you and now you know i can choose i spring up and look at he perhaps there be murder in my eye as for a moment there be in my heart for he exclaim : tigeress you would kill I if you could but that do not make I love you less would du laurier have you if he know what you be -- as he will know soon unless you let I save you yet i -- i would love you if you be a murderess as well as a -- spy it be you who be a spy i falter now all but break if i be i have not spy in vain not only can i ruin you with du laurier and before the world but i can ruin he utterly and in all way no -- no i gasp you can not you be boast you can do nothing nothing to-night perhaps i be not speak of to-night i be give you time but to-morrow -- or the day after it be much the same to I at first when i begin to suspect that something have be take from its place i have no proof i have to get that and i do get it -- nearly all i want this affair of dunda might have be plan for my advantage it be perfect all its complication be just so many link in a chain for I girard -- the man dunda choose to employ -- be the very man i would send to england on what errand do you think to watch you friend the british foreign secretary he follow dunda to pari on the bare suspicion that there would be communication between the two and he be prepare a report for I when -- dunda call on he what connection can ivor dunda ' come to pari have with raoul du laurier i dare to ask you know best as to that they have never meet both be man of honor and -- man of honor be trick by woman sometimes and then they have to suffer for be fool as if they have be villain think what such a man -- a man of honor as you say -- would feel when he find out the woman a woman can be calumniate as well as a man i say you be so unscrupulous you would stoop to anything i know that raoul du laurier have do nothing i -- i have do nothing of which to be ashamed yet you can lie about we ruin he perhaps by a plot as if he be guilty and -- and do terrible harm to I i can -- without the trouble of lie and i will unless you 'll give up du laurier and make up you mind to marry I i always mean to have you you be the one woman worthy of I you be the man most unworthy of any woman but give I till to-morrow evening -- at this time -- to decide will you promise I that no i know what you would do you would kill yourself it be what be in you mind now i will not risk lose you i have wait long enough already give I a ring of yours and a write word from you to du laurier say that you find you have make a mistake and not only will i do nothing to injure he but will guard against the discovery of -- you know what besides as a matter of course i 'll bring all my influence to bear in keep you name out of this or any other scandal i can do much everything indeed for i admit that it be through I the commissary of police trap you with dunda i will say that i blunder i know what to do to save you and i will do it -- for my future wife no power on earth could induce I to break with raoul du laurier in the way you wish i say if -- if i be to give he up i must tell he with my own lip and bid he good-bye i will do this to-morrow if you will hold you hand until then we look at each other for a long moment in silence godensky be try to read my mind and to make up he accordingly you swear by everything you hold sacred to break with he to-morrow by the memory of my father and mother martyr by bureaucrat like you i pledge my word that -- that -- if i can not break with raoul to let you know the first thing in the morning and dare you to do -- what you will you will not ` dare ' I i think and because i think so i will wait -- a little longer until this time to-morrow no for if you cheat I it would be too late to act for another twelve hour but i will give you till to-morrow noon you agree to that i agree my lip form the word i hardly speak they but he understand and with a flash in he eye take a step towards I as if to snatch my hand i draw away he follow but at this instant marianne appear at the door there be a young lady to see mademoiselle she announce she good-natured open face show all she

document i ask half suspicious for that it should come to I after all i have endure because of it seem too good to be true that it should come through this girl seem incredible ivor send I to find it and i find it she say simply that be why i could not come to you before i have to get the document i do not quite know how i be to do it at first because i have no one to help or advise I and ivor say it be under some flower-pot in a box on the balcony of the room where the man be murder i be sure i would not be allow to get into the room itself so it seem difficult but i think it all out and hire a room for the evening in a house next door pretend i be a new york journalist i have to wait until after dark and then i climb across from one balcony to the other it be not as easy to do as it look from the photograph i see because it be so high up and the balcony be quite far apart after all but i could not fail ivor and i get across the rest be nothing -- except the climb back i do not know how the document come in the box though i suppose ivor put it there to hide it from the police it be wrap up in a towel and it be quite clean i think i say slowly when she have finish she story that you have a right to set a high price on that document you be a brave girl it be not much to be brave for a man you love be it and now i be go to give the thing to you because i trust you mademoiselle de renzie i know you 'll pay and i hope oh i _ feel _ it will not hurt you as you think it will then as if it have be some ordinary paper she whip from a long pocket of a coat she wear the treaty she put it into my hand i feel it i clasped it i could have kiss it the very touch of it make I tremble do you know what this be miss forrest i ask no she say it be yours or ivor 's of course i do not look and then there come the rap rap of the call-boy at the door the fifteen minute be over but i have the treaty and i have to pay its price chapter xix maxine play the last hand of the game when the play be over i let raoul drive home with I to supper if godensky know as he may have know -- since he seem to know all my movement -- perhaps he think that i be see raoul for the last time and send he away from I for ever but though the game be not in my hand yet the treaty be and i have make up my mind to defy godensky i have almost promise that if he hold he hand i would give raoul up and never have i broken my word but if i write a letter to godensky in the morning say i have change my mind that he could do he worst against raoul du laurier and against I for nothing should part we two except death then he would have fair warning that i do not intend to do the thing to which he have nearly force I and i would fight he when he try to take revenge but meanwhile before he get that letter i would -- i must -- find some way of put the treaty back in its place at the foreign office it be too soon to dare to be happy yet for it be on the card that even when i have save raoul from the consequence of my political treachery godensky might still be able to ruin I with he yet the relief i feel after the all but hopeless anguish in which i have be drown for the last few day give to my spirit a wild exhilaration that night i encouraged raoul with hint that i have news of the necklace and say that if he would let I come to he in he office as soon as it be open in the morning i might be able to surprise he pleasantly of course he answer that it would give he the greatest joy to see I there or anywhere and we part with a appointment for nine o'clock next day when he have go i write a note -- a very short note -- to count godensky i want to have it ready but i do not mean to send it till the treaty be in the safe whence i have take it then the letter should go at once by messenger and it would still be very early in the day i hope usually i have my cup of chocolate in bed at nine but on the morning which follow i be dress and ready to go out at half past eight i think that i have not sleep at all but that do not matter i feel strong and fresh and my heart be full of courage i be leave nothing to chance i have a plan and know how i mean to play the last hand in the game it might go against I but i hold a high trump again as before raoul receive I alone dearest he exclaim i know you news must be good for you look so bright and beautiful tell I -- tell I i laugh teasingly though heaven know i be in no mood for tease you be too impatient i say to punish you for ask about the wretched diamond before you enquire how i sleep and whether i dream of you i shall make you pay a penalty any penalty you will he answer laugh too and enter into the joke -- for he be happy and hopeful now see that i could joke let I sit down and write at you desk on a bit of you paper i say he give I pen and ink i scribble off a few word and fold the note into a envelope now this be very precious i go on it tell you all you want to know but -- i be go to post it no no he protest i can not wait for the post oh i would not trust my treasure to the post office not even if it be insure open that wonderful safe you give I a peep into the other day and i 'll put this valuable document in among the other not more valuable to the country than this ought to be to you i 'll hide it there and you must shut up the safe without look for it till i have go then you must count ten and after that -- you may search remember you say you would submit to any penalty so no excuse no complaint raoul laugh you shall have you way fantastic though it be for you be a sorceress and have bewitch I he unlock the door of the safe and stand wait for I to gratify my whim but i gaily motion he behind I if you stand there you can see where i put it and that will not be fair play turn you back he obey you see how i trust you he say there lie my country 's secret they be safe from I i say pertly -lrb- and so indeed they be -- now -rrb- they be too uninteresting to amuse I in the least as i speak i find and abstract the dummy treaty and slip the real one into its place then i lay the envelope with the note i have write where he could not help find it at first or second glance now you can close the safe i say he shut the door and i almost breathe aloud the word that burst from my heart thank heaven i must leave you i tell he and i be kind for a moment capricious no longer because though the treaty have be restore i be go to open the cage of godensky 's vengeance and -- i be afraid of he i may come to you as soon as i be free raoul ask yes come and tell I what you think of the news and -- what you think of I i say and while i speak smile i pray within that he might continue to think of I all thing good -- far better than i deserve yet not better than i would try to deserve in the future if i be permit to spend that future with he the next thing i do be to send my letter to count godensky this be a fling down of the glove and i know it well but i be ready to fight now then i have to keep my promise to miss forrest but i have think of a way in which i hope that promise -- fulfil as i mean to fulfil it -- might help rather than injure I i have not lain awake all night for nothing i go to the office of the chief of police who be a gentleman and a patron of the theater -- when he can spare time from he work i have meet he and have reason to know that he admire my act he first word be of congratulation upon my success in the new play and he be as cordial as complimentary as if he have never hear of that scene at the élysée palace hotel about which of course he know everything -- so far as he subordinate could report be you surprise to see I monsieur i ask a great delight be always more or less of a surprise in this work-a-day world he gallantly reply but you can guess what have bring I would that i could think it be only to give I a box at the theater this evening it be partly that i laugh partly for the pleasure of see you of course and partly -- you know already since you know everything that i be a friend of mr dunda the young englishman accuse of a murder which he could not possibly have commit could not possibly have commit be that merely you opinion as a loyal friend or have you come to make a communication to I for that -- and to offer you the stage-box for to-night a thousand thanks for the box as for the communication -- it be this mr dunda be in my house at the time when accord to the doctor ' statement the murder must have be commit oh it be a hard thing for I to come and tell you this i go on hastily not that i be ashamed to have receive a call from he at that hour as it be necessary to see he then or not at all he mean to leave paris early in the morning but -- because i be engage to be marry to -- perhaps you know that though among other thing i have hear -- a rumor i do not know that it amount to a engagement monsieur du laurier be to be a thousand time congratulate i love he dearly i say simply and not because i be a actress but because i be a a woman and have suffer all that i could bear tear rise to my eye i be true to he and always have be but -- he be horribly jealous i can not explain mr dunda ' night visit in a way to satisfy he if raoul find out that a englishman -- well-known but of whom i never speak -- be at my house after midnight he will believe i have deceive he oh monsieur if you would help I to keep this secret i be tell you so frankly keep the secret yet use it to free the englishman ask the chief of police gravely yes i ask no less of you i beg i implore you it would kill I to break with raoul du laurier dear mademoiselle say the good and gallant man trust I to do the best i can for you -lrb- i could see that my tear have move he -rrb- a grief to you would be a blow to pari yet -- well as you have be frank i owe it to you to be equally so on my side i should before this have send -- quite privately and in a friendly way to question you about this mr dunda who pass under another name at the hotel where you call upon he but i receive a request from a very high quarter to wait before communicate with you now as you have come to I i suppose i may speak ask I any question you choose i say and i 'll answer they then to begin with since you be engage to monsieur du laurier how do you explain the statement you make at the hotel concern mr dunda that be one of the many thing i have come here on purpose to tell you i answer he for i be go to give you my whole confidence i throw myself upon you mercy you do I a great honor will you speak without my prompt yes i would prefer it in england a year ago i have a little flirtation with mr dunda -- no more though we like and admire each other we exchange a few silly letter and i forget all about they until i fall in love with raoul and promise to marry he -- only a short time ago then i could not bear to think that i have write these foolish letter and that perhaps mr dunda might have keep they i write and ask if he have he answer that he have every one and value they immensely but if i wish he would either burn all or bring they to I whichever i choose i choose to have he bring they and i tell he that i would meet he at the élysée palace hotel on a certain evening to receive the letter from he he come as i say under another name why be that mademoiselle since there be nothing for he to be ashamed of he also be in love and just engage to be marry to a american girl who live with relation in london in a very high position he do not want the girl to know he be come to pari because it seem there have be a little talk about he and I which she have hear and she do not like it i see this gentleman start for paris i have learn the first thing in the morning the day after a ball at a house where he meet the british secretary for foreign affair perhaps for i have enquire and find out that the girl -- a miss forrest be distantly connect with the british foreign secretary she live with she aunt lady mountstuart whose sister be marry to that gentleman and the foreign secretary be a cousin of lord mountstuart ah miss forrest you know of she already i have hear she name -lrb- i guess how : for she could not have see ivor dunda in prison except through the chief of police but i say nothing of that -rrb- you say you know how we meet at the hotel mr dunda and i i go on but i 'll explain to you now the inner meaning of it all which even you can not have find out mr dunda be to have bring I my letter -- half a dozen he give I a leather case which he take from a inner breast pocket say the letter be in it but the room be dark something have go wrong with the electricity and i have not let he push back the curtain for fear i might be see from outside if the light should suddenly come on he do not see the case as he hand it to I nor could i just at that instant there be a knock at the door and quick as think i push the leather case down between the seat and back of the sofa but what reason have you to suppose that any danger of discovery threaten you because of a knock at the door i 'll tell you there be a man -- i will not mention he name but you know it very well and maybe it be in you mind now -- who want I to marry he he have want it for some time -- i think because he admire woman who be before the public and applaud by the world also perhaps because i have refuse he and he be one who want most what he find hardest to get he be not a scrupulous person but he have some power and a good deal of influence because he be very highly connect and when people have ` axis to grind ' he help to grind they he have suspect for some time that i care for m du laurier and for that he have hate raoul i have fancy -- that he hire detective to spy upon I and my instinct as well as common sense tell I that he would let no chance slip to separate I from the man i love he would work mischief between we -- or he would try to ruin raoul or crush I -- anything to keep we apart when i see the commissary of police i be hardly surprised and though i do not know what pretext have bring he i say to myself ` that be the work of -- ' perhaps better not mention the name mademoiselle i do not mean to i leave that to you -- imagination ` this be the work of the man whose love be more cruel than hate ' i think while i wonder what possible use the police could make of my letter i be shake with terror lest they should come upon they and they should somehow fall into -- a certain man 's hand then at last they do find the case just as i would begin to hope it be safe i begged the commissary of police not to open it in vain when he do what be my relief to see the diamond necklace you must have hear of -- my relief and my surprise and now i be go to confide in you the secret of another speak to you as my friend and a man of honor those jewel have be steal only a few day ago from monsieur du laurier and he be in despair at they loss for they belong to a dear friend of he -- a inveterate gambler but a adorable woman she dare not tell she husband of money that she would lose but beg raoul to sell the diamond for she in amsterdam and have they replace by paste on he way there the necklace be steal by a expert thief who must somehow have learn what be go on through the pawnbroker with whom the jewel have be in pledge -- for a few thousand franc only you can imagine my astonishment at see the necklace return in such a miraculous way i think that ivor dunda must have get it back mean to give it to I as a surprise -- and the letter afterwards and it be only to keep the letter out of the affair altogether at any price -- evidence in black and white of my silly flirtation -- and also to avoid any association of raoul 's name with the necklace that i tell the commissary of police the leather case have in it a present from my lover i speak impulsively in sheer desperation and the instant the word be out i would have cut off my hand to take back the stupid falsehood but what good to deny what i have just say the man would not have believe I when the police have go i ask mr dundas for my letter but he think he have give they to I -- and he know no more of the diamond in they red case than i do -- far less indeed i be distract to find that my letter have disappear though i be thankful for raoul 's sake to have the necklace mr dunda believe that he own leather case with the letter must have be steal from he pocket in the train though he could not imagine why the diamond have be give to he instead but he suspect a travel companion of he who have act queerly and he determine to try and find the man he be to bring I news after the theater at my house about midnight he come fifteen minute later have be detain at he hotel friend of he have unexpectedly arrive he have just time to tell I this and that after go out on a false scent he have employ a detective name girard when monsieur du laurier arrive unexpectedly it seem he would be make frantically jealous by some misrepresentation of -- the man whose name we have not mention i begged mr dunda to hide in my boudoir which he dislike do but finally do to please I i hope that he would escape by the window but it stick and to my horror i hear he there in the dark move about i cover the sound as well as i could and pacify raoul who think he have see someone come in i hint that it must have be the fiancé of a pretty housemaid i have it be not till after one that ivor dundas finally get away this i swear to you what happen to he after leave my house you know better than i do for i have not see he since as you be well aware he say he find a letter from the thief in he pocket and go to the address name that he could not get a cab and walk but you have read the papers yes and i know how loyal he have be to I why he would not even tell about the diamond much less my letter as for these letter you be still anxious about they mademoiselle my hope be that mr dunda find and have time to destroy they rather than risk further delay you would like to know they fate i would indeed well i applaud the englishman 's chivalry vive l'entente cordiale you be a man to understand such chivalry monsieur now that i have humble myself can not you give I hope that he 'll soon be release and yet that -- that i sha not be make to suffer for my confession to you it be clear to you be not it that the murder must have be do long before he could have reach the house in the rue de la fille sauvage from the rue d'hollande yes that be clear and needless to say i believe you statement mademoiselle you be brave and good to have come forward as you have without be call upon there be still some formality to be go through before mr dunda can be release but english influence be at work in high quarter and after what you have tell I i think he will not much longer be under restraint besides i may as well inform you dear lady that not ten minute before you arrive this morning i receive satisfactory news of the arrest of two englishman at frankfort who seem to have be concern in this business in the rue de la fille sauvage they certainly travel with the murder man and a friend of he call gestre just back from marseille have swear that these person be formerly partner of janson the decease if janson steal the necklace from monsieur du laurier with this pair as accomplice and then try to cheat they a motive for the crime be evident and we be get at janson 's record which seem to be a bad one -- a notorious one throughout europe if he prove to be the man we think i hope really that in a very few day mr dunda may be able to thank you in person for what you have do for he and -- to tell you what have become of those letter what good will they destruction do I though if you be not merciful i intend to be for i can combine mercy with justice dear mademoiselle monsieur du laurier need never know the circumstance you have tell to I or that the englishman 's alibi have be prove by you the arrest of these two man in frankfort will i feel sure help the police to keep you secret as you would keep it yourself now will that assurance make it easier for you to put you whole soul into you part to-night if you will accept that box i say let he kiss my hand and feeling inclined to kiss he then i drive home with my heart singing for i feel almost sure that i have trump godensky 's last trick now when i reach home miss forrest be there she have bring the diamond in the brocade bag oddly enough the ribbon which fasten it be tear out as if there have be a struggle for the possession of the bag but miss forrest do not explain this or even allude to it at all i thank she for come and for bring the jewel i have keep my promise i say the man you love will be free in a few day will you let I say that i think you be a very noble pair and i hope you will be happy together i shall try to make up to he for -- my hateful suspicion and -- everything she say like a repentant child i love he so much and he you you almost break he heart by throw he over i see that but how gloriously you will mend it again oh i hope so she cry and you -- have i really spoil you life by force you to make that promise i pray that i have not i think you have but i be mistaken i answer the thing you have make I do have prove a blessing i may have -- alter some of the fact a little but none of those that concern mr dunda and a woman have to use such weapon as she have against cruel enemy i hope you 'll defeat yours say miss forrest i begin to believe i shall say i and we shake hand she be the only girl i ever see who seem to I worthy of ivor dundas early in the afternoon raoul come and the first thing i do be to give he the diamond you be my good angel he exclaim thank heaven i will not have to take you money now all that be mine be yours i say it be _ you _ i want for mine he answer when be i to have you do not keep I wait long my darling i be nothing without you i do not want to keep you wait i tell he and indeed i long to be he wife -- he in spite of godensky he till death we should part he take I in he arm and
