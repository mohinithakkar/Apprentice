introduction there never be a time when the demand for book for young people be so great as it be to-day or when so much be be do to meet the demand child 's counter boy ' book be sign which especially at the christmas season attract the eye in every large book shop tale of adventure manual about various branch of nature study historical romance life of hero -- in fact almost every kind of book -- be to be find in abundance beautifully illustrate attractively bind well print all design and write especially for the youth of we land it be indeed a encouraging sign it mean that the child of to-day be be introduce to the world 's best in literature and science and history and art in simple and gradual way in the middle age story of the martyr and legend of the church along with some simple form of catechetical instruction form the basis of a child 's mental and religious training later during and after the crusade the story of war and the mystery of the east increase the stock in trade for the home of europe but still the horizon remain a narrow one even the invention of printing do not bring to the young as many direct advantage as would naturally be expect to-day when christian missionary set up a printing press in some distant island of the sea the first book which they print in the vernacular be almost invariably those part of the bible such as the gospel and the story of genesis which most appeal to the young and what be of special importance they have the young directly and mainly in mind in they publishing work this be not true a few century ago the press be perhaps naturally and inevitably almost exclusively occupy with book for the learn world to be sure the legenda aurea of which i shall speak later although not intend primarily for child prove a great boon to they so do the chap book of england but it be not until the middle of the eighteenth century when john newbery set up he book shop at st paul 's churchyard london that any special attention be give by printer to the publication in attractive form of juvenile book newbery 's child 's book make he famous in he day but the world seem to have forget he yet he deserve a monument along with æsop and la fontaine and kate greenaway and andersen and scott and henty and all the other greater and lesser light who have do so much to gladden the heart and enlarge the mind of childhood and youth but from newbery 's day to this year of we lord nineteen hundred and three be a very long jump in what we may call the evolution of juvenile literature for the preparation of read matter for young people seem now almost to have reach its climax there be one field however and that the one which this volume try to cover which strangely enough seem to have be almost neglect of goody-goody Sunday school library book of a old-fashioned type which be insipid and lack both in virility of thought and literary form there be alas already too many what we need be something to take they place something which will furnish real literature and yet which from subject matter and manner of handling be specially adapt to what i still like to call Sunday read a phrase which unfortunately seem to mean little to most people to-day bear this in mind it be the purpose of this book to gather together in attractive form such religious classic as be specially fit to interest and uplift young people there be a wide variety in so far as _ subject matter _ _ source _ and _ form _ be concerned but a certain unity be give to the contents of the volume by the religious note which whether bring prominently forward or not be find alike in all the selection the bible have furnish directly or indirectly most of the _ subject matter _ here use the biography of various scripture character appear in large number adam and noah head the list and peter and paul bring up the end of a procession of worthy whose heroic deed as the servant of jehovah will always appeal to the imagination of youthful mind but it be not with bible character only that this book deal the life of christian saint who enter upon they inheritance such as christopher and sylvester and franci of assisus also have they place while yet more prominent be story and poem base on some bible incident even selection such as hawthorne 's great stone face or wordsworth 's ode to duty have they root deep in the bible for they can be understand and explain only by those who know the revelation it contain in so far then as the subject matter of the volume be concern either it or its inspiration can always be trace back to the bible when we turn from the bible material which as we have see supplies both subject and inspiration to the _ source _ from which the selection in they literary form as here give be derive we find that the old foundation have suffice for many kind of structure probably the source from which the editor have draw most largely be the golden legend this work which be translate into english and print by caxton in 1483 although little hear of now be for several century a household word in christendom it be the creation of a genoese archbishop jacobus de voragine and date from about the middle of the thirteenth century the good archbishop use the bible and the life of the saint as a basis and as a sharer of the superstition of the time have unbounded faith in every legend of the church put together in simple form for the edification of he flock the various story about jewish and christian worthy which compose the original legenda aurea this be translate into french by one jean de vignay in the fourteenth century and the english version be in turn mainly make from this translation in the simple sturdy language of caxton the book become a most popular one be often read aloud in the parish church of england where it help to familiarize the people especially the young with sacred story as represent by the hero of the old testament and the saint of the church in caxton 's introduction there be a quaint sentence regard the name of the book after mention the latin title he add that be to say in englyshe the golden legende for lyke as passeth golde in vallwe al other metally soo thy legende exedeth all other boke whether the good printer 's judgment be justified or no it be not for we to say it be true however that after the passing of over six century since its original production the editor of this volume in look for religious classic for young people have make more use of it than of any other collection all honor then to the old archbishop of genoa and to william caxton who make he work accessible to the youth of england the only other work which deserve any special mention as a source for the contents of this volume be the story and tale of han christian andersen if ever there be any one who deserve the title of the child 's friend surely this son of a poor danish shoemaker be the man he tale have be translate into many language and because of they true imagination and they simplicity of expression they have appeal to all child ten or more of they appear in this volume they be charming and wholesome reading and they continue popularity make we realize the truth of these closing line in andersen 's the old grave stone : the good and the beautiful perish never they live eternally in tale and song the other source from which this collection have be make up be so varied as to require no mention aside from that give with each title the master poet of english literature have be freely draw upon : byron to tell of the destruction of sennacherib milton to sing of christ 's nativity wordsworth to meditate aloud on duty and other great writer to emphasize various deep truth of life \* \* \* \* \* as we turn from subject matter and source to _ form _ we again find great variety almost every kind of literature be represent the early lengend of the jewish people tell by the author of the legenda aurea almost in the word of scripture bring to young and old alike the same lesson about god and duty the fact that they be legend rather than exact history do not in any way lessen they religious value then too the book contain allegory such as that of the pilgrim 's progress christendom 's greatest religious classic next to the bible itself and those of some of andersen 's tale poetry also be well represent the selection be in large part suggest by scripture there be in addition many story in the ordinary sense of the word -- tale which be entirely the fabric of the imagination but which like the selection from hawthorne have some great lesson to teach in fact the literary form represent in this volume be almost as numerous as those of the bible itself the latter use to be look upon merely as a storehouse of historic fact and devotional song now we see in it legend oratory poetry allegory history proverb and prophecy and we find that all of these form be use by god 's servant to teach he truth to man \* \* \* \* \* sufficient have be say i think to show the purpose and scope of this volume and to introduce the reader to its contents it be my hope and belief that the effort of my friend mr philip p well to make this a collection of religious classic in the full meaning of these word may prove successful my highest wish however be that those who read these selection with they great variety of source and form may mark the inspiration of thought or incident common to they all and may find a interest in refresh what may be a old acquaintance with that book of book which give with classic truth the fundamental subject matter for all deep thought and high aspiration anson phelp stoke jr contents the life of adam here beginneth the history of noah the rainbow here followeth

the water and god say : be make light and anon light be make and god see that light be good and divide the light from darkness and call the light day and darkness night and thus be make light with heaven and earth first and even and morning be make one day the second day he make the firmament and divide the water that be under the firmament from they that be above and call the firmament heaven the third day be make on the earth herb and fruit in they kind the fourth day god make the sun and moon and star etc the fifth day he make the fish in the water and bird in the air the sixth day god make the beast on the earth every one in he kind and gender and god see that all these work be good and say : make we man unto we similitude and image here speak the father to the son and holy ghost or else as it be the common voice of three person when it be say make we and to we in plural number man be make to the image of god in he soul here it be to be note that he make not only the soul with the body but he make both body and soul as to the body he make male and female god give to man the lordship and power upon live beast thus in six day be heaven and earth make and all the ornation of they and then he make the seventh day on which he rest not for that he be weary but cease he operation and show the seventh day which he bless thus he shortly show the generation of heaven and earth for here he determine the work of the six day and the seventh day he sanctify and make holy god have plant in the begin paradise a place of desire and delice and man be make in the field of damascus he be make of the slime of the earth paradise be make the third day of creation and be beset with herb plant and tree and be a place of most mirth and joy in the midst whereof be set two tree that be the tree of life and that other the tree of know good and evil and there be a well which casteth out water for to water the tree and herb of paradise this well be the mother of all water which well be divide into four part one part be call phison this goeth about inde the second be call gijon otherwise nilus and that runneth about ethiopium the other two be call tigri and euphrate tigris runneth toward assyrium and euphrate be call fruitful which runneth in chaldea these four flood come and spring out of the same well and depart and yet in some place some of they meet again then god take man from the place of he creation and bring he into paradise for to work there not to labor needily but in delighting and recreate he and that he should keep paradise for like as paradise should refresh he so should he labor to serve god and there god give he a commandment every commandment standeth in two thing in do or forbid in do he command he to eat of all the tree of paradise in forbid he command that he should not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil this commandment be give to the man and by the man it go to the woman for when the woman be make it be command to they both and hereto he set a pain say : whatsoever day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die by death god say : it be not good a man to be alone make we to he a helper like to himself for to bring forth child adam suppose that some helper to he have be among the beast which have be like to he therefore god bring to adam all live beast of the earth and air in which he understand they of the water also which with one commandment all come tofore he they be bring for two cause one be because man should give to each of they a name by which they should know that he should dominate over they and the second cause be because adam should know that there be none of they like to he and he name they in the hebrew tongue which be only the language and none other at the beginning and so none be find like unto he god send in adam a lust to sleep which be no dream but as be suppose in a extasy or in a trance in which be show to he the celestial court wherefore when he awake he prophesy of the conjunction of christ to he church and of the flood that be to come and of the doom and destruction of the world by fire he know which afterward he tell to he child while that adam sleep god take one of he rib both flesh and bone and make that a woman and set she tofore adam which then say : this be now a bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh and adam give she a name like as she lord and say she should be call virago which be as much as to say as make of a man and be a name take of a man and anon the name give he prophesy say : because she be take of the side of a man therefore a man shall forsake and leave father and mother and abide and be adherent unto he wife and they shall be two in one flesh and though they be two person yet in matrimony and wedlock they be but one flesh and in other thing twain for why neither of they have power of he own flesh they be both naked and be not ashamed for they stand both in the state of innocence then the serpent which be hotter than any beast of the earth and naturally deceivable for he be full of the devil lucifer which be deject and cast out of heaven have great envy to man that be bodily in paradise and know well if he might make he to trespass and break god 's commandment that he should be cast out also yet he be afeard to be take or espy of the man he go to the woman not so prudent and more prone to slide and bow and in the form of the serpent for then the serpent be erect as a man bede saith that he choose a serpent have a maiden 's cheer -lrb- face -rrb- for like oft apply to like and speak by the tongue of the serpent to eve and say : why command you god that ye should not eat of all the tree of paradise this he say to find occasion to say that he be come for then the woman answer and say : ne forte moriamur lest haply we die which she say doubt for lightly she be flexible to every part whereunto anon he answer : nay in no wise ye shall die but god would not that ye should be like he in science and know that when ye eat of this tree ye shall be as god know good and evil he as envious forbid you and anon the woman elate in pride and willing to be like to god accord thereto and believe he the woman see that the tree be fair to look on and clean and sweet of savor take and eat thereof and give unto adam of the same happily desire he by fair word but adam anon agree for when he see the woman not dead he suppose that god have say that they should die to fear they with and then eat of the fruit forbid and anon they sight be open that they see they nakedness and then anon they understand that they have trespass and thus they know that they be naked and they take fig leaf and sew they together for to cover they member in manner of breeches and anon after they hear the voice of we lord god walking and anon they hie he we lord call the man and say : adam where art thou call he in blame he and not as know where he be but as who say : adam see in what misery thou art which answer : i have hide I lord for i be naked we lord say : who tell thee that thou wert naked but that thou hast eat of the tree forbid he then not meekly confess he trespass but lay the fault on he wife and on he as giver of the woman to he and say : the woman that thou gavest to I as a fellow give to I of the tree and i eat thereof and then we lord say to the woman : why didst thou so neither she accuse herself but lay the sin on the serpent and privily she lay the fault on the maker of he the serpent be not demand for he do it not of himself but the devil by he and we lord cursing they begin at the serpent keep a order and congruous number of curse the serpent be the first and sin most for he sin in three thing the woman next and sin less than he but more than the man for she sin in two thing the man sin last and least for he sin but in one the serpent have envy he lie and deceive for these three he have three curse because he have envy at the excellence of man it be say to he : thou shalt go and creep on thy breast because he lie he be punish in he mouth when it be say : thou shalt eat earth all the day of thy life also he take away he voice and put venom in he mouth and because he deceive it be say : i shall put enmity between thee and woman and thy seed and she seed she shall break thy head etc in two thing the woman sin in pride and eat the fruit because she sin in pride he meek she saying : thou shalt be under the power of man and he shall have lordship over thee and he shall put thee to affliction now be she subject to a man by condition and dread which before be but subject by love and because she sin in the fruit she be punish in she fruit when it be say to she : thou shalt bring forth child in sorrow in the pain of sorrow standeth the curse but in bring forth of child be a blessing and so in punish god forgat not to have mercy and because adam sin but only in eating of the fruit therefore he be punish in seek he meat as it be say to he : accursed be the earth in thy work that be to say for thy work of thy sin for which be make that the earth that bring forth good and wholesome fruit plenteously from henceforth shall bring forth but seldom and also none without man 's labor and also sometime weed briar and thorn shall grow and he add : thereto shalt thou eat herb of the earth as who saith thou shalt be like a beast or jument he curse the earth because the trespass be of the fruit of the earth and not of the water he add thereto to he of labor : in the sweat of thy cheer -lrb- face -rrb- thou shalt eat thy bread unto the time thou return again into the earth that be to say till thou die for thou art earth and into earth thou shalt go again then adam wail and sorrow the misery that be to come of he posterity name he wife eve which be to say mother of all live folk then god make to adam and eve two leathern coat of the skin of dead beast to the end that they bare with they the sign of mortality and say : lo adam be make as one of we know good and evil now lest he put he hand and take of the tree of life and live ever as who saith : beware and cast he out lest he take and eat of the tree of life and so he be cast out of paradise and set in the field of damascus where as he be make and take from for to work and labor there and we lord set cherubim to keep paradise of delight with a burning sword and pliant to the end that none should enter there ne come to the tree of life after then that adam be cast out of paradise and set in the world he engender cain the fifteenth year after he be make and he sister calmana but after another fifteen year be abel bear and he sister delbora when adam be a hundred and thirty year of age cain slew abel he brother truth it be after many day cain and abel offer sacrifice and gift unto god it be to be believe that adam teach he son to offer to god they tithe and first fruit cain offer fruit for he be a ploughman and tiller of earth and abel offer milk and the first of the lamb mose saith of the fattest of the flock and god behold the gift of abel for he and he sacrifice be acceptable to we lord and as to cain he sacrifice god behold they not for they be not to he acceptable he offer withy and thorn and as some doctor say fire come from heaven and light the sacrifice of abel and the gift of cain pleased not we lord for the sacrifice would not belight nor burn clear in the light of god whereof cain have great envy unto he brother abel which arise against he and slew he and we lord say to he : where be abel thy brother he answer and say : i wot never be i keeper of my brother then we lord say : what hast thou do the voice of the blood of thy brother crieth to thee from the earth wherefore thou art curse and accurse be the earth that receive the blood of thy brother by he mouth of thy hand when thou shalt work and labor the earth it shall bring forth no fruit but thou shalt be fugitive vagabond and void on the earth this cain deserve well to be curse know the pain of the first trespass of adam yet he add thereto murder and slaughter of he brother then cain dread that beast should devour he or if he go forth he should be slay of the man or if he dwell with they they would slay he for he sin damned himself and in despair say : my wickedness be more than i can deserve to have forgiveness whoso find I shall slay I this he say of dread or else wish as who say would god he would slay I then we lord say : nay not so thou shalt die but not soon for whosoever slayeth cain shall be punish seven sithe more for he should deliver he from dread from labor and misery and add that he should be punish personally sevenfold more this punition shall endure to he in pain unto the seventh lameth whosomever shall slay cain shall loose seven vengeance some hold that he pain endure unto the seventh generation for he commit seven sin he depart not truly he have envy to he brother he work guilefully he slew he brother falsely he deny it he despair and damned he do no penance and after he go into the east fugitive and vagabond cain know he wife which bare enoch and he make a city and name it enoch after the name of he son enoch here it showeth well that this time be many man though they generation be not say whom cain call to he city by whose help he make it whom he induce to theft and robbery he be the first that wall or make city dread they that he hurt for surety he bring he people into the town then enoch gat irad and irad mehujael and he gat methusael and he gat lameth which be the seventh from adam and worst for he bring in first bigamy this lameth take two wife adah and zillum of adah he gat jabal which find first the craft to make fold for shepherd and to change they pasture and ordain flock of sheep and depart the sheep from the goat after the quality the lamb by themselves and the older by themselves and understand the feeding of they after the season of the year the name of he brother be jubal father of singer in the harp and organ not of the instrument for they be find long after but he be the finder of music that be to say of consonant of accord such as shepherd use in they delight and sport and forasmuch as he hear adam prophesy of two judgment by the fire and water that all thing should be destroy thereby and that he craft new find should not perish he do do write it in two pillar or column one of marble another of clay of the earth to the end that one should endure against the water and that other against the fire josephus saith that the pillar of marble be yet in the land of syrium of zillum he beget tubal-cain which find first the craft of smithery and working of iron and make thing for war and sculpture and graving in metal to the pleasure of the eye which he so work tubal tofore say have delight in the sound of he hammer of which he make the consonant and tune of accord in he song noema sister of tubal-cain find first the craft of diverse texture lameth be a shooter and use to shoot at wild beast for none use of the meat of they but only for to have the skin for they clothing and live so long that he be blind and have a child to lead he and on a time by adventure he slew cain for cain be always afeard and hide he among bush and briar and the child that lead lameth have suppose it have be some wild beast and direct lameth to shoot thereat and so ween to shoot at a beast slew cain and when he know that he have slay cain he with he bow slew the child and thus he slew they both to he damnation therefore as the sin of cain be punish seven sithe so be the sin of lameth seventy sithe and seven that be to say seventy-seven soul that come of lameth be perish in the deluge and noah 's flood also he wife do he much sorrow and evil-entreated he and he be wroth say that he suffer that for he double homicide and manslaughter yet nevertheless he fear he by pain say : why will ye slay I he shall be more and sorer punish that slayeth I than he that slew cain josephus say that when abel be slay and cain flee away adam when he be one hundred and thirty year old engender seth like to he similitude and he to the image of god this seth be a good man and he gat eno and eno cainan and cainan beget malaleel and malaleel jare and jare enoch and enoch methuselah and methuselah lamech and lamech noah and like as in the generation of cain the seventh be the worst so in the generation of seth the seventh be the best that be enoch whom god take and bring he into paradise unto the time that he shall come with elia for to convert the heart of the father into the son and adam live after he have beget seth eight hundred year and engendered son and daughter some hold opinion thirty son and thirty daughter and some fifty of that one and fifty of that other we find no certainty of they in the bible but all the day of adam living here in earth amount to the sum of nine hundred and thirty year and in the end of he life when he should die it be say but of none authority that he send seth he son into paradise for to fetch the oil of mercy where he receive certain grain of the fruit of the tree of mercy by a angel and when he come again he find he father adam yet alive and tell he what he have do and then adam laugh first and then die and then he lay the grain or kernel under he father 's tongue and bury he in the vale of hebron and out of he mouth grow three tree of the three grain of which tree the cross that we lord suffer he passion on be make by virtue of which he gat very mercy and be bring out of darkness into very light of heaven to the which he bring we that liveth and reigneth god world without end here beginneth the history of noah _ the first Sunday in sexagesima _ after that adam be dead die eve and be bury by he at the beginning in the first age the people live long adam live nine hundred and thirty year and methuselah live nine hundred and sixty-nine year s jerome saith that he die the same year that the flood be then noah be the tenth from adam in the generation of seth in whom the first age be end the seventy interpreter say that this first age dure two thousand two hundred and forty-four year s jerome saith not fully two thousand and methodius full two thousand etc noah then be a man perfect and righteous and keep god 's commandment and when he be five hundred year old he gat shem ham and japhet this time man begin to multiply on the earth and the child of god that be to say of seth as religious see the daughter of man that be to say of cain and take they to they wife this time be so much sin on the earth wherefore god be displeased and determine in he prescience to destroy man that he have make and say : i shall put man away that i have make and my spirit shall not abide in man for ever for he be flesh as who say i shall not punish man perpetually as i do the devil for man be frail and yet ere i shall destroy he i shall give he space and time of repentance and to amend he if he will the time of repentance shall be one hundred and twenty year then noah righteous and perfect walk with god that be in he law and the earth be corrupt by sin and fill when god see the earth to be corrupt and that every man be corrupt by sin upon the earth he say to noah : the end of all people be come tofore I except they that shall be save and the earth be replenish with they wickedness i shall destroy they with the earth id est -lrb- that be -rrb- with the fertility of the earth make to thee a ark of tree hew polished and square and make there diver place and lime it with clay and pitch within and without that be to wit with glue which be so fervent that the timber may not be loose and thou shalt make it three hundred cubit of length fifty in breadth and thirty of height and make therein diver distinction of place and chamber and of wardrobe and the ark have a door for to enter in and come out and a window be make thereon which that the hebrew say be of crystal this ark be on make from the beginning that god command first to make it one hundred and twenty year in which time noah oft desire the people to leave they sin and how he have speak with god and that he be command to make the ship for god should destroy they for they sin but if they leave it and they mock he and say that he rave and be a fool and give no faith to he say and continue in they sin and wickedness then when the ark be perfectly make god bid he to take into it of all the beast of the earth and also of the fowl of the air of each two male and female that they may live and also of all the meat of the earth that be comestible that they may serve and feed thee and they and noah do all that we lord command he then say we lord to noah : enter thou and all thy household into the ark that be to say thou and thy wife and thy three son and they three wife i have see that thou art rightful in this generation of all beast that be clean thou shalt take seven and of unclean beast but only two and of the bird seven and seven male and female that they may be save on the face of the earth yet after seven day i shall rain upon the earth forty day and forty night and shall destroy all the substance that i make on the earth and noah do all thing that we lord command he he be six hundred year old when the flood begin on the earth and then noah enter in and he son he wife and the wife of he son all into the ark to eschew the water of the flood of all the beast and the fowl and of all that move and have life on earth male and female noah take in to he as we lord have bid and seven day after they be enter the water begin to increase the well of the abysm be break and the cataract of heaven be open that be to say the cloud and it rain on the earth forty day and forty night and the ark be elevate and bear upon the water on height above the mountain and hill for the water be grow higher fifteen cubit above all the mountain that it should purge and wash the filth of the air then be consume all that be on the earth living man woman and beast and bird and all that ever bare life so that nothing abode upon the earth for the water be fifteen cubit above the highest mountain of the earth and when noah be enter he shut the door fast without forth and lime it with glue and so the water abode elevate in height a hundred and fifty day from the day that noah enter in and we lord then remember noah and all they that be in the ark with he and also on the beast and fowl and cease the water and the well and cataract be close and the rain be prohibit and forbid to rain no more the seventh month the twenty-seventh day of the month the ark rest on the hill of armenia the tenth month of the first day of the month the top of the hill appear first after these forty day after the lessing of the water noah open the window and desire sore to have tiding of ceasing of the flood and send out a raven for to have tiding and when he be go he return no more again for peradventure she find some dead carrion of a beast swimming on the water and light thereon to feed she and be leave there after this he send out a dive which fly out and when she could find no place to rest ne set she foot on she return unto noah and he take she in yet then be not the top of the hill bare and seven day after he send she out again which at even return bear a branch of a olive tree burgeon in she mouth and after other seven day he send she again which come no more again then in the year of noah six hundred and one the first day of the month noah open the covering of the ark and see that the earth be dry but he dare not go out but abide the commandment of we lord the second month the twenty-seventh day of the month we lord say to noah : go out of the ark thou and thy wife thy son and the wife of thy son he command they to go conjointly out which disjointly enter and let go out with they all the beast and fowl live and all the reptile every each after he kind and gender to whom we lord say : grow ye and multiply upon the earth then noah issue out and he wife and he son with they wife and all the beast the same day a year after they enter in every one after he gender noah then edify a altar to we lord and take of all the beast that be clean and offer sacrifice unto we lord and we lord smell the sweetness of the sacrifice and say to noah : from henceforth i shall not curse the earth for man for he be prone and ready to fall

they clothes and lade they ass again and return all into the town again then judah enter first with he brethren unto joseph and all they together fall down platte to the ground to whom joseph say : why have ye do thus know not ye that there be no man like to I in the science of knowledge to whom judah answer : what shall we answer to thee my lord or what shall we speak or rightfully desire god have find and remember the iniquity of we thy servant for we be all thy servant yea we and he at whom the cup be find joseph answer : god forbid that i should so do whosoever steal the cup shall be my servant and go ye you way for ye shall be free and go to you father then judah approach near he and speak with a hardy cheer to he and say : i beseech thee my lord to hear I thy servant that i may say to thine audience a word and that thou wilt not be wroth to thy servant thou art next to pharaoh my lord thou demandedst first of we thy servant : have ye a father or brother and we answer to thee my lord : we father be a old man and we have a brother a young child which be bear to he in he old age whose brother of the same mother be dead and he be a only son whom the father loveth tenderly thou saidst to we thy servant : bring he hither to I that i may see we tell to thee my lord for truth : we father may not forego the child if he forego he certainly he shall die and thou saidst to we thy servant : but if ye bring he not with you ye shall no more see my visage then when we come to we father and tell he all these thing and we father bid we to return and buy more corn to whom we say : we may not go thither but if we youngest brother go with we for if he be absent we dare not approach ne come to the presence of the man and he answer to we : ye know well that my wife bring to I forth but two son that one go out and ye say that wild beast have devour he and yet i hear never of he ne he appear not if now ye should take this my son and anything happen to he in the way ye should bring my hoar hair with sorrow to hell therefore if i should come home to my father and bring not the child with I sith the soul and health of my father dependeth of this child and see that he be not come with we he shall die and we thy servant should lead he old age with wail and sorrow to hell i myself shall be thy proper servant which have receive he upon my faith and have promise for he say to my father : if i bring he not again i shall be guilty of the sin to my father ever after i shall abide and continue thy servant for the child in the ministry and service of thee my lord i may not depart the child be absent lest i be witness of the sorrow that my father shall take wherefore i beseech thee to suffer this child to go to he father and receive I into thy service thus say judah with much more as josephus antiquitatum rehearseth more piteously and saith moreover that the cause why he do do hide the cup in benjamin 's sack be to know whether they love benjamin or hate he as they do he what time they sell he to the ishmaelite then this request make joseph might no longer forbear but command they that stand by to withdraw they and when all man be go out sauf he and he brethren he begin to say to they weep : i be joseph you brother liveth yet my father the brethren be so afeard that they could not speak ne answer to he then he debonairly say to they : come hither to I and when

take you sheep and beast with you like as ye desire and at you depart bless ye I the egyptian constrain the child to depart and go they way hastily say : we all shall die the child of israel take they meal and put it on they shoulder as they be command and borrow vessel of silver and of gold and much clothing we lord give to they such favor tofore the egyptian that the egyptian lend to they all that they desire and they spoil and rob egypt and so the child of israel depart nigh the number of six hundred thousand footman besides woman and child which be innumerable and a huge great multitude of beast of diver kind the time that the child of israel have dwell in egypt be four hundred year and so they depart out of egypt and go not the right way by the philistine but we lord lead they by

wilderness and we lord go tofore they by day in a column of a cloud and by night in a column of fire and be they leader and duke the pillar of the cloud fail never by day nor the pillar of fire by night tofore the people we lord say to mose i shall make he heart so hard that he shall follow and pursue you and i shall be glorified in pharaoh and in all he host the egyptian shall know that i be lord and anon it be tell to pharaoh that the child of israel flee and anon he heart be change and also the heart of he servant and say : what shall we do shall we suffer the child to depart and no more to serve we forthwith he take he chariot and all he people with he he take with he six hundred choose chariot and all the chariot and wain of egypt and the duke of all he host and he pursue the child of israel and follow they in great pride and when he approach that the child of israel see he come they be sore afraid and cry to we lord god and say to mose : be there not sepulchre enough for we in egypt but that we must now die in wilderness say we not to thee : go from we and let we serve the egyptian : it have be much better for we to have serve the egyptian than to die here in wilderness and mose say to the people : be ye not afraid stand and see ye the great wonder that we lord shall do for you this day the egyptian that ye now see ye shall never see they after this day god shall fight for you and be ye still we lord say then to mose : what criest thou to I say to the child of israel that they go forth take thou and raise the rod and stretch thy hand upon the sea and depart it that the child of israel may go dry through the middle of it i shall so indurate the heart of pharaoh that he shall follow you and all the egyptian and i shall be glorified in pharaoh and in all he host he cart and horseman and the egyptian shall know that i be lord when i shall so be glorified the angel of god go tofore the castle of israel and another come after in the cloud which stand between they of egypt and the child of israel and the cloud be dark that the host of israel might not come to they of all the night then mose stretch he hand upon the sea and there come a wind blow in such wise that it wax dry and the child of israel go in through the midst of the red sea all dry foot for the water stand up as a wall on the right side and on the left side the egyptian then pursue they follow and enter after they and all the cart chariot and horseman through the middle of the sea and then we lord behold that the child of israel be pass over and be on the dry land on that other side anon turn the water on they and the wheel on they cart turn up so down and drown all the host of pharaoh and sink down into the deep of the sea then say the egyptian : let we flee israel the lord fighteth for they against we and we lord say to mose : stretch out thine hand upon the sea and let the water return upon the egyptian and upon they chariot and horseman and so mose stretch out he hand and the sea return in to he first place and then the egyptian would have flee but the water come and overflow they in the midst of the flood and it cover the chariot and horseman and all the host of pharaoh and there be not one save of they and the child of israel have pass through the middle of the dry sea and come a-land thus deliver we lord the child of israel from the hand of the egyptian and they see the egyptian lie dead upon the brink of the sea and the people then dread we lord and believe in he and to mose he servant then mose and the child of israel sing this song to we lord : cantemus domino magnificatus est let we sing to we lord he be magnify he have overthrow the horseman and carman in the sea and miriam the sister of aaron a prophetess take a timpane in she hand and all the woman follow she with timpane and chord and she go tofore singing cantemus domino then mose bring the child of israel from the sea into the desert of sur and walk with they three day and three night and find no water and come into marah and the water there be so bitter that they might not drink thereof then the people grudge against mose say : what shall we drink and he cry unto we lord which show to he a tree which he take and put into the water and anon they be turn into sweetness there we lord ordain commandment and judgment and there he tempt he say : if thou hearest the voice of thy lord-god and that thou do be rightful before he and obeyest he commandment and keep he precept i shall not bring none of the languor ne sorrow upon thee that i do in egypt i be lord thy savior then the child of israel come in to elim where as be twelve fountain of water and seventy palm tree and they abide by the water then from thence go all the multitude of the child of israel into the desert of sin which be between elim and sinaus and grudge against mose and aaron in that wilderness and say : would god we have dwell still in egypt whereas we sit and have plenty of bread and flesh why have ye bring we into the desert for to slay all this multitude by hunger we lord say then to mose : i shall rain bread to you from heaven let the people go out and gather every day that i may prove they whether they walk in my law or not the sixth day let they gather double as much as they gather in one day of the other then say mose and aaron to all the child of israel : at even ye shall know that god have bring you from the land of egypt and to-morn ye shall see the glory of we lord i have well hear you murmur against we lord what have ye muse against we what be we and yet say mose we lord shall give you at even flesh for to eat and to-morn bread unto you fill for as much as ye have murmur against he what be we you murmur be not against we but against we lord as aaron spake to all the company of the child of israel they behold toward the wilderness and we lord spake to mose in a cloud and say : i have hear the grudging of the child of israel say to they : at even ye shall eat flesh and to-morn ye shall be fill with bread and ye shall know that i be you lord god and when the even be come there come so many curlew that it cover all they lodgings and on the morn there lay like dew all about in they circuit which when they see and come for to gather it be small and white like to coriander and they wonder on it and say : mahun that be as much to say what be this to whom mose say : this be the bread that god have send you to eat and god commandeth that every man should gather as much for every head as be the measure of gomor and let nothing be leave till on the morn and the sixth day gather ye double so much that be two measure of gomor and keep that one measure for the sabbath which god have sanctify and command you to hallow it yet some of they brake god 's commandment and gather more than they eat and keep it till on the morn and then it begin to putrify and be full of worm and that they keep for the sabbath day be good and putrify not and thus we lord feed the child of israel forty year in the desert and it be call manna mose take one gomor thereof and put it in the tabernacle for to be keep for a perpetual memory and remembrance then go they forth all the multitude of the child of israel in the desert of sin in they mansion and come to rephidim where as they have no water then all grudging they say to mose give we water for to drink to whom mose answer : what grudge ye against I why tempt ye we lord the people thirst sore for lack and penury of water say : why hast thou bring we out of egypt for to slay we and we child and beast then mose cry unto we lord say : what shall i do to this people i trow within a while they shall stone I to death then we lord say to mose : go before the people and take with thee the older man and senior of israel and take the rod that thou smotest with the flood in thy hand and i shall stand tofore upon the stone of oreb and smite thou the stone with the rod and the water shall come out thereof that the people may drink mose do so tofore the senior of israel and call that place temptation because of the grudge of the child of israel and say : be god with we or not then come amalek and fight against the child of israel in rephidim mose say then to joshua : choose to thee man and go out and fight against amalek to-morrow i shall stand on the top of the hill have the rod of god in my hand : joshua do as mose command he and fight against amalek mose aaron and hur ascend into the hill and when mose hold up he hand israel win and overcome they enemy and when he lay they down then amalek have the better the hand of mose be heavy aaron and hur take then a stone and put it under they and they sustain he hand on either side and so he hand be not weary until the go down of the sun and so joshua make amalek to flee and he people by strength of he sword we lord say to mose : write this for a remembrance in a book and deliver it to the ear of joshua i shall destroy and put away the memory of amalek under heaven mose then edify a altar unto we lord and call there on the name of we lord say : the lord be mine exaltation for this be the hand only of god and the battle and god shall be against amalek from generation to generation when jethro the priest of midian which be cousin of mose hear say what we lord have do to mose and to the child of israel he people he take zipporah the wife of mose and he two son gershom and eleazar and come with they to he into desert whom mose receive with worship and kiss he and when they be together mose tell he all what we lord have do to

and say : bless be the lord that have deliver you from the hand of the egyptian and of pharaoh and have save he people now i know that he be a great lord above all god because they do so proudly against they and jethro offer sacrifice and offering to we lord aaron and all the senior of israel come and eat with he tofore we lord the next day mose sit and judge and deem the people from morning unto evening which when he cousin see he say to he : what doest thou why sittest thou alone and all the people tarry from the morning until evening to whom mose answer : the people come to I demand sentence and the doom of god when there be any debate or difference among they they come to I to judge they and to show to they the precept and the law of god then say jethro : thou dost not well nor

god israel that have bring thee out of the land of egypt yet say we lord to mose : i see well that this people be of evil disposition suffer I that i may wreak my wrath on they and i shall destroy they i shall make thee governor of great people mose then pray we lord god say : why art thou wroth lord against thy people that thou hast bring out of the land of egypt in a great strength and a boisterous hand i beseech thee lord let not the egyptian say that they god have lock they out for to slay they in the mountain i pray thee lord that thy wrath may assuage and be thou pleased and benign upon the wickedness of thy people remember abraham isaac and jacob thy servant to whom thou promisedst and swaredst by thyself say : i shall multiply you seed as the star of heaven and the universal land of which i have speak i shall give to you seed and ye shall possess and have it ever and with these word we lord be pleased that he would do no harm as he have say unto he people and mose return from the mount bear two table of stone write both with the hand of god and the scripture that be in the table be the ten commandment as fore be write joshua hear the great noise of the child of israel say to mose : i trow they fight beneath which answer and say : it be no cry of exhort man to fight ne noise to compel I to flee but i hear the noise of singing when he approach to they he see the calf and the instrument of mirth and he be so wroth that he throw down the table and brake they at the foot of the hill and run and catch down the calf that they have make and burnt and smite it all to powder which he cast into water and give it to drink to the child of israel then say mose to aaron : what have this people do to thee that thou hast make to sin grievously to whom he answer : let not my lord take none indignation at I thou knowest well that this people be prone and ready to sin they say to I : make we god that may go tofore we we know not what be fall to this mose that lead we out of egypt to whom i say : who of you that have gold give it I they take and give it to I and i cast it into the fire and thereof come out this calf and then say mose : all they that be of god 's part and have not sin in this calf let they join to I and the child of levus join to he and he bid each man take a sword on he side and take vengeance and slay every each he brother friend and he neighbor that have trespass and so the child of levus go and slew thirty-three thousand of the child of israel and then say mose : ye have hallowed this day you hand unto we lord and ye shall be therefore bless the second day mose spake to the people and say : ye have commit and do the greatest sin that may be i shall ascend unto we lord again and shall pray he for you sin then mose ascended again and receive afterward two table again which we lord bid he make and therein we lord write the commandment and after we lord command he to make a ark and a tabernacle : in which ark be keep three thing first the rod with which he do marvel a pot full of manna and the two table with commandment and then after mose teach they the law how each man should behave he against other and what he should do and what he should not do and depart they into twelve tribe and command that every man should bring a rod into the tabernacle and mose write each name on the rod and mose shut fast the tabernacle and on the morn there be find one of the rod that burgeon and bare leaf and fruit and be of a almond tree that rod fall to aaron and after this long time the child desire to eat flesh and remember of the flesh that they eat in egypt and grudge against mose and would have ordain to they a duke for to have return into egypt wherefore mose be so woe that he desire of we lord to deliver he from this life because he see they so unkind against god then god send to they so great plenty of curlew that two day and one night they fly so thick by the ground that they take great number for they fly but the height of two cubit and they have so many that they dry they hang on they tabernacle and tent yet be they not content but ever grudging wherefore god smite they and take vengeance on they by a great plague and many die and be bury there and then from thence they go into hazeroth and dwelt after this miriam and aaron brother and sister of mose begin to speak against mose because of he wife which be of ethiopium and say : god have not speak only by mose have he not also speak to we wherefore we lord be wroth mose be the humblest and the meekest man that be in all the world anon then we lord say to he and to aaron and to miriam : go ye three only unto the tabernacle and there we lord say that there be none like to mose to whom he have speak mouth to mouth and reprove aaron and miriam because they speak so to mose and be wroth depart from they and anon miriam be smitten and make leper and white like snow and when aaron behold she and see she smitten with leprosy he say to mose : i beseech the lord that thou set not the sin on we which we have commit follily and let not this we sister be as a dead woman or as bear out of time and cast away from she mother behold and see half she flesh be devour of the leprosy then mose cry unto we lord say : i beseech thee lord that thou heal she to whom we lord say : if she father have spit in she face should she not be put to shame and rebuke seven day let she depart out of the castle seven day and after she shall be call in again so miriam be shut out of the castle seven day and the people remove not from the place till she be call again after this we lord command mose to send man into the land of canaan that he should give they charge for to see and consider the goodness thereof and that of every tribe he should send some mose do as we lord have command which go in and bring of the fruit with they and they bring a branch with one cluster of grape as much as two man might bear between they upon a colestaff when they have see the country and consider by the space of forty day they return and tell the commodity of the land but some say that the people be strong and many king and giant in such wise that they say it be impregnable and that the people be much stronger than they be wherefore the people anon be afeard and murmur against mose and would return again into egypt then joshua and caleb which be two of they that have consider the land say to the people : why grudge ye and wherefore be ye afraid we have well see the country and it be good to win the country floweth full of milk and honey be not rebel against god he shall give it we be ye not afeard then all the people cry against they and when they would have take stone and stone they we lord in he glory appear in a cloud upon the covering of the tabernacle and say to mose : this people believeth not the sign and wonder that i have show and do to they i shall destroy they all by pestilence and i shall make thee a prince upon people greater and stronger than this be then pray mose to we lord for the people that he would have pity on they and not destroy they but to have mercy on they after the magnitude of he mercy and we lord at he request forgive they nevertheless we lord say that all the man that have see he majesty and the sign and marvel that he do in egypt and in desert and have tempt he ten time and not obey unto he voice shall not see ne come into the country and land that i have promise to they father but joshua and caleb my servant shall enter into the land and they seed shall possess it mose tell all this unto the child and they wail and sorrow greatly therefore after this the people remove from thence and come into the desert of sin and then miriam sister of mose and aaron die and be bury in the same place then the people lack water and come and grudge against mose and yet wish they have abide in egypt then mose and aaron enter into the tabernacle and fall down to the ground low and pray unto we lord say : lord god hear the clamor of thy people and open to they thy treasure a fountain of live water that they may drink and the murmuration of they may cease we lord say to he then : take the rod in thy hand and thou and aaron thy brother assemble and gather the people and speak ye to the stone and it shall give out water and when the water cometh let all the multitude drink and they beast mose then take the rod as we lord bade and gather all the people tofore the stone and say to they : hear ye rebel and out of belief trow ye not that we may give you water out of this stone and he lift up he hand and smote between the stone and water come and flow out in the most largest wise in such wise that the people and beast drink they fill then say god to mose and aaron : because ye have not believe I and sanctify my name tofore the child of israel and give to I the laud but have do this in you name ye shall not bring this people into the land that i shall give to they and therefore this water be call the water of contradiction where the child grudge against god anon after this by god 's commandment mose take aaron upon the hill and despoil he of he vesture and clothe therewith he son eleazar and make he upperest bishop for he father aaron and there aaron die in the top of the hill and mose descend with eleazar and when all the multitude of people see that aaron be dead they weep and wail on he thirty day in every tribe and family after this the people go about the land of edom and begin to wax weary and grudge against we lord and mose and say yet : why hast thou lead we out of the land of egypt for to slay we in this desert and wilderness bread faileth we there be no water and we soul abhor and loathe this light meat for which cause god send among they fiery-serpent which bit and wound many of they and slew also then they that be hurt come in to mose and say : we have sin for we have speak against we lord and thee pray for we unto god that he deliver from we these serpent then mose pray we lord for the people and we lord say to he : make a serpent of brass and set it up for a sign and whosomever be hurt and looketh thereon and beholdeth it shall live and be whole then mose make a serpent of brass and set it up for a sign and when they that be hurt behold it they be make whole after this when mose have show to they all the law of we lord and ceremony and have govern they forty year and that he be a hundred and twenty year old he ascend from the field of moab upon the mountain of nebo into the top of pisgah against jericho and there we lord show to he all the land of gilead unto dan and the land of promise from that one end unto that other and then we lord say to he : this be the land that i promise to abraham isaac and jacob saying : i shall give it to thy seed now thou hast see it with thine eye and shalt not enter ne come therein and there in that place die mose servant of we lord as god command and be bury in the vale of the land of moab against beth-peor and yet never man know he sepulchre unto this day mose be a hundred and twenty year old when he die he eye never dim ne he tooth be never move the child of israel weep and mourn for he thirty day in the field of moab joshua the son of nun be replenish with the spirit of wisdom for mose set on he he hand and the child obey he as we lord have command to mose and there be never after a prophet in israel like unto mose which know and speak to god face to face in all sign and token that god do and show by he in the land of egypt to pharaoh and all he servant the burial of mose by nebo 's lonely mountain on this side jordan 's wave in a vale in the land of moab there lie a lonely grave and no man know that sepulchre and no man see it e'er for the angel of god upturn the sod and lay the dead man there that be the grandest funeral that ever pass on earth but no man hear the trampling or see the train go forth -- noiselessly as the daylight come back when night be do and the crimson streak on ocean 's cheek grow into the great sun noiselessly as the springtime she crown of verdure weave and all the tree on all the hill open they thousand leave so without sound of music or voice of they that weep silently down from the mountain 's crown the great procession sweep perchance the bald old eagle on gray beth-peor 's height out of he lonely eyrie look on the wondrous sight perchance the lion stalk still shun that hallowed spot for beast and bird have see and hear that which man knoweth not but when the warrior dieth he comrade in the war with arm reverse and muffle drum follow he funeral car they show the banner take they tell he battle win and after he lead he masterless steed while peal the minute gun amid the noblest of the land we lay the sage to rest and give the bard a honor place with costly marble drest in the great minster transept where light like glory fall and the organ ring and the sweet choir sing along the emblazon wall this be the truest warrior that ever buckle sword this the most gifted poet that ever breathe a word and never earth 's philosopher trace with he golden pen on the deathless page truth half so sage as he write down for man and have he not high honor -- the hillside for a pall to lie in state while angel wait with star for taper tall and the dark rock-pine like toss plume over he bier to wave and god 's own hand in that lonely land to lay he in the grave -- in that strange grave without a name whence he uncoffined clay shall break again o wondrous thought before the judgment day and stand with glory wrapt around on the hill he never tread and speak of the strife that win we life with the incarnate son of god o lonely grave in moab 's land o dark beth-peor 's hill speak to these curious heart of ours and teach they to be still god have he mystery of grace way that we can not tell he hide they deep like the hidden sleep of he he love so well _ -- cecil france alexander _ the history of joshua after mose joshua be duke and leader of the child of israel and bring they into the land of behest and do many great battle for whom god show many great marvel and in especial one that be that the sun stand still at he request till he have overcome he enemy by the space of a day and we lord when he fight send down such hail-stone that slew more of he enemy with the stone than with man 's hand joshua be a noble man and govern well israel and divide the land unto the twelve tribe by lot and when he be a hundred and ten year old he die and diver duke after he judge and deem israel of

August the history of saul _ the first Sunday after trinity Sunday unto the first Sunday of the month of August be read the book of king _ this history maketh mention that there be a man name elkanah which have two wife that one be name hannah and the name of the second peninnah peninnah have child and hannah have none but be barren the good man at such day as he be bounden go to he city for to

and eat no meat to whom elkanah she husband say : hannah why weepest thou and wherefore eatest thou not why be thine heart put to affliction be i not better to thee than ten son then hannah arise after she have eat and drunk in shilo and go to pray unto we lord make to he a vow if that she might have a son she should offer he to we lord elus that time sit tofore the post of the house of we lord and hannah besought and pray we lord make to he a vow if that she might have a son she should offer he to we lord and it be so that she pray so heartily in she thought and mind that she lip move not wherefore elus bare she on hand that she be drunk and she say : nay my lord i be a sorrowful woman i have drunken no wine ne drink that may cause I to be drunken but i have make my prayer and cast my soul in the sight of almighty god repute I not as one of the daughter of belial for the prayer that i have make and speak yet be of the multitude of the heaviness and sorrow of my heart then eli the priest say to she : go in peace the god of israel give to thee the petition of thy heart for that thou hast pray he and she say : would god that thy handservant might find grace in thy sight and so she depart and on the morn they go home again in to ramatha after this we lord remember she and she bare a fair son and name he samuel for so much as she ask he of we lord wherefore elkanah she husband go and offer a solemn sacrifice and he vow accomplish but hannah ascend not with he she say to she husband that she would not go till she child be wean and take from the pap and after when samuel be wean and be a infant the mother take he and three calf and three measure of meal and a bottle of wine and bring he unto the house of we lord in shilo and sacrifice that calf and offer the child to elus and tell to elus that she be the woman that pray we lord for that child and there hannah worship we lord and thank he and there make this psalm which be one of the canticle : my heart have rejoice in the lord and so forth all the remnant of that psalm and then elkanah with he wife return home to he house after this we lord visit hannah and she conceive three son and two daughter which she bring forth and samuel abode in the house of we lord and be minister in the sight of elus but the two son of elus hophni and phinea be child of belial not know we lord but do great sin against the commandment of god and we lord send a prophet to elus because he correct not he son and say he would take the office from he and from he house and that there should not be a old man in he house and kindred but should die ere they come to man 's estate and that god should raise a priest that should be faithful and after he heart samuel serve and minister we lord in a surplice before elus and on a time as elus lay in he bed he eye be so dim that he might not see the lantern of god till it be quench and put out samuel sleep in the temple of we lord whereas the ark of god be and we lord call samuel which answer : i be ready and run to elus and say : i be ready thou callest I which say : i call thee not my son return and sleep and he return and sleep and we lord call he the second time and he arise and go to elus and say : lo i be here thou calledst I which answer : i call thee not go thy way and sleep samuel know not the calling of we lord yet ne there be never revelation show he tofore and we lord call samuel the third time which arise and come to elus and say : i be here for thou calledst I then eli understand that we lord have call he and say to samuel : go and sleep and if thou be call again thou shalt say : speak lord for thy servant heareth thee samuel return and sleep in he place and we lord come and call he : samuel samuel and samuel say : say lord what it pleaseth for thy servant heareth and then we lord say to samuel : lo i make my word to be know in israel that whoso heareth he ear shall ring and sound thereof in that day i shall raise against elus that i have say upon he house i shall begin and accomplish it i have give he in knowledge that i shall judge he house for wickedness forasmuch as he knoweth he son to do wickedly and have not correct they therefore i have swear to the house of elus that the wickedness of he house shall not be make clean with sacrifice ne gift never samuel sleep till on the morn and then he rise and open the door of the house of we lord in he surplice and samuel be afeard to show this vision unto elus eli call he and ask what we lord have say to he and charge he to tell he all : and samuel tell to he all that we lord have say and hide nothing from he and he say : he be we lord what it pleaseth he let he do samuel grow and we lord be with he in all he work and it be know to all israel from dan to beersheba that samuel be the true prophet of we lord after this it be so that the philistine war against the child of israel against whom there be a battle and the child of israel overthrow and put to flight wherefore they assemble again and take with they the ark of god which hophnus and phinea son of elus bare and when they come with a great multitude with the ark the philistine be afraid notwithstanding they fight against they manly and slew thirty thousand footman of the child of israel and take the ark of god and the two son of elus be slay hophnus and phinea and a man of the tribe of benjamin run for to tell this unto elus which sit abide some tiding of the battle this man as soon as he enter into the town tell how the field be lose the people slay and how the ark be take and there be a great sorrow and cry and when elus hear this cry and wail he demand what this noise be and mean and wherefore they so sorrowed then the man hie and come and tell to eli elus be at that tide ninety-eight year old and he eye be waxen blind and might not see and he say : i be he that come from the battle and flee this day from the host to whom elus say : what be there do my son he answer : the host of israel be overthrow and flee tofore the philistine and a great ruin be make among the people thy two son be slay and the ark of god be take and when elus hear he name the ark of god he fall down backward by the door and brake he neck and there die he be a old man and have judge israel forty year then the philistine take the ark of god and set it in they temple of dagon by they god dagon in ashdod on the morn the next day early when they of ashdod come into they temple they see they god dagon lie on the ground tofore the ark of god upon he face and the head and the two hand of dagon be cut off and there abode no more but the trunk only in the place and god show many vengeance to they of the country as long as the ark be with they for god smite they with sickness and well boil in town and field of that region and there grow among they so many mouse that they suffer great persecution and confusion in that city the people see this vengeance and plague say : let not the ark of the god of israel abide longer with we for he hand be hard on we and on dagon we god and send for the great master and governor of the philistine and when they be gather they say : what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answer : let it be lead all about the city and so it be and a great vengeance and death be have upon all the city and smite every man with plague from the most to the least and then they send the ark of god into acheron and when they of acheron see the ark they cry say : they have bring the ark of the god of israel to we for to slay we and we people they cry that the ark should be send home again for much people be dead by the vengeance that be take on they and a great howling and wail be among they the ark be in the region of the philistine seven month after this they counsel with they priest what they should do with the ark and it be conclude it should be send home again but the priest say : if ye send it home send it not void but what

son judge on israel whose name be joel and abiah and these two he son walk not in he way but decline after covetise and take gift and perverted justice and doom then assemble and gather together all

nation have this displeased much to samuel when they say ordain on we a king then samuel counsel on this matter with we lord to whom god say : hear the voice of the people that speak to thee : they have not cast only thee away but I that i should not reign on they for they do now like as they ever have do sith i bring they out of egypt unto this day that be that they have serve false god and strange and so do they to thee notwithstanding hear they and tell to they tofore the right of the king and how he shall oppress they samuel tell all this to the people that demand to have a king and say : this shall be the right of a king that shall reign on you he shall take you son and make they he man of war and set they in he chariot and shall make they he carter and rider of he horse in he

samuel but say : give to we a king for a king shall reign on we and we shall be as all other people be and we king shall judge we and go before we and he shall fight we battle for we and samuel hear all and counsel with we lord to whom god command to ordain to they a king and so he do for he take a man of the tribe of benjamin whose name be saul a good man and choose and there be not a better among all the child of israel and he be higher of stature from the shoulder upward than any other of all the people and samuel anointed he king upon israel and say to he : we lord god have anointed thee upon he heritage and ordain thee a prince and thou shalt deliver he people from the hand of he enemy that be in the circuit and country about and so depart from he and samuel after this gather

that have only deliver you from all you evil and tribulation and have say : ordain upon we a king wherefore now stand every each in he tribe and we shall lot who shall be we king and the lot fall on the tribe of benjamin and in that tribe the lot fall upon saul the son of kish and they seek he and could not find he and it be tell he that he be hide in he house at home and the people run thither and fetch he and set he amidst all the people and he be higher than any of all the people from the shoulder upward then samuel say to the people now ye see and behold whom we lord have choose for there be none like he of all the people and then all the people cry : vivat rex live the king samuel write the law of the realm to the people in a book and put it tofore we lord thus be saul make the first king in israel and anon have much war for on all side man war on the child of israel and he defend they and saul have diver battle and have victory samuel come on a time to saul and say god command he to fight against amalek and that he should slay and destroy man woman and child ox cow camel and ass and sheep and spare nothing then saul assemble he people and have two hundred thousand footman and twenty thousand man of the tribe of judah and go forth and fight against amalek and slew they sauf he save agag the king of amalek alive and all other he slew but he spare the best flock of sheep and of other beast and also good clothes and wether and all that be good he spare and whatsomever be foul he destroy and this be show to samuel by we lord say : I forthinketh that i have ordain saul king upon israel for he have forsake I and not fulfil my commandment samuel be sorry herefor and wail all the night on the morn he rise and come to saul and saul offer sacrifice to we lord of the pillage that he have take and samuel demand of saul what noise that be he hear of sheep and beast and he say that they be of the beast that the people have bring from amalek to offer unto we

of israel thou wert make upperest and we lord anoint thee and make thee king and he say to thee : go and slay the sinner of amalek and leave none alive man ne beast why hast thou not obey the commandment of we lord and hast run to robbery and do evil in the sight of god and then say saul to samuel : i have take agag king of the amalekite and bring he with I but i have slay amalek the people have take of the sheep and beast of the best for to offer unto we lord god and then say samuel : trowest thou that we lord would rather have sacrifice and offering than not to obey he commandment better be obedience than sacrifice and better it be to take heed to do after thy lord than to offer the fat kidney of the wether for it be a sin to withstand and to repugn against he lord like the sin of idolatry and because thou hast not obey we lord and cast away he word we lord have cast thee away that thou shalt not be king then say saul to samuel : i have sin for i have not obey the word of god and thy word but have dread the people and obey to they request but i pray thee to bear my sin and trespass and return with I that i may worship we lord and samuel answer i shall not return with thee and so samuel depart and yet ere he depart he do do slay -lrb- cause to be slay -rrb- agag the king and samuel see never saul after unto he death then we lord bid samuel to go and

seven of they and samuel say there be not he that he would have then he say that there be no more save one which be youngest and yet a child and keep sheep in the field and samuel say : send for he for i shall eat no bread till he come and so he be send for and bring he be ruddy and fair of visage and well favor and samuel arise and take a horn with oil and anoint he in the middle of he brethren and forthwith the spirit of we lord come directly in he that same day and ever after then samuel depart and come into ramah and the spirit of we lord go away from saul and a evil spirit oft vex he then he servant say to he : thou oft art vex with a evil spirit it be good to have one that could harp to be with thee when the spirit vexeth thee thou shalt bear it the lighter and he say to he servant : provide ye to I such one and then one say : i see one of jesse 's son play on a harp a fair child and strong wise in he talk and we lord be with he then saul send message to jesse for david

the philistine gather they into great host to make war against saul and the child of israel and saul gather the child of israel together and come against they in the vale of terebinthe the philistine stand upon the hill on that other part and the valley be between they and there come out of the host of the philistine a great giant name goliath of gath he be six cubit high and a palm and a helmet of brass on he head and be clothe in a habergeon the weight of he habergeon be of five thousand shekel of weight of metal he have boot of brass on he calf and he shoulder be cover with plate of brass he glaive be as a great colestaff and there be thereon six shekel of iron and he squire go tofore he and cry against they of israel and say they should choose a man to fight a singular battle against goliath and if he be overcome the philistine should be servant to israel and if he prevail and overcome he enemy they of israel should serve the philistine and thus he do cry forty day long saul and the child of israel be sore afraid david be at this time in bethlehem with he father and keep sheep and three of he brethren be in the host with saul to whom jesse say : david take this pottage ten loaf of bread and ten cheese and go run unto the host to thy brethren and see how they do and learn how they be array david deliver he sheep to one to keep they and bare these thing unto the host and when he come thither he hear a great cry and he demand after he brethren and that same time come forth that giant goliath and say as he have do tofore and david hear he speak all they of israel flee for fear of he and david demand what he be and it be tell he that he be come to destroy israel and also that what man that might slay he the king should enrich he with great riches and should give to

slay he and the people say as afore be say and when he oldest brother hear he speak to the people he be wroth with he and say : wherefore art thou come hither and hast leave the few sheep in desert i know well thy pride thou art come for to see the battle and david say : what have i do be it not as the people say i dare fight well with this giant and decline from he brother to other of the people and all this be show to saul and david be bring to he and say to saul : i thy servant shall fight against this giant if thou wilt and saul say to he : thou mayst not withstand this philistine nor

wether from the middle of my flock and i pursue after and take it again from they mouth and they arise and would have devour I and i catch they by the jaw and slew they i thy servant slew the lion and the bear therefore this philistine uncircumcised shall be as one of they i shall now go and deliver israel from this opprobrium and shame how be this philistine uncircumcised so hardy as to curse the host of the living god and yet say david : the lord that keep I from the might of the lion and from the strength of the bear he will deliver I from the power of the philistine saul say then to david : go and we lord be with thee saul do do arm he with he armor and gird he sword about he and when he be arm david say : i may not ne can not fight thus for i be not accustomed ne use and unarmed he and take he staff that he have in he hand and choose to he five good round stone from the brook and put they in he bag and take a sling in he hand and go forth against the giant and when goliath see he come he despise he and say : weenest thou that i be a hound that comest with thy staff to I and he curse david by he god and say to david : come hither and i shall give thy flesh to the fowl of heaven and to the beast of the earth david say unto goliath : thou comest to I with thy sword and glaive and i come to thee in the name of the lord god of the host of israel which thou hast this day despise and that lord shall give thee in my hand and i shall slay thee and smite off thy head and i shall give this day the body of the man of war of the philistine to the fowl of heaven and to the beast of the earth then goliath rise and hie toward david and david on that other side hie and take a stone and lay it in he sling and throw it at the giant and smite he in the forehead in such wise that the stone be fix there in that he fall down on he visage thus prevail david against the philistine with he sling and stone and smite he and slew he and he have no sword but he go and take goliath 's own sword and therewith smite off he head and then the philistine see this giant thus slay flee and the israelite after follow and slew many of they and return again and come into the tent pavilion and

he hand tofore saul and saul demand of he of what kindred that he be and he say that he be son of jesse of bethlehem and forthwith that same time jonathan the son of saul love david as he own soul saul then would not give he license to return to he father and jonathan and he be confederate and swear each of they to be true to other for jonathan give he coat that he be clad withal and all he other garment unto he sword and spear unto david and david do all that ever saul bid he do wisely and prudently and when he return from the battle and goliath be slay the woman come out from every town singing with choir and timpane against the come of saul with great joy and gladness saying : saul have slay a thousand and david have slay ten thousand and this say displeased much to saul which say : they have give to david ten thousand and to I one thousand what may he more have save the realm and to be king for this cause saul never love david after that day ne never look on he friendly but ever seek means afterward to destroy david for he dread that david should be lord with he and put he from he and david be wise and keep he well from he and after this he wed michal daughter of saul and jonathan make oft time peace between saul and david yet saul keep no promise but ever lay in wait to slay david and jonathan warn david thereof and david gat he a company of man of war to the number of four hundred and keep he in the mountain and on a time david be at home with he wife michal and saul send thither man of war to slay he in he house in the morning and when michal hear

david go then he way and saul return home again and david say in he heart : sometime it might hap to I to fall and come into the hand of saul it be better i flee from he and save I in the land of the philistine and he go thence with six hundred man and come to achish king of gath and dwell there and when saul understand that he be with achish he cease to seek he and achish deliver to david a town to dwell in name ziklag after this the philistine gather and assemble much people against israel and saul assemble all israel and come upon gilboa and when saul see all the host of the philistine he heart dread and faint sore he cry for to have counsel of we lord and we lord answer he not ne by sweven ne by priest ne by prophet then say saul to he servant : fetch to I a woman have a phiton otherwise call a phitoness or a witch and they say that there be such a woman in endor saul then change he habit and clothing and do on other clothing and go and two man with he and come to the woman by night and make she by she craft to raise samuel and samuel say to saul : why hast thou put I from my rest for to arise and saul say : i be coart -lrb- constrain -rrb- thereto for the philistine

do to thee as he have say to thee by I and shall cut thy realm from thine hand and shall give it thy neighbor david for thou hast not obey he voice ne hast not do he commandment in amalek therefore thou shalt lose the battle and israel shall be overthrow to-morrow thou and thy child shall be with I and we lord shall suffer the child of israel to fall in the hand of the philistine anon then saul fall down to the earth the word of samuel make he afeard and there be no strength in he for he have eat no bread of all that day he be greatly troubled then the phitoness desire he to eat and she slew a paschal lamb that she have and dight and set it tofore he and bread and when he have eat he walk with he servant all that night and on the morn the philistine assail saul and they of israel and

the philistine have do unto saul all the strongest man of they arise and go all that night and take down the body of saul and of he son from the wall of bethshan and burn they and take the bone and bury they in the wood of jabesh-gilead and fast seven day _ thus endeth the life of saul which be first king upon israel and for disobedience of god 's commandment be slay and he heir never reign long after _ the history of david _ here followeth how david reign after saul and govern israel shortly take out of the bible the most historical matter and but little touch _ after the death of saul david return from the journey that he have against amalek for whilst david have be out with achish the king they of amalek have be in ziklag and take all that be therein prisoner and rob and carry away with

call I and say to I : who art thou and i say i be a amalekite and then he say : stand upon I and slay I for i be full of anguish and yet my soul be in I and i then stand on he slew he know well that he might not live after the ruin and i take the diadem from he head and the armylle from he arm which i have bring hither to thee my lord david take and rent he vestment and all the man that be with he and wail and sorrow much the death of saul and jonathan and of all the man of israel and fast that day till even and david say to the young man : of whence art thou and he say : i be the son of a amalekite and david say to he : why dreadedst thou not to put thy hand forth to slay he that be anoint of god david call one of he man and bid he slay he and he smite he and slew he and david say : thy blood be on thy head thine own mouth have speak against thee say : i have slay saul which be king anointed of we lord david sorrowed and bewail much the death of saul and of jonathan after this david counsel with we lord and demand if he should go in to one of the city of judah and we lord bid he go and he ask whither and we lord say : into hebron then david take he two wife and all the man that be with he every each with he household and dwell in the town of hebron and thither come the man of judah and anointed david king to reign upon the tribe of judah and abner prince of the host of saul and other servant of saul take ishbosheth the son of saul and lead he about and make he king over israel except the tribe of judah ishbosheth be forty year when he begin to reign and he reign two year the house of judah only follow david after this it hap that abner prince of the host of ishbosheth with certain man go out of the castle and joab with certain man of david go also out and run by the piscine -lrb- pool -rrb- of gibeon one party be on that one side and that other on the other and abner say to joab : let we young man play and skirmish together and joab agree and there rise twelve of benjamin of the party of ishbosheth and twelve of the child of david and when they meet together each take other by the head and roof they sword into each other 's side and be all there slay and there arise a great battle and abner and he fellowship be put to flight by the man of david and among all other there be asahel one of the brethren of joab and be the swiftest runner that might be and pursued abner and abner look behind he and bid he decline on the right side or on the left side and take one of the young man and he harness and come not at I asahel would not leave he yet abner say to he : go from I and follow not I lest i be compel to slay thee and then i may not make my peace with joab thy brother which would not hear abner but despise he and abner then turn and slew he in the same place and anon the sun go down and they withdraw there be slay of the child of david nineteen man and of they of benjamin three hundred and sixty be slay and thus there be long strife and contention between the house of david and the house of ishbosheth after this abner take a concubine of saul and hold she wherefore ishbosheth reprove he of it and abner be wroth greatly thereof and come to david and make friendship with he joab be not there when abner make he peace with david but when he know it he come to abner with a fair semblant and spake fair to he by dissimulation and slew he for to avenge the death of asahel he brother and when david hear how joab have slay abner he curse he and bewail greatly the death of abner and do do bury he -lrb- cause he to be bury -rrb- honorably and david follow the bier himself and when ishbosheth the son of saul hear that abner be dead he be all abashed and all israel sore troubled there be two prince of thief with ishbosheth name baanah and rechab which come on a day in to ishbosheth where he lay and sleep and there they slew he and take privily he head and bring it in to david in hebron and say : lo here be the head of thine enemy ishbosheth that seek to slay thee this day god have give to thee my lord vengeance of saul and of he seed david answer to they : by the living god that have deliver I from all anguish he that tell I that he have slay saul and have think to have have a reward of I i do do slay how much more ye that be so wicked to slay he that be not guilty in he house and upon he bed shall i not ask he blood of you hand and throw you out of this world yes certainly and david command to he servant to slay they and so they be slay and cut off they hand and foot and hang they on the piscine -lrb- pool -rrb- in hebron and take the head of ishbosheth and bury it in the sepulchre of abner and then come all the tribe of israel to david in hebron say : we be thy mouth and thy flesh when saul live and be king on we and reign thou wert come and go and because god have say thou shalt reign upon my people and be they governor therefore we shall obey thee and all the senior of israel come and do homage to david in hebron and anoint he king over they david be thirty year old when he begin to reign and he reign forty year he reign in hebron upon judah seven year and six month and in jerusalem he reign thirty-three year upon all israel and judah david then make he a dwelling-place in the hill of sion in jerusalem and after this the philistine make war against he but he oft overthrow they and slew many of they and make they tributary to he and after bring the ark of god in jerusalem and set it in he house after this yet the philistine make war again unto he and other king be aid and help they against david whom david overcome and slew and put under and on a time when joab be out with he man of war lie at a siege tofore a city david be at home and walk in he chamber and as he look out at a

he to send home to he uriah and joab send uriah to david and david demand how the host be rule and after bid he go home to he house and wash he foot and uriah go thence and the king send to he he dish with meat uriah would not go home but lay before the gate of the king 's house with other servant of the king 's and it be tell to the king that uriah go not home and then david say to uriah : thou comest from a far way why goest thou not home and uriah say to david : the ark of god and israel and judah be in the pavilion and my lord joab and the servant of thee my lord lie on the ground and would ye that i should go to my house by thy health and by the health of my soul i shall not do so then david say to uriah abide here then this night and to-morrow i shall deliver thee uriah abode there that day and the next and david make he eat tofore he and make he drunk yet for all that he would not go home but lay with the servant of david then on the morn david write a letter to joab that he should set uriah in the weakest place of the battle and where most jeopardy be and that he should be leave there that he might be slay and uriah bare this letter to joab and it be so do as david have write and uriah be slay in the battle and joab send word to david how they have fight and how uriah be slay and dead when uriah 's wife hear that she husband be dead she mourn and wail he and after the mourning david send for she and wed she and she bare he a son and this that david have commit on uriah displeased greatly we lord then we lord send nathan the prophet unto david which when he come say to he : there be two man dwelling in a city that one rich and that other poor the rich man have sheep and oxen right many but the poor man have but one little sheep which he buy and nourish and grow with he child eating of he bread and drinking of he cup and sleep in he bosom she be to he as a daughter and on a time when a certain pilgrim come to the rich man he spare he own sheep and ox to make a feast to the pilgrim that be come to he take the only sheep of the poor man and make meat thereof to he guest david be wroth and say to nathan : by the living god the man that have so do be the child of death the man that have so do shall yield therefor four time double then say nathan to david : thou art the same man that have do this thing this say the lord god of israel : i have anoint thee king upon israel and keep thee from the hand of saul and i have give to thee a house to keep in thine household and wife in thy bosom i have give to thee the house of israel and the house of judah and if these be small thing i shall add and give to thee much more and greater why hast thou therefore despise the word of god and hast do evil in the sight of we lord thou hast slay uriah with a sword and he wife hast thou take unto thy wife and thou hast slay he with the sword of the son of ammon therefore the sword shall not go from thy house world without end forasmuch as thou hast despise I and hast take uriah 's wife unto thy wife this say we lord : i shall raise evil against thee and shall take thy wife in thy sight and give they to thy neighbor thou hast do it privily but i shall make this to be do and open in the sight of all israel and then say david to nathan : peccavus i have sin against we lord nathan say : we lord have take away thy sin thou shalt not die but forasmuch as thou hast make the enemy to blaspheme the name of god therefore the son that be bear to thee shall die by death and nathan return to he house and for this sin david make this psalm : miserere mei deus -lrb- have pity on I o god -rrb- which be a psalm of mercy for david do great penance for these sin of adultery and also of homicide therefore god take away this sin and forgive it he but the son that she bring forth die and after this bathsheba that have be uriah 's wife bring forth another son name solomon which be well-beloved of god and after david solomon be king after this david have much war and trouble and anger insomuch that on a time amnon oldest son of david love thamar he sister david know hereof and be right sorry for it but he would not rebuke he son amnon for it for he love he because he be he first begotten son absalom hate amnon ever after and when absalom on a time do do shear he sheep he pray all he brethren to come eat with he and make they a feast like a king 's feast at which feast he do do slay he brother amnon and anon it be tell to the king david that absalom have slay all the king 's son wherefore the king be in great heaviness and sorrow but anon after it be tell he that there be no more slay but amnon and the other son come home and absalom flee into geshur and be there three year and durst not come home and after by the moyen of joab he be send for and come into jerusalem but yet he might not come in he father the king 's presence and dwell there two year and might not see the king he father this absalom be the fairest man that ever be for from the sole of he foot unto he head there be not a spot he have so much hair on he head that it grieve he to bear wherefore it be shear off once a year it weigh two hundred shekel of good weight then when he abide so long that he might not come to he father 's presence he send for joab to come speak with he and he would not come he send again for he and he come not then absalom say to he servant : know ye joab 's field that lieth by my field they say yea go ye say he and set fire in the barley that be therein and burn it and joab 's servant come and tell to joab that absalom have set fire on he corn then joab come to absalom and say : why hast thou set fire on my corn and he say i have send twice to thee pray thee to come to I that i might send thee to the king and that thou shouldst say to he why i come from geshur it have be better for I for to have abiden there i pray thee that i may come to he presence and see he visage and if he remember my wickedness let he slay I joab go in to the king and tell to he all these word then be absalom call and enter in to the king and he fall down and worship the king and the king kiss he after this absalom do do make for himself chariot and horseman and fifty man for to go before he and walk among the tribe of israel and greet and salute they take they by the hand and kiss they by which he gat to he the heart of the people and say to he father that he have avow to make sacrifice to god in hebron and he father give he leave and when he be there he gather people to he and make himself king and do do cry that all man should obey and wait on he as king of israel when david hear this he be sore abashed and be fain to flee out of jerusalem and absalom come with he people and enter into jerusalem into he father 's house and after pursued he father to depose he and david ordain he people and battle against he and send joab prince of he host against absalom and divide he host into three part and would have go with they but joab counsel that he should not go to the battle whatsomever hap and then david bid they to save he son absalom and they go forth and fight and absalom with he host be overthrow and put to flight and as absalom flee upon he mule he come under a oak and he hair fly about a bough of the tree and hold so fast that absalom hang by he hair and the mule run forth there come one to joab and tell he how that absalom hang by he hair on a bough of a oak and joab say : why hast thou not slay he the man say : god forbid that i should set hand on the king 's son i hear the king say : keep my son absalom alive and slay he not then joab go and take three spear and fix they in the heart of absalom as he hang on the tree by he hair and yet after this ten young man squire of joab run and slew he then joab trumped and blow the retreat and retain the people that they should not pursue the people fly and they take the body of absalom and cast it in a great pit and lay on he a great stone and when david know that he son be slay he make great sorrow and say : o my son absalom my son absalom who shall grant to I that i may die for thee my son absalom absalom my son it be tell to joab that the king weep and sorrow the death of he son absalom and all they victory be turn into sorrow and wail insomuch that the people eschew to enter into the city then joab enter in to the king and say : thou hast this day discourage the cheer of all thy servant because they have save thy life and the life of thy son and daughter of thy wife and of thy concubine thou lovest they that hate thee and hatest they that love thee and showest well this day that thou settest little by thy duke and servant and truly i know now well that if absalom have live and all we thy servant have be slay thou haddest be pleased therefore arise now and come forth and satisfy the people or else i swear to thee by the good lord that there shall not one of thy servant abide with thee till to-morrow and that shall be worse to thee than all the harm and evil that ever yet fall to thee then david the king arise and sit in the gate and anon it be show to all the people that the king sit in the gate and then all the people come in tofore the king and they of israel that have beerv with absalom flee into they tabernacle and after come again unto david when they know that absalom be dead and after one sheba a cursed man rebel and gather people against david against whom joab with the host of david pursued and drive he unto a city which he besiege and by the means of a woman of the same city sheba 's head be smite off and deliver to joab over the wall and so the city be save and joab pleased after this david call joab and bid he number the people of israel and so joab walk through all the tribe of israel from dan to beersheba and over jordan and all the country and there be founden in israel eight hundred thousand strong man that be able to fight and to draw sword and of the tribe of judah fifty thousand fight man and after that the people be number the heart of david be smite by we lord and be heavy and say : i have sin greatly in this deed but i pray the lord to take away the wickedness of thy servant for i have do follily david rise on the morn early and the word of we lord come to gad the prophet say : that he should go to david and bid he choose one of three thing that he should say to he when gad come to david he say that he should choose whether he would have seven year hunger in he land or three month he should flee he adversary and enemy or to have three day ' pestilence of these three god biddeth thee choose which thou wilt now advise thee and conclude what i shall answer to we lord david say to gad : i be constrain to a great thing but it be better for I to put I in the hand of we lord for he mercy be much more than in man and so he choose pestilence then we lord send pestilence the time constitute and there die of the people from dan to beersheba seventy thousand man and when the angel extend he hand upon jerusalem for to destroy it we lord be merciful upon the affliction and say to the angel so smite : it sufficeth now withdraw thy hand david say to we lord when he see the angel smite the people : i be he that have sin and do wickedly what have these sheep do i beseech thee that thy hand turn upon I and upon the house of my father then come gad to david and bid he make a altar in the same place where he see the angel and he buy the place and make the altar and offer sacrifice unto we lord and we lord be merciful and the plague cease in israel david be old and feeble and see that he death approach and ordain that he son solomon should reign and be king after he howbeit that adonijah he son take on he to be king during david 's life for which cause bathsheba and nathan come to david and tofore they he say that solomon should be king and ordain that he should be set on he mule by he prophet nathan zadok the priest and benaiah and bring in to sion and there zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint he king upon israel and blow in a trump and say : live the king solomon and from thence they bring he into jerusalem and set he upon he father 's seat in he father 's throne and david worship he in he bed and say : bless be the lord god of israel that have suffer I to see my son in my throne and seat and then adonijah and all they that be with he be afear and dread solomon run away and so cease adonijah the day of david approach fast that he should die and do do call solomon before he and there he command he to keep the commandment of we lord and walk in he way and to observe he ceremony he precept and he judgment as it be write in the law of mose and say : we lord confirm thee in thy reign and send to thee wisdom to rule it well and when david have thus counsel and command he to do justice and keep god 's law he bless he and die and be bury with he father this david be a holy man and make the holy psalter which be a holy book and be contain therein the old law and the new law he be a great prophet for he prophesy the come of christ he nativity he passion and resurrection and also he ascension and be great with god yet god would not suffer he to build a temple for he for he have shed man 's blood but god say to he he son that should reign after he should be a man peaceable and he should build the temple to god and when david have reign forty year king of jerusalem over judah and israel he die in good mind and be bury with he father in the city of david the song of david he sing of

friend ask why i have read this long-time-ago bible-story as a text for a sermon to-day i will not only answer but thank they for the question for nothing help a speaker at the start so much as a straight intelligent question i have read this story from the chronicle because i want to connect this beautiful occasion with some beautiful thing in the bible for beautiful thing go together my main object and desire in this service be to have everything beautiful and pure and high for i know how well you will remember this day in after year i know how every feature and incident be imprint itself upon you mind i know how twenty and forty year hence when we older one will be dead and go and you will be scatter far and wide some in the great city -- new york chicago st loui -- some in californium and some further off still -- i know how on quiet June sunday year hence you will recall this festival of flower in north adam you may be in some of the great city or on the broad prairie or among the park-like forest of the sierra or in puget sound but you will never forget this day these familiar wall this pulpit and font and chancel deck with flower this service make _ for _ you and in part _ by _ you -- you will never forget it and because you will always remember it i want to have it throughout just as beautiful just as pure and inspiring as possible the flower will do they part they never fail to speak sweet pure word to we you superintendent always do he part well and i hope you will all thank he in you heart if not in word for he faithful and laborious interest in you and you teacher and other who have bring together this wealth of beauty this glory of color and perfume this tribute of sweetness from mountain-side and field and garden -- they have do well and you will remember it all year hence and when far away and perhaps some tear will start for the day that be no more but this occasion would not be complete to my mind if there be not link with it some noble and inspiring trutn i want to make all these flower and this music the setting of a truth like a diamond set round with emerald or a opal with pearl _ you _ have bring the pearl and the emerald _ i _ must bring a diamond or a opal to set in the midst of they i be very sure that i have one in this old story -- a diamond very brilliant if we brush away the old hebrew dust and cut away the side and let in a little more light upon it i be not sure however but i ought to call it a pearl rather than a diamond for there be a chaste and gentle modesty about it that remind one of the soft lustre of a pearl rather than of the flash splendor of a diamond st john in name the precious stone that make the foundation of the heavenly city omit the diamond -- and for some good reason i suspect -- while the twelve gate be all pearl now i think david stand very near one of those gate of pearl at the time of this story to my mind it be nearly the most beautiful in all this book and i know you will listen while i tell it more fully i have this impression of david -- that if you have see he when he be young you would have think he the most glorious human be you have ever look on he be one of those person who fascinate all who come near they he bind everybody to he in a wonderful way they not only _ like _ he but they become absorb in he and be ready to obey he and serve he and to give themselves up to he in every way possible i be not at all surprise that saul 's son and daughter and saul himself fall in love with and could hardly live without he it be so all along and even after he become a old man everybody be fascinate by he -- even he old uncle -- and stand ready to do he bidding and consult he wish it be somewhat so with richard coeur de lion and napoleon and mary stuart and alexander and julius cæsar but the personal fascination of none of these person be so great as that of david in some respects he be no greater than some of these but he have a broader and more lovable nature than any of they for he have what not one of they have in anything like the same degree -- a great and noble generosity david deserve all the love that be lavish upon he because -- let man love he ever so much -- he love more in return there be not apparently at this early time of he life one grain of selfishness about he you know that the word _ chivalry _ be not use till about a thousand year back while david live almost three time as long ago but he be one of the most _ chivalrous _ man that ever live by chivalry i mean a union of honor purity religion nobleness bravery and devotion to a cause or person david excite this chivalric devotion in other because he have so much of it in himself and here i will stop a moment just to say that if you want to awaken any feeling in another toward yourself you must first have it in yourself i think there be a very general notion that in order to awaken admiration and love and regard in other one must have a fine appearance there be a great deal of misplace faith in fine clothes and bright eye and clear complexion and pretty feature but i have yet to learn that these ever win genuine love and admiration and so far as i have observe a true sentiment only grow out of a corresponding sentiment feeling come from feeling in short other come at last to feel toward we just about as we feel toward they and i never know a person young or old to show a kind generous hearty disposition to other who be not surround by friend and i have see -- i know not how many -- selfish and unobliging and unsympathetic person go friendless all they day in spite of wealth and fine appearance now put this away in you memory to think of hereafter it be david 's great-heartedness that bind other to he at the time of this story he be a sort of outlaw drive without any good reason from the court of saul but he be a man of too much spirit to allow himself to be tamely kill and he love saul and he family too well to actually make war upon he and he be too good a patriot to give trouble to he country -- a pretty hard place he have to fill i can assure you but he be equal to it and simply bide he time draw off into the wild and rocky region where he could hide and also protect himself but he be not a man whom people would leave alone the magnetic power that be in he draw kindred spirit and some that be not kindred who find it pleasanter to follow a chief in the wild than to live in the dull quiet of they home but the greater part of they be brave generous devoted soul who have come to the conclusion that to live with david and fight he battle and share he fortune be more enjoyable than to plod along under saul and he petty tyranny there be in particular eleven man of the tribe of gad -- mountaineer -- fierce as lion and swift as roe terrible man in battle and full of devotion to david in this way he get together quite a little army which he use to defend the border from the philistine who be a thieving set and also to defend himself in case saul trouble he it be not exactly the best sort of a life for a man to live and have not david be a person of very high principle he follower would have be a band of robber live on the country but david prevent that and make they as useful as be possible he headquarters be at the cave of adullam or what be now call engedus while here the philistine come on a forage expedition as far as bethlehem and with so large a force that david and he few follower be shut up in they fortress -- for how long we do not know -- probably for some day it be very dull and wearisome business imprison in a rocky defile and unable to do anything while the philistine be steal the harvest that grow on the very spot where he have spend he boyhood it be then that what have always seem to I a very touching and beautiful trait of david 's character show itself and that be -- _ a feeling of homesickness _ now there be very little respect to be have for a person who be not capable of homesickness to give up to it may be weak but to be incapable of it be a bad sign but in david it take a very poetic form close by be the home where he be bear there in bethlehem he have pass the dreamy year of he childhood and youth amid the love of he parent and brother whom he now have with he there he feed he sheep and sing to he harp and there morning and evening he gather with other about the well -- the meeting-place of he companion -- love with all the passionate energy of he nature and still love in spite of the troublous time that have come upon he as david brood over these memory he long with a yearning homesick feeling for bethlehem and its well and like a poet as he be he conceive that if he could but drink of its water it would relieve this feverish unrest and longing for the past it be a very natural feeling you be too young to know what it mean but we who be older think of these little thing in a strange yearning way it be the little thing of childhood that we long for -- to lie under the roof on which we hear the rain patter year and year ago to gather fruit in the old orchard to fish in the same stream to sit on the same rock or under the same elm or maple and see the sun go down behind the same old hill to drink from the same spring that refresh we in summer day that will not come again -- _ you _ be too young for this but we who be older know well how david feel he be not a man to hide he feeling and so he utter he longing for the water of the well by the gate of bethlehem he word be overhear and three of these terrible follower of he -- fierce as lion and fleet as deer -- take they sword and fight they way through the philistine slaying we know not how many and bring back some of the water it be enough for _ they _ that david want it now some people would say that it be very foolish and sentimental of david to be indulge in such a whim and still more foolish in these man to gratify it at the risk of they life but i think there be a better way of look at it if david have _ require _ they to procure the water at the risk of they life it would have be very wrong but the whole thing be unknown to he till the water be bring i prefer to regard it as a act of splendid heroism prompt by chivalric devotion and i will not stop to consider whether or not it be sensible and prudent and i want to say to you that whenever you see or hear of a action that have these quality of heroism and generosity and devotion it be well to admire and praise it whether it will bear the test of cold reason or not i hope you heart will never get to be so dry and hard that they will not beat responsive to brave and noble deed even if they be not exactly prudent but david take even a higher view of this brave and tender act of he lion-faced deer-footed follower it awake he religious feeling for we sense of what be noble and generous and brave lie very close to we religious sensibility the whole event pass in david 's mind into the field of religion and so what do he do drink the water and praise he three mighty warrior and bid they never again run such risk to gratify he chance wish no david look a great deal further into the matter than this the act seem to he to have a religious character its devotion be so complete and unselfish that it become sacred he feel what i have just say -- that a brave and devoted act that incur danger be almost if not quite a religious act and so he treat it in a religious way he be anxious to separate it from himself although do for he and get it into a service do for god and he may have think that he have himself be a little selfish to he mind it would have be a mean and low repayment to these man to drink they water with loud praise of they valor they have do a godlike deed and so he will transfer it to god and make it a act as between they and god i do not know that those lion-faced deer-footed warrior understand or appreciate he treatment of they act but david himself very well know what he be about and you can see that he act in a very high and true way he will not drink the water but pour it out unto the lord and let it sink into the ground unused and because unused a sort of sacrifice and offer to god water get with such valor and risk be not for man but for god much less be it right to use it to gratify a dreamy whim that have in it perhaps just a touch of selfishness the bravery and danger have make the water sacred and so he will make a sacred use of it if any one think that david be carry away by sentimentality or that he be overscrupulous one have only to recall how when _ actually _ in want he take the consecrate bread from the tabernacle at nob and eat it and give it to he follower he strong common-sense tell he that even consecrate bread be not too good for hungry man but that same fine common-sense tell he that water procure at the risk of life when not actually want have become sacred and have better be turn into a sort of prayer and offer to god than wantonly drunk and now have the story well in mind i will close by draw out from it one or two lesson that seem to I very practical suppose we be to ask who act in the noblest way -- the three strong man who get the water or david who make a sacrifice or libation of it it do not take we long to answer the real greatness of the whole affair be with the three man though david put a beautiful meaning upon it and exalt it to its true place they act be very brave and lofty but david crown it with its highest grace by carry it on into religion -- that be by set it before god i see a great many people who be live worthy life do a great many kind act and render beautiful service but do not take god into they thought nor render they service as unto he i think everybody must see that this act of these lion-faced man be more complete when david take it before god than as render for himself why it might take long to tell but briefly it be because the nameless grace of religion have be add to it and because it be connect with that great dear name that hallow everything bring under it many of you have bring here offering of flower sweet and fit for this day and place and purpose some may have bring they simply with the thought of help out the occasion or to please you teacher or because it be beautiful in itself to heap up beauty in this large way but if as you work here yesterday or bring you flower to-day you thought silently rise to god say these be for _ thy _ altar -- this glory of tint and perfume be not for we but for _ thee _ -- then i think every poet every person of fine feeling every true thinker would say that the latter be more beautiful than the former i hate to see a life that do not take hold of god i hate to see fine act and brave life and noble disposition and generous emotion that do not reach up into a sense of god i hate to see person -- and i see a great many such nowadays -- strive after beautiful life and true sentiment and large thought without ever a word of prayer or thought of god or anything to show they love and venerate christ i hate to see it both because they might rise so much higher and because at last it fail for god must enter into every thought and sentiment and purpose in order to make it genuine and truly beautiful and altogether right that god may be in you thought that you may learn to confess he in all you way to serve and fear and know and love he -- this be the wish with which i greet you to-day and the prayer that i offer in you behalf i find the other day some line by faber -- a catholic poet -- so beautifully give this last thought of we sermon that i will read they to you : oh god who be my childhood 's love my boyhood 's pure delight a presence feel the livelong day a welcome fear at night i know not what i thought of thee what picture i have make of that eternal majesty to whom my childhood pray with age thou grewest more divine more glorious than before i fear thee with a deeper fear because i love thee more thou broadenest out with every year each breath of life to meet i scarce can think thou art the same thou art so much more sweet father what hast thou grow to now a joy all joy above something more sacred than a fear more tender than a love with gentle swiftness lead I on dear god to see thy face and meanwhile in my narrow heart oh make thyself more space the history of solomon after david reign solomon he son which be in the begin a good man and walk in the way and law of god and all the king about he make peace with he and be king confirm obey and peaceable in he possession and accord to he father 's commandment do justice first on joab that have be prince of he father 's host because he slew two good man by treason and guile that be abner the son of ner and amasa the son of ithra and joab be afeard and dreaded solomon and flee into the tabernacle of we lord and hold the end of the altar and solomon send benaiah and slew he there and after bury he in he house in desert and after this on a night as he lay in he bed after he have sacrifice to we lord in gibeon we lord appear to he in he sleep say to he : ask and demand what thou wilt that i may give to thee and solomon say : lord thou hast do to my father great mercy because he walk in thy way in truth justice and a rightful heart thou hast always keep for he thy great mercy and hast give to he a son sit upon this throne as it be this day and now lord thou hast make I thy servant to reign for my father david i be a little child and know not my go out and enter in and i thy servant be set in the middle of the people that thou hast choose which be infinite and may not be number for multitude therefore lord give to I thy servant a heart docile and teach in wisdom that may judge thy people and discern between good and evil who may judge this people thy people that be so many this request and demand pleased much unto god that solomon have ask such a thing and god say to solomon : because thou hast require and ask this and hast not ask long life ne riches ne the soul of thine enemy but hast ask sapience and wisdom to discern doom and judgment i have give to thee after thy desire and request and i have give to thee a wise heart and understand insomuch that there be never none such tofore ne never after shall be and also those thing that thou hast not ask i have give also to thee that be to say riches and glory that no man shall be like to thee among all the king that shall be after thy day if thou walk in my way and keep my precept and observe my commandment as thy father walk i shall make thy day long after this solomon awake and come to jerusalem and stand tofore the ark of we lord and offer sacrifice and victim unto we lord and make a great feast unto all he servant and household then come tofore he two woman of which that one say : i beseech thee my lord hear I this woman and i dwell together in one house and i be deliver of a child in my cubicle -lrb- sleep

the morning for to give milk to my son it appear dead whom i take behold he diligently in the clear light understand well anon that it be not my son that i have bear the other woman answer and say : it be not so as thou sayest but my son liveth and thine be dead and contrary that other say : thou liest : my son liveth and thine be dead thus in this wise they strive tofore the king then the king say : this woman saith my son liveth and thine be dead and this answereth nay but thy son be dead and mine liveth then the king say : bring to I here a sword when they have bring forth a sword the

be to all people every man that shall go thereby shall be abashed and astonied and shall say : why have god do thus to this land and to thy house and they shall answer : for they have forsake they lord god that bring they out of the land of egypt and have follow strange god and they adore and worship and therefore god have bring on they all this evil : here may every man take ensample how perilous and dreadful it be to break the commandment of god twenty year after that solomon have edify the temple of god and he house and finish it perfectly hiram the king of tyre go for to see town that solomon have give to he and they please he not hiram have send to king solomon a hundred and twenty besant of gold which he have spend on the temple and he house and on the wall of jerusalem and

speak to king solomon all that ever she have in she heart and solomon teach she in all that ever she purpose tofore he she could say nothing but that the king answer to she there be nothing hide from

hundred and twenty besant of gold many aromatic and gem precious there be never see tofore so many aromatic ne so sweet odor smell as the queen of sheba give to king solomon king solomon give to the queen of sheba all that ever she desire and demand of he and after return into she country and land the weight of pure gold that be offer every year to solomon be six hundred and sixty-six talent of gold except that that the merchant offer and all they that sell and all the king of arabium and duke of that land solomon make two hundred shield of the purest gold and set they in the house of

gold and silver tooth of elephant and great riches the king solomon be magnify above all the king of the world in riches and wisdom and all the world desire to see the cheer and visage of solomon and to hear he wisdom that god have give to he every man bring to he gift vessel of gold and silver clothes and armor for war aromatic horse and mule every year solomon gather together chariot and horseman he have a thousand four hundred chariot and car and twelve thousand horseman and be lodge in small city and town about jerusalem by the king there be as great abundance and plenty of gold and silver in those day in jerusalem as stone or sycamore that grow in the field and horse be bring to he from egypt and chao what shall i all day write of the riches glory and magnificence of king solomon it be so great that it can not be express for there be never none like to he ne never shall none come after he like unto he he make the book of the parable contain thirty-one chapter the book of the canticle the book of ecclesiaste contain twelve chapter and the book of sapience contain nineteen chapter this king solomon love overmuch woman and specially strange woman of other sect as king pharaoh 's daughter and many other of the gentile he have seven hundred wife which be as queen and three hundred concubine and these woman turn he heart for when he be old he so dote and love they that they make he honor they strange god and worship ashtareth chemosh and moloch idol of zidonium of moabite and ammonite and make to they tabernacle for to please he wife and concubine wherefore god be wroth with he and say to he : because thou hast not observe my precept and my commandment that i command thee i shall cut thy kingdom and divide it and give it to thy servant but not in thy day i shall not do it for love that i have to david thy father but from the hand of thy son i shall cut it but not all i shall reserve to he one tribe for david 's love and jerusalem that i have choose and after this diver king become adversary to solomon and be never in peace after it be say but i find it not in the bible that solomon repent he much of this sin of idolatry and do much penance therefor for he let he be draw through jerusalem and beat himself with rod and scourge that the blood flow in the sight of all the people he reign upon all israel in jerusalem forty year and die and be bury with he father in the city of david and rehoboam he son reign after he the history of rehoboam after solomon reign he son rehoboam he come to sichem and thither come all the people for to ordain he king jeroboam and all the multitude of israel spake to rehoboam and say : thy father set on we a hard yoke and great imposition now thou hast not so much need therefore less it and minish it and ease we of the great and hard burden and we shall serve thee rehoboam answer and say : go ye and come again the third day and ye shall have a answer when the people be depart rehoboam make a counsel of the senior and old man that have assist he father solomon while he live and say to they : what say ye and counsel I that i may answer to the people which say to rohoboam : if thou wilt obey and agree to this people and agree to they petition and speak fair and friendly to they they shall serve thee always but rehoboam forsake the counsel of the old man and call the young man that be of he age and ask of they counsel and the young man that have be nourish with he bid he say to the people in this wise : be not my finger greater than the back of my father if my father have lay on you a heavy burden i shall add and put more to you burden my father beat you with scourge and i shall beat you with scorpion the third day after jeroboam and all the people come to rehoboam to have they answer and rehoboam leave the counsel of the old man and say to they like as the young man have counsel he and anon the people of israel forsake rehoboam and of twelve tribe there abide with he no more but the tribe of judah and benjamin and the other ten tribe depart and make jeroboam they king and never return unto the house of david after unto this day and thus for sin of solomon and because rehoboam would not do after the counsel of the old man but be counsel by young man the ten tribe of israel forsake he and depart from jerusalem and serve jeroboam and ordain he king upon israel anon after this jeroboam fall to idolatry and great division be ever after between the king of judah and the king of israel and so reign diver king each after other in jerusalem after rehoboam and in israel after jeroboam and here i leave all the history and make a end of the book of king for this time etc for ye that list to know how every king reign after other ye may find it in the first chapter of saint matthew which be read on christmas day in the morning before te deum which be the genealogy of we lady a little maid by theodore t munger -lrb- from lamp and path by courtesy of houghton mifflin & co -rrb- in old day we read of angel who come and take man by the hand and lead they away from the city of destruction we see no white-robed angel now yet man be lead away from threaten destruction : a hand be put into theirs and they be gently guide toward a bright and calm land so that they look no more backward and the hand may be that of a little child -- george eliot as aromatic plant bestow no spicy fragrance while they grow but crushed or trodden to the ground diffuse they balmy sweet around -- goldsmith : _ the captivity _ _ now naaman captain of the host of the king of syrium be a great man with he master and honorable because by he the lord have give deliverance unto syrium : he be also a mighty man in valor but he be a leper and the syrian have go out by company and have bring away captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she wait on naaman 's wife and she say unto she mistress would god my lord be with the prophet that be in samarium for he would recover he of he leprosy _ -- 2 king v 1-3 i think upon the whole that old story be better than new one i mean story of old time it be perhaps because only the very best be remember while the poorer one be forget so that those which have come down to we through past age be the choice one select from a great number that pleased people for a while but not well nor long enough to get fix in they mind of all old story i hardly know a better one than this of naaman and the little maid from samaria it be full of human nature that be it show that people act and feel three thousand year ago just as they do now : they be kind and sympathetic and proud and grateful and covetous and deceitful just as people be nowadays and the story have a fine romantic setting that be its incident take hold of we fancy and charm we -- a little girl steal in war and carry to a foreign country and put into the house of a great general who fall very ill and be cure in a wonderful way and so on i think it will please we all to hear it over again syrium and israel stand to each other very much like germany and switzerland one be a great rich country with fine river like the rhine and danube and a capital city so beautiful that it be call the eye of the east while israel be a small country full of mountain and with only one small river that run nearly dry in summer to tell the truth syrium look down on israel and -- what be worse -- often make war on it in those day war be even more cruel and senseless than it be now for it be not confine to the army that fight and capture one another but extend to woman and child who be often seize carry away from they home into the country of the enemy and make slave it be bad and senseless enough for man to stand up and stab one another as they use to in old time or shoot one another as they do now but to carry a mother away from she child or take a little girl away from she home and playmate and make a slave of she be something worse but it be often do in those ancient day as you will learn when you read history and the story of the siege of troy which spring out of steal a beautiful woman there be frequent war between syrium and israel israel have once conquer syrium and syrium have break away and so it go on back and forth year after year when we story begin naaman a great general have deliver he country from israel and bring home with he a little hebrew girl who be so beautiful and sweet in she way that he give she to he wife on he return from the war a strange present you say but it prove a very valuable one it seem to we very cruel one would think that if naaman and he wife love this little girl -- and i be sure they do -- they would have send she back to she home for she must have have a heartbreaking time of it at first but people be not kind in that way in those day yes i be sure they love she and be kind to she for the simple reason that she evidently love they and i be also sure that the reason they love she be that they could not help it as we shall see further on not long after the war naaman be attack with a disease so dreadful and repulsive that i can not describe it to you let we be thankful that leprosy be unknown here it be not only incurable but as it go on it become so terrible that one can not stay at home with he family but must go out and live alone or with other leper and wait for death which often do not happen for year it be a sad time for the great naaman when he discover that it have seize he he feel well and strong but the fearful sign make it sure it be a sadder time when he tell he wife for both know that the day would soon come when they could no longer stay together at home and that he must leave beautiful damascus and give up he place in the army and go off into the mountain and live alone or with other like himself the saddest feature of all be that there be no hope : all this be sure to take place if you have ever be in a house where some one be very ill and likely to die or some terrible accident have occur you have feel what a gloom overhang it and have be glad to escape from it and get out under the open sky but we little hebrew girl could not escape she must stay through it all and wait on naaman 's wife and see she weep and naaman 's strong face grow sadder every day now i think we shall begin to see what a rare noble sweet child this be that we be talk about what a pity that we do not know she name -- for she be a nameless child i would like to call she anna if i have any right to leave off the _ h _ that the hebrew put before and after this beautiful name and i should not change it by turn the _ a _ at the close into _ ie _ as so many young people -- and older one too who ought to know better -- be in the habit of do for i never could understand why girl with so noble name as anna and mary and helen and margaret and caroline should change they into the weak and silly form that we hear every day this change which usually shorten the name and end it with a _ ie _ be call a _ diminutive _ which accord to worcester mean a thing little of its kind and so may well enough be use in the nursery but that grown woman should use it seem to I foolish and even ignoble and i often fear it may indicate a lack of fine sentiment we do not know the name of we little maiden but we can safely imagine she appearance for two reason : we know she circumstance and she character be it not quite sure that when naaman select from he captive a little girl to wait on he wife he would take the most beautiful one when we make present to those we love we always get the best we can now we can go a step further and ask what make she beautiful _ in such a way _ that naaman think she would please he wife it must have be she sweet and amiable expression and that come from she character for nothing else can make beauty of this sort and so we picture she with black wavy hair and soft dark eye with red cheek glowing through a olive-colored skin lip like a pomegranate a sweet patient loving expression and a voice gentle and low and full of sympathy and readiness i be very sure about she voice and expression because i know she character i never have see any one with a loving and helpful spirit who have not a gentle voice and a sweet expression i think she must have be about twelve year old for if she have be younger she would not have know all about elisha and if older she would not have be call a _ little _ maid when the trouble come upon naaman 's family she feel it grievously and be more attentive and gentle in she service than ever just here she show the beauty of she character she have be cruelly wrong -- steal away from she country and home and make a slave without hope of ever see they again -- and so might naturally feel revengeful and say that naaman 's leprosy be a punishment for the wrong he have do she but instead she pity he and in she sympathy with he suffering forget she own so as she brood on the trouble she happen to remember one day that elisha have cure people who be very ill and do many wonderful thing and she say to she mistress would god my lord be with the prophet that be in samarium for he would recover he of he leprosy probably naaman 's wife question she closely about elisha and get at all she know about he and so hear about the child that fall sick among the reaper and the poor widow whose two son be to be sell as slave and the mantle of elijah that elisha have catch upon the bank of the jordan with which he smite the water at any rate she hear enough to awaken some hope and so tell she husband what we little maid have say when people be hopelessly ill they be willing to try anything a drown man will catch at a straw and naaman catch at this little straw of hope that the wind of war have blow across he path he think it over and say to himself it be my only chance no one here can do anything for I i will go down to samarium and find elisha i have often hear that the prophet there do wonderful thing if what the little maid say of the boy among the reaper be true perhaps elisha can cure I and so he go but it be very humiliating he think of israel and the little city of samarium and the jordan in a scornful way compare they with he splendid damascus and its green beautiful plain thirty mile wide and the great river abana that gush from the side of the mountain and flow through and all about the city make the whole country one vast garden he despise too the people of israel they be rude and poor and ignorant while he own people be rich and cultivate perhaps he have bear himself proudly when he be at war there and now to go back and ask favor -- to ask for himself what he could not get at home -- be humiliating indeed but he make the best of it and to cover he pride and make it seem as though he be not ask favor he take with he a immense amount of silver and gold and ten suit of raiment -- perhaps of linen _ damask _ that be first make in damascus i shall not follow the story further except to say that because naaman go in such a proud spirit elisha use every mean to make he humble he seem to be anxious to send naaman home not only a well but a better man and to teach he that there be other thing to be think of than great river and fine city and temple of rimmon especially he want to teach he that the one true god could make a small rough nation greater and stronger than one that worship idol naaman go home cure of he leprosy with some earth to make a altar of and all he gold and silver and fine garment except what the foolish gehazus get from he by lie how naaman propose to act when he should get home and be force to go with the king into the temple of rimmon you will find discuss in the second chapter of the second part of school day at rugby my opinion be that elisha tell he he must settle that matter with he own conscience but i can imagine that when he have worship god before the altar build of the earth bring from the jordan and then go into the temple of rimmon and do what the king do he conscience must have trouble he but i care a great deal more for we little maid than for naaman i wonder what become of she if naaman do what he ought he send she back to she home and give she all the gold and silver he have offer to elisha i be quite inclined to believe this for several reason naaman be a _ reasonable _ man when he be tell to go and wash himself seven time in jordan he be surprised and angry because it be so different from what he have expect and because he think it be a insult to he own great river but when he servant remind he that it be just as easy to do a little thing as a great thing he see the wisdom of it and let good sense triumph over pride he be also a _ generous _ man as the gift he offer to elisha show and he be _ conscientious _ or he would not have ask elisha about bow down in the temple of rimmon as a part of he duty to the king all through he show himself _ grateful _ yes i think he go back to syria not only with the flesh of a little child but with a child 's heart and because he be reasonable and generous and conscientious and grateful he do not forget the little maid who be at the bottom of the whole affair he owe quite as much to she as to elisha for people who start good enterprise deserve more praise and reward than those who carry they out so when he reach home and meet he wife and child -- why it be almost like come back from the dead -- he first thought must have be of the little maid we can imagine the great naaman take she in he arm with tear and say what can i do for you my little maid tell I what you most want and i will give it to you even if it be the half of my possession we know that eastern prince often say such thing when they fancy or they gratitude be deeply stir they give full course to all they feeling good and bad perhaps she have become fond of naaman 's wife and would like to stay with she perhaps they tell she they would adopt she and clothe she with rich damask and jewel of gold and silver but i doubt if she be a child who care more for such thing than for she parent and she home and as she hear the story of naaman 's cure and of elisha and the jordan she mind go back to she native land and to she home and a great longing fill she heart to see it again and to live the old life with she parent and brother and sister the jew do not easily forget they country nor they family and this little maid be a true jewess it might be a fine thing to live in a palace and wear jewel but she would rather go home and tend the sheep and goat and pick the grape and go to the fountain for water perhaps she have live on the slope of hermon where the dew fall heavily every night and the brook run full all summer for naaman 's march home lead near it we find she in damascus a slave but we will leave she at home among the vine and flower and kid with father and mother and mate for sh ' e be a child who live in she affection rather than in she ambition the chief thing she teach we be the beauty and blessedness of return good for evil long before christ 's day she be christ 's own child for she love she enemy and pray for those who have persecute she here followeth the history of job _ read on the first Sunday of September _ there be a man in the land of uz name job and this man be simple rightful and dread god and go from all

unto jerusalem till the mount of ethiopium for to obey and hold of he which all gainsay he with one will and without worship send home he messenger void and set nought by he then nebuchadnezzar have they at great indignation swear by he reign and by he throne that he would avenge he on they all and thereupon call all he duke prince and man of war and hold a counsel in which be decree that he should subdue all the world unto he empire and thereupon he ordain holoferne prince of he knighthood and bid he go forth and in especial against they that have despise he empire and bid he spare no

jerusalem and destroy the temple for nebuchadnezzar have command that he should extinct all the god of the earth and that no god should be name ne worship but he himself of all the nation that holoferne should subdue eliachim then priest in israel write unto all they in the mountain that they should keep the strait way of the mountain and so the child of israel do as the priest have ordain then eliachim the priest go about all israel and say to they : know ye that god have hear you prayer if ye abide and continue in you prayer and fasting in the sight of god remember ye of mose the servant of god which overthrow amalek trusting in he strength and in he power in he host in he helmet in he chariot and in he horseman not fight with iron but with pray of holy prayer in like wise shall it be with all the enemy of israel if ye persevere in this work that ye have begin with this exhortation they continue pray god they persevere in the sight of god and also they that offer to we lord be clothe with sackcloth and have ash on they head and with all they heart they pray god to visit he people israel it be tell to holoferne prince of the knighthood of the assyrian that the child of israel make they ready to resist he and have close the way of the mountain and he be burn in overmuch fury in great ire he call all the prince of moab and duke of ammon and say to they : say ye to I what people be this that besiege the mountain or what or how many city have they and what be they virtue and what multitude be of they or who be king of they knighthood then achior duke of all of they of ammon answering say : if thou deignest to hear I i shall tell thee truth of this people that dwelleth in the mountain and there shall not issue out of my mouth one false word this people dwell first in mesopotamium and be of the progeny of the chaldee but would not dwell there for they would not follow the god of they father that be in the land of chaldee and go and leave the ceremony of they father which be in the multitude of many god they honor one god of heaven which command they to go thence that they should dwell in canaan then after be there much hunger that they descend into egypt and there abide four hundred year and multiply that they might not be number when the king of egypt grieve they in he building bear clay tile and subdue they they cry to they lord and he smite the land of egypt with diver plague when they of egypt have cast they out from they the plague cease from they and then they would have take they again and would have call they to they service and they flee they god open the sea to they that they go through dry-foot in which the innumerable host of the egyptian pursue they be drown that there be not one of they save for to tell to they that come after they they pass thus the red sea and he feed they with manna forty year and make bitter water sweet and give they water out of a stone and wheresoever this people enter without bow or arrow shield or sword they god fight for they and there be no man may prevail against this people but when they depart from the culture and honor of they god and as oft as they have depart from they god and worship other strange god so oft have they be overcome with they enemy and when they repent and come to the knowledge of they sin and cry they god mercy they be restore again and they god giveth to they virtue to resist they enemy they have overthrow cananeum the king jebusee pheresee eneum etheum and amoreum and all the mighty man in esebon and have take they land and city and possess they and shall as long as they please they god they god hateth wickedness for tofore this time when they go from the law that they god give to they he suffer they to be take of many nation into captivity and be disperpled and now late they be come again and possess jerusalem wherein be sanctum sanctorum and be come over these mountain whereas some of they dwell now therefore my lord see and search if there be any wickedness of they in the sight of they god and then let we go to they for they god shall give they into thy hand and they shall be subdue under the yoke of thy power and when achior have say thus all the great man about holoferne be angry and have think for to have slay he say each to other : who be this that may make the child of israel resist the king nebuchadnezzar and he army and host man coward and without might and without any wisdom of war therefore that achior may know that he saith not true let we ascend the mountain and when the mighty man of they be take let he be slay with they that all man may know that nebuchadnezzar be god of the earth and that there be none other but he then when they cease to speak holoferne have indignation say to achior : because thou hast prophesy to we of the child of israel say that they god defend they i shall show to thee that there be no god but nebuchadnezzar for whom we have overcome they all and slay they as one man then shalt thou die with they by the sword of the assyrian and all israel shall be put into ruin and perdition and then shall be know that nebuchadnezzar be lord of all the earth and the sword of my knighthood shall pass through thy side and thou shalt depart hence and go to they and shalt not die unto the time that i have they and thee and when i have slay they with my sword thou shalt in like wise be slay with like vengeance after this holoferne command he servant to take achior and lead he to bethulium and to put he in the hand of they of israel and so they take achior and ascend the mountain against whom come out man of war then the servant of holoferne turn aside and bind achior to a tree hand and foot with cord and leave he and so return to they lord then the son of israel come down from bethulia loose and unbound he and bring he to bethulium and he be set amid the people be demand what he be and why he be so sore there bounden and he tell to they all the matter like as it be aforesaid and how holoferne have command he to be deliver unto they of israel then all the people fall down on to they face worship god and with great lamentation and weep with one will make they prayer unto we lord god of heaven and that he would behold the pride of they and to the meekness of they of israel and to take heed to the face of he hallow and show to they he grace and not forsake they and pray god to have mercy on they and defend they from they enemy and on that other side holoferne command he host to go up and assail bethulium and so go up of footman one hundred and twenty thousand and twelve thousand horseman and besiege the town and take they water from they insomuch that they that be in the town be in great penury of water for in all the town be not water enough for one day and such as they have be give to the people by measure then all the people young and old come to ozia which be they prince with charmi and gothoniel all with one voice cry : god the lord deem between we and thee for thou hast do to we evil what thou spakest not peaceably with assyrian for now we shall be deliver into the hand of they it be better for we to live in captivity under holoferne and live than to die here for thirst and see we wife and child die before we eye and when they have make this piteous cry and yell they go all to they church and there a long while prayed and cry unto god knowledge they sin and wickedness meekly beseech he to show he grace and pity on they then at last ozia arise up and say to the people : let we abide yet five day and if god send we no rescue ne help we not in that time that we may give glory to he name else we shall do as ye have say and when that judith hear thereof which be a widow and a bless woman and be leave widow three year and six month after that manass she husband die anon she go into the overest part of she house in which she make a privy bed which she and she servant close and have on she body a hair -lrb- hair cloth -rrb- have fast all the day of she life save sabbath and new moon and the feast of the house of israel she be a fair woman and she husband have leave she much riches with plentiful meiny and possession of drove of ox and flock of sheep and she be a famous woman and dreaded god greatly and when she have hear that ozia have say that the fifth day the city should be give over if god help they not she send for the priest chambri and charmi and say to they : what be this word in which ozia have consent that the city should be deliver to the assyrian if within five day there come no help to we and who be ye that tempt the lord god this word be not to stir god to mercy but rather to arouse wrath and woodness ye have set a time of mercy do by god and in you doom ye have ordain a day to he o good lord how patient be he let we ask he for forgiveness with weep tear he shall not threaten as a man ne inflame in wrath as a son of a man therefore meek we we soul to he and in a contrite spirit and meeked serve we to he and say we weep to god that after he will he show to we he mercy and as we heart be trouble in the pride of they so also of we humbleness and meekness let we be joyful for we have not follow the sin of we father that forsake they god and worship strange god wherefore they be give and be take into hideous and great vengeance into sword ravin and into confusion to they enemy we forsooth know no other god but he abide we meekly the comfort of he and he shall keep we from we enemy and he shall make all gentile that arise against he and shall make they without worship the lord we god and now ye brethren ye that be priest on whom hangeth the life of the people of god pray ye unto almighty god that he make I steadfast in the purpose that i have propose ye shall stand at the gate and i shall go out with my handmaid and pray ye the lord that he steadfast make my soul and do ye nothing till i come again and then judith go into she oratory and array she with she precious clothing and adornment and take unto she handmaid certain victuals such as she might lawfully eat and when she have make she prayer unto god she depart in she most noble array toward the gate whereas ozia and the priest abide she and when they see she they marvel of she beauty notwithstanding they let she go say : god of we father give thee grace and strengthen all the counsel of thine heart with he virtue and glory to jerusalem and be thy name in the number of saint and of righteous man and they all that be there say : aman and fiat fiat -lrb- let it be do -rrb- then she praise god pass through the gate and she handmaid with she and when she come down the hill about the spring of the day anon the spy of the assyrian take she saying : whence comest thou or whither goest thou the which answer : i be a daughter of the hebrew and flee from they know that they shall be take by you and come to holoferne for to tell he they privity and i shall show he by what entry he may win they in such wise as one man of he host shall not perish and the man that hear these word behold she visage and wonder of she beauty say to she : thou hast save thy life because thou hast founden such counsel come therefore to we lord for when thou shalt stand in he sight he shall accept thee and they lead she to the tabernacle of holoferne and when she come before he anon holoferne be catch by he eye and he tyrant knight say to he : who despise the people of jew that have so fair woman that not for they of right we ought to fight against they and so judith see holoferne sit in he canape that be of purple of gold smaragdo and precious stone within weave and when she have see he face she honor he fall down herself unto the earth and the servant of holoferne take she up he so commanding then holoferne say to she : be thou not afeard ne dread thee not i never grieve ne noyed man that would serve nebuchadnezzar thy people soothly if they have not despise I i have not raise my people ne strength against they now tell to I the cause why thou wentest from they and that it have pleased thee to come to we and judith say : take the word of thine handmaid and if thou follow they a perfect thing god shall do with thee forsooth nebuchadnezzar be the living king of the earth and thou hast he power for to chastise all people for man only serve not he but also the beast of the field obey to he he might be know over all and the child of israel shall be yield to thee for they god be angry with they for they wickedness they be enfamine and lack bread and water they be constrain to eat they horse and beast and to take such holy thing as be forbid in they law as wheat wine and oil all these thing god have show to I and they purpose to waste such thing as they ought not touch and therefore and for they sin they shall be put in the hand of they enemy and we lord have show I these thing to tell thee and i thine handmaid shall worship god and shall go out and pray he and come in and tell thee what he shall say to I in such wise that i shall bring thee through the middle of jerusalem and thou shalt have all the people of israel under thee as the sheep be under the shepherd insomuch there shall not a hound burk against thee and because these thing be say to I by the providence of god and that god be wroth with they i be send to tell thee these thing forsooth all these word pleased much to holoferne and to he people and they marvel of the wisdom of she and one say to another there be not such a woman upon earth in sight in fairness and in wit of word and holoferne say to she : god have do well that he have send thee hither for to let I have knowledge and if thy god do to I these thing he shall be my god and thou and thy name shall be great in the house of nebuchadnezzar then command holoferne she to go in where he treasure lay and to abide there and to give to she meat from he feast to whom she say that she might not eat of he meat but that she have bring meat with she for to eat then holoferne say : when that meat faileth what shall we give to thee to eat and judith say that she should not spend all till god shall do in my hand those thing that i have think and the servant lead she into he tabernacle and she desire that she might go out in the night and before day to pray and come in again and the lord command he cubiculer that she should go and come at she pleasure three day during and she go out into the valley of bethulium and baptize she in the water of the well and she stretch she hand up to the god of israel pray the good lord that he would govern she way for to deliver he people and thus she do unto the fourth day then holoferne make a great feast and send a man of he name bagoa for to entreat judith to come eat and drink with he and judith say : what be i that should gainsay my lord 's desire i be at he commandment whatsomever he will that i do i shall do and please he all the day of my life and she rise and adorn herself with she rich and precious clothes and go in and stand before holoferne and holoferne ' heart be pierce with she beauty and he say to she : sit down and drink in joy for thou hast find grace before I judith say : i shall drink my lord for my life be magnify this day before all the day of my life and she eat and drink such as she handmaid have ordain for she and holoferne be merry and drink so much wine that he never drink so much in one day in all he life and be drunken and at even when it be night holoferne go into he bed and bagoa bring judith in to he chamber and close the door and when judith be alone in the chamber and holoferne lay and sleep in overmuch drunkenness judith say to she handmaid that she should stand without forth before the door of the privy chamber and wait about and judith stand before the bed pray with tear and with move of she lip secretly say : o lord god of israel conform I in this hour to the work of my hand that thou raise up the city of jerusalem as thou hast promise and that i may perform this that i have think to do and when she have thus say she go to the pillar that be at he bed 's head and take he sword and loose it and when she have draw it out she take he hair in she hand and say : confirm I god of israel in this hour and smote twice in the neck and cut off he head and leave the body lie still and take the head and wrap it in the canape and deliver it to she maid and bid she to put it in she scrip and they two go out after they usage to pray and they pass the tent and go about the valley come to the gate of the city and judith say to the keeper of the wall : open the gate for god be with we that have do great virtue in israel and anon when they hear she call they call the priest of the city and they come run for they have suppose no more to have see she and light light all go about she she then enter in and stand up in a high place and command silence and say : praise ye the lord god that forsaketh not man hope in he and in I he handwoman have fulfil he mercy that he promise to the house of israel and have slay in my hand the enemy of he people this night and then she bring forth the head of holoferne and show it to they say : lo here the head of holoferne prince of the chivalry of assyrian and lo the canape of he in which he lay in he drunkenhood where we lord have smitten he by the hand of a woman forsooth god liveth for he angel keep I hence go there abide and from thence hither return and the lord have not suffer I he handwoman to be defoul but without pollution of sin have call I again to you joy in he victory in my escape and in you deliverance knowledge ye he all for good for he mercy be everlasting world without end and all they honor we lord say to she : the lord bless thee in he virtue for by thee he have bring we enemy to naught then ozia the prince of the people say to she : bless be thou of the high god before all woman upon earth and bless be the lord that make heaven and earth that have address thee in the wound of the head of the prince of we enemy after this judith bid that the head should be hang up on the wall and at the sun rise every man in he arm issue out upon you enemy and when they spy shall see you they shall run into the tent of they prince to raise he and to make he ready to fight and when he lord shall see he dead they shall be smite with so great dread and fear that they shall flee whom ye then shall pursue and god shall bring they and tread they under you foot then achior see the virtue of the god of israel leave he old heathen 's custom and believe in god and put himself to the people of israel and all the succession of he kindred unto this day then at the spring of the day they hang the head of holoferne on the wall and every man take he arm and go out with great noise which thing see the spy run together to the tabernacle of holoferne and come make noise for to make he to arise and that he should awake but no man be so hardy to knock or enter into he privy chamber but when the duke and leader of thousand come and other they say to the privy chamberlain : go and awake you lord for the mouse be go out of they cave and be ready to call we to battle then bagoa go into he privy chamber and stand before the curtain and clap he hand together and when he perceive no moving of he he draw the curtain and see the dead body of holoferne without head lie in he blood cry with great voice weep and rend he clothes and go in to the tabernacle of judith and find she not and start out to the people and say : a woman of the hebrew have make confusion in the house of nebuchadnezzar she have slay holoferne and he be dead and she have he head with she and when the prince and captain of the assyrian hear this anon they rent they clothes and intolerable dread fall on they and be sore trouble in they wit and make a horrible cry in they tent and when all the host have hear how holoferne be behead counsel and mind fly from they and with great tremble for succor begin to flee in such wise that none would speak with other but with they head bow down flee for to escape from the hebrew whom they see armed come upon they and depart flee by field and way of hill and valley and the son of israel see they flee follow they cry with trump and shout after they and slew and smite down all they that they overtake and ozia send forth unto all the city and region of israel and they send after all the young man and valiant to pursue they by sword and so they do unto the uttermost coast of israel the other man soothly that be in bethulium go

have leave so much that every man from the most to the least be make rich by the prey that they take then joachim the high bishop of jerusalem come unto bethulium with all the priest for to see judith and when she come tofore they all they bless she with one voice say : thou glory of jerusalem thou gladness of israel thou the worship do of we people thou didst manly and thy heart be comfort because thou lovedst chastity and knewest no man after the death of thy husband and therefore the hand of god have comfort thee and therefore thou shalt be bless world without end and all the people say :

and that one ever _ -- george herbert _ the life of st peter the apostle st peter the apostle among all other and above all other be of most fervent and burn love for he would have know the traitor that should betray we lord jesu christ as st austin saith : if he have know he he would have tear he with he tooth and therefore we lord would not name he to he for as chrysostom saith : if he have name he peter have arise and all to-torn he peter go upon the sea he be choose of god to be at he transfiguration and raise a maid from death to life he find the stater or piece of money in the fish 's mouth he receive of we lord the key of the kingdom of heaven he take the charge to feed the sheep of jesu christ he convert at a whitsuntide three thousand man he heal claude with john and then convert five thousand man he say to anania and saphira they death before he heal æneas of the palsy he raise tabitha he baptize cornelium with the shadow of he body he heal sick man he be put in prison by herod but by the angel of we lord he be deliver what he meat be and he clothing the book of st clement witnesseth for he say : bread only with olive and seldom with wort be mine usage and i have such clothing as thou seest a coat and a mantle and when i have that i demand no more it be say for certain that he bare always a sudary in he bosom with which he wipe the tear that run from he eye for when he remember the sweet presence of we lord for the great love that he have to he he might not forbear weep and also when he remember that he have reny he he weep abundantly great plenty of tear in such wise that he be so accustomed to weep that he face be burn with tear as it seem like as clement saith and saith also that in the night when he hear the cock crow he would weep customably and after that it be read in historium ecclesiastica that when st peter 's wife be lead to she passion he have great joy and call she by she proper name and say to she : my wife remember thee of we lord on a time when st peter have send two of he disciple for to preach the faith of jesu christ and when they have go twenty day ' journey one of they die and that other then return to st peter and tell he what have happen some say that it be st marcial that so die and some say it be st maternus and other say that it be st frank then st peter give to he he staff and command that he should return to he fellow and lay it upon he which he so do then he which have be forty day dead anon arise all live that time simon the enchanter be in jerusalem and he say he be first truth and affirm that who that would believe in he he would make they perpetual and he also say that nothing to he be impossible it be read in the book of st clement that he say that he should be worship of all man as god and that he might do all that he would and he say yet more : when my mother rachel command I that i should go reap corn in the field and see the sickle ready to reap with i command the sickle to reap by itself alone and it reap ten time more than any other and yet he add hereto more after jerome and say : i be the word of god i be the holy ghost i be almighty i be all that be of god he make serpent of brass to move and make the image of iron and of stone to laugh and dog to sing and as st linus saith he would dispute with st peter and show at a day assign that he be god and peter come to the place where the strife should be and say to they that be there : peace to you brethren that love truth to whom simon say : we have none need of thy peace for if peace and concord be make we should not profit to find the truth for thief have peace among they and therefore desire no peace but battle for when two man fight and one be overcome then be it peace then say peter : why dreadest thou to hear of peace of sin grow battle where be no sin there be peace in dispute be truth find and in work righteousness then say simon : it be not as thou sayest but i shall show to thee the power of my dignity that anon thou shalt adore I i be first truth and may flee by the air i can make new tree and turn stone into bread endure in the fire without hurt and all that i will i may do st peter dispute against all these and disclose all he malefice then simon magus see that he might not resist peter cast all he book into the sea lest st peter should prove he a magician by he book and go to rome where he be have and repute as a god and when peter know that he follow and come to rome the fourth year of claudius the emperor peter come to rome and sit there twenty-five year and ordain two bishop as he helper linus and cletus one within the wall and that other without he entend much to preach of the word of god by which he convert much people to the faith of christ and heal many sick man and in he preach always he praise and prefer chastity he convert four concubine of agrippa the provost so that they would no more come to he wherefore the provost seek occasion against peter after this we lord appear to st peter say to he : simon magus and nero purpose against thee dread thee not for i be with thee and shall give to thee the solace of my servant paul which to-morn shall come in to rome then peter know that he should not long abide here assemble all he brethren and take clement by the hand and ordain he a bishop and make he to sit in he own seat after this as we lord have say tofore paul come to rome and with peter begin to preach the faith of christ simon magus be so much beloved of nero that he ween that he have be the keeper of he life of he health and of all the city on a day as leo the pope saith as he stand tofore nero suddenly he visage change now old and now young which when nero see he suppose that he have be the son of god then say simon magus to nero : because that thou shalt know I to be the very son of god command my head to be smite off and i shall arise again the third day then nero command to he brother to smite off he head and when he suppose to have behead simon he behead a ram simon by he art magic go away unhurt and gather together the member of the ram and hide he three day the blood of the ram abode and congeal the third day he come and show he to nero say : command my blood to be wash away for lo i be he that be behead and as i promise i have rise again the third day whom nero see be abashed and trowed verily that he have be the son of god all this saith leo sometime also when he be with nero secretly within he conclave the devil in he likeness spake without to the people then the roman have he in such worship that they make to he a image and write above this title : to simon the holy god peter and paul enter to nero and discover all the enchantment and malefice of simon magus and peter add thereto see that like as in christ be two substance that be of god and man so be in this magician two substance that be of man and of the devil then say simon magus as st marcelle and leo witness lest i should suffer any longer this enemy i shall command my angel that they shall avenge I on he to whom peter say : i dread nothing thine angel but they dread I nero say : dreadest thou not simon that by certain thing affirmeth he godhead to whom peter say : if dignity or godhead be in he let he tell now what i think or what i do which think i shall first tell to thee that he shall not mow lie what i think to whom nero say : come hither and say what thou thinkest then peter go to he and say to he secretly : command some man to bring to I a barley-loaf and deliver it to I privily when it be take to he he bless it and hide it under he sleeve and then say he : now simon say what i think and have say and do simon answer : let peter say what i think peter answer : what simon thinketh that i know i shall do it when he have think then simon have indignation cry aloud : i command that dog come and devour he and suddenly there appear great dog and make a assault against peter he give to they of the bread that he have bless and suddenly he make they to flee then say peter to nero : lo i have show you what he think against I not in word but in deed for where he promise angel to come against I he bring dog thereby he showeth that he have none angel but dog then say simon : hear ye peter and paul if i may not grieve you here ye shall come where I it shall behove to judge you i shall spare you here hæc leo then simon magus as hegesippus and linus say elate in pride avaunt he that he can raise dead man to life and it hap that there be a young man dead and then nero let call peter and simon and all give sentence by the will of simon that he should be slay that might not arise the dead man to life simon then as he make he incantation upon the dead body he be see move he head of they that stand by then all they cry for to stone peter peter unnethe get silence say : if the dead body live let he arise walk and speak else know ye that it be a fantasy that the head of the dead man moveth let simon be take from the bed and the body abode immovable peter standing afar make he prayer cry to the dead body say : young man arise in the name of jesu christ of nazareth crucify and anon he arise living and walk then when the people would have stone simon magus peter say : he be in pain enough know he to be overcome in he heart we master have teach we for to do good for evil then say simon to peter and paul : yet be it not come to you that ye desire for ye be not worthy to have martyrdom the which answer : that be that we desire to have to thee shall never be well for thou liest all that thou sayest then as marcel saith : simon go to the house of marcel and bind there a great black dog at the door of the house and say : now i shall see if peter which be accustom to come hither shall come and if he come this dog shall strangle he and a little after that peter and paul go thither and anon peter make the sign of the cross and unbound the hound and the hound be as tame and meek as a lamb and pursued none but simon and go to he and take and cast he to the ground under he and would have strangle he and then run peter to he and cry upon the hound that he should not do he any harm and anon the hound leave and touch not he body but he all torent and tare he gown in such wise that he be almost naked then all the people and especially child run with the hound upon he and hunt and chase he out of the town as he have be a wolf then for the reproof and shame he dare not come in to the town of all a whole year after then marcel that be disciple of simon magus see these great miracle come to peter and be from then forthon he disciple and after at the end of the year simon return and be receive again into the amity of nero and then as leo saith this simon magus assemble the people and show to they how he have be anger of the galilean and therefore he say that he would leave the city which he be wont to defend and keep and set a day in which he would ascend into heaven for he deign no more to dwell in the earth then on the day that he have stablish like as he have say he go up to a high tower which be on the capitol and there be crown with laurel throw himself out from place to place and begin to fly in the air then say st paul to st peter : it appertaineth to I to pray and to thee for to command then say nero : this man be very god and ye be two traitor then say st peter to st paul : paul brother lift up thine head and see how simon flyeth then st paul say to st peter when he see he fly so high : peter why tarriest thou perform that thou hast begin god now calleth we then say peter : i charge and conjure you angel of sathana which bear he in the air by the name of we lord jesu christ that ye bear ne sustain he no more but let he fall to the earth and anon they let he fall to the ground and brake he neck and head and he die there forthwith and when nero hear say that simon be dead and that he have lose such a man he be sorrowful and say to the apostle : ye have do this in despite of I and therefore i shall destroy you by right evil example hæc leo then he deliver they to paulin which be a much noble man and paulin deliver they to mamertin under the keep of two knight processe and martinian whom st peter convert to the faith and they then open the prison and let they all go out that would go wherefore after the passion of the apostle paulin when he know that they be christian behead both processe and martinian the brethren then when the prison be open pray peter to go thence and he would not but at the last he be overcome by they prayer go away and when he come to the gate as leo witnesseth which be call sancta marium ad passus he meet jesu christ come against he and peter say to he : lord whither goest thou and he say to he : i go to rome for to be crucify again and peter demand he : lord shalt thou be crucify again and he say : yea and peter say then : lord i shall return again then for to be crucify with thee this say we lord ascend into heaven peter behold it which weep sore and when peter understand that we lord have say to he of he passion he return and when he come to he brethren he tell to they what we lord have say and anon he be take of the minister of nero and be deliver to the provost agrippa then be he face as clear as the sun as it be say then agrippa say to he : thou art he that glorifiest in the people and in woman that thou departest from the bed of they husband whom the apostle blame and say to he that he glorify in the cross of the lord jesu christ then peter be command to be crucify as a stranger and because that paul be a citizen of rome it be command that he head should be smite off and of this sentence give against they st dionysius in a epistle to timothy saith in this wise : o my brother timothy if thou hadst see the agony of the end of they thou shouldst have fail for heaviness and sorrow who should not weep that hour when the commandment of the sentence be give against they that peter should be crucify and paul be behead thou shouldst then have see the turbe of the jew and of the paynim that smite they and spit in they visage and when the horrible time come of they end that they be depart that one from that other they bind the pillar of the world but that be not without wail and weep of the brethren then say st paul to st peter : peace be with thee that be foundement of the church and pastor of the sheep and lamb of we lord peter then say to paul : go thou in peace preacher of good manners mediator leader and solace of rightful people and when they be withdraw far from other i follow my master they be not both slay in one street this saith st dionysius and as leo the pope and marcel witness when peter come to the cross he say : when my lord descend from heaven to the earth he be put on the cross right up but I whom it pleaseth he to call from the earth to heaven my cross shall show my head to the earth and address my foot to heaven for i be not worthy to be put on the cross like as my lord be therefore turn my cross and crucify I my head downward then they turn the cross and fasten he foot upward and the head downward then the people be angry against nero and the provost and would have slay they because they make st peter so to die but he require they that they should not let he passion and as leo witnesseth we lord open the eye of they that be there and weep so that they see the angel with crown of rose and of lily stand by peter that be on the cross with the angel and then peter receive a book of we lord wherein he learn the word that he say then as hegesippus saith : peter say thus : lord i have desire much to follow thee but to be crucify upright i have not usurped thou art always rightful high and sovereign and we be son of the first man which have the head incline to the earth of whom the fall signifieth the form of the generation human also we be bear that we be see inclined to the earth by effect and the condition be change for the world weeneth that such thing be good which be evil and bad lord thou art all thing to I and nothing be to I but thou only i yield to thee thanking with all the spirit of which i live by which i understand and by whom i call thee and when st peter see that the good christian man see he glory in yield thanking to god and commend good people to he he render up he spirit then marcel and apuleius he brother that be he disciple take off the body from the cross when he be dead and anoint it with much precious ointment and bury he honorably isidore saith in the book of the nativity and death of saint thus : peter after that he have govern antioch he found a church under claudius the emperor he go to rome against simon magus there he preach the gospel twenty-five year and hold the bishopric and thirty-six year after the passion of we lord he be crucify by nero turn the head downward for he would be so crucify : hæc isidorus that same day peter and paul appear to st dionysius as he saith in he foresaid epistle in these word : understand the miracle and see the prodigy my brother timothy of the day of the martyrdom of they for i be ready in the time of depart of they after they death i see they together hand in hand enter the gate of the city and clothe with clothes of light and array with crown of clearness and light hæc dionysius nero be not unpunished for they death and other great sin and tyranny that he commit for he slew himself with he own hand which tyranny be overlong to tell but shortly i shall rehearse here some he slew he master seneca because he be afraid of he when he go to school also nero slew he mother then for he pleasure he set rome afire which burn seven day and seven night and be in a high tower and enjoy he to see so great a flame of fire and sing merrily he slew the senator of rome to see what sorrow and lamentation they wife would make he fish with net of gold thread and the garment that he have wear one day he would never wear it ne see it after then the roman see he woodness -lrb- madness -rrb- assail he and pursue he unto without the city and when he see he might not escape they he take a stake and sharp it with he tooth and therewith stick himself through the body and so slew himself in another place it be read that he be devour of wolf then the roman return and find the frog and throw it out of the city and there burn it in the time of st cornelius the pope greek steal away the body of the apostle peter and paul but the devil that be in the idol be constrain by the divine virtue of god and cry and say : ye man of rome succor hastily you god which be steal from you for which thing the good christian people understand that they be the body of peter and paul and the paynim have suppose that it have be they god then assemble great number of christian man and of paynim also and pursue so long the greek that they doubt to have be slay and throw the body in a pit at the catacomb but afterward they be draw out by christian man st gregory saith that the great force of thunder and lightning that come from heaven make they so afraid that they depart each from other and so leave the body of the apostle at the catacomb in a pit but they doubt which bone be peter 's and which paul 's wherefore the good christian man put they to prayer and fasting and it be answer they from heaven that the great bone long to the preacher and the less to the fisher and so be depart and the bone be put in the church of he that it be dedicate of and other say that silvester the pope would hallow the church and take all the bone together and depart they by weight great and small and put that one-half in one church and that other half in that other and st gregory recounteth in he dialogue that in the church of st peter where he bone rest be a man of great holiness and of meekness name gentian and there come a maid into the church which be cripple and draw she body and leg after she with she hand and when she have long require and pray st peter for health he appear to she in a vision and say to she : go to gentian my servant and he shall restore thy health then begin she to creep here and there through the church and inquire who be gentian and suddenly it hap that he come to she that he seek and she say to he : the holy apostle st peter send I to thee that thou shouldest make I whole and deliver I from my disease and he answer : if thou be send to I from he arise thou anon and go on thy foot and he take she by the hand and anon she be all whole in such wise as she feel nothing of she grief nor malady and then she thank god and st peter and in the same book st gregory saith when that a holy priest be come to the end of he life he begin to cry in great gladness : ye be welcome my lord ye be welcome that ye vouchsafe to come to so little and poor a servant and he say : i shall come and thank you then they that stand by demand who they be that he speak to and he say to they wonder : have ye not see the bless apostle peter and paul and as he cry again he bless soul depart from the flesh some have doubt whether peter and paul suffer death in one day for some say it be the same one day but one a year after the other and jerome and all the saint that treat of this matter accord that it be on one day and one year and so be it contain in a epistle of deni and leo the pope saith the same in a sermon say : we suppose but that it be not do without cause that they suffer in one day and in one place the sentence of the tyrant and they suffer death in one time to the end that they should go together to jesu christ and both under one persecutor to the end that equal cruelty should strain that one and that other the day for they merit the place for they glory and the persecution overcome by virtue though they suffer both death in one day and in one hour yet it be not in one place but in diverse within rome and hereof saith a versifier in this wise : ense coronatus paulus cruce petrus eodem -- sub duce luce loco dux nero roma locus that be to say paul crown with the sword and peter have the cross reverse the place be the city of rome and howbeit that they suffer death in one day yet st gregory ordain that that day specially should be the solemnity of st peter and the next day commemoration of st paul for the church of st peter be hallowed that same day and also forasmuch as he be more in dignity and first in conversion and hold the principality at rome the life of st paul the apostle st paul the apostle after he conversion suffer many persecution the which the bless hilary rehearseth shortly say : paul the apostle be beat with rod at philippus he be put in prison and by the foot fast set in stock he be stone in lystra in iconium and thessalonica he be pursue of wicked people in ephesus he be deliver to wild beast in damascus he be let by a lepe down of the wall in jerusalem he be arrest beaten bind and await to be slay in cæsarea he be inclose and defame sailing toward italy he be in peril of death and from thence he come to rome and be judge under nero and there finish he life this saith st hilary : paul take upon he to be apostle among the gentile in lystra be a contract which he lose and redress a young man that fall out of a window and die he raise to life and do many other miracle at the isle of melita a serpent bit he hand and hurt he not and he throw it into the fire it be say that all they that come of the progeny and lineage of that man that then harbor paul may in no wise be hurt of no venemous beast wherefore when they child be bear they put serpent in they cradle for to prove if they be verily they child or no in some place it be say that paul be less than peter otherwhile more and sometimes equal and like for in dignity he be less in preach greater and in holiness they be equal haymo saith that paul from the cock-crow until the hour of five he labor with he hand and after entend to preach and that endure almost to night the residue of the time be for to eat sleep and for prayer which be necessary he come to rome when nero be not fully confirm in the empire and nero hearing that there be dispute and question make between paul and the jew he reck not much thereof suffer paul to go where he would and preach freely jeronimus saith in he book de viris illustribus that the thirty-sixth year after the passion of we lord the second year of nero st paul be send to rome bind and two year he be in free keep and dispute against the jew and after he be let go by nero and preach the gospel in the west part and the fourteenth year of nero the same year and day that peter be crucify he head be smite off hæc jeronimus the wisdom and religion of he be publish over all and be repute marvellous he gat to he many friend in the emperor 's house and convert they to the faith of christ and some of he writings be recite and read tofore the emperor and of all man marvellously commend and the senate understand of he by thing of authority it hap on a day that paul preach about evensong time in a loft a young man name patroclus butler of nero and with he well-beloved go for to see the multitude of people and the better for to hear paul he go up into a window and there sleep fall down and die which when nero hear he be much sorry and heavy therefor and anon order another in he office paul know hereof by the holy ghost say to they stand by he that they should go and bring to he patroclus which be dead and that the emperor love so much whom when he be bring he raise to life and send he with he fellow to the emperor whom the emperor know for dead and while he make lamentation for he it be tell to the emperor that patroclus be come to the gate and when he hear that patroclus be alive he much marvel and command that he should come in to whom nero say : patroclus livest thou and he say : yea emperor i live and nero say : who have make thee to live again and he say : the lord jesu christ king of all world then nero be wroth say : then shall he reign ever and resolve all the royaume of the world to whom patroclus say : yea certainly emperor then nero give to he a buffet say : therefore thou servest he and he say : yea verily i serve he that have raise I from death to life then five of the minister of nero that assist he say to he : o emperor why smitest thou this young man truly and wisely answer to thee trust verily we serve that same king almighty and when nero hear that he put they in prison for strongly to torment they whom he much have love then he make to inquire and to take all christian man and without examination make they to be torment with overgreat torment then be paul among other bind and bring tofore nero to whom nero say : o thou man servant of the great king bind tofore I why withdrawest thou my knight and drawest they to thee to whom paul say : not only from thy corner i have gather knight but also i gather from the universal world to my lord to whom we king giveth such gift that never shall fail and granteth that they shall be exclude from all indigence and need and if thou wilt be to he subject thou shalt be safe for he be of so great power that he shall come and judge all the world and destroy the figure thereof by fire and when nero hear that he should destroy the figure of the world by fire he command that all the christian man should be burn by fire and paul to be behead as he that be guilty against he majesty and so great a multitude of christian people be slay then that the people of rome brake up he palace and cry and move sedition against he say : cæsar amend thy manners and attemper thy commandment for these be we people that thou destroyest and defend the empire of rome the emperor then dread the noise of the people change he decree and edict that no man should touch ne hurt no christian man till the emperor have otherwise ordain wherefore paul be bring again tofore nero whom as soon as nero see he cry and say : take away this wicked man and behead he and suffer he no longer to live upon the earth to whom paul say : nero i shall suffer a little while but i shall live eternally with my lord jesu christ nero say : smite off he head that he may understand I stronger than he king that when he be overcome we may see whether he may live after to whom paul say : to the end that thou know I to live everlastingly when my head shall be smite off i shall appear to thee living and then thou mayst know that christ be god of life and of death and when he have say this he be lead to the place of he martyrdom and as he be lead the three knight that lead he say to he : tell to we paul who be he you king that ye love so much that for he love ye have liefer die than live and what reward shall ye have therefor then paul preach to they of the kingdom of heaven and of the pain of hell in such wise that he convert they to the faith and they pray he to go freely whither he would god forbid brethren say he that i should flee i be not fugitive but the lawful knight of christ i know well that from this transitory life i shall go to everlasting life as soon as i shall be behead true man shall take away my body mark ye well the place and come thither to-morrow and ye shall find by my sepulchre two man luke and titus pray to whom when ye shall tell for what cause i have send you to they they shall baptize you and make you heir of the kingdom of heaven and while they thus speak together nero send two knight to look if he be slay and behead or no and when thus st paul would have convert they they say : when thou art dead and risest again then we shall believe now come forth and receive that thou hast deserve and as he be lead to the place of he passion in the gate of hostence a noble woman name plautillum a disciple of paul who after another name be call lemobium for haply she have two name meet there with paul which weep commend she to he prayer to whom paul say : farewell plautillum daughter of everlasting health lend to I thy veil or keverchief with which thou coverest thy head that i may bind mine eye therewith and afterward i shall restore it to thee again and when she have deliver it to he the butcher scorn she saying : why hast thou deliver to this enchanter so precious a cloth for to lose it then when he come to the place of he passion he turn he toward the east hold he hand up to heaven right long with tear pray in he own language and thank we lord and after that bid he brethren farewell and bind he eye himself with the keverchief of plautillum and kneel down on both knee stretch forth he neck and so be behead and as soon as the head be from the body it say : jesus christus which have be to he so sweet in he life it be say that he name jesus or christus or both fifty time from he wound spring out milk into the clothes of the knight and afterward flow out blood in the air be a great shine light and from the body come a much sweet odor dionysius in a epistle to timothy saith of the death of paul thus : in that hour full of heaviness my well-beloved brother the butcher say : paul make ready thy neck then bless paul look up into heaven mark he forehead and he breast with the sign of the cross and then say anon : my lord jesus christ into thy hand i commend my spirit etc and then without heaviness and compulsion he stretch forth he neck and receive the crown of martyrdom the butcher so smite off he head the bless martyr paul take the keverchief and unbound he eye and gather up he own blood and put it therein and deliver to the woman then the butcher return and plautillum meet he and demand he say : where hast thou leave my master the knight answer : he lieth without the town with one of he fellow and he visage be cover with thy keverchief and she answer and say : i have now see peter and paul enter into the city clothe with right noble vestment and also they have right fair crown upon they head more clear and more shine than the sun and have bring again my keverchief all bloody which he have deliver I for which thing and work many believe in we lord and be baptize and this be that st dionysius saith and when nero hear say this thing he doubt he and begin to speak of all these thing with he philosopher and with he friend and as they speak together of this matter paul come in and the gate shut and stand tofore cæsar and say : cæsar here be tofore thee paul the knight of the king perdurable and not vanquish now believe then certainly that i be not dead but alive but thou caitiff thou shalt die of a evil death because thou hast slay the servant of god and when he have say thus he vanish away and nero what for dread and what for anger he be nigh out of he wit and wist not what to do then by the counsel of he friend he unbound patroclus and barnaba and let they go where they would and the other knight longinus master of the knight and accestus come on the morn to the sepulchre of paul and there they find two man pray that be luke and titus and between they be paul and when luke and titus see they they be abashed and begin to flee and anon paul vanish away and the knight cry after they and say : we come not to grieve you but know ye for truth that we come for to be baptize of you like as paul have say whom we see now pray with you when they hear that they return and baptize they with great joy the head of st paul be cast in a valley and for the multitude of other head of man that be slay and throw there it could not be know which it be the life of st christopher christopher tofore he baptism be name reprobus but afterward he be name christopher which be as much to say as bear christ christopher be of the lineage of the canaanite and he be of a right great stature and have a terrible and fearful cheer and countenance and he be twelve cubit of length and as it be read in some history that when he serve and dwell with the king of canaan it come in he mind that he would seek the greatest prince that be in the world and he would he serve and obey and so far he go that he come to a right great king of whom the renomee generally be that he be the greatest of the world and when the king see he he receive he into he service and make he to dwell in he court upon a time a minstrel sing tofore he a song in which he name oft the devil and the king which be a christian man when he hear he name the devil make anon the sign of the cross in he visage and when christopher see that he have great marvel what sign it be and wherefore the king make it and he demand of he and because the king would not say he say : if thou tell I not i shall no longer dwell with thee and then the king tell to he say : alway when i hear the devil name i fear that he should have power over I and i garnish I with this sign that he grieve not ne annoy I then christopher say to he : doubtest thou the devil that he hurt thee not then be the devil more mighty and greater than thou art i be then deceive of my hope and purpose for i have suppose i have find the most mighty and the most greatest lord of the world but i commend thee to god for i will go seek he for to be my lord and i he servant and then depart from this king and hast he for to seek the devil and as he go by a great desert he see a great company of knight of which a knight cruel and horrible come to he and demand whither he go and christopher answer to he and say : i go seek the devil for to be my master and he say : i be he that thou seekest and then christopher be glad and bind he to be he servant perpetual and take he for he master and lord and as they go together by a common way they find there a cross erect and standing and anon as the devil see the cross he be afeard and flee and leave the right way and bring christopher about by a sharp desert and after when they be past the cross he bring he to the highway that they have leave and when christopher see that he marvel and demand whereof he doubt and have leave the high and fair way and have go so far about by so aspre a desert and the devil would not tell he in no wise then christopher say to he : if thou wilt not tell I i shall anon depart from thee and shall serve thee no more wherefor the devil be constrain to tell he and say : there be a man call christ which be hang on the cross and when i see he sign i be sore afraid and flee from it wheresoever i see it to whom christopher say : then he be greater and more mightier than thou when thou art afraid of he sign and i see well that i have labor in vain when i have not founden the greatest lord of the world and i will serve thee no longer go thy way then for i will go seek christ and when he have long seek and demand where he should find christ at last he come into a great desert to a hermit that dwelt there and this hermit preach to he of jesu christ and inform he in the faith diligently and say to he : this king whom thou desirest to serve requireth the service that thou must oft fast and christopher say to he : require of I some other thing and i shall do it for that which thou requirest i may not do and the hermit say : thou must then wake and make many prayer and christopher say to he : i wot not what it be i may do no such thing and then the hermit say to he : knowest thou such a river in which many be perish and lose to whom christopher say : i know it well then say the hermit : because thou art noble and high of stature and strong in thy member thou shalt be resident by that river and thou shalt bear over all they that shall pass there which shall be a thing right convenable to we lord jesu christ whom thou desirest to serve and i hope he shall show himself to thee then say christopher : certe this service may i well do and i promise to he for to do it then go christopher to this river and make there he habitacle for he and bare a great pole in he hand instead of a staff by which he sustain he in the water and bare over all manner of people without cease and there he abide thus do many day and in a time as he sleep in he lodge he hear the voice of a child which call he and say : christopher come out and bear I over then he awake and go out but he find no man and when he be again in he house he hear the same voice and he run out and find nobody the third time he be call and come thither and find a child beside the rivage of the river which pray he goodly to bear he over the water and then christopher lift up the child on he shoulder and take he staff and enter into the river for to pass and the water of the river arise and swell more and more : and the child be heavy as lead and alway as he go further the water increase and grow more and the child more and more wax heavy insomuch that christopher have great anguish and be afeard to be drown and when he be escape with great pain and pass the water and set the child aground he say to the child : child thou hast put I in great peril thou weighest almost as i have all the world upon I i might bear no greater burden and the child answer : christopher marvel thee nothing for thou hast not only bear all the world upon thee but thou hast bear he that create and make all the world upon thy shoulder i be jesu christ the king to whom thou servest in this work and because that thou know that i say to be the truth set thy staff in the earth by thy house and thou shalt see to-morn that it shall bear flower and fruit and anon he vanish from he eye and then christopher set he staff in the earth and when he arise on the morn he find he staff like a palmier bearing flower leave and date and then christopher go into the city of lycium and understand not they language then he pray we lord that he might understand they and so he do and as he be in this prayer the judge suppose that he have be a fool and leave he there and then when christopher understand the language he cover he visage and go to the place where they martyr christian man and comfort they in we lord and then the judge smite he in the face and christopher say to they : if i be not christian i should avenge mine injury and then christopher pitch he rod in the earth and pray to we lord that for to convert the people it might bear flower and fruit and anon it do so and then he convert eight thousand man and then the king send two knight for to fetch he to the king and they find he pray and durst not tell to he so and anon after the king send as many more and they anon set they down for to pray with he and when christopher arise he say to they : what seek ye and when they see he in the visage they say to he : the king have send we that we should lead thee bind unto he and christopher say to they : if i would ye should not lead I to he bind ne unbound and they say to he : if thou wilt go thy way go quit where thou wilt and we shall say to the king that we have not find thee it shall not be so say he but i shall go with you and then he convert they in the faith and command they that they should bind he hand behind he back and lead he so bind to the king and when the king see he he be afeard and fall down off the seat and he servant lift he up and releve he again and then the king inquire he name and he country and christopher say to he : tofore or i be baptize i be name reprobus and after i be christopher tofore baptism a canaanite now a christian man to whom the king say : thou hast a foolish name that be to wit of christ crucify which could not help himself ne may not profit to thee how therefore thou cursed canaanite why wilt thou not do sacrifice to we god to whom christopher say : thou art rightfully call dagnus for thou art the death of the world and fellow of the devil and thy god be make with the hand of man and the king say to he : thou wert nourish among wild beast and therefore thou mayst not say but wild language and word unknown to man and if thou wilt now do sacrifice to the god i shall give to thee great gift and great honor and if not i shall destroy thee and consume thee by great pain and torment but for all this he would in no wise do sacrifice wherefore he be send in to prison and the king do do behead the other knight that he have send for he whom he have convert after this christopher be bring tofore the king and the king command that he should be beat with rod of iron and that there should be set upon he head a cross of iron red hot and burning and then after he do do make a siege or a stool of iron and make christopher to be bounden thereon and after to set fire under it and cast therein pitch but the siege or settle melt like wax and christopher issue out without any harm or hurt and when the king see that he command that he should be bind to a strong stake and that he should be through-shotten with arrow with forty knight archer but none of the knight might attain he for the arrow hang in the air about nigh he without touch then the king ween that he have be through-shotten with the arrow of the knight and address he for to go to he and one of the arrow return suddenly from the air and smite he in the eye and blind he to whom christopher say : tyrant i shall die to-morn make a little clay with my blood temper and anoint therewith thine eye and thou shalt receive health then by the commandment of the king he be lead for to be behead and then there make he he orison and he head be smite off and so suffer martyrdom and the king then take a little of he blood and lay it on he eye and say : in the name of god and of st christopher and be anon heal then the king believe in god and give commandment that if any person blame god or st christopher he should anon be slay with the sword ambrose saith in he preface thus of this holy martyr : lord thou hast give to christopher so great plenty of virtue and such grace of doctrine that he call from the error of paynim forty-eight thousand man to the honor of christian faith by he shine miracle and with this he be strain and bounden in a seat of iron and great fire put under doubt nothing the heat and all a whole day during stand bounden to a stake yet might not be through-pierced with arrow of all the knight and with that one of the arrow smite out the eye of the tyrant to whom the blood of the holy martyr re-establish he sight and enlumine he in take away the blindness of he body and gat of the christian mind and pardon and he also gat of thee by prayer power to put away sickness and sore from they that remember he passion and figure then let we pray to st christopher that he pray for we etc the seven sleeper the seven sleeper be bear in the city of ephesus and when decius the emperor come into ephesus for the persecution of christian man he command to edify the temple in the middle of the city so that all should come with he to do sacrifice to the idol and do do seek all the christian people and bind they for to make they to do sacrifice or else to put they to death in such wise that every man be afeard of the pain that he promise that the friend forsake he friend and the son reny he father and the father the son and then in this city be founden seven christian man that be to wit maximian malchus marcianus deni john serapion and constantine and when they see this they have much sorrow and because they be the first in the palace that despise the sacrifice they hide they in they house and be in fasting and in prayer and then they be accuse tofore decius and come thither and be find very christian man then be give to they space for to repent they unto the come again of decius and in the meanwhile they dispend they patrimony in alms to the poor people and assemble they together and take counsel and go to the mount of celion and there ordain to be more secretly and there hide they long time and one of they administer and serve they always and when he go into the city he clothe he in the habit of a beggar when decius be come again he command that they should be fetch and then malchus which be they servant and minister to they meat and drink return in great dread to he fellow and tell and show to they the great fury and woodness of they and then be they sore afraid and malchus set tofore they the loaf of bread that he have bring so that they be comfort of the meat and be more strong for to suffer torment and when they have take they refection and sit in weep and wailing suddenly as god would they sleep and when it come on the morn they be seek and could not be find wherefore decius be sorrowful because he have lose such young man and then they be accuse that they be hide in the mount of celion and have give they goods to poor man and yet abode in they purpose and then command decius that they kindred should come to he and menace they to the death if they say not of they all that they know and they accuse they and complain that they have dispend all they riches then decius think what he should do with they and as we lord would he inclose the mouth of the cave wherein they be with stone to the end that they should die therein for hunger and fault of meat then the minister and two christian man theodorus and rufinus write they martyrdom and lay it subtlely among the stone and when decius be dead and all that generation three hundred and sixty-two year after and the thirtieth year of theodosius the emperor when the heresy be of they that deny the resurrection of dead body and begin to grow theodosius then the most christian emperor be sorrowful that the faith of we lord be so felonously demen for anger and heaviness he clothe he in hair and weep every day in a secret place and lead a full holy life which god merciful and piteous see would comfort they that be sorrowful and weep and give to they esperance and hope of the resurrection of dead man and open the precious treasure of he pity and raise the foresaid martyr in this manner follow he put in the will of a burgess of ephesus that he would make in that mountain which be desert and aspre a stable for he pasturer and herdman and it hap that of adventure the mason that make the say stable open this cave and then these holy saint that be within awake and be raise and intersalue each other and have suppose verily that they have sleep but one night only and remember of the heaviness that they have the day tofore and then malchus which minister to they say what decius have ordain of they for he say : we have be seek like as i say to you yesterday for to do sacrifice to the idol that be it that the emperor desireth of we and then maximian answer : god we lord knoweth that we shall never sacrifice and comfort he fellow he command to malchus to go and buy bread in the city and bid he bring more that he do yesterday and also to inquire and demand what the emperor have command to do and then malchus take five shilling and issue out of the cave and when he see the mason and the stone tofore the cave he begin to bless he and be much amarvelled but he think little on the stone for he think on other thing then come he all doubtful to the gate of the city and be all amarvell for he see the sign of the cross about the gate and then without tarry he go to that other gate of the city and find there also the sign of the cross thereon and then he have great marvel for upon every gate he see set up the sign of the cross and therewith the city be garnish and then he bless he and return to the first gate and ween he have dream and after he advise and comfort himself and cover he visage and enter into the city and when he come to the seller of bread and hear the man speak of god yet then be he more abashed and say : what be this that no man yesterday durst name jesu christ and now every man confesseth he to be christian i trow this be not the city of ephesus for it be all otherwise build it be some other city i wot not what and when he demand and hear verily that it be ephesus he suppose that he have err and think verily to go again to he fellow and then go to they that sell bread and when he show he money the seller marvel and say that one to that other that this young man have find some old treasure and when malchus see they talk together he doubt not that they would lead he to the emperor and be sore afeard and pray they to let he go and keep both money and bread but they hold he and say to he : of whence art thou for thou hast find treasure of old emperor show it to we and we shall be fellow with thee and keep it secret and malchus be so afeard that he wist not what to say to they for dread and when they see that he speak not they put a cord about he neck and draw he through the city unto the middle thereof and tiding be have all about in the city that a young man have find ancient treasure in such wise that all they of the city assemble about he and he confess there that he have find no treasure and he behold they all but he could know no man there of he kindred ne lineage which he have verily suppose that they have live but find none wherefore he stand as he have be from himself in the middle of the city and when st martin the bishop and antipater the consul which be new come into this city hear of this thing they send for he that they should bring he wisely to they and he money with he and when he be bring to the church he ween well he should have be lead to the emperor decius and then the bishop and the consul marvel of the money and they demand he where he have find this treasure unknown and he answer that he have nothing founden but it be come to he of he kindred and patrimony and they demand of he of what city he be i wot well that i be of this city if this be the city of ephesus and the judge say to he : let thy kindred come and witness for thee and he name they but none know they and they say that he feign for to escape from they in some manner and then say the judge : how may we believe thee that this money be come to thee of thy friend when it appeareth in the scripture that it be more than three hundred and seventy-two year sith it be make and forge and be of the first day of decius the emperor and it resembleth nothing to we money and how may it come from thy lineage so long since and thou art young and wouldst deceive the wise and ancient man of this city of ephesus and therefore i command that thou be demen after the law till thou hast confess where thou hast find this money then malchus kneel down tofore they and say : for god 's sake lord say ye to I that i shall demand you and i shall tell to you all that i have in my heart decius the emperor that be in this city where be he and the bishop say to he there be no such at this day in the world that be name decius he be emperor many year since and malchus say : sire hereof i be greatly abashed and no man believeth I for i wot well that we flee for fear of decius the emperor and i see he that yesterday he enter into this city if this be the city of ephesus then the bishop think in himself and say to the judge that this be a vision that we lord will have show by this young man then say the young man : follow ye I and i shall show to you my fellow which be in the mount of celion and believe ye they this know i well that we flee from the face of the emperor decius and then they go with he and a great multitude of the people of the city with they and malchus enter first into the cave to he fellow and the bishop next after he and there find they among the stone the letter seal with two seal of silver and then the bishop call they that be come thither and read they tofore they all so that they that hear it be all abashed and amarvelled and they see the saint sit in the cave and they visage like unto rose flowering and they kneel down glorified god and anon the bishop and the judge send to theodosius the emperor pray he that he would come anon for to see the marvel of we lord that he have late show and anon he arise up from the ground and take off the sack in which he weep and glorified we lord and come from constantinople to ephesus and all they come against he and ascend in to the mountain with he together unto the saint in to the cave and as soon as the bless saint of we lord see the emperor come they visage shine like to the sun and the emperor enter then and glorified we lord and embrace they weep upon each of they and say : i see you now like as i should see we lord raise lazarus and then maximian say to he : believe we for forsooth we lord have raise we tofore the day of the great resurrection and to the end that thou believe firmly the resurrection of the dead people verily we be raise as ye here see and live and in like wise as the child be in the womb of he mother without feel harm or hurt in the same wise we have be live and sleep in lie here without feeling of anything and when they have say all this they incline they head to the earth and render they spirit at the command of we lord jesu christ and so die then the emperor arise and fall on they weep strongly and embrace they and kiss they debonairly and then he command to make precious sepulchre of gold and silver and to bury they body therein and in the same night they appear to the emperor and say to he that he should suffer they to lie on the earth like as they have lie tofore till that time that we lord have raise they unto the time that they should rise again then command the emperor that the place should be adorn nobly and richly with precious stone and all the bishop that would confess the resurrection should be assoil it be in doubt of that which be say that they sleep three hundred and sixty-two year for they be raise the year of we lord four hundred and seventy-eight and decius reign but one year and three month and that be in the year of we lord two hundred and seventy and so they sleep but two hundred and eight year the life of st silvester silvester be son of one justa and be learn and teach of a priest name cyrinus which do marvellously great alms and make hospitality it hap that he receive a christian man into he house name timothy who no man would receive for the persecution of tyrant wherefore the say timothy suffer death and passion after that year while he preach justly the faith of jesu christ it be so that the prefect tarquinius suppose that timothy have have great plenty of riches which he demand of silvester threaten he to the death but if he deliver they to he and when he find certainly that timothy have no great riches he command to st silvester to make sacrifice to the idol and if he do not he would make he suffer diver torment st silvester answer : false evil man thou shalt die this night and shalt have torment that ever shall endure and thou shalt know whether thou wilt or not that he whom we worship be very god then st silvester be put in prison and the provost go to dinner now it hap that as he eat a bone of a fish turn in he throat and stick fast so that he could neither have it down ne up and at midnight die like as st silvester have say and then st silvester be deliver out of prison he be so gracious that all christian man and paynim love he for he be fair like a angel to look on a fair speaker whole of body holy in work good in counsel patient and charitable and firmly establish in the faith he have in write the name of all the widow and orphan that be poor and to they he administer they necessity he have a custom to fast all friday and saturday and it be so that melchiade the bishop of rome die and all the people choose st silvester for to be the high bishop of rome which sore against he will be make pope he institute for to be fast Wednesday Friday and Saturday and the Thursday for to be hallowed as Sunday now it hap that the emperor constantine do do slay all the christian man over all where he could find they and for this cause st silvester flee out of the town with he clerk and hide he in a mountain and for the cruelty of constantine god send he such a sickness that he become lazar and measel and by the counsel of he physician he get three thousand young child for to have cut they throat for to have they blood in a bath all hot and thereby he might be heal of he measelry and when he should ascend into he chariot for to go to the place where he should be bath the mother of the child come cry and bray for sorrow of they child and when he understand that they be mother of the child he have great pity on they and say to he knight and they that be about he : the dignity of the empire of rome be bring forth of the fountain of pity the which have stablish by decree that who that slayeth a child in battle shall have he head smite off then should it be great cruelty to we for to do to ours such thing as we defend to strange nation for so should cruelty surmount we it be better that we leave cruelty and that pity surmount we and therefore I seemeth better to save the life of these innocent than by they death i should have again my health of the which we be not yet certain ne we may recover nothing for to slay they for if so be that i should thereby have health that should be a cruel health that should be buy with the death of so many innocent then he command to render and deliver again to the mother they child and give to every each of they a good gift and thus make they return to they house with great joy from whence they depart with great sorrow and he himself return again in he chariot unto he palace now it hap that the night after st peter and st paul appear to this emperor constantine say to he : because thou hast have horror to shed and spill the blood of innocent we lord jesu christ have have pity on thee and commandeth thee to send unto such a mountain where silvester be hide with he clerk and say to he that thou comest for to be baptize of he and thou shalt be heal of thy malady and when he be awake he do do call he knight and command they to go to that mountain and bring the pope silvester to he courteously and fair for to speak with he when st silvester see from far the knight come to he he suppose they seek he for to be martyr and begin to say to he clerk that they should be firm and stable in the faith for to suffer martyrdom when the knight come to he they say to he much courteously that constantine send for he and pray he that he would come and speak with he and forthwith he come and when they have intersalute each other constantine tell to he he vision and when silvester demand of he what man they be that so appear to he the emperor wist not ne could not name they st silvester open a book wherein the image of st peter and st paul be portray and demand of he if they be like unto they then constantine anon know they and say that he have see they in he sleep then st silvester preach to he the faith of jesu christ and baptize he and when he be baptize a great light descend upon he so that he say that he have see jesu christ and be heal forthwith of he measelry and then he ordain seven law unto holy church the first be that all the city should worship jesu christ as very god the second thing be that whosoever should say any villany of jesu christ he should be punish the third whosomever should do villany to christian man he should lose half he goods the fourth that the bishop of rome should be chief of all holy church like as the emperor be chief of all the world the fifth that who that have do or should do trespass and flee to the church that he should be keep there free from all injury the sixth that no man should edify any church without license of holy church and consent of the bishop the seventh that the dime and tenth part of the possession should be give to the church after this the emperor come to st peter 's church and confess meekly all he sin tofore all people and what wrong he have do to christian man and make to dig and cast out to make the foundement for the church and bare on he shoulder twelve hod or basket full of earth when helen the mother of constantine dwelling in bethany hear say that the emperor be become christian she send to he a letter in which she praise much she son of this that he have renounce the false idol but she blame he much that he have renounce the law of the jew and worship a man crucify then constantine remand to he mother that she should assemble the greatest master of the jew and he should assemble the greatest master of the christian man to the end that they might dispute and know which be the truest law then helen assemble twelve master which she bring with she which be the wisest that they might find in that law and st silvester and he clerk be of that other party then the emperor ordain two paynim gentile to be they judge of whom that one be name crato and that other zenophilus which be prove wise and expert and they to give the sentence and be judge of the disputation then begin one of the master of the jew for to maintain and dispute he law and st silvester and he clerk answer to he disputation and to they all always conclude they by scripture the judge which be true and just hold more of the party of st silvester than of the jew then say one of the master of the jew name zambry i marvel say he that ye be so wise and incline you to they word let we leave all these word and go we to the effect of the deed then he do do come -lrb- cause to come -rrb- a cruel bull and say a word in he ear and anon the bull die then the people be all against silvester then say silvester believe not thou that he have name in the ear the name of jesu christ but the name of some devil know ye verily it be no great strength to slay a bull for a man or a lion or a serpent may well slay he but it be great virtue to raise he again to life then if he may not raise he it be by the devil and if he may raise he again to life i shall believe that he be dead by the power of god and when the judge hear this they say to zambry that have slay the bull that he should raise he again then he answer that if silvester might raise he in the name of jesus of galilee he master then he would believe in he and thereto bind they all the jew that be there and st silvester first make he orison and prayer to we lord and sith come to the bull and say to he in he ear : thou cursed creature that art enter into this bull and hast slay he go out in the name of jesu christ in whose name i command thee bull arise thou up and go thou with the other beast debonairly and anon the bull arise and go forth softly then the queen and the judge which be paynim be convert to the faith in this time it hap that there be at rome a dragon in a pit which every day slew with he breath more than three hundred man then come the bishop of the idol unto the emperor and say unto he : o thou most holy emperor sith the time that thou hast receive christian faith the dragon which be in yonder foss or pit slayeth every day with he breath more than three hundred man then send the emperor for st silvester and ask counsel of he of this matter st silvester answer that by the might of god he promise to make he cease of he hurt and blessure of this people then st silvester put himself to prayer and st peter appear to he and say : go surely to the dragon and the two priest that be with thee take in thy company and when thou shalt come to he thou shalt say to he in this manner : we lord jesu christ which be bear of the virgin mary crucify bury and arise and now sitteth on the right side of the father this be he that shall come to deem and judge the living and the dead i command thee sathana that thou abide he in this place till he come then thou shalt bind he mouth with a thread and seal it with thy seal wherein be the imprint of the cross then thou and the two priest shall come to I whole and safe and such bread as i shall make ready for you ye shall eat thus as st peter have say st silvester do and when he come to the pit he descend down one hundred and fifty step bear with he two lantern and find the dragon and say the word that st peter have say to he and bind he mouth with the thread and seal it and after return and as he come upward again he meet with two enchanter which follow he for to see if he descend which be almost dead of the stench of the dragon whom he bring with he whole and sound which anon be baptize with a great multitude of people with they thus be the city of rome deliver from double death that be from the culture and worshipping of false idol and from the venom of the dragon at the last when st silvester approach toward he death he call to he the clergy and admonish they to have charity and that they should diligently govern they church and keep they flock from the wolf and after the year of the incarnation of we lord three hundred and twenty he depart out of this world and sleep in we lord etc of st austin that bring christendom to england st austin be a holy monk and send in to england to preach the faith of we lord jesu christ by st gregory then be pope of rome the which have a great zeal and love unto england as be rehearse all along in he legend how that he see child of england in the market of rome for to be sell which be fair of visage for which cause he demand license and obtain to go into england for to convert the people thereof to christian faith and he be on the way the pope die and he be choose pope and be countermand and come again to rome and after when he be sacred into the papacy he remember the realm of england and send st austin as head and chief and other holy monk and priest with he to the number of forty person unto the realm of england and as they come toward england they come in the province of anjou purposing to have rest all night at a place call pounte say a mile from the city and river of ligerim but the woman scorn and be so noyous to they that they drive they out of the town and they come unto a fair broad elm and purpose to have rest there that night but one of the woman which be more cruel than the other purpose to drive they thence and come so nigh they that they might not rest there that night and then st austin take he staff for to remove from that place and suddenly he staff spring out of he hand with a great violence the space of three furlong thence and there stick fast in the earth and when st austin come to he staff and pull it out of the earth incontinent by the might of we lord sourd and spring there a fair well or fountain of clear water which refresh he well and all he fellowship and about that well they rest all that night and they that dwell thereby see all that night over that place a great light come from heaven which cover all that place where these holy man lay and on the morn st austin write in the earth with he staff beside the well these word follow : here have austin the servant of the servant of god hospitality whom st gregory the pope have send to convert england on the morn when the holy man be depart the dweller of the coast thereby which see the light in the night tofore come thither and find there a fair well of the which they marvel greatly and when they see the scripture write in the earth they be greatly abashed because of they unkindness and repent they full sore of that they have mock they the day before and after they edify there a fair church in the same place in the worship of st austin the which the bishop of anjou hallowed and to the hallow thereof come so great multitude of people that they tread the corn in the field down all plain like unto a floor clean sweep for there be no sparing of it notwithstanding at the time of reap that ground so trodden bare more corn and better than any other field beside not trodden do and the high altar of that church standeth over the place where st austin write with he staff by the well and yet unto this day may no woman come in to that church but there be a noble woman that say that she be not guilty in offend st austin and take a taper in she hand and go for to offer it in the say church but the sentence of almighty god may not be revoke for as soon as she enter the church she bowels and sinew begin to shrink and she fall down dead in ensample of all other woman whereby we may understand that injury do against a saint displeaseth greatly almighty god and from thence st austin and he fellowship come into england and arrive in the isle of thanet in east kent and king ethelbert reign that time in kent which be a noble man and a mighty to whom st austin send show the intent of he come from the court of rome and say that he have bring to he right joyful and pleasant tiding and say that if he would obey and do after he preach that he should have everlasting joy in the bliss of heaven and should reign with almighty god in he kingdom and then king ethelbert hearing this command that they should abide and tarry in the same isle and that all thing should be minister to they that be necessary unto the time that he be otherwise advise and soon after the king come to they in the same isle and he be in the field st austin with he fellowship come and speak with he have tofore they the sign of the cross singing by the way the litany beseech god devoutly to strengthen they and help and the king receive he and he fellowship and in the same place st austin preach a glorious sermon and declare to the king the christian faith openly and the great merit and avail that should come thereof in time come and when he have end he sermon the king say to he : you promise be full fair that ye bring but because they be new and have not be hear here before we may not yet give consent thereto nevertheless because ye be come as pilgrim from far country we will not be grevious ne hard to you but we will receive you meekly and minister to you such thing as be necessary neither we will forbid you but as many as ye can convert to you faith and religion by you preach ye shall have license to baptize they and to accompany they to you law and then the king give to they a mansion in the city of dorobernence which now be call canterbury and when they draw nigh the city they come in with a cross of silver and with procession singing the litany pray almighty god of succor and help that he would take away he wrath from the city and to inflame the heart of the people to receive he doctrine and then st austin and he fellowship begin to preach there the word of god and about there in the province and such people as be well disposed anon be convert and follow this holy man and by the holy conversation and miracle that they do much people be convert and great fame arise in the country and when it come to the king 's ear anon he come to the presence of st austin and desire he to preach again and then the word of god so inflamed he that incontinent as soon as the sermon be end the king fall down to the foot of st austin and say sorrowfully : alas woe be I that i have err so long and know not of he that thou speakest of thy promise be so delectable that i think it all too long till i be christen wherefore holy father i require thee to minister to I the sacrament of baptism and then st austin see the great meekness and obedience of the king that he have to be christen he take he up with weep tear and baptize he with all he household and meiny and inform they diligently in the christian faith with great joy and gladness and when all this be do st austin desire the health of the people of england go forth on foot to york and when he come nigh to the city there meet he a blind man which say to he : o thou holy austin help I that be full needy to whom st austin say : i have no silver but such as i have i give thee in the name of jesu christ arise and be all whole and with that word he receive he sight and believe in we lord and be baptize and upon christmas day he baptize in the river name swale ten thousand man without woman and child and there be a great multitude of people resort to the say river which be so deep that no man might pass over on foot and yet by miracle of we lord there be neither man woman ne child drown but they that be sick be make whole both in body and in soul and in the same place they build a church in the worship of god and st austin and when st austin have preach the faith to the people and have confirm they steadfastly therein he return again from york and by the way he meet a leper ask help and when st austin have say these word to he : in the name of jesu christ be thou cleansed from all thy leprosy anon all he filth fall away and a fair new skin appear on he body so that he seem all a new man also as st austin come into oxfordshire to a town that be call compton to preach the word of god to whom the curate say : holy father the lord of this lordship have be ofttimes warn of I to pay he tithe to god and yet he withholdeth they and therefore i have curse he and i find he the more obstinate to whom st austin say : son why payest thou not thy tithe to god and to the church knowest thou not that the tithe be not thine but belong to god and then the knight say to he : i know well that i till the ground wherefore i ought as well to have the tenth sheaf as the ninth and when st austin could not turn the knight 's entent then he depart from he and go to mass and ere he begin he charge that all they that be accurse should go out of the church and then rise a dead body and go out in to the churchyard with a white cloth on he head and stand still there till the mass be do and then st austin go to he and demand he what he be and he answer and say : i be sometime lord of this town and because i would not pay my tithe to my curate he accurse I and so i die and go to hell and then st austin bid bring he to the place where he curate be bury and then the carrion bring he thither to the grave and because that all man should know that life and death be in the power of god st austin say : i command thee in the name of god to arise for we have need of thee and then he arise anon and stand before all the people to whom st austin say : thou knowest well that we lord be merciful and i demand thee brother if thou knowest this man and he say : yea would god that i have never know he for he be a withholder of he tithe and in all he life a evil doer thou knowest that we lord be merciful and as long as the pain of hell endure let we also be merciful to all christian and then st austin deliver to the curate a rod and there the knight kneel on he knee be assoil and then he command he to go again to he grave and there to abide till the day of doom and he enter anon into he grave and forthwith fall to ash and powder and then st austin say to the priest : how long hast thou lain here and he say a hundred and fifty year and then he ask how it stand with he and he say : well holy father for i be in everlasting bliss and then say st austin : wilt thou that i pray to almighty god that thou abide here with we to confirm the heart of man in very belief and then he say : nay holy father for i be in a place of rest and then say st austin : go in peace and pray for I and for all holy church and he then enter again into he grave and anon the body be turn to earth of this sight the lord be sore afeard and come all quake to st austin and to he curate and demand forgiveness of he trespass and promise to make amends and ever after to pay he tithe and to follow the doctrine of st austin after this st austin enter into dorsetshire and come in to a town whereas be wicked people who refuse he doctrine and preach utterly and drive he out of the town casting on he the tail of thornback or like fish wherefore he besought almighty god to show he judgment on they and god send to they a shameful token for the child that be bear after in that place have tail as it be say till they have repent they it be say commonly that this fall at strood in kent but bless be god at this day be no such deformity item in another place there be certain people which would in no wise give faith to he preach ne he doctrine but scorn and mock he wherefore god take such vengeance that they burn with fire invisible so that they skin be red as blood and suffer so great pain that they be constrain to come and ask forgiveness of st austin and then he pray god for they that they might be acceptable to he and receive baptism and that he would release they pain and then he christen they and that burn heat be quench and they be make perfectly whole and feel never after more thereof on a time as st austin be in he prayer we lord appear to he and comforting he with a gentle and familiar speech say : o thou my good servant and true be thou comfort and do manly for i thy lord god be with thee in all thine affection and mine ear be open to thy prayer and for whom thou demandest any petition thou shalt have thy desire and the gate of everlasting life be open to thee where thou shalt joy with I without end and in that same place where we lord say these word he fix he staff into the ground and a well of clear water sourd and spring up in that same place the which well be call cerne and it be in the country of dorset whereas now be build a fair abbey and be name cerne after the well and the church be build in the same place whereas we lord appear to st austin also in the same country be a young man that be lame dumb and deaf and by the prayer of st austin he be make whole and then soon after he be dissolute and wanton and noyed and grieve the people with jangling and talk in the church and then god send to he he old infirmity again because of he misguide and at the last he fall to repentance and ask god forgiveness and st austin and st austin pray for he and he be make whole again the second time and after that he continue in good and virtuous living to he life 's end and after this st austin full of virtue depart out of this world unto we lord god and lieth bury at canterbury in the abbey that he found there in the worship and rule whereas we lord god showeth yet daily many miracle and the third day before the nativity of we lady be hallowed the translation of st austin in which night a citizen of canterbury be that time at winchester see heaven open over the church of st austin and a burning ladder shine full bright and angel come down to the same church and then he think that the church have burn of the great light and brightness that come down on the ladder and marvel greatly what this should mean for he know nothing of the translation of st austin and when he know the truth that on that time the body of the glorious saint be translate he give laud and thanking to almighty god and we may verily know by that evident vision that it be a holy and devout place and as it be say that of old time ancient holy man that use to come thither would at the entry of it do off they hose and shoe and durst not presume to go into that holy monastery but barefoot because so many holy saint be there shrine and bury and god have show so many miracle in that holy place for he bless saint st austin that if i should write they here it should occupy a great book edwin and paulinus _ the conversion of northumbrium _ the black-hair 'd gaunt paulinus by ruddy edwin stand : -- bow down o king of deira before the bless rood cast out thy heathen idol and worship christ we lord -- but edwin look would and ponder would and answer would not a word again the gaunt paulinus to ruddy edwin spake : god offer life immortal for he dear son 's own sake wilt thou not hear he message who bear the key and sword -- but edwin look would and ponder would and answer would not a word rise then a sage old warrior be five-score winter old whose beard from chin to girdle like one long snow-wreath roll would : -- at yule-time in we chamber we sit in warmth and light while cold and howling round we lie the black land of night athwart the room a sparrow dart from the open door : within the happy hearth-light one red flash -- and no more we see it come from darkness and into darkness go : -- so be we life king edwin alas that it be so but if this pale paulinus have somewhat more to tell some news of whence and whither and where the soul will dwell -- if on that outer darkness the sun of hope may shine -- he make life worth the living i take he god for mine so speak the wise old warrior and all about he cry : paulinus ' god have conquer would and he shall be we guide : -- for he make life worth living who bring this message plain when we brief day be over that we shall live again _ -- unknown _ the life of st george martyr st george be a knight and bear in cappadocium on a time he come in to the province of libya to a city which be say silene and by this city be a stagne or a pond like a sea wherein be a dragon which envenom all the country and on a time the people be assemble for to slay

the law and we child be now dead and ye would do the contrary you daughter shall be give or else we shall burn you and you house when the king see he might no more do he begin to weep and say to he daughter : now shall i never see thine espousal then return he to the people amus demand eight day ' respite and they grant it to he and when the eight day be pass they come to he and say : thou seest that the city perisheth : then do the king do array he daughter like as she should be wed and embrace she kiss she and give she he benediction and after lead she to the place where the dragon be when she be there st george pass by and when he see the lady he demand the lady what she make there and she say : go ye you way fair young man that ye perish not also then say he : tell to I what have and why weep ye and doubt ye of nothing when she see that he would know she say to he how she be deliver to the dragon then say st george : fair daughter doubt ye no thing hereof for i shall help thee in

service diligently and that he should have pity on the poor people and after kiss the king and depart now it hap that in the time of diocletian and maximian which be emperor be so great persecution of christian man that within a month be martyr well twenty-two thousand and therefore they have so great dread that some reny and forsake god and do sacrifice to the idol when st george see this he leave the habit of a knight and sell all that he have and give it to the poor and take the habit of a christian man and go into the middle of the paynim and begin to cry : all the god of the paynim and gentile be devil my god make the heaven and be very god then say the provost to he : of what presumption cometh this to thee that thou sayest that we god be devil and say to we what thou art and what be thy name he answer anon and say : i be name george i be a gentleman a knight of cappadocium and have leave all for to serve the god of heaven then the provost enforce himself to draw he unto he

take brand of iron and join they to he side and he bowels which then appear he do do frot with salt and so send he into prison but we lord appear to he the same night with great light and comfort he much sweetly and by this great consolation he take to he so good heart that he doubt no torment that they might make he suffer then when dacian the provost see that he might not surmount he he call he enchanter and say to he : i see that these christian people doubt not we torment the enchanter bind himself upon he head to be smite off if he overcome not he craft then he do take strong venom and meddle it with wine and make invocation of the name of he false god and give it to st george to drink st george take it and make the sign of the cross on it and anon drink it without grieve he any thing then the enchanter make it more stronger than it be tofore of venom and give it he to drink and it grieve he nothing when the enchanter see that he kneel down at the foot of st george and pray he that he would make he christian and when dacian know that he be become christian he make to smite off he head and after on the morn he make st george to be set between two wheel which be full of sword sharp and cut on both side but anon the wheel be break and st george escape without hurt and then command dacian that they should put he in a caldron full of molten lead and when st george enter

he shall anon be make perfectly whole and have he wit again this bless and holy martyr st george be patron of the realm of england and the cry of man of war in the worship of whom be found the noble order of the garter and also a noble college in the castle of windsor by king of england in which college be the heart of st george which sigismund the emperor of almayne bring and give for a great and a precious relic to king harry the fifth the life of st patrick st patrick be bear in britain which be call england and be learn at rome and there flourish in virtue and after depart out of the part of italy where he have long dwell and come home into he country in wale name pendyac and enter into a fair and joyous country call the valley rosine to whom the angel of god appear and say : o patrick this see ne bishopric god have not provide to thee but unto one not yet bear but shall thirty year hereafter be bear and so he leave that country and sail over into ireland and as higden saith in polycronicon the fourth book the twenty-fourth chapter that st patrick 's father be name caprum which be a priest and a deacon 's son which be call fodum and st patrick 's mother be name conchessa martin 's sister of france in he baptism he be name sucate and st germain call he magonius and celestinus the pope name he patrick that be as much to say as father of the citizen st patrick on a day as he preach a sermon of the patience and sufferance of the passion of we lord jesu christ to the king of the country he lean upon he crook or cross and it hap by adventure that he set the end of the crook or he staff upon the king 's foot and pierce he foot with the pike which be sharp beneath the king have suppose that st patrick have do it wittingly for to move he the sooner to patience and to the faith of god but when st patrick perceive it he be much abashed and by he prayer he heal the king and furthermore he impetr and gat grace of we lord that no venomous beast might live in all the country and yet unto this day be no venomous beast in all ireland after it hap on a time that a man of that country steal a sheep which belong to he neighbor whereupon st patrick admonest the people that whomsoever have take it should deliver it again within seven day when all the people be assemble within the church and the man which have steal it make no semblant to render ne deliver again this sheep then st patrick command by the virtue of god that the sheep should bleat and cry in the belly of he that have eat it and so hap it that in the presence of all the people the sheep cry and bleat in the belly of he that have steal it and the man that be culpable repent he of he trespass and the other from then forthon keep they from steal of sheep from any other man also st patrick be wont for to worship and do reverence unto all the cross devoutly that he might see but on a time tofore the sepulchre of a paynim stand a fair cross which he pass and go forth by as he have not see it and he be demand of he fellow why he see not that cross and then he pray to god he say for to know whose it be and he say he hear a voice under the earth say : thou sawest it not because i be a paynim that be bury here and be unworthy that the sign of the cross should stand there wherefore he make the sign of the cross to be take thence on a time as st patrick preach in ireland the faith of jesu christ and do but little profit by he predication for he could not convert the evil rude and wild people he pray to we lord jesu christ that he would show they some sign openly fearful and ghastful by which they might be convert and be repentant of they sin then by the commandment of god st patrick make in the earth a great circle with he staff and anon the earth after the quantity of the circle open and there appear a great pit and a deep and st patrick by the revelation of god understand that there be a place of purgatory in to which whomsoever enter therein he should never have other penance ne feel none other pain and there be show to he that many should enter which should never return ne come again and they that should return should abide but from one morn to another and no more and many enter that come not again as touch this pit or hole which be name st patrick 's purgatory some hold opinion that the second patrick which be a abbot and no bishop that god show to he this place of purgatory but certainly such a place there be in ireland wherein many man have be and yet daily go in and come again and some have have there marvellous vision and see grisly and horrible pain of whom there be book make as of tundale and other then this holy man st patrick the bishop live till he be one hundred and twenty-two year old and be the first that be bishop in ireland and die in aurelius ambrose 's time that be king of britain in he time be the abbot columba otherwise name colinkillus and st bride whom st patrick profess and veil and she over-live he forty year all these three holy saint be bury in ulster in the city of dunence as it be in a cave with three chamber they body be find at the first come of king john king harry the second 's son into ireland upon whose tomb these verse follow be write : hic jacent in duno quus tumulo tumulantur in uno brigida patricius atque columba pius which be for to say in english : in duno these three be bury all in one sepulchre : bride patrick and columba the mild man say that this holy bishop st patrick do three great thing one be that he drive with he staff all the venomous beast out of ireland the second that he have grant of we lord god that none irish man shall abide the come of antichrist the third wonder be read of he purgatory which be more refer to the less st patrick the abbot and this holy abbot because he find the people of that land rebel he go out of ireland and come in to england in the abbey of glastonbury where he die on a st bartholomew 's day he flourish about the year of we lord eight hundred and fifty of saint franci how he receive the counsel of st clare and of brother silvester and how he preach unto the bird the humble servant of christ st franci a short while after he conversion have already gather together many companion and receive they into the order fall into deep thought and much doubting as to what he ought to do : whether to give himself wholly unto prayer or some time also unto preaching : and on this matter he much desire to learn the will of god and for that the holy humility that be in he suffer he not to trust over much in himself nor in he own prayer he think to search out the will of god through the prayer of other : wherefore he call brother masseo and bespake he thus : go unto sister clare and tell she on my behalf that she with certain of she most spiritual companion should pray devoutly unto god that it may please he to show I which of the twain be the better : whether to give myself to preach or wholly unto prayer and then go unto brother silvester and tell the like to he this be that brother silvester who when he be in the world have see a cross of gold proceeding from the mouth of st franci the which reach even unto heaven and the arm thereof unto the end of the world and this brother silvester be of so great devotion and so great sanctity that whatsoe'er he ask of god be grant he and oftentimes he speak with god wherefore st franci have a great devotion unto he so brother masseo depart and accord to the bidding of st franci carry he message first unto st clare and then unto brother silvester who when he have hear thereof forthwith fall on he knee in prayer and as he pray receive answer from god and turn to brother masseo and bespake he thus : thus saith the lord : say unto brother franci that god have not call he to this estate for himself alone but to the end that he may gain fruit of soul and that many through he may be save with this reply brother masseo return to st clare to learn what she have receive of god and she answer that god have send to she and she companion the same reply as he have give to brother silvester whereat brother masseo hie he back again to st franci and st franci receive he with exceed great love wash he foot and make ready for he the meal and after he have eat st franci call brother masseo into the wood and there kneel down before he and draw back he hood stretch out he arm in the shape of a cross and ask he : what have my lord jesu christ command that i should do reply brother masseo : as unto brother silvester so likewise unto sister clare and she sister have christ make answer and reveal : that it be he will that thou go throughout the world to preach since he have choose thee not for thyself alone but also for the salvation of other and then st franci when he have hear this answer and known thereby the will of jesu christ rise up with fervor exceed great and say : let we be go in the name of god and he take for he companion brother masseo and brother agnolo holy man and set forth with fervent zeal of spirit take no thought for road or way they come unto a little town that be call savurniano and st franci set himself to preach but first he bid the swallow that be twitter keep silence till such time as he have do the preaching and the swallow be obedient to he word and he preach there with such fervor that all the man and woman of that town mind through they devotion to come after he and leave the town but st franci suffer they not say : make not ill haste nor leave you home and i will ordain for you what ye should do for the salvation of you soul : and therewith he resolve to find the third order for the salvation of all the world and so leave they much comfort and with mind firm set on penitence he depart thence and come unto a place between cannaio and bevagno and as with great fervor he be go on the way he lift up he eye and behold some tree hard by the road whereon sit a great company of bird well-nigh without number whereat st franci marvel and say to he companion : ye shall wait for I here upon the way and i will go to preach unto my little sister the bird and he go unto the field and begin to preach unto the bird that be on the ground and immediately those that be on the tree fly down to he and they all of they remain still and quiet together until st franci make a end of preach : and not even then do they depart until he have give they he blessing and accord to what brother masseo afterward related unto robert jacque da massa st franci go among they touch they with he cloak howbeit none move from out he place the sermon that st franci preach unto they be after this fashion : my little sister the bird much bounden be ye unto god you creator and always in every place ought ye to praise he for that he have give you liberty to fly about everywhere and have also give you double and triple raiment moreover he preserve you seed in the ark of noah that you race might not perish out of the world still more be ye beholden to he for the element of the air which he have appoint for you beyond all this ye sow not neither do you reap and god feedeth you and giveth you the stream and fountain for you drink the mountain and the valley for you refuge and the high tree whereon to make you nest and because ye know not how to spin or sew god clotheth you you and you child wherefore you creator loveth you much see that he have bestow on you so many benefit and therefore my little sister beware of the sin of ingratitude and study always to give praise unto god whena st franci speak these word to they those bird begin all of they to open they beak and stretch they neck and spread they wing and reverently bend they head down to the ground and by they act and by they song to show that the holy father give they joy exceed great and st franci rejoice with they and be glad and marvel much at so great a company of bird and they most beautiful diversity and they good heed and sweet friendliness for the which cause he devoutly praise they creator in they at the last have end the preach st franci make over they the sign of the cross and give they leave to go away and thereby all the bird with wondrous singing rise up in the air and then in the fashion of the cross that st franci have make over they divide themselves into four part and the one part fly toward the east and the other toward the west and the other toward the south and the fourth toward the north and each flight go on its way singing wondrous song signify thereby that even as st franci the standard-bearer of the cross of christ have preach unto they and make over they the sign of the cross after the pattern of which they separate themselves unto the four part of the world : even so the preaching of the cross of christ renew by st franci would be carry by he and the brother throughout the world the which brother after the fashion of the bird possess nothing of they own in this world commit they life wholly unto the providence of god how st franci convert the fierce wolf of agobio what time st franci abode in the city of agobio there appear in the country of agobio a exceed great wolf terrible and fierce the which not only devour animal but also man insomuch that all the city folk stand in great fear sith ofttime he come near to the city and all man when they go out array they in arm as it be for the battle and yet withal they might not avail to defend they against he whensoe'er any chance on he alone for fear of this wolf they be come to such a pass that none dare go forth of that place for the which matter st franci have compassion on the people of that land wish to go forth unto that wolf albeit the townsfolk all give counsel against it : and make the sign of the most holy cross he go forth from that place with he companion put all he trust in god and the other misdoubt to go further st franci take the road to the place where the wolf lay and lo in the sight of many of the townsfolk that have come out to see this miracle the say wolf make at st franci with open mouth : and come up to he st franci make over he the sign of the most holy cross and call he to he and bespake he thus : come hither brother wolf : i command thee in the name of christ that thou do no harm nor to I nor to any one o wondrous thing whenas st franci have make the sign of the cross right so the terrible wolf shut he jaw and stay he running : and when he be bid come gently as a lamb and lay he down at the foot of st franci thereat st franci thus bespake he : brother wolf much harm hast thou work in these part and do grievous ill spoil and slaying the creature of god without he leave : and not alone hast thou slay and devour the brute beast but hast dare to slay man make in the image of god for the which cause thou art deserving of the gibbet as a thief and a most base murderer and all man cry out and murmur against thee and all this land be thine enemy but i would fain brother wolf make peace between thee and these so that thou mayest no more offend they and they may forgive thee all thy past offence and nor man nor dog pursue thee any more at these word the wolf with movement of body tail and eye and by the bend of he head give sign of he assent to what st franci say and of he will to abide therby then speak st franci again : brother wolf sith it pleaseth thee to make and hold this peace i promise thee that i will see to it that the folk of this place give thee food alway so long as thou shalt live so that thou suffer not hunger any more for that i wot well that through hunger hast thou work all this ill but sith i win for thee this grace i will brother wolf that thou promise I to do none hurt to any more be he man or beast dost promise I this and the wolf give clear token by the bowing of he head that he promise then quoth st franci : brother wolf i will that thou plight I troth for this promise that i may trust thee full well and st franci stretch forth he hand to take pledge of he troth the wolf lift up he right paw before he and lay it gently on the hand of st franci give thereby such sign of good faith as he be able then quoth st franci : brother wolf i bid thee in the name of jesu christ come now with I nothing doubt and let we go stablish this peace in god 's name and the wolf obedient set forth with he in fashion as a gentle lamb whereat the townsfolk make mighty marvel beholding and straightway the bruit of it be spread through all the city so that all the people men-folk and women-folk great and small young and old gat they to the market place for to see the wolf with st franci and the people be gather all together st franci rise up to preach avize they among other matter how for they sin god suffer such thing to be and pestilence also : and how far more parlous be the flame of hell the which must vex the damned eternally than be the fury of the wolf that can but slay the body how much then should man fear the jaw of hell when such a multitude stand sore adread of the jaw of one so small a beast then turn ye beloved unto god and work out a fit repentance for you sin and god will set you free from the wolf in this present time and in time to come from out the fire of hell and do the preach st franci say : give ear my brother : brother wolf who standeth here before ye have promise I and plighted troth to make he peace with you and to offend no more in any thing and do ye promise he to give he every day whate'er he need : and i be make he surety unto you that he will keep this pact of peace right steadfastly then promise all the folk with one accord to give he food abidingly then quoth st franci to the wolf before they all : and thou brother wolf dost thou make promise to keep firm this pact of peace that thou offend not man nor beast nor any creature and the wolf kneel he down and bow he head : and with gentle movement of he body tail and eye give sign as best he could that he would keep they pact entire quoth st franci : brother wolf i wish that as thou hast pledge I thy faith to this promise without the gate even so shouldest thou pledge I thy faith to thy promise before all the people and that thou play I not false for my promise and the surety that i have give for thee then the wolf lift up he right paw lay it in the hand of st franci therewith this act and the other set forth above work such great joy and marvel in all the people both through devotion to the saint and through the newness of the miracle and through the peace with the wolf that all begin to lift up they voice unto heaven praise and blessing god that have send st franci unto they who by he merit have set they free from the jaw of the cruel beast and thereafter this same wolf live two year in agobio and go like a tame beast in and out the house from door to door without do hurt to any or any do hurt to he and be courteously nourish by the people and as he pass thuswise through the country and the house never do any dog bark behind he at length after a two year ' space brother wolf die of old age : whereat the townsfolk sorely grieve sith mark he pass so gently through the city they mind they the better of the virtue and the sanctity of st franci how st franci tame the wild turtle-dove it befall on a day that a certain young man have catch many turtle-dove : and as he be carry they for sale st franci who have ever a tender pity for gentle creature meet he and look on those turtle-dove with pity eye say to the youth : i pray thee give they I that bird so gentle unto which the scripture likeneth chaste and humble and faithful soul may not fall into the hand of cruel man that would kill they forthwith inspire of god he give they all to st franci and he receive they into he bosom begin to speak tenderly unto they : o my sister simple-minded turtle-doves innocent and chaste why have ye let yourselve be catch now would i fain deliver you from death and make you nest that ye may be fruitful and multiply accord to the commandment of you creator and st franci go and make nest for they all : and they abide therein begin to lay they egg and hatch they before the eye of the brother : and so tame be they they dwell with st franci and all the other brother as though they have be fowl that have always feed from they hand and never do they go away until st franci with he blessing give they leave to go and to the young man who have give they to he st franci say : my little son thou wilt yet be a brother in this order and do precious service unto jesu christ and so it come to pass for the say youth become a brother and live in the order in great sanctity song of the emigrant in bermuda where the remote bermuda ride in the ocean 's bosom unespy from a small boat that row would along the

unknown and yet far kinder than we own he land we on a grassy stage safe from the storm and prelate 's rage : he give we this eternal spring which here enamel everything and send the fowl to we in

felicium browne heman _ the pilgrim 's progress _ in the similitude of a dream _ as i walk through the wilderness of this world i light on a certain place where be a den and lay I down in that place to sleep and as i sleep i dream a dream i dream and behold i see a man clothe with rag stand in a certain place with he face from he own house a book in he hand and a great burden upon he back i look and see he open the book and read therein and as he read he weep and tremble and not be able longer to contain he brake out with a lamentable cry say what shall i do in this plight therefore he go home and restrain himself as long as he could that he wife and child should not perceive he distress but he could not be silent long because that he trouble increase wherefore at length he brake he mind to he wife and child and thus he begin to talk to they : o my dear wife say he and you the child of my bowels i you dear friend be in myself undo by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon I moreover i be certainly inform that this we city will be burn with fire from heaven in which fearful overthrow both myself with thee my wife and you my sweet-babe shall miserably come to ruin except -lrb- the which yet i see not -rrb- some way of escape _ can _ be find whereby we may be deliver at this he relation be sore amaze not for that they believe that what he say to they be true but because they think that some frenzy distemper have get into he head therefore it draw toward night and they hope that sleep might settle he brain with all haste they get he to bed but the night be as troublesome to he as the day wherefore instead of sleep he spend it in sigh and tear so when the morning be come they would know how he do he tell they worse and worse : he also set to talk to they again but they begin to be harden they also think to drive away he distemper by harsh and surly carriage to he sometimes they would deride sometimes they would chide and sometimes they would quite neglect he wherefore he begin to retire himself to he chamber to pray for and pity they and also to condole he own misery he would also walk solitarily in the field sometimes read and sometimes pray and thus for some day he spend he time now i saw upon a time when he be walk in the field that he be as he be wont reading in he book and greatly distressed in he mind and as he read he burst out as he have do before cry what shall i do to be save i saw also that he look this way and that way as if he would run yet he stand still because as i perceive he could not tell which way to go i look then and see a man name evangelist come to he and he ask wherefore dost thou cry he answer sir i perceive by the book in my hand that i be condemn to die and after that to come to judgment and i find that i be not willing to do the first nor able to do the second then say evangelist why not willing to die since this life be attend with so many evil the man answer because i fear that this burden that be upon my back will sink I lower than the grave and i shall fall into tophet and sir if i be not fit to go to prison i be not fit to go to judgment and from thence to execution and the thought of these thing make I cry then say evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still he answer because i know not whither to go then he give he a parchment roll and there be write within flee from the wrath to come the man therefore read it and look upon evangelist very carefully say whither must i fly then say evangelist point with he finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicket-gate the man say no then say the other do you see yonder shine light he say i think i do then say evangelist keep that light in you eye and go up directly thereto so shalt thou see the gate at which when thou knockest it shall be tell thee what thou shalt do so i saw in my dream that the man begin to run now he have not run far from he own door when he wife and child perceive it begin to cry after he to return but the man put he finger in he ear and run on cry life life eternal life so he look not behind he but flee toward the middle of the plain the neighbor also come out to see he run and as he run some mock other threaten and some cry after he to return and among those that do so there be two that resolve to fetch he back by force the name of the one be obstinate and the name of the other pliable now by this time the man be get a good distance from they but however they be resolve to pursue he which they do and in a little time they overtake he then say the man neighbor wherefore be ye come they say to persuade you to go back with we but he say that can by no means be you dwell say he in the city of destruction the place also where i be bear : i see it to be so and die there sooner or later you will sink lower than the grave into a place that burn with fire and brimstone : be content good neighbor and go along with I what say obstinate and leave we friend and comfort behind we yes say christian for that be he name because that all which you forsake be not worthy to be compare with a little of that i be seek to enjoy and if you will go along with I and hold it you shall fare as i myself for there where i go be enough and to spare come away and prove my word _ obst _ what be the thing you seek since you leave all the world to find they _ chr _ i seek a inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away and it be lay up in heaven and safe there to be bestow at the time appoint on they that diligently seek it read it so if you will in my book tush say obstinate away with you book will you go back with we or no no not i say the other because i have lay my hand to the plow _ obst _ come then neighbor pliable let we turn again and go home without he there be a company of these crazy-headed coxcomb that when they take a fancy by the end be wiser in they own eye than seven man that can render a reason _ plus _ then say pliable do not revile if what the good christian say be true the thing he look after be better than ours my heart incline to go with my neighbor _ obst _ what more fool still be rule by I and go back who know whither such a brain-sick fellow will lead you go back go back and be wise _ chr _ come with I neighbor pliable there be such thing to be have which i speak of and many more glory beside if you believe not I read here in this book and for the truth of what be express therein behold all be confirm by the blood of he that make it _ plus _ well neighbor obstinate say pliable i begin to come to a point i intend to go along with this good man and to cast in my lot with he : but my good companion do you know the way to this desire place _ chr _ i be direct by a man whose name be evangelist to speed I to a little gate that be before we where we shall receive instruction about the way _ plus _ come then good neighbor let we be go then they go both together _ obst _ and i will go back to my place say obstinate i will be no companion of such mislead fantastical fellow now i saw in my dream that when obstinate be go back christian and pliable go talk over the plain and thus they begin they discourse _ chr _ come neighbor pliable how do you do i be glad you be persuade to go along with I have even obstinate himself but feel what i have feel of the power and terror of what be yet unseen he would not thus lightly have give we the back _ plus _ come neighbor christian since there be none but we two here tell I now further what the thing be and how to be enjoy whither we be go _ chr _ i can better conceive of they with my mind than speak of they with my tongue : but yet since you be desirous to know i will read they in my book _ plus _ and do you think that the word of you book be certainly true _ chr _ yes verily for it be make by he that can not lie _ pit _ well say what thing be they _ chr _ there be a endless kingdom to be inhabit and everlasting life to be give we that we may inhabit that kingdom forever _ plus _ well say and what else _ chr _ there be crown of glory to be give we and garment that will make we shine like the sun in the firmament of heaven _ plus _ this be excellent : and what else _ chr _ there shall be no more cry nor sorrow for he that be owner of the place will wipe all tear from we eye _ plus _ and what company shall we have there _ chr _ there we shall be with seraphim and cherubim creature that will dazzle you eye to look on they there also you shall meet with thousand and ten thousand that have go before we to that holy place none of they be hurtful but loving and holy every one walk in the sight of god and standing in he presence with acceptance forever in a word there we shall see the elder with they golden crown there we shall see the holy virgin with they golden harp there we shall see man that by the world be cut in piece burn in flame eat of beast drown in the sea for the love they bare to the lord of the place all well and clothe with immortality as with a garment _ plus _ the hearing of this be enough to ravish one 's heart but be these thing to be enjoy how shall we get to be sharer thereof _ chr _ the lord the governor of the country have record that in this book the substance of which be if we be truly willing to have it he will bestow it upon we freely _ plus _ well my good companion glad be i to hear of these thing : come on let we mend we pace _ chr _ i can not go so fast as i would by reason of this burden that be on my back now i saw in my dream that just as they have end this talk they draw nigh to a very miry slough that be in the midst of the plain : and they be heedless do both fall suddenly into the bog the name of the slough be despond here therefore they wallow for a time be grievously bedaub with dirt and christian because of the burden that be on he back begin to sink in the mire _ plus _ then say pliable ah neighbor christian where be you now _ chr _ truly say christian i do not know _ pli _ at this pliable begin to be offend and angrily say to he fellow be this the happiness you have tell I all this while of if we have such ill speed at we first set out what may we expect between this and we journey 's end may i get out again with my life you shall possess the brave country alone for I and with that he give a desperate struggle or two and get out of the mire on that side of the slough which be next to he own house : so away he go and christian see he no more wherefore christian be leave to tumble in the slough of despond alone : but still he endeavor to struggle to that side of the slough that be furthest from he own house and next to the wicket-gate the which he do but could not get out because of the burden that be upon he back : but i beheld in my dream that a man come to he whose name be help and ask he what he do there _ chr _ sir say christian i be bid to go this way by a man call evangelist who direct I also to yonder gate that i might escape the wrath to come and as i be go thither i fall in here _ help _ but why do not you look for the step _ chr _ fear follow I so hard that i flee the next way and fall in _ help _ then say he give I thine hand so he give he he hand and he draw he out and he set he upon sound ground and bid he go on he way then i step to he that pluck he out and say sir wherefore since over this place be the way from the city of destruction to yonder gate be it that this plat be not mend that poor traveller might go thither with more security and he say unto I this miry slough be such a place as can not be mend : it be the descent whither the scum and filth that attend conviction for sin doth continually run and therefore it be call the slough of despond for still as the sinner be awaken about he lost condition there arise in he soul many fear and doubt and discourage apprehension which all of they get together and settle in this place : and this be the reason of the badness of this ground it be not the pleasure of the king that this place should remain so bad he laborer also have by the direction of he majesty 's surveyor be for above these sixteen hundred year employ about this patch of ground if perhaps it might have be mend : yea and to my knowledge say he here have be swallow up at least twenty thousand cart-load yea million of wholesome instruction that have at all season be bring from all place of the king 's dominion -- and they that can tell say they be the best material to make good ground of the place -- if so be it might have be mend but it be the slough of despond still and so will be when they have do what they can true there be by the direction of the lawgiver certain good and substantial step place even through the very midst of this slough but at such time as this place doth much spew out its filth as it doth against change of weather these step be hardly see or if they be man through the dizziness of they head step beside and then they be bemire to purpose notwithstanding the step be there but the ground be good when they be once in at the gate now i saw in my dream that by this time pliable be get home to he house so he neighbor come to visit he and some of they call he wise man for come back and some call he fool for hazard himself with christian other again do mock at he cowardliness say surely since you begin to venture i would not have be so base to have give out for a few difficulty : so pliable sit sneak among they but at last he get more confidence and then they all turn they tale and begin to deride poor christian behind he back and thus much concern pliable so in the process of time christian get up to the gate now over the gate there be write knock and it shall be open unto you he knock therefore more than once or twice say may i now enter here will he within open to sorry I though i have be a undeserving rebel then shall i not fail to sing he lasting praise on high at last there come a grave person to the gate name goodwill who ask who be there and whence he come and what he would have _ chr _ here be a poor burden sinner i come from the city of destruction but be go to mount zion that i may be deliver from the wrath to come : i would therefore sir since i be inform that by this gate be the way thither know if you be willing to let I in _ good _ i be willing with all my heart say he and with that he open the gate so when christian be step in the other give he a pull then say christian what mean that the other tell he a little distance from this gate there be erect a strong castle of which beelzebub be the captain from thence both he and they that be with he shoot arrow at those who come up to this gate if haply they may die before they can enter it then say christian i rejoice and tremble now i saw in my dream that the highway which christian be to go be fence on either side with a wall and that wall be call salvation up this way therefore do burden christian run but not without great difficulty because of the load on he back he run thus till he come at a place somewhat ascend and upon that place stand a cross and a little below in the bottom a sepulchre so i saw in my dream that just as christian come up with the cross he burden loose from off he shoulder and fall from off he back and begin to tumble and so continue to do till it come to the mouth of the sepulchre where it fall in and i see it no more then be christian glad and lightsome and say with a merry heart he have give I rest by he sorrow and life by he death then he stand still awhile to look and wonder for it be very surprising to he that the sight of the cross should thus ease he of he burden he look therefore and look again even till the spring that be in he head send the water down he cheek now as he stand look and weep behold three shine one come to he and salute he with peace be to thee so the first say to he thy sin be forgive thee the second strip he of he rag and clothe he with change of raiment the third also set a mark on he forehead and give he a roll with a seal upon it which he bid he look on as he run and that he should give it in at the celestial gate so they go they way then christian give three leap for joy and go on singing : thus far do i come laden with my sin nor could aught ease the grief that i be in till i come hither what a place be this must here be the beginning of my bliss must here the burden fall from off my back must here the string that bind it to I crack blest cross blest sepulchre blest rather be the man that there be put to shame for I i see then in my dream that he go on thus even until he come at the bottom where he see a little out of the way three man fast asleep with fetter upon they heel the name of the one be simple of another sloth and of the third presumption christian then see they lie in this case go to they if peradventure he might awake they and cry you be like they that sleep on the top of a mast for the dead sea be under you a gulf that have no bottom : awake therefore and come away be willing also and i will help you off with you iron he also tell they if he that goeth about like a roar lion come by you will certainly become a prey to he tooth with that they look upon he and begin to reply in this sort : simple say i see no danger sloth say yet a little more sleep and presumption say every tub must stand upon its own bottom and so they lay down to sleep again and christian go on he way yet be he trouble to think that man in that danger should so little esteem the kindness of he that so freely offer to help they both by awakening of they counsel of they and proffer to help they off with they iron and as he be trouble thereabout he espy two man come tumble over the wall on the left hand of the narrow way and they make up apace to he the name of the one be formalist and the name of the other hypocrisy so as i say they draw up unto he who thus enter with he into discourse _ chr _ gentleman whence come you and whither do you go _ form _ and _ hyp _ we be bear in the land of vain-glory and be go for praise to mount zion _ chr _ why come you not in at the gate which standeth at the beginning of the way know ye not that it be write that he that cometh not in by the door but climbeth up some other way the same be a thief and a robber they say that to go to the gate for entrance be by all they countryman count too far about and that therefore they usual way be to make a short cut of it and to climb over the wall as they have do _ chr _ but will it not be count a trespass against the lord of the city whither we be bind thus to violate he reveal will they tell he that as for that he need not to trouble he head thereabout : for what they do they have custom for and could produce if need be testimony that would witness it for more than a thousand year but say christian will you practice stand a trial at law they tell he that custom it be of so long standing as above a thousand year would doubtless now be admit as a thing legal by a impartial judge and besides say they if we get into the way what matter be it which way we get in if we be in we be in : thou art but in the way who as we perceive come in at the gate : and we also be in the way that come tumble over the wall : wherein now be thy condition better than ours _ chr _ i walk by the rule of my master : you walk by the rude working of you fancy you be count thief already by the lord of the way : therefore i doubt you will not be find true man at the end of the way you come in by yourselve without he direction and shall go out by yourselve without he mercy to this they make he but little answer only they bid he look to himself then i see that they go on every man in he way without much conference one with another save that these two man tell christian that as to law and ordinance they doubt not but that they should as conscientiously do they as he therefore say they we see not wherein thou differest from we but by the coat that be on thy back which be as we trow give thee by some of thy neighbor to hide the shame of thy nakedness _ chr _ by law and ordinance you will not be save since you come not in by the door and as for this coat that be on my back it be give I by the lord of the place whither i go and that as you say to cover my nakedness with and i take it as a token of he kindness to I for i have nothing but rag before and besides thus i comfort myself as i go surely think i when i come to the gate of the city the lord thereof will know I for good since i have he coat on my back a coat that he give I freely in the day that he strip I of my rag i have moreover a mark in my forehead of which perhaps you have take no notice which one of my lord 's most intimate associate fix there in the day that my burden fall off my shoulder i will tell you moreover that i have then give I a roll seal to comfort I by read as i go in the way i be also bid to give it in at the celestial gate in token of my certain go in after it all which thing i doubt you want and want they because you come not in at the gate to these thing they give he no answer only they look upon each other and laugh then i see that they go on all save that christian keep before who have no more talk but with himself and that sometimes sighingly and sometimes comfortably also he would be often read in the roll that one of the shine one give he by which he be refresh i beheld then that they all go on till they come to the foot of the hill difficulty at the bottom of which there be a string there be also in the same place two other way besides that which come straight from the gate one turn to the left hand and the other to the right at the bottom of the hill but the narrow way lay right up the hill and the name of the go up the side of the hill be call difficulty christian now go to the spring and drink thereof to refresh himself and then begin to go up the hill say : the hill though high i covet to ascend the difficulty will not I offend for i perceive the way to life lie here come pluck up heart let 's neither faint nor fear better though _ difficult _ the right way to go than wrong though _ easy _ where the end be woe the other two also come to the foot of the hill but when they see the hill be steep and high and that there be two other way to go and suppose also that these two way might meet again with that up which christian go on the other side of the hill therefore they be resolve to go in those way now the name of one of those way be danger and the name of the other destruction so the one take the way which be call danger which lead he into a great wood and the other take directly up the way to destruction which lead he into a wide field full of dark mountain where he stumble and fall and rise no more i look then after christian to see he go up the hill where i perceive he fall from run to go and from go to clamber upon he hand and he knee because of the steepness of the place now about midway to the top of the hill be a pleasant arbor make by the lord of the hill for the refreshment of weary traveller thither therefore christian get where also he sit down to rest he then he pull he roll out of he bosom and read therein to he comfort he also now begin afresh to take a review of the coat or garment that be give he as he stand by the cross thus please himself awhile he at last fall into a slumber and thence into a fast sleep which detain he in that place until it be almost night and in he sleep he roll fall out of he hand now as he be sleep there come one to he and awake he say go to the ant thou sluggard consider she way and be wise and with that christian suddenly start up and speed he on he way and go apace till he come to the top of the hill now when he be get up to the top of the hill there come two man run to meet he amain the name of the one be timorous and of the other mistrust : to whom christian say sir what be the matter you run the wrong way timorous answer that they be go to the city of zion and have get up that difficult place : but say he the further we go the more danger we meet with wherefore we turn and be go back again yes say mistrust for just before we lie a couple of lion in the way whether sleep or wake we know not and we could not think if we come within reach but they would presently pull we to piece _ chr _ then say christian you make I afraid but whither shall i fly to be safe if i go back to my own country that be prepare for fire and brimstone and i shall certainly perish there if i can get to the celestial city i be sure to be in safety there : i must venture to go back be nothing but death to go forward be fear of death and life everlasting beyond it i will yet go forward so mistrust and timorous run down the hill and christian go on he way but think again of what he hear from the man he feel in he bosom for he roll that he might read therein and be comfort but he feel and find it not then be christian in great distress and know not what to do for he want that which use to relieve he and that which should have be he pass into the celestial city here therefore he begin to be much perplexed and know not what to do at last he bethink himself that he have sleep in the arbor that be on the side of the hill and fall down upon he knee he ask god forgiveness for that he foolish act and then go back to look for he roll but all the way he go back who can sufficiently set forth the sorrow of christian 's heart sometimes he sigh sometimes he weep and oftentimes he chide himself for be so foolish to fall asleep in that place which be erect only for a little refreshment from he weariness thus therefore he go back carefully look on this side and on that all the way as he go if happily he might find he roll that have be he comfort so many time in he journey he go thus till he come within sight of the arbor where he sit and sleep but that sight renew he sorrow the more by bring again even afresh he evil of sleep unto he mind thus therefore he now go on bewail he sinful sleep say oh wretched man that i be that i should sleep in the daytime that i should sleep in the midst of difficulty that i should so indulge the flesh as to use that rest for ease to my flesh which the lord of the hill have erect only for the relief of the spirit of pilgrim how many step have i take in vain thus it happen to israel : for they sin they be send back again by the way of the red sea and i be make to tread those step with sorrow which i might have tread with delight have it not be for this sinful sleep how far might i have be on my way by this time i be make to tread those step thrice over which i need not to have tread but once : yea also now i be like to be benighted for the day be almost spend oh that i have not sleep now by this time he be come to arbor again where for awhile he sit down and weep but at last as christian would have it look sorrowfully down under the settle there he espy he roll the which he with tremble and haste catch up and put it into he bosom but who can tell how joyful this man be when he have get he roll again for this roll be the assurance of he life and acceptance at the desire haven therefore he lay it up in he bosom give thanks to god for direct he eye to the place where it lay and with joy and tear betake himself again to he journy but oh how nimbly now do he go up the rest of the hill yet before he get up the sun go down upon christian and this make he again recall the vanity of he sleep to he remembrance and thus he again begin to condole with himself : o thou sinful sleep how for thy sake be i like to be benighted in my journey i must walk without the sun darkness must cover the path of my foot and i must hear the noise of the doleful creature because of my sinful sleep now also he remember the story that mistrust and timorous tell he of how they be fright with the sight of the lion then say christian to himself again these beast range in the night for they prey and if they should meet with I in the dark how should i shift they how should i escape be by they tear in piece thus he go on he way but while he be thus bewail he unhappy miscarriage he lift up he eye and behold there be a very stately palace before he the name of which be beautiful and it stand just by the highway side so i saw in my dream that he make haste and go forward that if possible he might get lodge there now before he have go far he enter into a very narrow passage which be about a furlong off the porter 's lodge and look very narrowly before he as he go he espy two lion in the way now think he i see the danger that mistrust and timorous be drive back by -lrb- the lion be chained but he see not the chain -rrb- then he be afraid and thought also himself to go back after they for he think nothing but death be before he but the porter at the lodge whose name be watchful perceive that christian make a halt as if he would go back cry unto he say be thy strength so small fear not the lion for they be chained and be place there for trial of faith where it be and for discovery of those that have none keep in the midst of the path and no hurt shall come unto thee then i see that he go on tremble for fear of the lion but take good heed to the direction of the porter he hear they roar but they do he no harm then he clap he hand and go on till he come and stand before the gate where the porter be then say christian to the porter sir what house be this and may i lodge here to-night the porter answer this house be build by the lord of the hill and he build it for the relief and security of pilgrim the porter also ask whence he be and whither he be go _ chr _ i be come from the city of destruction and be go to mount zion but because the sun be now set i desire if i may to lodge here to-night _ port _ what be you name _ chr _ my name be now christian but my name at the first be graceless i come of the race of japheth whom god will persuade to dwell in the tent of shem _ port _ but how doth it happen that you come so late the sun be set _ chr _ i have be here sooner but that wretched man as i be i sleep in the arbor that stand on the hillside nay i have notwithstanding that be here much sooner but that in my sleep i lose my evidence and come without it to the brow of the hill and then feel for it and find it not i be force with sorrow of heart to go back to the place where i sleep my sleep where i find it and now i be come _ port _ well i will call out one of the virgin of this place who will if she like you talk bring you in to the rest of the family accord to the rule of the house so watchful the porter ring a bell at the sound of which come out of the door of the house a grave and beautiful damsel name discretion and ask why she be call the porter answer this man be on a journey from the city of destruction to mount zion but be weary and benighted he ask I if he might lodge here to-night so i tell he i would call for thee who after discourse have with he mayest do as seemeth thee good even accord to the law of the house then she ask he whence he be and whither he be go and he tell she she ask he also how he get into the way and he tell she then she ask he what he have see and meet with in the way and he tell she and at last she ask he name so he say it be christian and i have so much the more a desire to lodge here to-night because by what i perceive this place be build by the lord of the hill for the relief and security of pilgrim so she smile but the water stand in she eye and after a little pause she say i will call forth two or three more of the family so she run to the door and call out prudence piety and charity who after a little more discourse with he have he into the family and many of they meet he at the threshold of the house say come in thou bless of the lord this house be build by the lord of the hill on purpose to entertain such pilgrim in then he bow he head and follow they into the house so when he be come in and sit down they give he something to drink and consent together that until supper be ready some of they should have some particular discourse with christian for the best improvement of time and they appoint piety prudence and charity to discourse with he now i saw in my dream that thus they sit talk together until supper be ready so when they have make ready they sit down to meat now the table be furnish with fat thing and wine that be well refine and all they talk at the table be about the lord of the hill as namely what he have do and wherefore he do what he do and why he have build that house and by what they say i perceive that he have be a great warrior and have fight with and slay he that have the power of death but not without great danger to himself which make I love he the more for as they say and as i believe say christian he do it with the loss of much blood but that which put the glory of grace into all he do be that he do it out of pure love to this country and besides there be some of they of the household that say they have be and speak with he since he do die on the cross and they have attest that they have it from he own lip that he be such a lover of poor pilgrim that the like be not to be find from the east to the west they moreover give a instance of what they affirm and that be he have strip himself of he glory that he might do this for the poor and that they have hear he say and affirm that he would not dwell in the mountain of zion alone they say moreover that he have make many pilgrim prince though by nature they be beggar bear and they original have be the dunghill thus they discourse together till late at night : and after they have commit themselves to they lord for protection they betake themselves to rest the pilgrim they lay in a large upper chamber whose window open toward the sunrise the name of the chamber be peace where he sleep till break of day and then he awake and sing : where be i now be this the love and care of jesus for the man that pilgrim be thus to provide that i should be forgive and dwell already the next door to heaven so in the morning they all get up and after some more discourse they tell he that he should not depart till they have show he the rarity of that place and first they have he into the study where they show he record of the greatest antiquity in which as i remember my dream they show he the pedigree of the lord of the hill that he be the son of the ancient of day and come by that eternal generation here also be more fully record the act that he have do and the name of many hundred that he have take into he service and how he have place they in such habitation that could neither by length of day nor decay of nature be dissolve then they read to he some of the worthy act that some of he servant have do as how they have subdue kingdom work righteousness obtain promise stop the mouth of lion quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness be make strong wax valiant in fight and turn to flight the army of the alien then they read again another part of the record of the house where it be show how willing they lord be to receive into he favor any even any though they in time past have offer great affront to he person and proceedings here also be several other history of many other famous thing of all which christian have a view as of thing both ancient and modern together with prophecy and prediction of thing that have they certain accomplishment both to the dread and amazement of enemy and the comfort and solace of pilgrim the next day they take he and have he into the armory where they show he all manner of furniture which they lord have provide for pilgrim as sword shield helmet breastplate all-prayer and shoe that would not wear out and there be here enough of this to harness out as many man for the service of they lord as there be star in heaven for multitude they also show he some of the engine with which some of he servant have do wonderful thing they show he mose ' rod the hammer and nail with which jael slew sisera the pitcher trumpet and lamp too with which gideon put to flight the army of midian then they show he the ox 's goad wherewith shamgar slew six hundred man they show he also the jaw-bone with which samson do such mighty feat they show he moreover the sling and stone with which david slew goliath of gath and the sword also with which they lord will kill the man of sin in the day that he shall rise up to the prey they show he besides many excellent thing with which christian be much delighted this do they go to they rest again then i saw in my dream that on the morrow he get up to go forward but they desire he to stay till the next day also and then say they we will if the day be clear show you the delectable mountain which they say would yet further add to he comfort because they be nearer the desire haven than the place where at present he be so he consent and stay when the morning be up they have he to the top of the house and bid he look south so he do and behold at a great distance he see a most pleasant mountainous country beautify with wood vineyard fruit of all sort flower also with spring and fountain very delectable to behold then he ask the name of the country they say it be immanuel 's land and it be as common say they as this hill be to and for all the pilgrim and when thou comest there from thence say they thou mayest see to the gate of the celestial city as the shepherd that live there will make appear now he bethink himself of set forward and they be willing he should but first say they let we go again into the armory so they do and when he come there they harness he from head to foot with what be of proof lest perhaps he should meet with assault in the way he be therefore thus accoutred walk out with he friend to the gate and there he ask the porter if he see any pilgrim pass by then the porter answer yes _ chr _ pray do you know he say he _ port _ i ask he name and he tell I it be faithful _ chr _ oh say christian i know he he be my townsman my dear neighbor he come from the place where i be bear how far do you think he may be before _ port _ he be get by this time below the hill _ chr _ well say christian good porter the lord be with thee and add to thy blessing much increase for the kindness thou hast show to I then he begin to go forward but discretion piety chanty and prudence would accompany he down to the foot of the hill so they go on together reiterate they former discourse till they come to go down the hill then say christian as it be difficult come up so so far as i can see it be dangerous go down yes say prudence so it be for it be a hard matter for a man to go down into the valley of humiliation as thou art now and to catch no slip by the way therefore say they be we come out to accompany thee down the hill so he begin to go down but very warily yet he catch a slip or two then i saw in my dream that these good companion when christian be get down to the bottom of the hill give he a loaf of bread a bottle of wine and a cluster of raisin and then he go he way but now in this valley of humiliation poor christian be hard put to it for he have go but a little way before he espy a foul fiend come over the field to meet he : he name be apollyon then do christian begin to be afraid and to cast in he mind whether to go back or to stand he ground but he consider again that he have no armor for he back and therefore think that to turn the back to he might give he greater advantage with ease to pierce he with he dart therefore he resolve to venture and stand he ground for thought he have i no more in mine eye than the saving of my life it would be the best way to stand so he go on and apollyon meet he now the monster be hideous to behold he be clothe with scale like a fish and they be he pride he have wing like a dragon and foot like a bear and out of he belly come fire and smoke and he mouth be as the mouth of a lion when he come up to christian he behold he with a disdainful countenance and thus begin to question with he _ apollyon _ whence come you and whither be you bind _ chr _ i be come from the city of destruction which be the place of all evil and i be go to the city of zion _ apol _ by this i perceive that thou art one of my subject for all that country be mine and i be the prince and god of it how be it then that thou hast run away from thy king be it not that i hope thou mayst do I more service i would strike thee now at one blow to the ground _ chr _ i be indeed bear in you dominion but you service be hard and you wages such as a man could not live on : for the wages of sin be death therefore when i be come to year i do as other considerate person do look out if perhaps i might mend myself _ apol _ there be no prince that will thus lightly lose he subject neither will i as yet lose thee but since thou complainest of thy service and wages be content to go back and what we country will afford i do here promise to give thee _ chr _ but i have let myself to another even to the king of prince and how can i with fairness go back with thee _ apol _ thou hast do in this accord to the proverb change a bad for worse but it be ordinary for those that have profess themselves he servant after awhile to give he the slip and return again to I do thou so too and all shall be well _ chr _ i have give he my faith and swear my allegiance to he how then can i go back from this and not be hang as a traitor _ apol _ thou didst the same to I and yet i be willing to pass by all if now thou wilt yet turn again and go back _ chr _ what i promise thee be in my nonage and besides i count that the prince under whose banner now i stand be able to absolve I yea and to pardon also what i do as to my compliance with thee and besides o thou destroy apollyon to speak truth i like he service he wages he servant he government he company and country better than thine therefore leave off to persuade I further i be he servant and i will follow he _ apol _ consider again when thou art in cool blood what thou art like to meet with in the way that thou goest thou knowest that for the most part he servant come to a ill end because they be transgressor against I and my way how many of they have be put to shameful death and besides thou countest est he service better than mine whereas he never come yet from the place where he be to deliver any that serve he out of my hand but as for I how many time as all the world very well know have i deliver either by power or fraud those that have faithfully serve I from he and he though take by they and so i will deliver thee _ chr _ he forbearing at present to deliver they be on purpose to try they love whether they will cleave to he to the end and as for the ill end thou sayest they come to that be most glorious in they account for for the present deliverance they do not much expect it for they stay for they glory and then they shall have it when they prince come in he and the glory of the angel _ apol _ thou hast already be unfaithful in thy service to he and how dost thou think to receive wages of he _ chr _ wherein o apollyon have i be unfaithful to he _ apol _ thou didst faint at the first set out when thou wast almost choke in the gulf of despond thou didst attempt wrong way to be rid of thy burden whereas thou shouldst have stay till thy prince have take it off thou didst sinfully sleep and lose thy choice thing thou wast almost persuade to go back at the sight of the lion and when thou talkest of thy journey and of what thou hast see and hear thou art inwardly desirous of vain-glory in all that thou sayest or doest _ chr _ all this be true and much more which thou hast leave out but the prince whom i serve and honor be merciful and ready to forgive but besides these infirmity possess I in thy country for there i suck they in and i have groan under they be sorry for they and have obtain pardon of my prince _ apol _ then apollyon break out into a grievous rage say i be a enemy to this prince i hate he person he law and people i be come out on purpose to withstand thee _ chr _ apollyon beware what you do for i be in the king 's highway the way of holiness therefore take heed to yourself then apollyon straddle quite over the whole breadth of the way and say i be void of fear in this matter prepare thyself to die for i swear by my infernal den that thou shalt go no further here will i spill thy soul and with that he throw a name dart at he breast : but christian have a shield in he hand with which he catch it and so prevent the danger of that then do christian draw for he see it be time to bestir he and apollyon as fast make at he throw dart as thick as hail by the which notwithstanding all that christian could do to avoid it apollyon wound he in he head he hand and foot this make christian give a little back : apollyon therefore follow he work amain and christian again take courage and resist as manfully as he could this sore combat last for about half a day even till christian be almost quite spend for you must know that christian by reason of he wound must need grow weaker and weaker then apollyon espy he opportunity begin to gather up close to christian wrestling with he give he a dreadful fall and with that christian 's sword fly out of he hand then say apollyon i be sure of thee now and with that he have almost press he to death so that christian begin to despair of life but as god would have it while apollyon be fetch he last blow thereby to make a full end of this good man christian nimbly reach out he hand for he sword and catch it say rejoice not against I o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise and with that give he a deadly thrust which make he give back as one that have receive he mortal wound christian perceive that make at he again say nay in all these thing we be more than conqueror through he that love we and with that apollyon spread forth he dragon 's wing and speed he away that christian saw he no more in this combat no man can imagine unless he have see and hear as i do what yell and hideous roaring apollyon make all the time of the fight he speak like a dragon : and on the other side what sigh and groan burst from christian 's heart i never see he all the while give so much as one pleasant look till he perceive he have wound apollyon with he two-edged sword then indeed he do smile and look upward but it be the dreadfulest fight that i ever see so when the battle be over christian say i will here give thanks to he that have deliver I out of the mouth of the lion to he that do help I against apollyon and so he do say : great beelzebub the captain of this fiend design would my ruin therefore to this end he send he harness would out and he with rage that hellish be do fiercely I engage : but bless michael help I and i by dint of sword do quickly make he fly therefore to he let I give lasting praise and thank and bless he holy name always then there come to he a hand with some of the leaf of the tree of life the which christian take and apply to the wound that he have receive in the battle and be heal immediately he also sit down in that place to eat bread and to drink of the bottle that be give to he a little before so be refresh he address himself to he journey with he sword draw in he hand for he say i know not but some other enemy may be at hand but he meet with no other affront from apollyon quite through the valley now at the end of this valley be another call the valley of the shadow of death and christian must need go through it because the way to the celestial city lay through the midst of it now this valley be a very solitary place the prophet jeremiah thus describe it : a wilderness a land of desert and pit a land of drought and of the shadow of death a land that no man -lrb- but a christian -rrb- passeth through and where no man dwell now here christian be worse put to it than in he fight with apollyon as by the sequel you shall see i see then in my dream that when christian be get to the border of the shadow of death there meet he two man child of they that bring up a evil report of the good land -- make haste to go back -- to whom christian spake as follow : _ chr _ whither be you go _ man _ they say back back and we would have you do so too if either life or peace be prize by you why what be the matter say christian _ man _ matter say they we be go that way as you be go and go as far as we dare : and indeed we be almost past come back for have we go a little further we have not be here to bring the news to thee but what have you meet with say christian _ man _ why we be almost in the valley of the shadow of death but that by good hap we look before we and see the danger before we come to it but what have you see say christian _ man _ see why the valley itself which be as dark as pitch : we also see there the hobgoblin satyr and dragon of the pit we hear also in that valley a continual howling and yell as of a people under unutterable misery who there sit bind in affliction and iron and over that valley hang the discourage cloud of confusion : death also doth always spread he wing over it in a word it be every whit dreadful be utterly without order then say christian i perceive not yet by what you have say but that this be my way to the desire haven _ man _ be it thy way we will not choose it for ours so they part and christian go on he way but still with he sword draw in he hand for fear lest he should be assault i see then in my dream so far as this valley reach there be on the right hand a very deep ditch that ditch be it into which the blind have lead the blind in all age and have both there miserably perish again behold on the left hand there be a very dangerous quag into which if even a good man fall he find no bottom for he foot to stand on : into that quag king david once do fall and have no doubt therein be smother have not he that be able pluck he out the pathway be here also exceed narrow and therefore good christian be the more put to it for when he seek in the dark to shun the ditch on the one hand he be ready to tip over into the mire on the other : also when he seek to escape the mire without great carefulness he would be ready to fall into the ditch thus he go on and i hear he here sigh bitterly for beside the danger mention above the pathway be here so dark that ofttime when he lift up he foot to go forward he know not where or upon what he should set it next about the midst of this valley i perceive the mouth of hell to be and it stand also hard by the wayside now think christian what shall i do and ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance with spark and hideous noise -lrb- thing that care not for christian 's sword as do apollyon before -rrb- that he be force to put up he sword and betake himself to another weapon call all-prayer so he cry in my hearing o lord i beseech thee deliver my soul thus he go on a great while yet still the flame would be reach toward he also he hear doleful voice and rushing to and fro so that sometimes he think he should be tear in piece or trodden down like mire in the street this frightful sight be see and these dreadful noise be hear by he for several mile together : and come to a place where he think he hear a company of fiend come forward to meet he he stop and begin to muse what he have best to do sometimes he have half a think to go back then again he think he might be half way through the valley he remember also how he have already vanquish many a danger and that the danger of go back might be much more than for to go forward so he resolve to go on : yet the fiend seem to come nearer and nearer but when they be come even almost at he he cry out with a most vehement voice i will walk in the strength of the lord god so they give back and come no further one thing i would not let slip i take notice that now poor christian be so confound that he do not know he own voice and thus i perceive it just when he be come over against the mouth of the burning pit one of the wicked one get behind he and step up softly to he and whisperingly suggest many grievous blasphemy to he which he verily think have proceed from he own mind this put christian more to it than anything that he meet with before even to think that he should now blaspheme he that he love so much before yet if he could have help it he would not have do it but he have not the discretion either to stop he ear or to know from whence these blasphemy come when christian have travel in this disconsolate condition some considerable time he think he hear the voice of a man as go before he say though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with I then be he glad and that for these reason : first because he gather from thence that some who fear god be in this valley as well as himself secondly for that he perceive god be with they though in that dark and dismal state and why not think he with I though by reason of the impediment that attend this place i can not perceive it thirdly for that he hope could he overtake they to have company by and by so he go on and call to he that be before but he know not what to answer for that he also think himself to be alone and by and by the day break : then say christian he have turn the shadow of death into the morning now morning be come he look back not out of desire to return but to see by the light of the day what hazard he have go through in the dark so he see more perfectly the ditch that be on the one hand and the quag that be on the other also how narrow the way be which lead between they both also now he see the hobgoblin and satyr and dragon of the pit but all afar off for after break of day they come not nigh yet they be discover to he accord to that which be write he discovereth deep thing out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death now be christian much affect with this deliverance from all the danger of he solitary way which danger though he fear they much before yet he see they more clearly now because the light of the day make they conspicuous to he and about this time the sun be rise and this be another mercy to christian for you must note that though the first part of the valley of the shadow of death be dangerous yet this second part which he be yet to go be if possible far more dangerous for from the place where he now stand even to the end of the valley the way be all along set so full of snare trap gin and net here and so full of pit pitfall deep hole and shelving down there that have it now be dark as it be when he come the first part of the way have he have a thousand soul they have in reason be cast away but as i say just now the sun be rise then say he he candle shineth on my head and by he light i go through darkness in this light therefore he come to the end of the valley now i saw in my dream that at the end of the valley lay blood bone ash and mangled body of man even of pilgrim that have go this way formerly and while i be muse what should be the reason i espied a little before I a cave where two giant pope and pagan dwelt in old time by whose power and tyranny the man whose bone blood ash etc lay there be cruelly put to death but by this place christian go without much danger whereat i somewhat wonder but i have learn since that pagan have be dead many a day and as for the other though he be yet alive he be by reason of age and also of the many shrewd brush that he meet with in he younger day grow so crazy and stiff in he joint that he can now do little more than sit in he cave 's mouth grin at pilgrim as they go by and bite he nail because he can not come at they so i see that christian go on he way yet at the sight of the old man that sit at the mouth of the cave he could not tell what to think especially because he speak to he though he could not go after he say you will never mend till more of you be burn but he hold he peace and set a good face on it and so go by and catch no hurt then sing christian : oh world of wonder -lrb- i can say no less -rrb- that i should be preserve in that distress that i have meet with here oh bless be that hand that from it have deliver would I danger in darkness heaven hell and sin do compass I while i this vale be in yea snare and pit and trap and net do lie my path about that worthless silly i might have be catch would entangled and cast down but since i live let jesus wear the crown now as christian go on he way he come to a little ascent which be cast up on purpose that pilgrim might see before they up there therefore christian go and look forward he see faithful before he upon he journey then say christian aloud ho ho so-ho stay and i will be you companion at that faithful look behind he to whom christian cry again stay stay till i come up to you but faithful answer no i be upon my life and the avenger of blood be behind I at this christian be somewhat move and put to all he strength he quickly get up with faithful and do also overrun he so the last be first then do christian vain-gloriously smile because he have get the start of he brother but not take good heed to he foot he suddenly stumble and fall and could not rise again until faithful come up to help he then i saw in my dream they go very lovingly on together and have sweet discourse of all thing that have happen to they in they pilgrimage then i saw in my dream that when they be get out of the wilderness they presently see a town before they and the name of that town be vanity and at the town there be a fair keep call vanity fair it be keep all the year long it beareth the name of vanity fair because the town where it be keep be lighter than vanity and also because all that be there sell or that cometh thither be vanity as be the say of the wise all that cometh be vanity this fair be no new erected business but a thing of ancient standing i will show you the original of it almost five thousand year ago there be pilgrim walk to the celestial city as these two honest person be and beelzebub apollyon and legion with they companion perceive by the path that the pilgrim make that they way to the city lay through this town of vanity they contrived here to set up a fair a fair wherein should be sell all sort of vanity and that it should last all the year long therefore at this fair be all such merchandise sell as house land trade place honor preferment title country kingdom lust pleasure and delight of all sort such as harlot wife husband child master servant live blood body soul silver gold pearl precious stone and what not and moreover at this fair there be at all time to be see juggling cheat game play fool ape knave and rogue and that of every kind here be to be see too and that for nothing theft murder adultery false-swearer and that of a blood-red color and as in other fair of less moment there be the several row and street under they proper name where such and such wares be vend : so here likewise you have the proper place row street namely country and kingdom where the wares of this fair be soonest to be find here be the britain row the french row the italian row the spanish row the german row where several sort of vanity be to be sell but as in other fair some one commodity be as the chief of all the fair so the ware of rome and she merchandise be greatly promote in this fair only we english nation with some other have take a dislike thereat now as i say the way to the celestial city lie just through this town where this lusty fair be keep and he that would go to the city and yet not go through this town must need go out of the world the prince of prince himself when here go through this town to he own country and that upon a fair-day too yea and as i think it be beelzebub the chief lord of this fair that invite he to buy of he vanity yea would have make he lord of the fair would he but have do he reverence as he go through the town yea because he be such a person of honor beelzebub have he from street to street and show he all the kingdom of the world in a little time that he might if possible allure that bless one to cheapen and buy some of he vanity but he have no mind to the merchandise and therefore leave the town without lay out so much as one farthing upon these vanity this fair therefore be a ancient thing of long standing and a very great fair now these pilgrim as i say must need go through this fair well so they do but behold even as they enter into the fair all the people in the fair be move and the town itself as it be in a hubbub about they and that for several reason : for first the pilgrim be clothe with such kind of raiment as be diverse from the raiment of any that trade in that fair the people therefore of the fair make a great gaze upon they some say they be fool some they be bedlam and some they be outlandish man secondly and as they wonder at they apparel so they do likewise at they speech for few could understand what they say they naturally speak the language of canaan but they that keep the fair be the man of this world so that from one end of the fair to the other they seem barbarian each to the other thirdly but that which do not a little amuse the merchandiser be that these pilgrim set very light by all they wares they care not so much as to look upon they and if they call upon they to buy they would put they finger in they ear and cry turn away mine eye from behold vanity and look upward signify that they trade and traffic be in heaven one chance mockingly behold the carriage of the man to say unto they what will ye buy but they look gravely upon he say we buy the truth at that there be a occasion take to despise the man the more some mock some taunt some speaking reproachfully and some call upon other to smite they at last thing come to a hubbub and great stir in the fair insomuch that all order be confound now be word presently bring to the great one of the fair who quickly come down and depute some of he most trusty friend to take those man into examination about whom the fair be almost overturn so the man be bring to examination and they that sit upon they ask whence they come whither they go and what they do there in such a unusual garb the man tell they that they be pilgrim and stranger in the world and that they be go to they own country which be the heavenly jerusalem and that they have give no occasion to the man of the town nor yet to the merchandiser thus to abuse they and to let they in they journey except it be for that when one ask they what they would buy they say they would buy the truth but they that be appoint to examine they do not believe they to be any other than bedlam and mad or else such as come to put all thing into a confusion in the fair therefore they take they and beat they and besmear they with dirt and then put they into the cage that they might be make a spectacle to all the man of the fair there therefore they lay for some time and be make the object of any man 's sport or malice or revenge the great one of the fair laughing still at all that befall they but the man be patient and not render railing for railing but contrariwise blessing and give good word for bad and kindness for injury do some man in the fair that be more observe and less prejudiced than the rest begin to check and blame the baser sort for they continual abuse do by they to the man they therefore in angry manner let fly at they again count they as bad as the man in the cage and tell they that they seem confederate and should be make partaker of they misfortune the other reply that for aught they could see the man be quiet and sober and intended nobody any harm and that there be many that trade in they fair that be more worthy to be put into the cage yea and pillory too than be the man that they have abuse thus after diver word have pass on both side -- the man behave themselves all the while very wisely and soberly before they -- they fall to some blow among themselves and do harm one to another then be these two poor man bring before they examiner again and there charge as be guilty of the late hubbub that have be in the fair so they beat they pitifully and hang iron upon they and lead they in chain up and down the fair for a example and terror to other lest any should speak in they behalf or join themselves unto they but christian and faithful behave themselves yet more wisely and receive the ignominy and shame that be cast upon they with so much meekness and patience that it win to they side -- though but few in comparison of the rest -- several of the man in the fair this put the other party yet into a greater rage insomuch that they conclude the death of these two man wherefore they threaten that neither cage nor iron should serve they turn but that they should die for the abuse they have do and for delude the man of the fair then be they remand to the cage again until further order should be take with they so they put they in and make they fast in the stock here therefore they call again to mind what they have hear from they faithful friend evangelist and be the more confirm in they way and suffering by what he tell they would happen to they they also now comfort each other that whose lot it be to suffer even he should have the best of it therefore each man secretly wish that he might have that preferment but commit themselves to the all-wise disposal of he that ruleth all thing with much content they abide in the condition in which they be until they should be otherwise dispose of then a convenient time be appoint they bring they forth to they trial in order to they condemnation when the time be come they be bring before they enemy and arraign the judge 's name be lord hate-good they indictment be one and the same in substance though somewhat vary in form the contents whereof be this : that they be enemy to and disturber of the trade that they have make commotion and division in the town and have win a party to they own most dangerous opinion in contempt of the law of they prince then faithful begin to answer that he have only set himself against that which have set itself against he that be higher than the highest and say he as for disturbance i make none be myself a man of peace : the party that be win to we be win by behold we truth and innocence and they be only turn from the worse to the better and as to the king you talk of since he be beelzebub the enemy of we lord i defy he and all he angel then proclamation be make that they that have aught to say for they lord the king against the prisoner at the bar should forthwith appear and give in they evidence so there come in three witness to wit envy superstition and pickthank they be then ask if they know the prisoner at the bar and what they have to say for they lord the king against he then stand forth envy and say to this effect : my lord i have know this man a long time and will attest upon oath before this honorable bench that he be -- _ judge _ hold -- give he he oath so they sware he then he say my lord this man notwithstanding he plausible name be one of the vilest man in we country he neither regardeth prince nor people law nor custom but doeth all that he can to possess all man with certain of he disloyal notion which he in the general call principle of faith and holiness and in particular i hear he once myself affirm that christianity and the custom of we town of vanity be diametrically opposite and could not be reconcile by which say my lord he doth at once not only condemn all we laudable doings but we in the do of they then do the judge say to he hast thou any more to say _ envy _ my lord i could say much more only i would not be tedious to the court yet if need be when the other gentleman have give in they evidence rather than anything shall be want that will despatch he i will enlarge my testimony against he so he be bid to stand by then they call superstition and bid he look upon the prisoner at the bar they also ask what he could say for they lord the king against he then they sware he so he begin : _ super _ my lord i have no great acquaintance with this man nor do i desire to have further knowledge of he however this i know that he be a very pestilent fellow from some discourse i have with he the other day in this town for then talk with he i hear he say that we religion be naught and such by which a man could by no means please god which say of he my lord you lordship very well know what necessarily thence will follow to wit that we still do worship in vain be yet in we sin and finally shall be damned : and this be that which i have to say then be pickthank swear and bid say what he know in behalf of they lord the king against the prisoner at the bar _ pick _ my lord and you gentleman all this fellow i have know of a long time and have hear he speak thing that ought not to be speak for he have rail on we noble prince beelzebub and have speak contemptibly of he honorable friend whose name be the lord old man the lord carnal delight the lord luxurious the lord desire of vain glory my old lord lechery sir have greedy with all the rest of we nobility and he have say moreover that if all man be of he mind if possible there be not one of these nobleman should have any longer a be in this town besides he have not be afraid to rail on you my lord who be now appoint to be he judge call you a ungodly villain with many other suchlike vilify term with which he have bespatter most of the gentry of we town when this pickthank have tell he tale the judge direct he speech to the prisoner at the bar say thou runagate heretic and traitor hast thou hear what these honest gentleman have witness against thee _ faith _ may i speak a few word in my own defense _ judge _ sirrah sirrah thou deservest to live no longer but to be slay immediately upon the place yet that all man may see we gentleness toward thee let we hear what thou hast to say _ faith _ 1 i say then in answer to what mr envy have speak i never say aught but this that what rule or law or custom or people be flat against the word of god be diametrically opposite to christianity if i have say amiss in this convince I of my error and i be ready here before you to make my recantation 2 as to the second to wit mr superstition and he charge against I i say only this that in the worship of god there be require a divine faith but there can be no divine faith without a divine revelation of the will of god therefore whatever be thrust into the worship of god that be not agreeable to divine revelation can not be do but by a human faith which faith will not be profitable to eternal life 3 as to what mr pickthank have say i say -- avoid term as that i be say to rail and the like -- that the prince of this town with all the rabblement he attendant by this gentleman name be more fit for a be in hell than in this town and country and so the lord have mercy upon I then the judge call to the jury -- who all this while stand by to hear and observe -- gentleman of the jury you see this man about whom so great a uproar have be make in this town you have also hear what these worthy gentleman have witness against he also you have hear he reply and confession : it lieth now in you breast to hang he or save he life but yet i think meet to instruct you in we law there be a act make in the day of pharaoh the great servant to we prince that lest those of a contrary religion should multiply and grow too strong for he they male should be throw into the river there be also a act make in the day of nebuchadnezzar the great another of he servant that whoever would not fall down and worship he golden image should be throw into a fiery furnace there be also a act make in the day of darius that whoso for some time call upon any god but he should be cast into the lion ' den now the substance of these law this rebel have break not only in think -- which be not to be bear -- but also in word and deed which must therefore need be intolerable for that of pharaoh he law be make upon a supposition to prevent mischief no crime be yet apparent but here be a crime apparent for the second and third you see he disputeth against we religion and for the treason that he have confess he deserveth to die the death then go the jury out whose name be mr blindman mr no-good mr malice mr lovelust mr liveloose mr heady mr high-mind mr enmity mr liar mr cruelty mr hatelight and mr implacable who everyone give in he private verdict against he among themselves and afterward unanimously conclude to bring he in guilty before the judge and first among themselves mr blindman the foreman say i see clearly that this man be a heretic then say mr no-good away with such a fellow from the earth ay say mr malice for i hate the very look of he then say mr lovelust i could never endure he nor i say mr liveloose for he would always be condemn my way hang he hang he say mr heady a sorry scrub say mr high-mind my heart riseth against he say mr enmity he be a rogue say mr liar hanging be too good for he say mr cruelty let we despatch he out of the way say mr hatelight then say mr implacable might i have all the world give I i could not be reconcile to he therefore let we forthwith bring he in guilty of death and so they do therefore he be presently condemn to be have from the place where he be to the place from whence he come and there to be put to the most cruel death that could be invent they therefore bring he out to do with he accord to they law : and first they scourge he then they buffet he then they lance he flesh with knife after that they stone he with stone then prick he with they sword and last of all they burn he to ash at the stake thus come faithful to he end now i see that there stand behind the multitude a chariot and a couple of horse wait for faithful who so soon as he adversary have despatch he be take up into it and straightway be carry up through the cloud with sound of trumpet the nearest way to the celestial gate but as for christian he have some respite and be remand back to prison so he there remain for a space but he who overrule all thing have the power of they rage in he own hand so work it about that christian for that time escape they and go he way and as he go he sing say : well faithful thou hast faithfully profest unto thy lord with whom thou shall be bless when faithless one with all they vain delight be cry out under they hellish plight sing faithful sing and let thy name survive for though they kill thee thou art yet alive now i saw in my dream that christian go not forth alone for there be one whose name be hopeful -- be so make by the beholding of christian and faithful in they word and behavior in they suffering at the fair -- who join himself unto he and enter into a brotherly covenant tell he that he would be he companion thus one die to bear testimony to the truth and another rise out of he ash to be a companion with christian in he pilgrimage this hopeful also tell christian that there be many more of the man in the fair that would take they time and follow after i see then that they go on they way to a pleasant river which david the king call the river of god but john the river of the water of life now they way lay just upon the bank of this river here therefore christian and he companion walk with great delight they drink also of the water of the river which be pleasant and enliven to they weary spirit besides on the bank of this river on either side be green tree with all manner of fruit and the leaf they eat to prevent surfeit and other disease that be incident to those who heat they blood by travel on either side of the river be also a meadow curiously beautify with lily and it be green all the year long in this meadow they lay down and sleep for here they might lie down safely when they awake they gather again of the fruit of the tree and drink again of the water of the river and then lay down again to sleep thus they do several day and night then they sing : behold ye how these crystal stream do glide to comfort pilgrim by the highway-side the meadow green besides they fragrant smell yield dainty for they and he who can tell what pleasant fruit yea leave these tree do yield will soon sell all that he may buy this field so when they be dispose to go on -- for they be not as yet at they journey 's end -- they eat and drink and depart now i beheld in my dream that they have not journey far but the river and the way for a time part at which they be not a little sorry yet they dare not go out of the way now the way from the river be rough and they foot tender by reason of they travels so the soul of the pilgrim be much discourage because of the way wherefore still as they go on they wish for a better way now a little before they there be on the left hand of the road a meadow and a stile to go over into it and that meadow be call by-path meadow then say christian to he fellow if this meadow lieth along by we wayside let 's go over into it then he go to the stile to see and behold a path lay along by the way on the other side of the fence it be accord to my wish say christian here be the easiest go come good hopeful and let we go over _ hope _ but how if this path should lead we out of the way that be not likely say the other look doth it not go along by the wayside so hopeful be persuade by he fellow go after he over the stile when they be go over and be get into the path they find it very easy for they foot and withal they look before they espy a man walk as they do and he name be vain confidence so they call after he and ask he whither that way lead he say to the celestial gate look say christian do not i tell you so by this you may see we be right so they follow and he go before they but behold the night come on and it grow very dark so that they that be behind lose the sight of he that go before he therefore that go before -- vain confidence by name -- not see the way before he fall into a deep pit which be on purpose there make by the prince of those grounds to catch vainglorious fool withal and be dash in piece with he fall now christian and he fellow hear he fall so they call to know the matter but there be none to answer only they hear a groan then say hopeful where be we now then be he fellow silent as mistrust that he have lead he out of the way and now it begin to rain and thunder and lighten in a most dreadful manner and the water rise amain then hopeful groan in himself say oh that i have keep on my way _ chr _ who could have think that this path should have lead we out of the way _ hope _ i be afraid on it at the very first and therefore give you that gentle caution i would have speak plainer but that you be older than i _ chr _ good brother be not offend i be sorry i have bring thee out of the way and that i have put thee into such imminent danger pray my brother forgive I i do not do it of a evil intent _ hope _ be comfort my brother for i forgive thee and believe too that this shall be for we good _ chr _ i be glad i have with I a merciful brother but we must not stand here let we try to go back again _ hope _ but good brother let I go before _ chr _ : no if you please let I go first that if there be any danger i may be first therein because by my means we be both go out of the way no say hopeful you shall not go first for you mind be trouble may lead you out of the way again then for they encouragement they hear the voice of one say let thine heart be toward the highway even the way that thou wentest turn again but by this time the water be greatly rise by reason of which the way of go back be very dangerous -lrb- then i think that it be easier go out of the way when we be in than go in when we be out -rrb- yet they adventure to go back but it be so dark and the flood be so high that in they go back they have like to have drown nine or ten time neither could they with all the skill they have get again to the stile that night wherefore at last lighting under a little shelter they sit down there until the day brake but be weary they fall asleep now there be not far from the place they lay a castle call doubt castle the owner whereof be giant despair and it be in he grounds they now be sleep : wherefore he get up in the morning early and walk up and down in he field catch christian and hopeful asleep in he grounds then with a grim and surly voice he bid they awake and ask they whence they be and what they do in he grounds they tell he they be pilgrim and that they have lose they way then say the giant you have this night trespass on I by trample in and lie on my grounds and therefore you must go along with I so they be force to go because he be stronger than they they also have but little to say for they know themselves in a fault the giant therefore drive they before he and put they into he castle in a very dark dungeon nasty and stink to the spirit of these two man here then they lay from Wednesday morning till Saturday night without one bit of bread drop of drink or light or any to ask how they do they be therefore here in evil case and be far from friend and acquaintance now in this place christian have double sorrow because it be through he unadvised counsel that they be bring into this distress now giant despair have a wife and she name be diffidence : so when he be go to bed he tell he wife what he have do to wit that he have take a couple of prisoner and cast they into he dungeon for trespassing on he grounds then he ask she also what he have best to do further with they so she ask he what they be whence they come and whither they be bind and he tell she then she counsel he that when he arise in the morning he should beat they without mercy so when he arise he getteth he a grievous crabtree cudgel and go down into the dungeon to they and there first fall to rating of they as if they be dog although they never give he a word of distaste then he fall upon they and beat they fearfully in such sort that they be not able to help themselves or to turn they upon the floor this do he withdraw and leave they there to condole they misery and to mourn under they distress : so all that day they spend they time in nothing but sigh and bitter lamentation the next night she talk with she husband further about they and understand that they be yet alive do advise he to counsel they to make away with themselves so when morning be come he go to they in a surly manner as before and perceive they to be very sore with the stripe that he have give they the day before he tell they that since they be never like to come out of that place they only way would be forthwith to make a end of themselves either with a knife halter or poison : for why say he should you choose to live see it be attend with so much bitterness but they desire he to let they go with that he look ugly upon they and rush to they have doubtless make a end of they himself but that he fall into one of he fit -- for he sometimes in sunshiny weather fall into fit -- and lose for a time the use of he hand wherefore he withdraw and leave they as before to consider what to do then do the prisoner consult between themselves whether it be best to take he counsel or no and thus they begin to discourse brother say christian what shall we do the life that we now live be miserable for my part i know not whether it be best to live thus or to die out of hand my soul chooseth strangle rather than life and the grave be more easy for I than this dungeon shall we be rule by the giant _ hope _ indeed we present condition be dreadful and death would be far more welcome to I than thus forever to abide but yet let we consider the lord of the country to which we be go have say thou shalt do no murder no not to another man 's person much more then be we forbid to take he counsel to kill ourselves besides he that kill another can but commit murder upon he body but for one to kill himself be to kill body and soul at once and moreover my brother thou talkest of ease in the grave but hast thou forget the hell whither for certain the murderer go for no murderer have eternal life etc and let we consider again that all the law be not in the hand of giant despair other so far as i can understand have be take by he as well as we and yet have escape out of he hand who know but that god who make the world may cause that giant despair may die or that at some time or other he may forget to lock we in or but he may in a short time have another of he fit before we and he may lose the use of he limb and if ever that should come to pass again for my part i be resolve to pluck up the heart of a man and to try my utmost to get from under he hand i be a fool that i do not try to do it before but however my brother let we be patient and endure awhile the time may come that may give we a happy release but let we not be we own murderer with these word hopeful at present do moderate the mind of he brother so they continue together in the dark that day in they sad and doleful condition well toward evening the giant go down into the dungeon again to see if he prisoner have take he counsel but when he come there he find they alive and truly alive be all for now what for want of bread and water and by reason of the wound they receive when he beat they they could do little but breathe but i say he find they alive at which he fall into a grievous rage and tell they that see they have disobey he counsel it should be worse with they than if they have never be bear at this they tremble greatly and i think that christian fall into a swoon but come a little to himself again they renew they discourse about the giant 's counsel and whether yet they have best take it or no now christian again seem for do it but hopeful make he second reply as followeth : my brother say he rememberest thou not how valiant thou hast be heretofore apollyon could not crush thee nor could all that thou didst hear or see or feel in the valley of the shadow of death what hardship terror and amazement hast thou already go through and art thou now nothing but fear thou seest that i be in the dungeon with thee a far weaker man by nature than thou art also this giant have wound I as well as thee and also cut off the bread and water from my mouth and with thee i mourn without the light but let we exercise a little more patience remember how thou playedst the man at vanity fair and wast neither afraid of the chain nor cage nor yet of bloody death wherefore let we -- at least to avoid the shame that it become not a christian to be find in -- bear up with patience as well as we can now night be come again and the giant and he wife in bed she ask he concern the prisoner and if they have take he counsel to which he reply they be sturdy rogue they choose rather to bear all hardship than to make away with themselves then say she take they into the castle-yard to-morrow and show they the bone and skull of those that thou hast already despatch and make they believe ere a week come to a end thou wilt tear they in piece as thou hast do they fellow before they so when the morning be come the giant go to they again and take they into the castle-yard and show they as he wife have bid he these say he be pilgrim as you be once and they trespass on my grounds as you have do and when i think fit i tear they in piece and so within ten day i will do you go get you down to you den again and with that he beat they all the way thither they lay therefore all day on Saturday in a lamentable case as before now when night be come and when mr diffidence and she husband the giant be get to bed they begin to renew they discourse of they prisoner and withal the old giant wonder that he could neither by he blow nor counsel bring they to a end and with that he wife reply i fear say she that they live in hope that some will come to relieve they or that they have picklock about they by the means of which they hope to escape and sayest thou so my dear say the giant i will therefore search they in the morning well on Saturday about midnight they begin to pray and continue in prayer till almost break of day now a little before it be day good christian as one half amaze break out into this passionate speech : what a fool quoth he be i to lie in a stink dungeon when i may as well walk at liberty i have a key in my bosom call promise that will i be persuade open any lock in doubt castle then say hopeful that be good news good brother pluck it out of thy bosom and try then christian pull it out of he bosom and begin to try at the dungeon door whose bolt as he turn the key give back and the door fly open with ease and christian and hopeful both come out then he go to the outward door that lead into the castle-yard and with he key open that door also after that he go to the iron gate for that must be open too but that lock go desperately hard yet the key do open it then they thrust open the gate to make they escape with speed but that gate as it open make such a creak that it wake giant despair who hastily rise to pursue he prisoner feel he limb to fail for he fit take he again so that he could by no means go after they then they go on and come to the king 's highway again and so be safe because they be out of he jurisdiction now when they be go over the stile they begin to contrive with themselves what they should do at that stile to prevent those that shall come after from fall into the hand of giant despair so they consent to erect there a pillar and to engrave upon the side thereof this sentence : over this stile be the way to doubt castle which be keep by giant despair who despiseth the king of the celestial country and seek to destroy he holy pilgrim many therefore that follow after read what be write and escape the danger this do they sing as follow : out of the way we go and then we find what 'twa to tread upon forbid ground and let they that come after have a care lest they for trespassing he pris ` ner be whose castle 's doubt and whose name 's despair they then go till they come to the delectable mountain which mountain belong to the lord of that hill of which we have speak before so they go up to the mountain to behold the garden and orchard the vineyard and fountain of water where also they drink and wash themselves and do freely eat of the vineyard now there be on the top of these mountain shepherd feed they flock and they stand by the highway-side the pilgrim therefore go to they and lean upon they staff -- as be common with weary pilgrim when they stand to talk with any by the way -- they ask whose delectable mountain be these and whose be the sheep that feed upon they _ shep _ these mountain be immanuel 's land and they be within sight of he city and the sheep also be he and he lay down he life for they _ chr _ be this the way to the celestial city _ shep _ you be just in you way _ chr _ how far be it thither _ shep _ too far for any but those who shall get thither indeed _ chr _ be the way safe or dangerous _ shep _ safe for those for whom it be to be safe but transgressor shall fall therein _ chr _ be there in this place any relief for pilgrim that be weary and faint in the way _ shep _ the lord of these mountain have give we a charge not to be forgetful to entertain stranger therefore the good of the place be before you i saw also in my dream that when the shepherd perceive that they be wayfare man they also put question to they to which they make answer as in other place as whence come you and how get you into the way and by what means have you persevere therein for but few of they that begin to come hither do show they face on these mountain but when the shepherd hear they answer be pleased therewith they look very lovingly upon they and say welcome to the delectable mountain the shepherd i say whose name be knowledge experience watchful and sincere take they by the hand and have they to they tent and make they partake of what be ready at present they say moreover we would that you should stay here awhile to be acquaint with we and yet more to solace yourselve with the good of these delectable mountain they then tell they that they be content to stay so they go to rest that night because it be very late then i saw in my dream that in the morning the shepherd call up christian and hopeful to walk with they upon the mountain so they go forth with they and walk awhile have a pleasant prospect on every side then say the shepherd one to another shall we show these pilgrim some wonder so when they have conclude to do it they have they first to the top of a hill call error which be very steep on the furthest side and bid they look down to the bottom so christian and hopeful look down and see at the bottom several man dash all to piece by a fall they have from the top then say christian what meaneth this the shepherd answer have you not hear of they that be make to err by hearken to hymeneus and philetus as concern the faith of the resurrection of the body they answer yes then say the shepherd those that you see dash in piece at the bottom of this mountain be they and they have continue to this day unburied as you see for a example to other to take heed how they clamber too high or how they come too near the brink of this mountain then i see that they have they to the top of another mountain and the name of that be caution and bid they look afar off which when they do they perceive as they think several man walk up and down among the tomb that be there and they perceive that the man be blind because they stumble sometimes upon the tomb and because they could not get out from among they then say christian what mean this the shepherd then answer do you not see a little below these mountain a stile that lead into a meadow on the left hand of this way they answer yes then say the shepherd from that stile there go a path that lead directly to doubt castle which be keep by giant despair and these man point to they among the tomb come once on pilgrimage as you do now even until they come to that same stile and because the right way be rough in that place they choose to go out of it into that meadow and there be take by giant despair and cast into doubt castle where after they have awhile be keep in the dungeon he at last do put out they eye and lead they among those tomb where he have leave they to wander to this very day that the say of the wise man might be fulfil he that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead then christian and hopeful look one upon another with tear gush out but yet say nothing to the shepherd then i saw in my dream that the shepherd have they to another place in a bottom where be a door on the side of a hill and they open the door and bid they look in they look in therefore and see that within it be very dark and smoky they also think that they hear there a rumble noise as of fire and a cry of some tormented and they smell the scent of brimstone then say christian what mean this the shepherd tell they this be a by-way to hell a way that hypocrite go in at namely such as sell they birthright with esau such as sell they master with juda such as blaspheme the gospel with alexander and that lie and dissemble with anania and sapphira he wife then say hopeful to the shepherd i perceive that these have on they even every one a show of pilgrimage as we have now have they not _ shep _ yes and hold it a long time too _ hope _ how far might they go on in pilgrimage in they day since they notwithstanding be thus miserably cast away _ shep _ some further and some not so far as these mountain then say the pilgrim one to another we have need to cry to the strong for strength _ shep _ ay and you will have need to use it when you have it too by this time the pilgrim have a desire to go forward and the shepherd a desire they should so they walk together toward the end of the mountain then say the shepherd one to another let we here show the pilgrim the gate of the celestial city if they have skill to look through we perspective-glass the pilgrim then lovingly accept the motion so they have they to the top of a high hill call clear and give they the glass to look then they try to look but the remembrance of that last thing that the shepherd have show they make they hand shake by means of which impediment they could not look steadily through the glass yet they think they see something like the gate and also some of the glory of the place thus they go away and sing : thus by the shepherd secret be reveal would which from all other man be keep conceal would : come to the shepherd then if you would see thing deep thing hide and that mysterious be when they be about to depart one of the shepherd give they a note of the way another of they bid they beware of the flatterer the third bid they take heed that they sleep not upon enchanted ground and the fourth bid they god speed they go then till they come at a place where they see a way put itself into they way and seem withal to lie as straight as the way which they should go and here they know not which of the two to take for both seem straight before they therefore here they stand still to consider and as they be think about the way behold a man black of flesh but cover with a very light robe vame to they and ask they why they stand there they answer they be go to the celestial city but know not which of these way to take follow I say the man it be thither that i be go so they follow he in the way that but now come into the road which by degree turn and turn they so from the city that they desire to go to that in a little time they face be turn from it yet they follow he but by and by before they be aware he lead they both within the compass of a net in which they be both so entangled that they know not what to do and with that the white robe fall off the black man 's back then they see where they be wherefore there they lay cry some time for they could not get themselves out then say christian to he fellow now do i see myself in a error do not the shepherd bid we beware of the flatterer as be the say of the wise man so we have find it this day : a man that flattereth he neighbor spreadeth a net for he foot _ hope _ they also give we a note of direction about the way for we more sure finding thereof but therein we have also forget to read and not keep ourselves from the path of the destroyer here david be wiser than we for saith he concern the work of man by the word of thy lip i have keep I from the path of the destroyer thus they lay bewail themselves in the net at last they espy a shine one come toward they with a whip of small cord in he hand when he be come to the place where they be he ask they whence they come and what they do there they tell he that they be poor pilgrim go to zion but be lead out of they way by a black man clothe in white who bid we say they follow he for he be go thither too then say he with a whip it flatterer a false apostle that have transform himself into a angel of light so he rent the net and let the man out then say he to they follow I that i may set you in you way again so he lead they back to the way which they have leave to follow the flatterer then he ask they say where do you lie the last night they say with the shepherd upon the delectable mountain he ask they if they have not a note of direction for the way they answer yes but do you not say he when you be at a stand pluck out and read you note they answer no he ask they why they say they forget he ask moreover if the shepherd do not bid they beware of the flatterer they answer yes but we do not imagine say they this fine-spoken man have be he then i saw in my dream that he command they to lie down which when they do he chastise they sore to teach they the good way wherein they should walk and as he chastise they he say as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent this do he bid they go on they way and take good heed to the other direction of the shepherd so they thank he for all he kindness and go softly along the right way singing : come hither you that walk along the way see how the pilgrim fare that go astray : they catch be in a entangled net 'cause they good counsel lightly do forget ` tis true they rescue be but yet you see they be scourg have to boot : let this you caution be now after awhile they perceive afar off one come softly and alone all along the highway to meet they then say christian to he fellow yonder be a man with he back toward zion and he be come to meet we _ hope _ i see he let we take heed to ourselves now lest he should prove a flatterer also so he draw nearer and nearer and at last come up to they he name be atheist and he ask they whither they be go _ chr _ we be go to the mount zion then atheist fall into a very great laughter _ chr _ what be the meaning of you laughter _ atheist _ i laugh to see what ignorant person you be to take upon you so tedious a journey and yet be like to have nothing but you travel for you pain _ chr _ why man do you think we shall not be receive _ atheist _ receive there be no such place as you dream of in all this world _ chr _ but there be in the world to come _ atheist _ when i be at home in my own country i hear as you now affirm and from that hearing go out to see and have be seek this city these twenty year but find no more of it than i do the first day i set out _ chr _ we have both hear and believe that there be such a place to be find _ atheist _ have not i when at home believe i have not come thus far to seek but find none -- and yet i should have there be such a place to be find for i have go to seek it further than you -- i be go back again and will seek to refresh myself with the thing that i then cast away for hope of that which i now see be not then say christian to hopeful he companion be it true which this man have say _ hope _ take heed he be one of the flatterer remember what it have cost we once already for hearken to such kind fellow what no mount zion do we not see from the delectable mountain the gate of the city also be we not now to walk by faith let we go on lest the man with the whip overtake we again you should have teach I that lesson which i will round you in the ear withal : cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the word of knowledge i say my brother cease to hear he and let we believe to the saving of the soul _ chr _ my brother i do not put the question to thee for that i doubt of the truth of we belief myself but to prove thee and to fetch from thee a fruit of the honesty of thy heart as for this man i know that he be blind by the god of this world let thee and I go on know that we have belief of the truth and no lie be of the truth _ hope _ now do i rejoice in hope of the glory of god so they turn away from the man and he laugh at they go he way i then see in my dream that they go on until they come into a certain country whose air naturally tend to make one drowsy if he come a stranger into it and here hopeful begin to be very dull and heavy to sleep wherefore he say unto christian : i do now begin to grow so drowsy that i can scarcely hold open mine eye let we lie down and take one nap by no means say the other lest sleep we never awake more _ hope _ why my brother sleep be sweet to the labor man we may be refresh if we take a nap _ chr _ do you not remember that one of the shepherd bid we to beware of the enchanted ground he mean by that that we should beware of sleep : wherefore let we not sleep as other do but let we watch and be sober _ hope _ i acknowledge myself in a fault and have i be here alone i have by sleep run the danger of death i see it be true that the wise man saith two be better than one hitherto have thy company be my mercy and thou shalt have a good reward for thy labor now then say christian to prevent drowsiness in this place let we fall into good discourse with all my heart say the other now i saw in my dream that the pilgrim be get over the enchanted ground and enter into the country of beulah whose air be very sweet and pleasant the way lie directly through it they solace themselves there for a season yea here they hear continually the singing of bird and see every day the flower appear in the earth and hear the voice of the turtle in the land in this country the sun shineth night and day wherefore this be beyond the valley of the shadow of death and also out of the reach of giant despair neither could they from this place so much as see doubt castle here they be within sight of the city they be go to also here meet they some of the inhabitant thereof for in this land the shine one commonly walk because it be upon the border of heaven in this land also the contract between the bride and the bridegroom be renew yea here as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so doth they god rejoice over they here they have no want of corn and wine for in this place they meet with abundance of what they have seek for in all they pilgrimage here they hear voice from out of the city loud voice say say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold he reward be with he here all the inhabitant of the country call they the holy people the redeem of the lord seek out etc now as they walk in this land they have more rejoice than in part more remote from the kingdom to which they be bind and draw near to the city they have yet a more perfect view thereof it be build of pearl and precious stone also the street thereof be pave with gold so that by reason of the natural glory of the city and the reflection of the sunbeam upon it christian with desire fall sick hopeful also have a fit or two of the same disease : wherefore here they lay by it awhile cry out because of they pang if you see my beloved tell he that i be sick of love but be a little strengthened and better able to bear they sickness they walk on they way and come yet nearer and nearer where be orchard vineyard and garden and they gate open into the highway now as they come up to these place behold the gardener stand in the way to whom the pilgrim say whose goodly vineyard and garden be these he answer they be the king 's and be plant here for he own delight and also for the solace of pilgrim so the gardener have they into the vineyard and bid they refresh themselves with the dainty he also show they there the king 's walk and the arbor where he delighteth to be : and here they tarry and sleep now i beheld in my dream that they talk more in they sleep at this time than ever they do in all they journey and be in a muse thereabout the gardener say even to I wherefore musest thou at the matter : it be the nature of the fruit of the grape of these vineyard to go down so sweetly as to cause the lip of they that be asleep to speak so i see that when they awake they address themselves to go up to the city but as i say the reflection of the sun upon the city -- for the city be pure gold -- be so extremely glorious that they could not as yet with open face behold it but through a instrument make for that purpose so i see that as they go on there meet they two man in raiment that shone like gold also they face shine as the light these man ask the pilgrim whence they come and they tell they they also ask they where they have lodge what difficulty and danger what comfort and pleasure they have meet in the way and they tell they then say the man that meet they you have but two difficulty more to meet with and then you be in the city christian then and he companion ask the man to go along with they : so they tell they that they would : but say they you must obtain it by you own faith so i saw in my dream that they go on together till they come in sight of the gate now i further see that between they and the gate be a river : but there be no bridge to go over and the river be very deep at the sight therefore of this river the pilgrim be much stunned but the man that go with they say you must go through or you can not come at the gate the pilgrim then begin to inquire if there be no other way to the gate to which they answer yes but there have not any save two to wit enoch and elijah be permit to tread that path since the foundation of the world nor shall until the last trumpet shall sound the pilgrim then especially christian begin to despond in they mind and look this way and that but no way could be find by they by which they might escape the river then they ask the man if the water be all of a depth they say no yet they could not help they in that case for say they you shall find it deeper or shallower as you believe in the king of the place they then address themselves to the water and enter christian begin to sink and cry out to he good friend hopeful he say i sink in deep water the billow go over my head all he wave go over I then say the other be of good cheer my brother : i feel the bottom and it be good then say christian ah my friend the sorrow of death have compass I about i shall not see the land that flow with milk and honey and with that a great darkness and horror fall upon christian so that he could not see before he also here he in a great measure lose he sens so that he could neither remember nor orderly talk of any of those sweet refreshment that he have meet with in the way of he pilgrimage but all the word that he speak still tend to discover that he have horror of mind and heart-fear that he should die in that river and never obtain entrance in at the gate here also as they that stand by perceive he be much in the troublesome thought of the sin that he have commit both since and before he begin to be a pilgrim it be also observe that he be trouble with apparition of hobgoblin and evil spirit for ever and anon he would intimate so much by word hopeful therefore here have much ado to keep he brother 's head above water yea sometimes he would be quite go down and then ere awhile he would rise up again half dead hopeful also would endeavor to comfort he say brother i see the gate and man stand by to receive we but christian would answer it be you it be you they wait for you have be hopeful ever since i know you and so have you say he to christian ah brother say he surely if i be right he would now arise to help I but for my sin he have bring I into the snare and have leave I then say hopeful my brother you have quite forget the text where it be say of the wicked there be no band in they death but they strength be firm they be not trouble as other man neither be they plague like other man these trouble and distress that you go through in these water be no sign that god have forsake you but be send to try you whether you will call to mind that which heretofore you have receive of he goodness and live upon he in you distress then i saw in my dream that christian be in a muse awhile to whom also hopeful add these word be of good cheer jesus christ maketh thee whole and with that christian brake out with a loud voice oh i see he again and he tell I when thou passest through the water i shall be with thee and through the river they shall not overflow thee then they both take courage and the enemy be after that as still as a stone until they be go over christian therefore presently find ground to stand upon and so it follow that the rest of the river be but shallow thus they get over now upon the bank of the river on the other side they see the two shine man again who there wait for they wherefore be come out of the river they salute they say we be minister spirit send forth to minister for those that shall be heir of salvation thus they go along toward the gate now you must note that the city stand upon a mighty hill but the pilgrim go up that hill with ease because they have these two man to lead they up by the arm : they have likewise leave they mortal garment behind they in the river for though they go in with they they come out without they they therefore go up here with much agility and speed though the foundation upon which the city be frame be higher than the cloud they therefore go up through the region of the air sweetly talk as they go be comfort because they safely get over the river and have such glorious companion to attend they the talk that they have with the shine one be about the glory of the place who tell they that the beauty and glory of it be inexpressible there say they be the mount zion the heavenly jerusalem the innumerable company of angel and the spirit of just man make perfect you be go now say they to the paradise of god where you shall see the tree of life and eat of the never fading fruit thereof : and when you come there you shall have white robe give you and you walk and talk shall be every day with the king even all the day of eternity there you shall not see again such thing as you see when you be in the lower region upon the earth to wit sorrow sickness affliction and death for the former thing be pass away you be go now to abraham to isaac and jacob and to the prophet man that god have take away from the evil to come and that be now rest upon they bed each one walk in he righteousness the man then ask what must we do in the holy place to whom it be answer you must there receive the comfort of all you toil and have joy for all you sorrow you must reap what you have sow even the fruit of all you prayer and tear and suffering for the king by the way in that place you must wear crown of gold and enjoy the perpetual sight and vision of the holy one for there you shall see he as he be there also you shall serve he continually with praise with shout and thanksgive whom you desire to serve in the world though with much difficulty because of the infirmity of you flesh there you eye shall be delighted with see and you ear with hear the pleasant voice of the mighty one there you shall enjoy you friend again that be go hither before you and there you shall with joy receive even every one that follow into the holy place after you there also you shall be clothe with glory and majesty and put in a equipage fit to ride out with the king of glory when he shall come with sound of trumpet in the cloud as upon the wing of the wind you shall come with he and when he shall sit upon the throne of judgment you shall sit by he yea and when he shall pass sentence upon all the worker of iniquity let they be angel or man you also shall have a voice in that judgment because they be he and you enemy also when he shall again return to the city you shall go too with sound of trumpet and be ever with he now while they be thus draw toward the gate behold a company of the heavenly host come out to meet they to whom it be say by the other two shine one these be the man that have love we lord when they be in the world and that have leave all for he holy name and he have send we to fetch they and we have bring they thus far on they desire journey that they may go in and look they redeemer in the face with joy then the heavenly host give a great shout say bless be they that be call to the marriage supper of the lamb there come out also at this time to meet they several of the king 's trumpeter clothe in white and shine raiment who with melodious voice and loud make even the heaven to echo with they sound these trumpeter salute christian and he fellow with ten thousand welcome from the world and this they do with shout and sound of trumpet this do they compass they round on every side some go before some behind and some on the right hand and some on the leave -- as it be to guard they through the upper region -- continually sound as they go with melodious noise in note on high so that the very sight be to they that could behold it as if heaven itself be come down to meet they thus therefore they walk on together and as they walk ever and anon these trumpeter even with joyful sound would by mix they music with look and gesture still signify to christian and he brother how welcome they be into they company and with what gladness they come to meet they and now be these two man as it be in heaven before they come at it be swallow up with the sight of angel and with hearing of they melodious note here also they have the city itself in view and think they hear all the bell therein to ring to welcome they thereto but above all the warm and joyful thought that they have about they own dwelling there with such company and that for ever and ever oh by what tongue or pen can they glorious joy be express -- thus they come up to the gate now when they be come up to the gate there be write over it in letter of gold bless be they that do he commandment that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gate into the city then i saw in my dream that the shine man bid they call at the gate : the which when they do some from above look over the gate to wit enoch mose and elijah etc to whom it be say these pilgrim be come from the city of destruction for the love that they bear to the king of this place : and then the pilgrim give in unto they each man he certificate which they have receive in the begin those therefore be carry in to the king who when he have read they say where be the man to whom it be answer they be stand without the gate the king then command to open the gate that the righteous nation say he that keepeth truth may enter in now i saw in my dream that these two man go in at the gate and lo as they enter they be transfigure and they have raiment put on that shone like gold there be also that meet they with harp and crown and give they to they : the harp to praise withal and the crown in token of honor then i hear in my dream that all the bell in the city ring again for joy and that it be say unto they enter ye into the joy of we lord i also hear the man themselves that they sing with a loud voice say blessing and honor and glory and power be unto he that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever now just as the gate be open to let in the man i look in after they and behold the city shone like the sun the street also be pave with gold and in they walk many man with crown on they head palm in they hand and golden harp to sing praise withal they be also of they that have wing and they answer one another without intermission say holy holy holy be the lord and after that they shut up the gate : which when i have see i wish myself among they now while i be gaze upon all these thing i turn my head to look back and see ignorance come up to the river side but he soon get over and that without half the difficulty which the other two man meet with for it happen that there be then in the place one vain-hope a ferry-man that with he boat help he over so he as the other i saw do ascend the hill to come up to the gate only he come alone neither do any meet he with the least encouragement when he be come up to the gate he look up to the write that be above and then begin to knock suppose that entrance should have be quickly administer to he but he be ask by the man that look over the top of the gate whence come you and what would you have he answer i have eat and drink in the presence of the king and he have teach in we street then they ask he for he certificate that they might go in and show it to the king : so he fumble in he bosom for one and find none then say they have you none but the man answer never a word so they tell the king but he would not come down to see he but command the two shine one that conduct christian and hopeful to the city to go out and take ignorance and bind he hand and foot and have he away then they take he up and carry he through the air to the door that i saw in the side of the hill and put he in there then i see that there be a way to hell even from the gate of heaven as well as from the city of destruction so i awake and behold it be a dream the pilgrim who would true valor see let he come hither one here will constant be come wind come weather there be no discouragement shall make he once relent he first-avow would intent to be a pilgrim whoso beset he round with dismal story do but themselves confound he strength the more be no lion can he fright he 'll with a giant fight but he will have a right to be a pilgrim nor enemy nor fiend can daunt he spirit he know he at the end shall life inherit : -- then fancy fly away he 'll not fear what man say he 'll labor night and day to be a pilgrim _ -- j bunyan _ the great stone face by nathaniel hawthorne one afternoon when the sun be go down a mother and she little boy sit at the door of they cottage talk about the great stone face they have but to lift they eye and there it be plainly to be see though mile away with the sunshine brighten all its feature and what be the great stone face embosome among a family of lofty mountain there be a valley so spacious that it contain many thousand inhabitant some of these good people dwell in log hut with the black forest all around they on the steep and difficult hillside other have they home in comfortable farmhouse and cultivate the rich soil on the gentle slope or level surface of the valley other again be congregate into populous village where some wild highland rivulet tumble down from its birthplace in the upper mountain region have be catch and tame by human cunning and compel to turn the machinery of cotton factory the inhabitant of this valley in short be numerous and of many mode of life but all of they grown people and child have a kind of familiarity with the great stone face although some possess the gift of distinguish this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of they neighbor the great stone face then be a work of nature in she mood of majestic playfulness form on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rock which have be throw together in such a position as when view at a proper distance precisely to resemble the feature of the human countenance it seem as if a enormous giant or a titan have sculpture he own likeness on the precipice there be the broad arch of the forehead a hundred foot in height the nose with its long bridge and the vast lip which if they could have speak would have roll they thunder accent from one end of the valley to the other true it be that if the spectator approach too near he lose the outline of the gigantic visage and could discern only a heap of ponderous and gigantic rock pile in chaotic ruin one upon another retrace he step however the wondrous feature would again be see and the further he withdraw from they the more like a human face with all its original divinity intact do they appear until as it grow dim in the distance with the cloud and glorified vapor of the mountain clustering about it the great stone face seem positively to be alive it be a happy lot for child to grow up to manhood or womanhood with the great stone face before they eye for all the feature be noble and the expression be at once grand and sweet as if it be the glow of a vast warm heart that embrace all mankind in its affection and have room for more it be a education only to look at it accord to the belief of many people the valley owe much of its fertility to this benign aspect that be continually beam over it illuminate the cloud and infuse its tenderness into the sunshine as we begin with say a mother and she little boy sit at they cottage-door gazing at the great stone face and talk about it the child 's name be ernest mother say he while the titanic visage smile on he i wish that it could speak for it look so very kindly that its voice must need be pleasant if i be to see a man with such a face i should love he dearly if a old prophecy should come to pass answer he mother we may see a man some time or other with exactly such a face as that what prophecy do you mean dear mother eagerly inquire ernest pray tell I all about it so he mother tell he a story that she own mother have tell to she when she herself be younger than little ernest a story not of thing that be past but of what be yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indian who formerly inhabit this valley have hear it from they forefather to whom as they affirm it have be murmur by the mountain stream and whisper by the wind among the tree-top the purport be that at some future day a child should be bear hereabouts who be destine to become the greatest and noblest personage of he time and whose countenance in manhood should bear a exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few old-fashioned people and young one likewise in the ardor of they hope still cherish a enduring faith in this old prophecy but other who have see more of the world have watch and wait till they be weary and have behold no man with such a face nor any man that prove to be much greater or nobler than he neighbor conclude it to be nothing but a idle tale at all event the great man of the prophecy have not yet appear o mother dear mother cry ernest clap he hand above he head i do hope that i shall live to see he he mother be a affectionate and thoughtful woman and feel that it be wisest not to discourage the generous hope of she little boy so she only say to he perhaps you may and ernest never forget the story that he mother tell he it be always in he mind whenever he look upon the great stone face he spend he childhood in the log-cottage where he be bear and be dutiful to he mother and helpful to she in many thing assist she much with he little hand and more with he loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grow up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sun-browned with labor in the field but with more intelligence brighten he aspect than be see in many lad who have be teach at famous school yet ernest have have no teacher save only that the great stone face become one to he when the toil of the day be over he would gaze at it for hour until he begin to imagine that those vast feature recognize he and give he a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to he own look of veneration we must not take upon we to affirm that this be a mistake although the face may have look no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret be that the boy 's tender and confide simplicity discern what other people could not see and thus the love which be mean for all become he peculiar portion about this time there go a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretell from age ago who be to bear a resemblance to the great stone face have appear at last it seem that many year before a young man have migrate from the valley and settle at a distant seaport where after get together a little money he have set up as a shopkeeper he name -- but i could never learn whether it be he real one or a nickname that have grow out of he habit and success in life -- be gathergold be shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develop itself in what the world call luck he become a exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulky-bottomed ship all the country of the globe appear to join hand for the mere purpose of add heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one man 's wealth the cold region of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle send he they tribute in the shape of fur hot africa sift for he the golden sand of she river and gather up the ivory tusk of she great elephant out of the forest the east come bring he the rich shawl and spice and tea and the effulgence of diamond and the gleaming purity of large pearl the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yield up she mighty whale that mr gathergold might sell they oil and make a profit on it be the original commodity what it might it be gold within he grasp it might be say of he as of mida in the fable that whatever he touch with he finger immediately glisten and grow yellow and be change at once into sterling metal or which suit he still better into pile of coin and when mr gathergold have become so very rich that it would have take he a hundred year only to count he wealth he bethink himself of he native valley and resolve to go back thither and end he day where he be bear with this purpose in view he send a skilful architect to build he such a palace as should be fit for a man of he vast wealth to live in as i have say above it have already be rumor in the valley that mr gathergold have turn out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly look for and that he visage be the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people be the more ready to believe that this must need be the fact when they behold the splendid edifice that rise as if by enchantment on the site of he father 's old weather-beaten farmhouse the exterior be of marble so dazzingly white that it seem as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler one which mr gathergold in he young play-day before he finger be gifted with the touch of transmutation have be accustom to build of snow it have a richly ornamented portico support by tall pillar beneath which be a lofty door stud with silver knob and make of a kind of variegated wood that have be bring from beyond the sea the window from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment be compose respectively of but one enormous pane of glass so transparently pure that it be say to be a finer medium than even the vacant atmosphere hardly anybody have be permit to see the interior of this palace but it be report and with good semblance of truth to be far more gorgeous than the outside insomuch that whatever be iron or brass in other house be silver or gold in this and mr gathergold 's bedchamber especially make such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have be able to close he eye there but on the other hand mr gathergold be now so inured to wealth that perhaps he could not have close he eye unless where the gleam of it be certain to find its way beneath he eyelid in due time the mansion be finish next come the upholsterer with magnificent furniture then a whole troop of black and white servant the harbinger of mr gathergold who in he own majestic person be expect to arrive at sunset we friend ernest meanwhile have be deeply stir by the idea that the great man the noble man the man of prophecy after so many age of delay be at length to be make manifest to he native valley he know boy as he be that there be a thousand way in which mr gathergold with he vast wealth might transform himself into a angel of beneficence and assume a control over human affair as wide and benignant as the smile of the great stone face full of faith and hope ernest doubt not that what the people say be true and that now he be to behold the living likeness of those wondrous feature on the mountain side while the boy be still gaze up the valley and fancy as he always do that the great stone face return he gaze and look kindly at he the rumble of wheel be hear approach swiftly along the wind road here he come cry a group of people who be assemble to witness the arrival here come the great mr gathergold a carriage draw by four horse dash round the turn of the road within it thrust partly out of the window appear the physiognomy of a little old man with a skin as yellow as if he own midas-hand have transmute it he have a low forehead small sharp eye pucker about with innumerable wrinkle and very thin lip which he make still thinner by press they forcibly together the very image of the great stone face shout the people sure enough the old prophecy be true and here we have the great man come at last and what greatly perplex ernest they seem actually to believe that here be the likeness which they speak of by the roadside there chance to be a old beggar-woman and two little beggar-children straggler from some far-off region who as the carriage roll onward hold out they hand and lift up they doleful voice most piteously beseech charity a yellow claw -- the very same that have claw together so much wealth -- poke itself out of the coach window and drop some copper coin upon the ground so that though the great man 's name seem to have be gathergold he might just as suitably have be nickname scattercopper still nevertheless with a earnest shout and evidently with as much good faith as ever the people bellow -- he be the very image of the great stone face but ernest turn sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that sordid visage and gaze up the valley where amid a gathering mist gilded by the last sunbeam he could still distinguish those glorious feature which have impress themselves into he soul they aspect cheer he what do the benign lip seem to say he will come fear not ernest the man will come the year go on and ernest cease to be a boy he have grow to be a young man now he attract little notice from the other inhabitant of the valley for they see nothing remarkable in he way of life save that when the labor of the day be over he still love to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the great stone face accord to they idea of the matter it be a folly indeed but pardonable inasmuch as ernest be industrious kind and neighborly and neglect no duty for the sake of indulge this idle habit they know not that the great stone face have become a teacher to he and that the sentiment which be express in it would enlarge the young man 's heart and fill it with wider and deeper sympathy than other heart they know not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learn from book and a better life than could be mold on the defaced example of other human life neither do ernest know that the thought and affection which come to he so naturally in the field and at the fireside and wherever he commune with himself be of a higher tone than those which all man share with he a simple soul -- simple as when he mother first teach he the old prophecy -- he behold the marvellous feature beam adown the valley and still wonder that they human counterpart be so long in make he appearance by this time poor mr gathergold be dead and bury and the oddest part of the matter be that he wealth which be the body and spirit of he existence have disappear before he death leave nothing of he but a living skeleton cover over with a wrinkled yellow skin since the melting away of he gold it have be very generally concede that there be no such striking resemblance after all between the ignoble feature of the ruin merchant and that majestic face upon the mountain-side so the people cease to honor he during he lifetime and quietly consign he to forgetfulness after he decease once in a while it be true he memory be bring up in connection with the magnificent palace which he have build and which have long ago be turn into a hotel for the accommodation of stranger multitude of whom come every summer to visit that famous natural curiosity the great stone face thus mr gathergold be discredit and throw into the shade the man of prophecy be yet to come it so happen that a native-born son of the valley many year before have enlist as a soldier and after a great deal of hard fighting have now become a illustrious commander whatever he may be call in history he be know in camp and on the battle-field under the nickname of old blood-and-thunder this war-worn veteran be now infirm with age and wound and weary of the turmoil of a military life and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet that have so long be ring in he ear have lately signify a purpose of return to he native valley hope to find repose where he remember to have leave it the inhabitant he old neighbor and they grown-up child be resolve to welcome the renowned warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner and all the more enthusiastically it be affirm that now at last the likeness of the great stone face have actually appear a aid-de-camp of old blood-and-thunder travel through the valley be say to have be strike with the resemblance moreover the schoolmate and early acquaintance of the general be ready to testify on oath that to the best of they recollection the aforesaid general have be exceedingly like the majestic image even when a boy only that the idea have never occur to they at that period great therefore be the excitement throughout the valley and many people who have never once think of glance at the great stone face for year before now spend they time in gaze at it for the sake of know exactly how general blood-and-thunder look on the day of the great festival ernest with all the other people of the valley leave they work and proceed to the spot where the sylvan banquet be prepare as he approach the loud voice of the rev dr battleblast be hear beseech a blessing on the good thing set before they and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor they be assemble the table be arrange in a clear space of the wood shut in by the surround tree except where a vista open eastward and afford a distant view of the great stone face over the general 's chair which be a relic from the home of washington there be a arch of verdant bough with the laurel profusely intermix and surmount by he country 's banner beneath which he have win he victory we friend ernest raise himself on he tiptoe in hope to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest but there be a mighty crowd about the table anxious to hear the toast and speech and to catch any word that might fall from the general in reply and a volunteer company do duty as a guard prick ruthlessly with they bayonet at any particularly quiet person among the throng so ernest being of a unobtrusive character be thrust quite into the background where he could see no more of old blood-and-thunder 's physiognomy than if it have be still blaze on the battle-field to console himself he turn toward the great stone face which like a faithful and long-remembered friend look back and smile upon he through the vista of the forest meantime however he could overhear the remark of various individual who be compare the feature of the hero with the face on the distant mountain-side ` tis the same face to a hair cry one man cut a caper for joy wonderfully like that be a fact respond another like why i call it old blood-and-thunder himself in a monstrous looking-glass cry a third and why not he be the greatest man of this or any other age beyond a doubt and then all three of the speaker give a great shout which communicate electricity to the crowd and call forth a roar from a thousand voice that go reverberate for mile among the mountain until you might have suppose that the great stone face have pour its thunder-breath into the cry all these comment and this vast enthusiasm serve the more to interest we friend nor do he think of question that now at length the mountain-visage have find its human counterpart it be true ernest have imagine that this long-looked-for personage would appear in the character of a man of peace utter wisdom and do good and make people happy but take a habitual breadth of view with all he simplicity he contend that providence should choose its own method of blessing mankind and could conceive that this great end might be effect even by a warrior and a bloody sword should inscrutable wisdom see fit to order matter so the general the general be now the cry hush silence old blood-and-thunder 's go to make a speech even so for the cloth be remove the general 's health have be drunk amid shout of applause and he now stand upon he foot to thank the company ernest see he there he be over the shoulder of the crowd from the two glitter epaulet and embroidered collar upward beneath the arch of green bough with intertwine laurel and the banner droop as if to shade he brow and there too visible in the same glance through the vista of the forest appear the great stone face and be there indeed such a resemblance as the crowd have testify alas ernest could not recognize it he behold a war-worn and weather-beaten countenance full of energy and expressive of a iron will but the gentle wisdom the deep broad tender sympathy be altogether want in old blood-and thunder 's visage and even if the great stone face have assume he look of stern command the milder trait would still have temper it this be not the man of prophecy sigh ernest to himself as he make he way out of the throng and must the world wait longer yet the mist have congregate about the distant mountain-side and there be see the grand and awful feature of the great stone face awful but benignant as if a mighty angel be sit among the hill and enrobe himself in a cloud-vesture of gold and purple as he look ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beam over the whole visage with a radiance still brighten although without motion of the lip it be probably the effect of the western sunshine melting through the thinly diffused vapor that have sweep between he and the object that he gaze at but -- as it always do -- the aspect of he marvellous friend make ernest as hopeful as if he have never hope in vain fear not ernest say he heart even as if the great face be whisper he -- fear not ernest he will come more year speed swiftly and tranquilly away ernest still dwell in he native valley and be now a man of middle age by imperceptible degree he have become know among the people now as heretofore he labor for he bread and be the same simple-hearted man that he have always be but he have think and feel so much he have give so many of the best hour of he life to unworldly hope for some great good to mankind that it seem as though he have be talk with the angel and have imbibe a portion of they wisdom unaware it be visible in the calm and well-considered beneficence of he daily life the quiet stream of which have make a wide green margin all along its course not a day pass by that the world be not the better because this man humble as he be have live he never step aside from he own path yet would always reach a blessing to he neighbor almost involuntarily too he have become a preacher the pure and high simplicity of he thought which as one of its manifestation take shape in the good deed that drop silently from he hand flow also forth in speech he utter truth that work upon and mold the life of those who hear he he auditor it may be never suspect that ernest they own neighbor and familiar friend be more than a ordinary man least of all do ernest himself suspect it but inevitably as the murmur of a rivulet come thought out of he mouth that no other human lip have speak when the people 's mind have have a little time to cool they be ready enough to acknowledge they mistake in imagine a similarity between general blood-and-thunder 's truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountain-side but now again there be report and many paragraph in the newspaper affirm that the likeness of the great stone face have appear upon the broad shoulder of a certain eminent statesman he like mr gathergold and old blood-and-thunder be a native of the valley but have leave it in he early day and take up the trade of law and politics instead of the rich man 's wealth and the warrior 's sword he have but a tongue and it be mightier than both together so wonderfully eloquent be he that whatever he might choose to say he auditor have no choice but to believe he wrong look like right and right like wrong for when it please he he could make a kind of illuminated fog with he mere breath and obscure the natural daylight with it he tongue indeed be a magic instrument : sometimes it rumble like the thunder sometimes it warble like the sweetest music it be the blast of war -- the song of peace and it seem to have a heart in it when there be no such matter in good truth he be a wondrous man and when he tongue have acquire he all other imaginable success -- when it have be hear in hall of state and in the court of prince and potentate -- after it have make he know all over the world even as a voice cry from shore to shore -- it finally persuade he countryman to select he for the presidency before this time -- indeed as soon as he begin to grow celebrated -- he admirer have find out the resemblance between he and the great stone face and so much be they strike by it that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman be know by the name of old stony phiz the phrase be consider as give a highly favorable aspect to he political prospects for as be likewise the case with the popedom nobody ever become president without take a name other than he own while he friend be do they best to make he president old stony phiz as he be call set out on a visit to the valley where he be bear of course he have no other object than to shake hand with he fellow-citizen and neither think nor care about any effect which he progress through the country might have upon the election magnificent preparation be make to receive the illustrious statesman a cavalcade of horseman set forth to meet he at the boundary line of the state and all the people leave they business and gather along the wayside to see he pass among these be ernest though more than once disappoint as we have see he have such a hopeful and confide nature that he be always ready to believe in whatever seem beautiful and good he keep he heart continually open and thus be sure to catch the blessing from on high when it should come so now again as buoyantly as ever he go forth to behold the likeness of the great stone face the cavalcade come prance along the road with a great clattering of hoof and a mighty cloud of dust which rise up so dense and high that the visage of the mountain-side be completely hide from ernest 's eye all the great man of the neighborhood be there on horseback : militia officer in uniform the member of congress the sheriff of the county the editor of newspaper and many a farmer too have mount he patient steed with he Sunday coat upon he back it really be a very brilliant spectacle especially as there be numerous banner flaunt over the cavalcade on some of which be gorgeous portrait of the illustrious statesman and the great stone face smile familiarly at one another like two brother if the picture be to be trust the mutual resemblance it must be confess be marvellous we must not forget to mention that there be a band of music which make the echo of the mountain ring and reverberate with the loud triumph of its strain so that airy and soul-thrilling melody break out among all the height and hollow as if every nook of he native valley have find a voice to welcome the distinguished guest but the grandest effect be when the far-off mountain precipice fling back the music for then the great stone face itself seem to be swell the triumphant chorus in acknowledgment that at length the man of prophecy be come all this while the people be throw up they hat and shout with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of ernest kindle up and he likewise throw up he hat and shout as loudly as the loudest huzza for the great man huzza for old stony phiz but as yet he have not see he here he be now cry those who stand near ernest there there look at old stony phiz and then at the old man of the mountain and see if they be not as like as two twin-brother in the midst of all this gallant array come a open barouche draw by four white horse and in the barouche with he massive head uncovered sit the illustrious statesman old stony phiz himself confess it say one of ernest 's neighbor to he the great stone face have meet its match at last now it must be own that at he first glimpse of the countenance which be bow and smile from the barouche ernest do fancy that there be a resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the mountain-side the brow with its massive depth and loftiness and all the other feature indeed be boldly and strongly hew as if in emulation of a more than heroic of a titanic model but the sublimity and stateliness the grand expression of a divine sympathy that illuminate the mountain visage and etherealize its ponderous granite substance into spirit might here be seek in vain something have be originally leave out or have depart and therefore the marvellously gifted statesman have always a weary gloom in the deep cavern of he eye as of a child that have outgrow its plaything or a man of mighty faculty and little aim whose life with all its high performance be vague and empty because no high purpose have endow it with reality still ernest 's neighbor be thrust he elbow into he side and press he for a answer confess confess be not he the very picture of you old man of the mountain no say ernest bluntly i see little or no likeness then so much the worse for the great stone face answer he neighbor and again he set up a shout for old stony phiz but ernest turn away melancholy and almost despondent : for this be the saddest of he disappointment to behold a man who might have fulfil the prophecy and have not will to do so meantime the cavalcade the banner the music and the barouche sweep past he with the vociferous crowd in the rear leave the dust to settle down and the great stone face to be reveal again with the grandeur that it have wear for untold century lo here i be ernest the benign lip seem to say i have wait longer than thou and be not yet weary fear not the man will come the year hurry onward tread in they haste on one another 's heel and now they begin to bring white hair and scatter they over the head of ernest they make reverend wrinkle across he forehead and furrow in he cheek he be a aged man but not in vain have he grow old : more than the white hair on he head be the sage thought in he mind he wrinkle and furrow be inscription that time have grave and in which he have write legend of wisdom that have be test by the tenor of a life and ernest have cease to be obscure unsought for undesired have come the fame which so many seek and make he know in the great world beyond the limit of the valiey in which he have dwell so quietly college professor and even the active man of city come from far to see and converse with ernest for the report have go abroad that this simple husbandman have idea unlike those of other man not gain from book but of a higher tone -- a tranquil and familiar majesty as if he have be talk with the angel as he daily friend whether it be sage statesman or philanthropist ernest receive these visitor with the gentle sincerity that have characterize he from boyhood and speak freely with they of whatever come uppermost or lay deepest in he heart or they own while they talk together he face would kindle unawares and shine upon they as with a mild evening light pensive with the fulness of such discourse he guest take leave and go they way and pass up the valley pause to look at the great stone face imagine that they have see its likeness in a human countenance but could not remember where while ernest have be grow up and grow old a bountiful providence have grant a new poet to this earth he likewise be a native of the valley but have spend the greater part of he life at a distance from that romantic region pour out he sweet music amid the bustle and din of city often however do the mountain which have be familiar to he in he childhood lift they snowy peak into the clear atmosphere of he poetry neither be the great stone face forget for the poet have celebrate it in a ode which be grand enough to have be utter by its own majestic lip this man of genius we may say have come down from heaven with wonderful endowment if he sing of a mountain the eye of all mankind behold a mightier grandeur repose on its breast or soar to its summit than have before be see there if he theme be a lovely lake a celestial smile have now be throw over it to gleam forever on its surface if it be the vast old sea even the deep immensity of its dread bosom seem to swell the higher as if move by the emotion of the song thus the world assume another and a better aspect from the hour that the poet bless it with he happy eye the creator have bestow he as the last best touch to he own handiwork creation be not finish till the poet come to interpret and so complete it the effect be no less high and beautiful when he human brethren be the subject of he verse the man or woman sordid with the common dust of life who cross he daily path and the little child who play in it be glorified if he behold they in he mood of poetic faith he show the golden link of the great chain that intertwine they with a angelic kindred he bring out the hidden trait of a celestial birth that make they worthy of such kin some indeed there be who think to show the soundness of they judgment by affirm that all the beauty and dignity of the natural world exist only in the poet 's fancy let such man speak for themselves who undoubtedly appear to have be spawn forth by nature with a contemptuous bitterness she have plaster they up out of she refuse stuff after all the swine be make as respects all thing else the poet 's ideal be the truest truth the song of this poet find they way to ernest he read they after he customary toil seat on the bench before he cottage-door where for such a length of time he have fill he repose with think by gaze at the great stone face and now as he read stanza that cause the soul to thrill within he he lift he eye to the vast countenance beam on he so benignantly o majestic friend he murmur address the great stone face be not this man worthy to resemble thee the face seem to smile but answer not a word now it happen that the poet though he dwell so far away have not only hear of ernest but have meditate much upon he character until he deem nothing so desirable as to meet this man whose untaught wisdom walk hand in hand with the noble simplicity of he life one summer morning therefore he take passage by the railroad and in the decline of the afternoon alight from the car at no great distance from ernest 's cottage the great hotel which have formerly be the palace of mr gathergold be close at hand but the poet with he carpet-bag on he arm inquire at once where ernest dwelt and be resolve to be accept as he guest approach the door he there find the good old man hold a volume in he hand which alternately he read and then with a finger between the leaf look lovingly at the great stone face good evening say the poet can you give a traveller a night 's lodging willingly answer ernest and then he add smile methink i never see the great stone face look so hospitably at a stranger the poet sit down on the bench beside he and he and ernest talk together often have the poet hold intercourse with the wittiest and the wisest but never before with a man like ernest whose thought and feeling gush up with such a natural freedom and who make great truth so familiar by he simple utterance of they angel as have be so often say seem to have work with he at he labor in the field angel seem to have sit with he by the fireside and dwelling with angel as friend with friend he have imbibe the sublimity of they idea and imbue it with the sweet and lowly charm of household word so think the poet and ernest on the other hand be move and agitate by the living image which the poet fling out of he mind and which people all the air about the cottage-door with shape of beauty both gay and pensive the sympathy of these two man instruct they with a profounder sense than either could have attain alone they mind accord into one strain and make delightful music which neither of they could have claim as all he own nor distinguished he own share from the other 's they lead one another as it be into a high pavilion of they thought so remote and hitherto so dim that they have never enter it before and so beautiful that they desire to be there always as ernest listen to the poet he imagine that the great stone face be bend forward to listen too he gaze earnestly into the poet 's glowing eye who be you my strangely gifted guest he say the poet lay he finger on the volume that ernest have be read you have read these poem say he you know I then -- for i write they again and still more earnestly than before ernest examine the poet 's feature then turn toward the great stone face then back with a uncertain aspect to he guest but he countenance fall he shake he head and sigh wherefore be you sad inquire the poet because reply ernest all through life i have await the fulfilment of a prophecy and when i read these poem i hope that it might be fulfil in you you hope answer the poet faintly smile to find in I the likeness of the great stone face and you be disappoint as formerly with mr gathergold and old blood-and-thunder and old stony phiz yes ernest it be my doom you must add my name to the illustrious three and record another failure of you hope for -- in shame and sadness do i speak it ernest -- i be not worthy to be typify by yonder benign and majestic image and why ask ernest he point to the volume be not those thought divine they have a strain of the divinity reply the poet you can hear in they the far-off echo of a heavenly song but my life dear ernest have not correspond with my thought i have have grand dream but they have be only dream because i have live -- and that too by my own choice -- among poor and mean reality sometimes even -- shall i dare to say it -- i lack faith in the grandeur the beauty and the goodness which my own work be say to have make more evident in nature and in human life why then pure seeker of the good and true shouldst thou hope to find I in yonder image of the divine the poet speak sadly and he eye be dim with tear so likewise be those of ernest at the hour of sunset as have long be he frequent custom ernest be to discourse to a assemblage of the neighbor inhabitant in the open air he and the poet arm in arm still talk together as they go along proceed to the spot it be a small nook among the hill with a gray precipice behind the stern front of which be relieve by the pleasant foliage of many creep plant that make a tapestry for the naked rock by hang they festoon from all its rugged angle at a small elevation above the ground set in a rich framework of verdure there appear a niche spacious enough to admit a human figure with freedom for such gesture as spontaneously ascompany earnest thought and genuine emotion into this natural pulpit ernest ascend and throw a look of familiar kindness around upon he audience they stand or sit or recline upon the grass as seem good to each with the depart sunshine fall obliquely over they and mingle its subdue cheerfulness with the solemnity of a grove of ancient tree beneath and amid the bough of which the golden ray be constrain to pass in another direction be see the great stone face with the same cheer combine with the same solemnity in its benignant aspect ernest begin to speak give to the people of what be in he heart and mind he word have power because they accord with he thought and he thought have reality and depth because they harmonize with the life which he have always live it be not mere breath that this preacher utter they be the word of life because a life of good deed and holy love be melt into they pearl pure and rich have be dissolve into this precious draught the poet as he listen feel that the be and character of ernest be a nobler strain of poetry than he have ever write he eye glisten with tear he gaze reverentially at the venerable man and say within himself that never be there a aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that mild sweet thoughtful countenance with the glory of white hair diffuse about it at a distance but distinctly to be see high up in the golden light of the setting sun appear the great stone face with hoary mist around it like the white hair around the brow of ernest its look of grand beneficence seem to embrace the world at that moment in sympathy with a thought which he be about to utter the face of ernest assume a grandeur of expression so imbue with benevolence that the poet by a irresistible impulse throw he arm aloft and shout : behold behold ernest be himself the likeness of the great stone face then all the people look and see that what the deep-sighted poet say be true the prophecy be fulfil but ernest have finish what he have to say take the poet 's arm and walk slowly homeward still hope that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by appear bear a resemblance to the great stone face the gentle boy by nathaniel hawthorne in the course of the year 1656 several of the people call quaker lead as they profess by the inward movement of the spirit make they appearance in new england they reputation as holder of mystic and pernicious principle have spread before they the puritan early endeavor to banish and to prevent the further intrusion of the rise sect but the measure by which it be intend to purge the land of heresy though more than sufficiently vigorous be entirely unsuccessful the quaker esteem persecution as a divine call to the post of danger lay claim to a holy courage unknown to the puritan themselves who have shun the cross by provide for the peaceable exercise of they religion in a distant wilderness though it be the singular fact that every nation of the earth reject the wander enthusiast who practice peace toward all man the place of greatest uneasiness and peril and therefore in they eye the most eligible be the province of massachusett bay the fine imprisonment and stripe liberally distribute by we pious forefather the popular antipathy so strong that it endure nearly a hundred year after actual persecution have cease be attraction as powerful for the quaker as peace honor and reward would have be for the wordly-minded every european vessel bring new cargo of the sect eager to testify against the oppression which they hope to share and when shipmaster be restrain by heavy fine from afford they passage they make long and circuitous journey through the indian country and appear in the province as if convey by a supernatural power they enthusiasm heighten almost to madness by the treatment which they receive produce action contrary to the rule of decency as well as of rational religion and present a singular contrast to the calm and staid deportment of they sectarian successor of the present day the command of the spirit inaudible except to the soul and not to be controvert on grounds of human wisdom be make a plea for most indecorous exhibition which abstractedly consider well deserve the moderate chastisement of the rod these extravagance and the persecution which be at once they cause and consequence continue to increase till in the year 1659 the government of massachusett bay indulge two member of the quaker sect with the crown of martyrdom a indelible stain of blood be upon the hand of all who consent to this act but a large share of the awful responsibility must rest upon the person then at the head of the government he be a man of narrow mind and imperfect education and he uncompromising bigotry be make hot and mischievous by violent and hasty passion he exert he influence indecorously and unjustifiably to compass the death of the enthusiast and he whole conduct in respect to they be mark by brutal cruelty the quaker whose revengeful feeling be not less deep because they be inactive remember this man and he associate in after time the historian of the sect affirm that by the wrath of heaven a blight fall upon the land in the vicinity of the bloody town of boston so that no wheat would grow there and he take he stand as it be among the grave of the ancient persecutor and triumphantly recount the judgment that overtake they in old age or at the parting hour he tell we that they die suddenly and violently and in madness but nothing can exceed the bitter mockery with which he record the loathsome disease and death by rottenness of the fierce and cruel governor on the evening of the autumn day that have witness the martyrdom of two man of the quaker persuasion a puritan settler be return from the metropolis to the neighboring country town in which he reside the air be cool the sky clear and the linger twilight be make brighter by the ray of a young moon which have now nearly reach the verge of the horizon the traveller a man of middle age wrap in a gray frieze cloak quicken he pace when he have reach the outskirts of the town for a gloomy extent of nearly four mile lay between he and he home the low straw-thatched house be scatter at considerable interval along the road and the country have be settle but about thirty year the tract of original forest still bear no small proportion to the cultivate ground the autumn wind wander among the branch whirling away the leaf from all except the pine-tree and moan as if it lament the desolation of which it be the instrument the road have penetrate the mass of wood that lay nearest to the town and be just emerge into a open space when the traveller 's ear be salute by a sound more mournful than even that of the wind it be like the wail of some one in distress and it seem to proceed from beneath a tall and lonely fir-tree in the center of a clear but uninclosed and uncultivated field the puritan could not but remember that this be the very spot which have be make accurse a few hour before by the execution of the quaker whose body have be throw together into one hasty grave beneath the tree on which they suffer he struggle however against the superstitious fear which belong to the age and compel himself to pause and listen the voice be most likely mortal nor have i cause to tremble if it be otherwise think he strain he eye through the dim moonlight methink it be like the wail of a child some infant it may be which have stray from its mother and chance upon this place of death for the ease of mine own conscience i must search this matter out he therefore leave the path and walk somewhat fearfully across the field though now so desolate its soil be press down and trample by the thousand footstep of those who have witness the spectacle of that day all of whom have now retire leave the dead to they loneliness the traveller at length reach the fir-tree which from the middle upward be cover with live branch although a scaffold have be erect beneath and other preparation make for the work of death under this unhappy tree which in after time be believe to drop poison with its dew sit the one solitary mourner for innocent blood it be a slender and light-clad little boy who lean he face upon a hillock of fresh-turned and half-frozen earth and wail bitterly yet in a suppress tone as if he grief might receive the punishment of crime the puritan whose approach have be unperceived lay he hand upon the child 's shoulder and address he compassionately you have choose a dreary lodging my poor boy and no wonder that you weep say he but dry you eye and tell I where you mother dwell i promise you if the journey be not too far i will leave you in she arm to-night the boy have hush he wail at once and turn he face upward to the stranger it be a pale bright-eyed countenance certainly not more than six year old but sorrow fear and want have destroy much of its infantile expression the puritan see the boy 's frightened gaze and feeling that he tremble under he hand endeavor to reassure he nay if i intend to do you harm little lad the readiest way be to leave you here what you do not fear to sit beneath the gallows on a new-made grave and yet you tremble at a friend 's touch take heart child and tell I what be you name and where be you home friend reply the little boy in a sweet though falter voice they call I ilbrahim and my home be here the pale spiritual face the eye that seem to mingle with the moonlight the sweet airy voice and the outlandish name almost make the puritan believe that the boy be in truth a be which have spring up out of the grave on which he sit but perceive that the apparition stand the test of a short mental prayer and remember that the arm which he have touch be life-like he adopt a more rational supposition the poor child be stricken in he intellect think he but verily he word be fearful in a place like this he then speak soothingly intend to humor the boy 's fantasy you home will scarce be comfortable ilbrahim this cold autumn night and i fear you be ill provide with food i be hasten to a warm supper and bed and if you will go with I you shall share they i thank thee friend but though i be hungry and shiver with cold thou wilt not give I food nor lodging reply the boy in the quiet tone which despair have teach he even so young my father be of the people whom all man hate they have lay he under this heap of earth and here be my home the puritan who have lay hold of little ilbrahim 's hand relinquish it as if he be touch a loathsome reptile but he possess a compassionate heart which not even religious prejudice could harden into stone god forbid that i should leave this child to perish though he come of the accursed sect say he to himself do we not all spring from a evil root be we not all in darkness till the light doth shine upon we he shall not perish neither in body nor if prayer and instruction may avail for he in soul he then speak aloud and kindly to ilbrahim who have again hide he face in the cold earth of the grave be every door in the land shut against you my child that you have wander to this unhallowed spot they drive I forth from the prison when they take my father thence say the boy and i stand afar off watch the crowd of people and when they be go i come hither and find only this grave i know that my father be sleep here and i say this shall be my home no child no not while i have a roof over my head or a morsel to share with you exclaim the puritan whose sympathy be now fully excite rise up and come with I and fear not any harm the boy weep afresh and cling to the heap of earth as if the cold heart beneath it be warmer to he than any in a living breast the traveller however continue to entreat he tenderly and seem to acquire some degree of confidence he at length arise but he slender limb totter with weakness he little head grow dizzy and he lean against the tree of death for support my poor boy be you so feeble say the puritan when do you taste food last i eat of bread and water with my father in the prison reply ilbrahim but they bring he none neither yesterday nor to-day say that he have eat enough to bear he to he journey 's end trouble not thyself for my hunger kind friend for i have lack food many time ere now the traveller take the child in he arm and wrap he cloak about he while he heart stir with shame and anger against the gratuitous cruelty of the instrument in this persecution in the awaken warmth of he feeling he resolve that at whatever risk he would not forsake the poor little defenceless be whom heaven have confide to he care with this determination he leave the accursed field and resume the homeward path from which the wail of the boy have call he the light and motionless burden scarcely impede he progress and he soon behold the fire ray from the window of the cottage which he a native of a distant clime have build in the western wilderness it be surround by a considerable extent of cultivate ground and the dwelling be situate in the nook of a wood-covered hill whither it seem to have creep for protection look up child say the puritan to ilbrahim whose faint head have sink upon he shoulder there be we home at the word home a thrill pass through the child 's frame but he continue silent a few moment bring they to the cottage-door at which the owner knock for at that early period when savage be wander everywhere among the settler bolt and bar be indispensable to the security of a dwelling the summons be answer by a bond-servant a coarse-clad and dull-featured piece of humanity who after ascertain that he master be the applicant undo the door and hold a flare pine-knot torch to light he in further back in the passageway the red blaze discover a matronly woman but no little crowd of child come bound forth to greet they father 's return as the puritan enter he thrust aside he cloak and display ilbrahim 's face to the female dorothy here be a little outcast whom providence have put into we hand observe he be kind to he even as if he be of those dear one who have depart from we what pale and bright-eyed little boy be this tobia she inquire be he one whom the wilderness folk have ravish from some christian mother no dorothy this poor child be no captive from the wilderness he reply the heathen savage would have give he to eat of he scanty morsel and to drink of he birchen cup but christian man alas have cast he out to die then he tell she how he have find he beneath the gallows upon he father 's grave and how he heart have prompt he like the speaking of a inward voice to take the little outcast home and be kind unto he he acknowledge he resolution to feed and clothe he as if he be he own child and to afford he the instruction which should counteract the pernicious error hitherto instil into he infant mind dorothy be gifted with even a quicker tenderness than she husband and she approve of all he doings and intention have you a mother dear child she inquire the tear burst forth from he full heart as he attempt to reply but dorothy at length understand that he have a mother who like the rest of she sect be a persecute wanderer she have be take from the prison a short time before carry into the uninhabited wilderness and leave to perish there by hunger or wild beast this be no uncommon method of dispose of the quaker and they be accustom to boast that the inhabitant of the desert be more hospitable to they than civilized man fear not little boy you shall not need a mother and a kind one say dorothy when she have gather this information dry you tear ilbrahim and be my child as i will be you mother the good woman prepare the little bed from which she own child have successively be bear to another resting-place before ilbrahim would consent to occupy it he kneel down and as dorothy listen to he simple and affect prayer she marvel how the parent that have teach it to he could have be judge worthy of death when the boy have fall asleep she bent over he pale and spiritual countenance press a kiss upon he white brow draw the bedclothes up about he neck and go away with a pensive gladness in she heart tobia pearson be not among the earliest emigrant from the old country he have remain in england during the first year of the civil war in which he have bear some share as a cornet of dragoon under cromwell but when the ambitious design of he leader begin to develop themselves he quit the army of the parliament and seek a refuge from the strife which be no longer holy among the people of he persuasion in the colony of massachusett a more worldly consideration have perhaps a influence in draw he thither for new england offer advantage to man of unprosperous fortune as well as to dissatisfied religionist and pearson have hitherto find it difficult to provide for a wife and increase family to this suppose impurity of motive the more bigoted puritan be incline to impute the removal by death of all the child for whose earthly good the father have be over-thoughtful they have leave they native country bloom like rose and like rose they have perish in a foreign soil those expounder of the way of providence who have thus judge they brother and attribute he domestic sorrow to he sin be not more charitable when they see he and dorothy endeavor to fill up the void in they heart by the adoption of a infant of the accursed sect nor do they fail to communicate they disapprobation to tobia but the latter in reply merely point at the little quiet lovely boy whose appearance and deportment be indeed as powerful argument as could possibly have be adduce in he own favor even he beauty however and he win manners sometimes produce a effect ultimately unfavorable for the bigot when the outer surface of they iron heart have be soften and again grow hard affirm that no merely natural cause could have so work upon they they antipathy to the poor infant be also increase by the ill success of diver theological discussion in which it be attempt to convince he of the error of he sect ilbrahim it be true be not a skilful controversialist but the feeling of he religion be strong as instinct in he and he could neither be entice nor drive from the faith which he father have die for the odium of this stubbornness be share in a great measure by the child 's protector insomuch that tobia and dorothy very shortly begin to experience a most bitter species of persecution in the cold regard of many a friend whom they have value the common people manifest they opinion more openly pearson be a man of some consideration be a representative to the general court and a approve lieutenant in the trainband yet within a week after he adoption of ilbrahim he have be both hiss and hoot once also when walk through a solitary piece of wood he hear a loud voice from some invisible speaker and it cry what shall be do to the backslider lo the scourge be knot for he even the whip of nine cord and every cord three knot these insult irritated pearson 's temper for the moment they enter also into he heart and become imperceptible but powerful worker toward a end which he most secret thought have not yet whisper \* \* \* \* \* on the second sabbath after ilbrahim become a member of they family pearson and he wife deem it proper that he should appear with they at public worship they have anticipate some opposition to this measure from the boy but he prepare himself in silence and at the appoint hour be clothe in the new mourning suit which dorothy have work for he as the parish be then and during many subsequent year unprovided with a bell the signal for the commencement of religious exercise be the beat of a drum at the first sound of that martial call to the place of holy and quiet thought tobia and dorothy set forth each hold a hand of little ilbrahim like two parent link together by the infant of they love on they path through the leafless wood they be overtake by many person of they acquaintance all of whom avoid they and pass by on the other side but a severer trial await they constancy when they have descend the hill and draw near the pine-built and undecorated house of prayer around the door from which the drummer still send forth he thundering summons be draw up a formidable phalanx include several of the oldest member of the congregation many of the middle aged and nearly all the younger male pearson find it difficult to sustain they unite and disapprove gaze but dorothy whose mind be differently circumstanced merely draw the boy closer to she and falter not in she approach as they enter the door they overhear the muttered sentiment of the assemblage and when the revile voice of the little child smite ilbrahim 's ear he weep the interior aspect of the meeting-house be rude the low ceiling the unplastered wall the naked woodwork and the undraperied pulpit offer nothing to excite the devotion which without such external aid often remain latent in the heart the floor of the building be occupy by row of long cushionless bench supply the place of pew and the broad aisle form a sexual division impassable except by child beneath a certain age pearson and dorothy separate at the door of the meeting-house and ilbrahim be within the year of infancy be retain under the care of the latter the wrinkled beldam involve themselves in they rusty cloak as he pass by even the mild-featured maiden seem to dread contamination and many a stern old man arise and turn he repulsive and unheavenly countenance upon the gentle boy as if the sanctuary be polluted by he presence he be a sweet infant of the sky that have stray away from he home and all the inhabitant of this miserable world close up they impure heart against he draw back they earth-soiled garment from he touch and say we be holier than thou ilbrahim seat by the side of he adopt mother and retain fast hold of she hand assume a grave and decorous demeanor such as might befit a person of mature taste and understanding who should find himself in a temple dedicate to some worship which he do not recognize but feel himself bind to respect the exercise have not yet commence however when the boy 's attention be arrest by a event apparently of trifling interest a woman have she face muffle in a hood and a cloak draw completely about she form advance slowly up the broad aisle and take a place upon the foremost bench ilbrahim 's faint color vary he nerve flutter he be unable to turn he eye from the muffle female when the preliminary prayer and hymn be over the minister arise and have turn the hour-glass which stand by the great bible commence he discourse he be now well stricken in year a man of pale thin countenance and he gray hair be closely cover by a black velvet skull cap in he younger day he have practically learn the meaning of persecution from archbishop laud and he be not now dispose to forget the lesson against which he have murmur then introduce the often-discussed subject of the quaker he give a history of that sect and a description of they tenet in which error predominate and prejudice distort the aspect of what be true he advert to the recent measure in the province and caution he hearer of weaker part against call in question the just severity which god-fearing magistrate have at length be compel to exercise he speak of the danger of pity in some case a commendable and christian virtue but inapplicable to this pernicious sect he observe that such be they devilish obstinacy in error that even the little child the sucking babe be harden and desperate heretic he affirm that no man without heaven 's especial warrant should attempt they conversion lest while he lend he hand to draw they from the slough he should himself be precipitate into its lowest depths the sand of the second hour be principally in the lower half of the glass when the sermon conclude a approve murmur follow and the clergyman have give out a hymn take he seat with much self-congratulation and endeavor to read the effect of he eloquence in the visage of the people but while voice from all part of the house be tuning themselves to sing a scene occur which though not very unusual at that period in the province happen to be without precedent in this parish the muffle female who have hitherto sit motionless in the front rank of the audience now arise and with slow stately and unwavering step ascend the pulpit stair the quivering of incipient harmony be hush and the divine sit in speechless and almost terrify astonishment while she undo the door and stand up in the sacred desk from which he malediction have just be thunder she then divest herself of the cloak and hood and appear in a most singular array a shapeless robe of sackcloth be gird about she waist with a knotted cord she raven hair fall down upon she shoulder and its blackness be defile by pale streak of ash which she have strew upon she head she eyebrow dark and strongly define add to the deathly whiteness of a countenance which emaciate with want and wild with enthusiasm and strange sorrow retain no trace of earlier beauty this figure stand gaze earnestly on the audience and there be no sound nor any movement except a faint shuddering which every man observe in he neighbor but be scarcely conscious of in himself at length when she fit of inspiration come she speak for the first few moment in a low voice and not invariably distinct utterance she discourse give evidence of a imagination hopelessly entangled with she reason it be a vague and incomprehensible rhapsody which however seem to spread its own atmosphere round the hearer 's soul and to move he feeling by some influence unconnected with the word as she proceed beautiful but shadowy image would sometimes be see like bright thing move in a turbid river or a strong and singularly shaped idea leap forth and seize at once on the understanding or the heart but the course of she unearthly eloquence soon lead she to the persecution of she sect and from thence the step be short to she own peculiar sorrow she be naturally a woman of mighty passion and hatred and revenge now wrap themselves in the garb of piety the character of she speech be change she image become distinct though wild and she denunciation have a almost hellish bitterness the governor and he mighty man she say have gather together take counsel among themselves and say ` what shall we do unto this people -- even unto the people that have come into this land to put we iniquity to the blush ' and lo the devil entereth into the council-chamber like a lame man of low stature and gravely apparel with a dark and twisted countenance and a bright downcast eye and he standeth up among the ruler yea he goeth to and fro whispering to each and every man lend he ear for he word be ` slay slay ' but i say unto ye woe to they that slay woe to they that shed the blood of saint woe to they that have slay the husband and cast forth the child the tender infant to wander homeless and hungry and cold till he die and have save the mother alive in the cruelty of they tender mercy woe to they in they lifetime curse be they in the delight and pleasure of they heart woe to they in they death-hour whether it come swiftly with blood and violence or after long and linger pain woe in the dark house in the rottenness of the grave when the child 's child shall revile the ash of the father woe woe woe at the judgment when all the persecute and all the slay in this bloody land and the father the mother and the child shall await they in a day that they can not escape seed of the faith seed of the faith ye whose heart be move with a power that ye know not arise wash you hand of this innocent blood lift you voice choose one cry aloud and call down a woe and a judgment with I have thus give vent to the flood of malignity which she mistake for inspiration the speaker be silent she voice be succeed by the hysteric shriek of several woman but the feeling of the audience generally have not be draw onward in the current with she own they remain stupefied strand as it be in the midst of a torrent which deafen they by its roaring but might not move they by its violence the clergyman who could not hitherto have eject the usurper of he pulpit otherwise than by bodily force now address she in the tone of just indignation and legitimate authority get you down woman from the holy place which you profane he say be it to the lord 's house that you come to pour forth the foulness of you heart and the inspiration of the devil get you down and remember that the sentence of death be on you yea and shall be execute be it but for this day 's work i go friend i go for the voice have have its utterance reply she in a depressed and even mild tone i have do my mission unto thee and to thy people reward I with stripe imprisonment or death as ye shall be permit the weakness of exhaust passion cause she step to totter as she descend the pulpit stair the people in the meanwhile be stir to and fro on the floor of the house whispering among themselves and glance toward the intruder many of they now recognize she as the woman who have assault the governor with frightful language as he pass by the window of she prison they know also that she be adjudge to suffer death and have be preserve only by a involuntary banishment into the wilderness the new outrage by which she have provoke she fate seem to render further lenity impossible and a gentleman in military dress with a stout man of inferior rank draw toward the door of the meeting-house and await she approach scarcely do she foot press the floor however when a unexpected scene occur in that moment of she peril when every eye frown with death a little timid boy press forth and throw he arm round he mother i be here mother it be i and i will go with thee to prison he exclaim she gaze at he with a doubtful and almost frightened expression for she know that the boy have be cast out to perish and she have not hope to see he face again she fear perhaps that it be but one of the happy vision with which she excited fancy have often deceive she in the solitude of the desert or in prison but when she feel he hand warm within she own and hear he little eloquence of childish love she begin to know that she be yet a mother bless art thou my son she sob my heart be withered yea dead with thee and with thy father and now it leap as in the first moment when i press thee to my bosom she kneel down and embrace he again and again while the joy that could find no word express itself in broken accent like the bubble gush up to vanish at the surface of a deep fountain the sorrow of past year and the darker peril that be nigh cast not a shadow on the brightness of that fleeting moment soon however the spectator see a change upon she face as the consciousness of she sad estate return and grief supply the fount of tear which joy have open by the word she utter it would seem that the indulgence of natural love have give she mind a momentary sense of its error and make she know how far she have stray from duty in follow the dictate of a wild fanaticism in a doleful hour art thou return to I poor boy she say for thy mother 's path have go darkening onward till now the end be death son son i have bear thee in my arm when my limb be totter and i have feed thee with the food that i be faint for yet i have ill perform a mother 's part by thee in life and now i leave thee no inheritance but woe and shame thou wilt go seek through the world and find all heart close against thee and they sweet affection turn to bitterness for my sake my child my child how many a pang await thy gentle spirit and i the cause of all she hide she face on ilbrahim 's head and she long raven hair discolor with the ash of she mourning fall down about he like a veil a low and interrupted moan be the voice of she heart 's anguish and it do not fail to move the sympathy of many who mistake they involuntary virtue for a sin sob be audible in the female section of the house and every man who be a father draw he hand across he eye tobia pearson be agitate and uneasy but a certain feeling like the consciousness of guilt oppress he so that he could not go forth and offer himself as the protector of the child dorothy however have watch she husband 's eye she mind be free from the influence that have begin to work on he and she draw near the quaker woman and address she in the hearing of all the congregation stranger trust this boy to I and i will be he mother she say take ilbrahim 's hand providence have signally mark out my husband to protect he and he have feed at we table and lodge under we roof now many day till we heart have grow very strongly unto he leave the tender child with we and be at ease concern he welfare the quaker rise from the ground but draw the boy closer to she while she gaze earnestly in dorothy 's face she mild but saddened feature and neat matronly attire harmonize together and be like a verse of fireside poetry she very aspect prove that she be blameless so far as mortal could be so in respect to god and man while the enthusiast in she robe of sackcloth and girdle of knotted cord have as evidently violate the duty of the present life and the future by fix she attention wholly on the latter the two female as they hold each a hand of ilbrahim form a practical allegory it be rational piety and unbridled fanaticism contend for the empire of a young heart thou art not of we people say the quaker mournfully no we be not of you people reply dorothy with mildness but we be christian look upward to the same heaven with you doubt not that you boy shall meet you there if there be a blessing on we tender and prayerful guidance of he thither i trust my own child have go before I for i also have be a mother i be no longer so she add in a falter tone and you son will have all my care but will ye lead he in the path which he parent have trodden demand the quaker can ye teach he the enlighten faith which he father have die for and for which i even i be soon to become a unworthy martyr the boy have be baptize in blood will ye keep the mark fresh and ruddy upon he forehead i will not deceive you answer dorothy if you child become we child we must breed he up in the instruction which heaven have impart to we we must pray for he the prayer of we own faith we must do toward he accord to the dictate of we own conscience and not of yours be we to act otherwise we should abuse you trust even in comply with you wish the mother look down upon she boy with a troubled countenance and then turn she eye upward to heaven she seem to pray internally and the contention of she soul be evident friend she say at length to dorothy i doubt not that my son shall receive all earthly tenderness at thy hand nay i will believe that even thy imperfect light may guide he to a better world for surely thou art on the path thither but thou hast speak of a husband doth he stand here among this multitude of people let he come forth for i must know to whom i commit this most precious trust she turn she face upon the male auditor and after a momentary delay tobia pearson come forth from among they the quaker see the dress which mark he military rank and shake she head but then she note the hesitate air the eye that struggle with she own and be vanquish the color that go and come and could find no resting-place as she gaze a unmirthful smile spread over she feature like sunshine that grow melancholy in some desolate spot she lip move inaudibly but at length she speak i hear it i hear it the voice speaketh within I and saith ` leave thy child catharine for he place be here and go hence for i have other work for thee break the bond of natural affection martyr thy love and know that in all these thing eternal wisdom have its end ' i go friend i go take ye my boy my precious jewel i go hence trust that all shall be well and that even for he infant hand there be a labor in the vineyard she kneel down and whisper to ilbrahim who at first struggle and cling to he mother with sob and tear but remain passive when she have kiss he cheek and arise from the ground have hold she hand over he head in mental prayer she be ready to depart farewell friend in mine extremity she say to pearson and he wife the good deed ye have do I be a treasure lay up in heaven to be return a thousand-fold hereafter and farewell ye mine enemy to whom it be not permit to harm so much as a hair of my head nor to stay my footstep even for a moment the day be come when ye shall call upon I to witness for ye to this one sin uncommitted and i will rise up and answer she turn she step toward the door and the man who have station themselves to guard it withdraw and suffer she to pass a general sentiment of pity overcome the virulence of religious hatred sanctify by she love and she affliction she go forth and all the people gaze after she till she have journey up the hill and be lose behind its brow she go the apostle of she own unquiet heart to renew the wanderings of past year for she voice have be already hear in many land of christendom and she have pine in the cell of a catholic inquisition before she feel the lash and lay in the dungeon of the puritan she mission have extend also to the follower of the prophet and from they she have receive the courtesy and kindness which all the contend sect of we purer religion unite to deny she she husband and herself have reside many month in turkey where even the sultan 's countenance be gracious to they in that pagan land too be ilbrahim 's birthplace and he oriental name be a mark of gratitude for the good deed of a unbeliever \* \* \* \* \* when pearson and he wife have thus acquire all the rights over ilbrahim that could be delegate they affection for he become like the memory of they native land or they mild sorrow for the dead a piece of the immovable furniture of they heart the boy also after a week or two of mental disquiet begin to gratify he protector by many inadvertent proof that he consider they as parent and they house as home before the winter snow be melt the persecute infant the little wanderer from a remote and heathen country seem native in the new england cottage and inseparable from the warmth and security of its hearth under the influence of kind treatment and in the consciousness that he be love ilbrahim 's demeanor lose a premature manliness which have result from he earlier situation he become more childlike and he natural character display itself with freedom it be in many respects a beautiful one yet the disorder imagination of both he father and mother have perhaps propagate a certain unhealthiness in the mind of the boy in he general state ilbrahim would derive enjoyment from the most trifling event and from every object about he he seem to discover rich treasure of happiness by a faculty analogous to that of the witch-hazel which point to hidden gold where all be barren to the eye he airy gayety come to he from a thousand source communicate itself to the family and ilbrahim be like a domesticated sunbeam brighten moody countenance and chase away the gloom from the dark corner of the cottage on the other hand as the susceptibility of pleasure be also that of pain the exuberant cheerfulness of the boy 's prevail temper sometimes yield to moment of deep depression he sorrow could not always be follow up to they original source but most frequently they appear to flow though ilbrahim be young to be sad for such a cause from wound love the flightiness of he mirth render he often guilty of offence against the decorum of a puritan household and on these occasion he do not invariably escape rebuke but the slightest word of real bitterness which he be infallible in distinguish from pretended anger seem to sink into he heart and poison all he enjoyment till he become sensible that he be entirely forgive of the malice which generally accompany a superfluity of sensitiveness ilbrahim be altogether destitute when trodden upon he would not turn when wound he could but die he mind be want in the stamen for self-support it be a plant that would twine beautifully round something stronger than itself but if repulse or tear away it have no choice but to wither on the ground dorothy 's acuteness teach she that severity would crush the spirit of the child and she nurture he with the gentle care of one who handle a butterfly she husband manifest a equal affection although it grow daily less productive of familiar caress the feeling of the neighboring people in regard to the quaker infant and he protector have not undergo a favorable change in spite of the momentary triumph which the desolate mother have obtain over they sympathy the scorn and bitterness of which he be the object be very grievous to ilbrahim especially when any circumstance make he sensible that the child he equal in age partook of the enmity of they parent he tender and social nature have already overflow in attachment to everything about he and still there be a residue of unappropriated love which he yearn to bestow upon the little one who be teach to hate he as the warm day of spring come on ilbrahim be accustom to remain for hour silent and inactive within hearing of the child 's voice at they play yet with he usual delicacy of feeling he avoid they notice and would flee and hide himself from the smallest individual among they chance however at length seem to open a medium of communication between he heart and theirs it be by means of a boy about two year older than ilbrahim who be injure by a fall from a tree in the vicinity of pearson 's habitation as the sufferer 's own home be at some distance dorothy willingly receive he under she roof and become he tender and careful nurse ilbrahim be the unconscious possessor of much skill in physiognomy and it would have deter he in other circumstance from attempt to make a friend of this boy the countenance of the latter immediately impress a beholder disagreeably but it require some examination to discover that the cause be a very slight distortion of the mouth and the irregular broken line and near approach of the eyebrow analogous perhaps to these trifling deformity be a almost imperceptible twist of every joint and the uneven prominence of the breast form a body regular in its general outline but faulty in almost all its detail the disposition of the boy be sullen and reserved and the village schoolmaster stigmatize he as obtuse in intellect although at a later period of life he evince ambition and very peculiar talent but whatever might be he personal or moral irregularity ilbrahim 's heart seize upon and clung to he from the moment that he be bring wound into the cottage the child of persecution seem to compare he own fate with that of the sufferer and to feel that even different mode of misfortune have create a sort of relationship between they food rest and the fresh air for which he languish be neglect he nestle continually by the bedside of the little stranger and with a fond jealousy endeavor to be the medium of all the care that be bestow upon he as the boy become convalescent ilbrahim contrived game suitable to he situation or amuse he by a faculty which he have perhaps breathe in with the air of he barbaric birthplace it be that of recite imaginary adventure on the spur of the moment and apparently in inexhaustible succession he tale be of course monstrous disjointed and without aim but they be curious on account of a vein of human tenderness which run through they all and be like a sweet familiar face encounter in the midst of wild and unearthly scenery the auditor pay much attention to these romance and sometimes interrupt they by brief remark upon the incident display shrewdness above he year mingle with a moral obliquity which grate very harshly against ilbrahim 's instinctive rectitude nothing however could arrest the progress of the latter 's affection and there be many proof that it meet with a response from the dark and stubborn nature on which it be lavish the boy 's parent at length remove he to complete he cure under they own roof ilbrahim do not visit he new friend after he departure but he make anxious and continual inquiry respect he and inform himself of the day when he be to reappear among he playmate on a pleasant summer afternoon the child of the neighborhood have assemble in the little forest-crowned amphitheatre behind the meeting-house and the recover invalid be there lean on a staff the glee of a score of untainted bosom be hear in light and airy voice which dance among the tree like sunshine become audible the grow man of this weary world as they journey by the spot marvel why life beginning in such brightness should proceed in gloom and they heart or they imagination answer they and say that the bliss of childhood gush from its innocence but it happen that a unexpected addition be make to the heavenly little band it be ilbrahim who come toward the child with a look of sweet confidence on he fair and spiritual face as if have manifest he love to one of they he have no longer to fear a repulse from they society a hush come over they mirth the moment they behold he and they stand whisper to each other while he draw nigh but all at once the devil of they father enter into the unbreeched fanatic and send up a fierce shrill cry they rush upon the poor quaker child in a instant he be the center of a brood of baby-fiend who lift stick against he pelt he with stone and display a instinct of destruction far more loathsome than the blood-thirstiness of manhood the invalid in the meanwhile stand apart from the tumult cry out with a loud voice fear not ilbrahim come hither and take my hand and he unhappy friend endeavor to obey he after watch the victim 's struggle approach with a calm smile and unabashed eye the foul-hearted little villain lift he staff and strike ilbrahim on the mouth so forcibly that the blood issue in a stream the poor child 's arm have be raise to guard he head from the storm of blow but now he drop they at once he persecutor beat he down trample upon he drag he by he long fair lock and ilbrahim be on the point of become as veritable a martyr as ever enter bleeding into heaven the uproar however attract the notice of a few neighbor who put themselves to the trouble of rescue the little heretic and of convey he to pearson 's door ilbrahim 's bodily harm be severe but long and careful nursing accomplish he recovery the injury do to he sensitive spirit be more serious though not so visible its sign be principally of a negative character and to be discover only by those who have previously know he he gait be thenceforth slow even and unvaried by the sudden burst of sprightlier motion which have once correspond to he overflow gladness he countenance be heavier and its former play of expression the dance of sunshine reflect from move water be destroy by the cloud over he existence he notice be attract in a far less degree by pass event and he appear to find greater difficulty in comprehend what be new to he than at a happier period a stranger found he judgment upon these circumstance would have say that the dulness of the child 's intellect widely contradict the promise of he feature but the secret be in the direction of ilbrahim 's thought which be brood within he when they should naturally have be wander abroad a attempt of dorothy to revive he former sportiveness be the single occasion on which he quiet demeanor yield to a violent display of grief he burst into passionate weep and run and hide himself for he heart have become so miserably sore that even the hand of kindness tortured it like fire sometimes at night and probably in he dream he be hear to cry mother mother as if she place which a stranger have supply while ilbrahim be happy admit of no substitute in he extreme affliction perhaps among the many life-weary wretch then upon the earth there be not one who combine innocence and misery like this poor broken-hearted infant so soon the victim of he own heavenly nature while this melancholy change have take place in ilbrahim one of a earlier origin and of different character have come to its perfection in he adopt father the incident with which this tale commence find pearson in a state of religious dulness yet mentally disquieted and longing for a more fervid faith than he possess the first effect of he kindness to ilbrahim be to produce a softened feeling and incipient love for the child 's whole sect but join to this and result perhaps from self-suspicion be a proud and ostentatious contempt of they tenet and practical extravagance in the course of much thought however for the subject struggle irresistibly into he mind the foolishness of the doctrine begin to be less evident and the point which have particularly offend he reason assume another aspect or vanish entirely away the work within he appear to go on even while he sleep and that which have be a doubt when he lay down to rest would often hold the place of a truth confirm by some forget demonstration when he recall he thought in the morning but while he be thus become assimilate to the enthusiast he contempt in no wise decrease toward they grow very fierce against himself he imagine also that every face of he acquaintance wear a sneer and that every word address to he be a gibe such be he state of mind at the period of ilbrahim 's misfortune and the emotion consequent upon that event complete the change of which the child have be the original instrument in the meantime neither the fierceness of the persecutor nor the infatuation of they victim have decrease the dungeon be never empty the street of almost every village echo daily with a lash the life of a woman whose mild and christian spirit no cruelty could imbitter have be sacrifice and more innocent blood be yet to pollute the hand that be so often raise in prayer early after the restoration the english quaker represent to charle ii that a vein of blood be open in he dominion but though the displeasure of the voluptuous king be rouse he interference be not prompt and now the tale must stride forward over many month leave pearson to encounter ignominy and misfortune he wife to a firm endurance of a thousand sorrow poor ilbrahim to pine and droop like a cankered rosebud he mother to wander on a mistaken errand neglectful of the holiest trust which can be commit to a woman \* \* \* \* \* a winter evening a night of storm have darken over pearson 's habitation and there be no cheerful face to drive the gloom from he broad hearth the fire it be true send forth a glowing heat and a ruddy light and large log drip with half-melted snow lay ready to be cast upon the ember but the apartment be sadden in its aspect by the absence of much of the homely wealth which have once adorn it for the exaction of repeat fine and he own neglect of temporal affair have greatly impoverish the owner and with the furniture of peace the implement of war have likewise disappear the sword be break the helm and cuirass be cast away forever the soldier have do with battle and might not lift so much as he naked hand to guard he head but the holy book remain and the table on which it rest be draw before the fire while two of the

gray head ' o thou to whom i have look in my furthest wanderings continue the quaker raise he agitate eye to heaven inflict not upon the bloodiest of we persecutor the unmitigated agony of my soul when i believe that all i have do and suffer for thee be at the instigation of a mock fiend but i yield not i knelt down and wrestle with the tempter while the scourge bit more fiercely into the flesh my prayer be hear and i go on in peace and joy toward the wilderness the old man though he fanaticism have generally all the calmness of reason be deeply move while recite this tale and he unwonted emotion seem to rebuke and keep down that of he companion they sit in silence with they face to the fire imagine perhaps in its red ember new scene of persecution yet to be encounter the snow still drift hard against the window and sometimes as the blaze of the log have gradually sink come down the spacious chimney and hiss upon the hearth a cautious footstep might now and then be hear in a neighbor apartment and the sound invariably draw the eye of both quaker to the door which lead thither when a fierce and riotous gust of wind have lead he thought by a natural association to homeless traveller on such a night pearson resume the conversation i have well-nigh sink under my own share of this trial observe he sigh heavily yet i would that it might be double to I if so the child 's

therefore proceed through the entry to the door which they open bid the applicant come in in god 's name a furious blast of wind drive the storm into they face and extinguish the lamp they have barely time to discern a figure so white from head to foot with the drift snow that it seem like winter 's self come in human shape to seek refuge from its own desolation enter friend and do thy errand be it what it may say pearson it must need be press since thou comest on such a bitter night peace be with this household say the stranger when they stand on the floor of the inner apartment pearson start the elder quaker stir the slumbering ember of the fire till they send up a clear and lofty blaze it be a female voice that have speak it be a female form that shine out cold and wintry in that comfortable light catharine bless woman exclaim the old man art thou come to this darkened land again art thou come to bear a valiant testimony as in former year the scourge have not prevail against thee and from the dungeon hast thou come forth triumphant but strengthen strengthen now thy heart catharine for heaven will prove thee yet this once ere thou go to thy reward rejoice friend she reply thou who hast long be of we people and thou whom a little child have lead to we rejoice lo i come the messenger of glad tiding for the day of persecution be overpass the heart of the king even charle have be move in gentleness toward we and he have send forth he letter to stay the hand of the man of blood a ship 's company of we friend have arrive at yonder town and i also sail joyfully among they as catharine speak she eye be roam about the room in search of he for whose sake security be dear to she pearson make a silent appeal to the old man nor do the latter shrink from the painful task assign he sister he begin in a softened yet perfectly calm tone thou tellest we of he love manifest in temporal good and now must we speak to thee of that selfsame love display in chastening hitherto catharine thou hast be as one journey in a darksome and difficult path and lead a infant by the hand fain wouldst thou have look heavenward continually but still the care of that little child have draw thine eye and thy affection to the earth sister go on rejoice for he totter footstep shall impede thine own no more but the unhappy mother be not thus to be console she shake like a leaf she turn white as the very snow that hang drift into she hair the firm old man extend he hand and hold she up keep he eye upon hers as if to repress any outbreak of passion i be a woman i be but a woman will he try I above my strength say catharine very quickly and almost in a whisper i have be wound sore i have suffer much many thing in the body many in the mind crucify in myself and in they that be dearest to I surely add she with a long shudder he have spare I in this one thing she break forth with sudden and irrepressible violence tell I man of cold heart what have god do to I have he cast I down never to rise again have he crush my very heart in he hand and thou to whom i commit my child how hast thou fulfil thy trust give I back the boy well sound alive alive or earth and heaven shall avenge I the agonize shriek of catharine be answer by the faint the very faint voice of a child on this day it have become evident to pearson to he aged guest and to dorothy that ilbrahim 's brief and troubled pilgrimage draw near its close the two former would willingly have remain by he to make use of the prayer and pious discourse which they deem appropriate to the time and which if they be impotent as to the depart traveller 's reception in the world whither it go may at least sustain he in bidding adieu to earth but though ilbrahim utter no complaint he be disturb by the face that look upon he so that dorothy 's entreaty and they own conviction that the child 's foot might tread heaven 's pavement and not soil it have induce the two quaker to remove ilbrahim then close he eye and grow calm and except for now and then a kind and low word to he nurse might have be think to slumber as nightfall come on however and the storm begin to rise something seem to trouble the repose of the boy 's mind and to render he sense of hearing active and acute if a pass wind linger to shake the casement he strive to turn he head toward it if the door jar to and fro upon its hinge he look long and anxiously thitherward if the heavy voice of the old man as he read the scripture rise but a little higher the child almost hold he die breath to listen if a snowdrift sweep by the cottage with a sound like the trail of a garment ilbrahim seem to watch that some visitant should enter but after a little time he relinquish whatever secret hope have agitate he and with one low complain whisper turn he cheek upon the pillow he then address dorothy with he usual sweetness and besought she to draw near he she do so and ilbrahim take she hand in both of he grasp it with a gentle pressure as if to assure himself that he retain it at interval and without disturb the repose of he countenance a very faint tremble pass over he from head to foot as if a mild but somewhat cool wind have breathe upon he and make he shiver as the boy thus lead she by the hand in he quiet progress over the border of eternity dorothy almost imagine that she could discern the near though dim delightfulness of the home he be about to reach she would not have entice the little wanderer back though she bemoan herself that she must leave he and return but just when ilbrahim 's foot be press on the soil of paradise he hear a voice behind he and it recall he a few few pace of the weary path which he have travel as dorothy look upon he feature she perceive that they placid expression be again disturbed she own thought have be so wrap in he that all sound of the storm and of human speech be lose to she but when catharine 's shriek pierce through the room the boy strive to raise himself friend she be come open unto she cry he in a moment he mother be kneel by the bedside she draw ilbrahim to she bosom and he nestle there with no violence of joy but contentedly as if he be hush himself to sleep he look into she face and read its agony say with feeble earnestness mourn not dearest mother i be happy now and with these word the gentle boy be dead \* \* \* \* \* the king 's mandate to stay the new england persecutor be effectual in prevent further martyrdom but the colonial authority trust in the remoteness of they situation and perhaps in the suppose instability of the royal government shortly renew they severity in all other respects catharine 's fanaticism have become wilder by the sundering of all human tie and wherever a scourge be lift there be she to receive the blow and whenever a dungeon be unbarred thither she come to cast herself upon the floor but in process of time a more christian spirit -- a spirit of forbearance though not of cordiality or approbation -- begin to pervade the land in regard to the persecute sect and then when the rigid old pilgrim eye she rather in pity than in wrath when the matron feed she with the fragment of they child 's food and offer she a lodging on a hard and lowly bed when no little crowd of schoolboy leave they sport to cast stone after the rove enthusiast -- then do catharine return to pearson 's dwelling and make that she home as if ilbrahim 's sweetness yet linger round he ash as if he gentle spirit come down from heaven to teach he parent a true religion she fierce and vindictive nature be soften by the same grief which have once irritated it when the course of year have make the feature of the unobtrusive mourner familiar in the settlement she become a subject of not deep but general interest a be on whom the otherwise superfluous sympathy of all might be bestow every one speak of she with that degree of pity which it be pleasant to experience every one be ready to do she the little kindness which be not costly yet manifest good-will and when at last she die a long train of she once bitter persecutor follow she with decent sadness and tear that be not painful to she place by ilbrahim 's green and sunken grave the angel by han christian andersen whenever a good child die a angel from heaven come down to earth and take the dead child in he arm spread out he great white wing and fly away over all the place the child have love and pick quite a handful of flower which he carry up to the almighty that they may bloom in heaven more brightly than on earth and the father press all the flower to he heart but he kiss the flower that please he best and the flower be then endowed with a voice and can join in the great chorus of praise see -- this be what a angel say as he carry a dead child up to heaven and the child hear as if in a dream and they go on over the region of home where the little child have play and they come through garden with beautiful flower -- which of these shall we take with we to plant in heaven ask the angel now there stand near they a slender beautiful rise bush but a wicked hand have break the stem so that all the branch cover with half-opened bud be hang droop around quite wither the poor rise bush say the child take it that it may bloom up yonder and the angel take it and kiss the child and the little one half open he eye they pluck some of the rich flower but also take with they the despise buttercup and the wild pansy now we have flower say the child and the angel nod but he do not yet fly upward to heaven it be night and quite silent they remain in the great city they float about there in a small street where lay whole heap of straw ash and sweepings for it have be removal-day there lay fragment of plate bit of plaster rag and old hat and all this do not look well and the angel point amid all this confusion to a few fragment of a flower-pot and to a lump of earth which have fall out and which be keep together by the root of a great dry field flower which be of no use and have therefore be throw out into the street we will take that with we say the angel i will tell you why as we fly onward down yonder in the narrow lane in the low cellar live a poor sick boy from he childhood he have be bedridden when he be at he best he could go up and down the room a few time lean on crutch that be the utmost he could do for a few day in summer the sunbeam would penetrate for a few hour to the ground of the cellar and when the poor boy sit there and the sun shone on he and he look at the red blood in he three finger as he hold they up before he face he would say ` yes to-day he have be out ' he know the forest with its beautiful vernal green only from the fact that the neighbor 's son bring he the first green branch of a beech-tree and he hold that up over he head and dream he be in the beech wood where the sun shone and the bird sing on a spring day the neighbor 's boy also bring he field flower and among these be by chance one to which the root be hang and so it be plant in a flower-pot and place by the bed close to the window and the flower have be plant by a fortunate hand and it grow throw out new shoot and bear flower every year it become as a splendid flower-garden to the sickly boy -- he little treasure here on earth he water it and tend it and take care that it have the benefit of every ray of sunlight down to the last that struggle in through the narrow window and the flower itself be weave into he dream for it grow for he and gladden he eye and spread its fragrance about he and toward it he turn in death when the father call he he have now be with the almighty for a year for a year the flower have stand forget in the window and be wither and thus at the removal it have be throw out into the dust of the street and this be the flower the poor withered flower which we have take into we nosegay for this flower have give more joy than the richest flower in a queen 's garden but how do you know all this ask the child which the angel be carry to heaven i know it say the angel for i myself be that little boy who walk on crutch i know my flower well and the child open he eye and look into the glorious happy face of the angel and at the same moment they enter the region where there be peace and joy and the father press the dead child to he bosom and then it receive wing like the angel and fly hand in hand with he and the almighty press all the flower to he heart but he kiss the dry withered field flower and it receive a voice and sing with all the angel hover around -- some near and some in wider circle and some in infinite distance but all equally happy and they all sing little and great the good happy child and the poor field flower that have lie there wither throw among the dust in the rubbish of the removal-day in the narrow dark lane the red shoe by han christian andersen there once be a little girl a very nice pretty little girl but in summer she have to go barefoot because she be poor and in winter she wear thick wooden shoe so that she little instep become quite red altogether red in the middle of the village live a old shoemaker

but when they speak of dress and splendor and beauty she would shake she head next Sunday they all go to church and she be ask if she wish to go too but she look sadly with tear in she eye at she crutch and then the other go to hear god 's word but she go alone into she little room which be only large enough to contain she bed and a chair and here she sit with she hymn-book and as she read it with a pious mind the wind bear the note of the organ over to she from the church and she lift up she face wet with tear and say : o lord help I then the sun shine so brightly and before she stand the

with sunshine peace and joy that it break she soul fly on the sunbeam to heaven and there be nobody who ask after the red shoe the lovliest rise in the world by han christian andersen once there reign a queen in whose garden be find the most glorious flower at all season and from all the land in the world but especially she love rose and therefore she possess the most various kind of this flower from the wild dog-rose with the apple-scented green leaf to the most splendid provence rise they grow against the earth wall wind themselves round pillar and window-frame into the passage and all along the ceiling in all the hall and the rose be various in fragrance form and color but care and sorrow dwelt in these hall : the queen lay upon a sick-bed and the doctor declare that she must die there be still one thing that can serve she say the wisest of they bring she the loveliest rise in the world the one which be the expression of the brightest and purest love for if that be bring before she eye ere they close she will not die and young and old come from every side with rose the loveliest that bloom in each garden but they be not the right sort the flower be to be bring out of the garden of love but what rise be it there that express the highest and purest love and the poet sing of the loveliest rise in the world and each one name he own and intelligence be send far round the land to every heart that beat with love to every class and condition and to every age no one have till now name the flower say the wise man no one have point out the place where it bloom in its splendor they be not the rose from the coffin of romeo and juliet or from the walburg 's grave though these rose will be ever fragrant in song they be not the rose that sprout forth from winkelried 's blood-stained lance from the blood that flow in a sacred cause from the breast of the hero who die for he country though no death be sweeter than this and no rise redder than the blood that flow then nor be it that wondrous flower to cherish which man devote in a quiet chamber many a sleepless night and much of he fresh life -- the magic flower of science i know where it bloom say a happy mother who come with she pretty child to the bedside of the queen i know where the loveliest rose of the world be find the rise that be the expression of the highest and purest love spring from the bloom

of the woman i have see it and a loftier purer rise do not bloom i see it on the cheek of the queen she have take off she golden crown and in the long dreary night she be carry she sick child in she arm : she weep kiss it and pray for she child as a mother pray in the hour of she anguish holy and wonderful in its might be the white rose of grief but it be not the one we seek no the loveliest rose of the world i see at the altar of the lord say the good old bishop i see it shine as if a angel 's face have appear the young maiden go to the lord 's table and renew the promise make at they baptism and rose be blush and pale rose shine on they fresh cheek a young girl stand there she look with all the purity and love of she young spirit up to heaven : that be the expression of the highest and purest love may she be bless say the wise man but not one of you have yet name to I the loveliest rose of the world then there come into the room a child the queen 's little son tear stand in he eye and glisten on he cheek he carry a great open book and the binding be of velvet with great silver clasp mother cry the boy only hear what i have read and the child sit by the bedside and read from the book of he who suffer death on the cross to save man and even those who be not yet bear greater love there be not -- and a roseate hue spread over the cheek of the queen and she eye gleam for she see that from the leaf of the book there bloom the loveliest rise that spring from the blood of christ shed on the cross i see it she say : he who behold this the loveliest rise on earth shall never die a vision of the last day by han christian andersen of all the day of we life the greatest and most solemn be the day on which we die hast thou ever try to realize that most sure most portentous hour the last hour we shall spend on earth there be a certain man a upholder of truth and justice a christian man and orthodox so the world esteem he and in sooth it may be that some good thing be find in he

righteous and despise other he go to rest secure that he account be right with all man that he have pay he due and work good work that day of the secret pride of he heart of the harsh word that have pass he lip he take no account at all and so he sleep and in he sleep death stand by he bedside a glorious angel strong spotless beautiful but unlike every other angel stern unsmiling pitiless of aspect thine hour be come and thou must follow I spake death and death 's cold finger touch the man 's foot whereupon they become like ice then touch he forehead then he heart and the chain that bind the immortal soul to clay be riven asunder and the soul be free to follow the angel of death but during those brief seconds while yet that awful touch thrill through foot and head and heart there pass over the die man as in great heaving ocean wave the recollection of all that he have work and feel in he whole life just as one shudder glance into a whirlpool suffice to reveal in think rapid as lightning the entire unfathomable depth just as in one momentary glance at the starry heaven we can conceive the infinite multitude of that glorious host of unknown orb in such a retrospect the terrify sinner shrink back into himself and find there no stay by which to cling must feel shrink into infinite nothingness while the devout soul raise its thought to the almighty yield itself up to he in childlike trust and pray thy will be do in I but this man have not the childlike mind neither do he tremble like the sinner he thought be still the self-praising thought in which he have fall asleep he path he believe must lead straight heavenward and mercy the promise mercy would open to he the gate and in he dream the soul follow the angel of death though not without first cast one wistful glance at the couch where lay in its white shroud the lifeless image of clay still as it be bear the impress of the soul 's own individuality and now they hover through the air now glide along the ground be it a vast decorate hall they be pass through or a forest it seem hard to tell nature it appear be formally set out for show as in the artificial old french garden and amid its strange carefully arrange scene pass and repass troops of man and woman all clad as for a masquerade such be human life say the angel of death the figure seem more or less disguise those who sweep by in the glory of velvet and gold be not all among the noblest or most dignified-looking neither be all those who wear the garb of poverty insignificant or vulgar it be a strange masquerade but most strange it be to see how one and all carefully conceal under they clothing something they would not have other perceive but in vain for each be bent upon discover he neighbor 's secret and they tear and snatch at one another till now here now there some part of a animal be reveal in one be find the grinning head of a ape in another the cloven foot of a goat in a third the poison-fang of a snake in a fourth the clammy fin of a fish all have in they some token of the animal -- the animal which be fast root in human nature and which here be see struggle to burst forth and however closely a man might hold he garment over it the other would never rest till they have rent the hiding veil and all keep cry out look here look now here he be there she be -- and every one mockingly lay bare he fellow 's shame and what be the animal in I inquire the disembodied soul and the angel of death point to a haughty form around whose head shine a bright widespread glory of rainbow-colored ray but at whose heart might be see lurk half-hidden the foot of the peacock the glory be in fact merely the peacock 's gaudy tail and as they pass on large foul-looking bird shriek out from the bough of the tree with clear intelligible though harsh human voice they shriek thou that walkest with death dost remember I all the evil thought and desire that have nestle within he from he birth until he death now call after he rememberest thou I and the soul shudder recognize the voice it could not deny knowledge of the evil thought and desire that be now rise up in witness against it in we flesh in we evil nature dwelleth no good thing cry the soul but at least thought never with I ripen into action the world have not see the evil fruit and the soul hurry on to get free from the accuse voice but the great black fowl sweep in circle round and scream out they scandalous word louder and louder as though they would be hear all over the world and the soul flee from they like the hunt stag and at every step stumble against sharp flint stone that lay in the path how come these sharp stone here they look like mere withered leave lie on the ground every stone be for some incautious word thou hast speak which lay as a stumbling-block in thy neighbor 's path which wound thy neighbor 's heart far more sorely and deeply than these sharp flint now wind thy foot alas i never once think of that sigh the soul and those word of the gospel ring through the air judge not that ye be not judge we have all sin say the soul recover from its momentary self-abasement i have keep the law and the gospel i have do what i could i be not as other be and in he dream this man now stand at the gate of heaven and the angel who guard the entrance inquire who art thou tell I thy faith and show it to I in thy work i have faithfully keep the commandment i have humble myself in the eye of the world i have preserve myself free from the pollution of intercourse with sinner i have hate and persecute evil and those who practice it and i would do so still yea with fire and sword have i the power then thou art one of mohammed 's follower say the angel i a mohammedan -- never ` he who strike with the sword shall perish by the sword ' thus speak the son he religion thou knowest not it may be that thou art one of the child of israel whose maxim be ` a eye for a eye a tooth for a tooth ' -- art thou such i be a christian i see it not in thy faith or in thine action the law of christ be the law of forgiveness love and mercy mercy the gracious echo of that sweet word thrill through infinite space the gate of heaven open and the soul hover toward the realm of endless bliss but the flood of light that stream forth from within be so dazzlingly bright so transcendently white and pure that the soul shrink back as from a two-edged sword and the hymn and harp-tone of angel mingle in such exquisite celestial harmony as the earthly mind have not power either to conceive or to endure and the soul tremble and bow itself deeper and deeper and the heavenly light penetrate it through and through and it feel to the quick as it have never truly feel before the burden of its own pride cruelty and sin what i have do of good in the world that do i because i could not otherwise but the evil that i do -- that be of myself the confession be wring from he more and more the man feel dazzled and overpower by the pure light of heaven he seem fall into a measureless abyss the abyss of he own nakedness and unworthiness shrink into himself humble cast out unripe for the kingdom of heaven shuddering at the thought of the just and holy god -- hardly dare he to gasp out mercy and the face of the angel at the portal be turn toward he in soften pity mercy be for they who implore it not claim it there be mercy also for thee turn thee child of man turn thee back the way thou camest to thy clayey tabernacle in pity be it give thee to dwell in dust yet a little while be no longer righteous in thine own eye copy he who with patience endure the contradiction of sinner strive and pray that thou mayest become poor in spirit and so mayest thou yet inherit the kingdom holy loving glorious forever shalt thou be o err human spirit -- thus ring the chorus of angel and again overpower by those transcendent melody dazzle and blind by that excess of purest light the soul again shrink back into itself it seem to be fall a infinite depth the celestial music grow fainter and fainter till common earthly sight and sound dispel the vision the ray of the early morning sun fall full on he face the cheerful crow of the vigilant cock call the sleeper up to pray inexpressibly humble yet thankful he arise and kneel beside he bed thou who hast show I to myself help I now that i may not only do justly but love mercy and walk humbly with my god thou who hast convict I of sin now purify I strengthen I that though ever unworthy of thy presence i may yet support by thy love dare to ascend into thine ever lasting light the vision be he be the lesson the prayer also ours the old gravestone by han christian andersen in one of we small trading town at that time of year when folk say the evening grow long a whole family be assemble together the air be still mild and warm the lamp be light the long curtain hang down before the window and bright moonlight prevail without they be talk about a big old stone that lay down in the yard close by the kitchen door where the servant often place the kitchen utensil after they have be clean to dry in the sun and where the child be fond of play it be in fact a old gravestone yes say the master of the house i believe it come from the old ruin convent chapel pulpit and gravestone with all they epitaph be sell my late father buy several of these the other be break into paving-stone but this one be leave unused lie in the yard it be easy to know it for a gravestone say the eldest of the child you can still see on it a mountain-side and a piece of a angel but the inscription be almost quite worn out except the name ` preben ' and a capital 's ' a little further on and underneath it ` martha ' but it be impossible to make out any more and that you can only read after if have be rain or when we have wash it why then it must be the gravestone of preben swan and he wife exclaim a old man who by he age might appear the grandfather of everybody in the room to be sure they be among the last that be bury in the old convent churchyard -- the grand old couple everybody know they everybody love they they be like king and queen in the town folk say they have more than a barrelful of gold and yet they go about simply clothe in the coarsest cloth only they linen be always of dazzling whiteness yes that be a charming old pair preben and martha one be always so glad to see they sit together on the bench at the top of they stone staircase under the old lime-tree 's shade they be so good to the poor they feast they clothe they and there be good sense and a true christian spirit in all they benevolence the wife die first i remember the day quite well i be then a little boy and go with my father to see old preben : the old man be so grieved he cry like a child the corpse still lay in she bedroom close to the chamber where we sit she look as if she have just fall asleep and the old man tell my father how he should now be so lonely and how many year they have spend together and how they have first make acquaintance and come to love each other as i say before i be a child but it move I strangely to listen to the old man and watch how he grow more animated as he go on speak a faint color come into he cheek as he talk of they youthful day how pretty she have be how many little innocent trick he have play in order to meet she and when he speak of he wedding-day he eye quite sparkle he seem to be live he happy time over again -- and all the while she be lie dead in the next chamber a old lady and he be a old man -- ah how time pass i be a child then and now i be as old as preben swan yes time and change come to all i remember as well as possible the funeral-day and preben swan follow the coffin they have have they gravestone carve with name and inscription all except the date of they death some year before that same evening the stone be take to the grave and put into its place the next year the grave have to be reopen and old preben rejoin he wife they do not turn out to be so rich as people have fancy and what they do leave go to distant relation very far off the old wooden house with the bench at the top of the high stone staircase under the lime-tree be order to be pull down for it be too ruinous to stand any longer and afterward when the convent chapel and cemetery be destroy the gravestone of preben and martha be sell like other to whomsoever choose to buy it and so now it lie in the yard for the little one to roll over and to make a shelf for the kitchen pot and pan and the paved street now cover the resting-place of old preben and he wife and nobody think of they any more and the old man who relate all this shake he head sadly forget all thing be forget and the rest begin to speak of other matter but the youngest boy a child with large grave eye creep up on a chair behind the curtain and look out into the yard where the moon shine brightly on the big stone that before have seem to he flat and uninteresting enough but now have become to he like a page of a large-sized story-book for all that the boy have hear concern preben and he wife the stone seem to contain within it and he look first at the stone and then at the brilliant moon which look to he like a bright kind face look down through the pure still air upon the earth forget all shall be forget these word come to he ear from the room but at that very moment a invisible angel kiss the boy 's forehead and softly whisper keep the seed carefully keep it till the time for ripen through thee child as thou art shall the half-erased inscription the crumble gravestone stand out in clear legible character for generation to come through thee shall the old couple again walk arm-in-arm through the ancient gateway and sit with smile face on the bench under the lime tree greet rich and poor the good and the beautiful perish never they live eternally in tale and song good-for-nothing by han christian andersen the sheriff stand at the open window he

old friend look up to heaven let the world say she be good-for-nothing we lord in he heavenly kingdom will not say so in the uttermost part of the sea by han christian andersen some large ship be send up toward the north pole for the purpose of discover the boundary of land and sea and of try how far man could make they way a year and a day have elapse amid mist and ice have they with great difficulty steer further and further the winter have now begin the sun have set one long night would continue during many many week one unbroken plain of ice spread around they the ship be all fast moor to it the snow lay about in heap and have even shape itself into cubiform house some as big as we barrow some only just large enough for two or three man to find shelter within darkness they could not complain of for the northern light -- nature 's firework -- now red now blue flash unceasingly and the snow glisten so brightly at time when it be brightest come troops of the native strange-looking figure clothe in hairy skin and with sledge make out of hard fragment of ice they bring skin to exchange which the sailor be only too glad to use as warm carpet inside they snow house and as bed whereon they could rest under they snowy tent while outside prevail a intensity of cold such as we never experience during we severest winter but the sailor remember that at home it be still autumn and they think of the warm sunbeam and the leaf still cling to the tree in varied glory of crimson and gold they watch tell they it be evening and time for rest and in one of the snow house two sailor have already lie down to sleep the youngest of these two have with he he best home-treasure the bible that he grandmother have give he at parting every night it lay under he pillow he have know its contents from childhood and every day he read a portion and often as he lay on he couch he recall to mind those holy word of comfort if i should take the wing of the morning and remain in the uttermost part of the sea even there should thy hand lead I and thy right hand should hold I these sublime word of faith be on he lip as he close he eye when sleep come to he and dream with sleep -- busy swift-winged dream prove that though the body may rest the soul must ever be awake first he seem to hear the melody of song dear to he in he home a mild summer breeze seem to breathe upon he and a light shone upon he couch as though the snowy dome above he have become transparent he lift he head and behold the dazzling white light be not the white of a snow wall it come from the large wing of a angel stoop over he a angel with eye beam with love the angel 's form seem to spring from the page of the bible as from the pitcher of a lily-blossom he extend he arm and lo the narrow wall of the snow-hut sink back like a mist melting before the daylight once again the green meadow and autumnal-tinted wood of the sailor 's home lay around he bath in quiet sunshine the stork 's nest be empty but the apple still cling to the wild apple-tree though leaf have fall the red hip glisten and the blackbird whistle in the little green cage that hang in the lowly window of he childhood 's home the blackbird whistle the tune he have teach he and the old grandmother wound chickweed about the bar of the cage as she grandson have be wont to do and the smith 's pretty young daughter stand draw water from the well and as she nod to the grandmother the latter beckon to she and hold up a letter to show she a letter that have come that morning from the cold northern land from the north pole itself where the old woman 's grandson now be -- safe under god 's protect hand and the two woman old and young laugh and weep by turn -- and he the while the young sailor whose body be sleep amid ice and snow he spirit roaming in the world of dream under the angel 's wing see and hear it all and laugh and weep with they and from the letter these word be read aloud even in the uttermost part of the sea he right hand shall hold I fast : and a sweet solemn music be waft round he and the angel droop he wing like a soft protect veil they fall closer over the sleeper the dream be end all be darkness in the little snow-hut but the bible lay under the sailor 's head faith and hope abode in he heart god be with he and he home be with he even in the uttermost part of the sea something by han christian andersen i will be something declare the eldest of five brother i will be of use in the world be it ever so humble a position that i may hold let I be but useful and that will be something i will make brick folk can not do without they so i shall at least do something something very little though reply the second brother why it be as good as nothing it be work that might be do by a machine better be a mason as i intend to be then one belong to a guild become a citizen have a banner of one 's own nay if all thing go well i may become a master and have apprentice and workman under I that will be something it will be nothing at all then i can tell you that rejoin the third think how many different rank there be in a town far above that of a master-mason you may be a honest sort of a man but you will never be a gentleman gentle and simple those be the two grand division and you will always be one of the ` simple ' well i know better than that i will be a architect i will be one of the thinker the artist i will raise myself to the aristocracy of intellect i may have to begin from the very lowest grade i may begin as a carpenter 's boy and run about with a paper-cap on my head to fetch ale for the workman i may not enjoy it but i shall try to imagine it be only a masquerade ` to-morrow ' i shall say ' i will go my own way and other shall not come near I ' yes i shall go to the academy learn to draw and be call a architect that will be something i may get a title perhaps and i shall build and build as other before I have do yes that will be something but it be something that i care nothing about say the fourth i should not care to go on on in the beaten track to be a mere copyist i will be a genius cleverer than all of you put together i will create a new style provide idea for building suit to the climate and material of we country suit to we national character and the requirement of the age but suppose the climate and the material do not agree suggest the fifth how will you get on then if they will not co-operate as for we national character to be follow out that in architecture will be sheer affectation and the requirement of modern civilization will drive you perfectly mad i see you will none of you ever be anything though of course you will not believe I but do as you please i shall not be like you i shall reason over what you execute there be something ridiculous in everything i shall find it out show you yeur fault -- that will be something and he keep he word and folk say of this fifth brother there be something in he certainly he have plenty of brain but he do nothing but he be content he be something but what become of the five brother we will hear the whole the eldest brother the brickmaker find that every brick he turn out whole yield he a tiny copper coin -- only copper -- but a great many of these small coin add together could be convert into a bright silver dollar and through the power of this wheresoever he knock whether at baker 's butcher 's or tailor 's the door fly open and he receive what he want such be the virtue of he brick some of course get break before they be finish but a use be find even for these for up by the trench would poor mother margaret fain build herself a little house if she might she take all the broken brick ay and she get a few whole one besides for a good heart have the eldest brother though only a brickmaker the poor thing build she house with she own hand it be very narrow its one window be all on one side the door be too low and the thatch on the roof might have be lay on better but it give she shelter and a home and could be see far over the sea which sometimes burst over the trench in its might and sprinkle a salt shower over the little house which keep its place there year after he who make the brick be dead and go as for the second brother he learn to build after another fashion as he have resolve when he be out of he apprenticeship he buckle on he knapsack and start singing as he go on he travels he come home again and become a master in he native town he build house after house a whole street of house there they stand look well and be a credit to the town and these house soon build he a little house for himself how ask the house and they will give you no answer but the people will answer you and say why of course the street build he he house it be small enough and have only a clay floor but when he and he bride dance over it the floor grow as smooth as if it have be polish and from every stone in the wall spring a flower that look as gay as the costliest tapestry it be a pretty house and a happy wed pair the banner of the mason ' guild wave outside and workman and apprentice shout hurra yes that be something and at last he die -- that too be something next come the architect the third brother he begin as a carpenter 's apprentice and run about the town on errand wear a paper-cap but he study industriously at the academy and rise steadily upward if the street full of house have build a house for he brother the mason the street take its name from the architect the handsomest house in the whole street be he -- that be something and he be something he child be gentleman and could boast of they birth and when he die he widow be a widow of condition -- that be something -- and he name stand on the corner of the street and be in everybody 's lip -- that be something too now for the genius the fourth brother who want to invent something new something original somehow the ground give way beneath he foot he fall and break he neck but he have a splendid funeral with music and banner and flowery paragraph in the newspaper and three eulogium be pronounce over he each longer than the last and this would have pleased he mightily for he love speechifying of all thing a monument be erect over he grave only one story high -- but that be something so now he be dead as well as he three elder brother the youngest the critic outlive they all and that be as it should be for thus he have the last word which to he be a matter of the greatest importance he have plenty of brain folk say now he hour have strike he die and he soul seek the gate of heaven there it stand side by side with another soul -- old mother margaret from the trench it be for the sake of contrast i suppose that i and this miserable soul should wait here together think the critic well now who be you my good woman he inquire and the old woman reply with as much respect as though st peter himself be address she -- in fact she take he for st peter he give himself such grand air -- i be a poor old soul i have no family i be only old margaret from the house near the trench well and what have you do down below i have do as good as nothing in the world nothing whatever it will be mercy indeed if such as i be suffer to pass through this gate and how do you leave the world inquire the critic carelessly he must talk about something it weary he to stand there wait well i can hardly tell how i leave it i have be sickly enough during these last few year and could not well bear to creep out of bed at all during the cold weather it have be a severe winter but now that be all past for a few day as you highness must know the wind be quite still but it be bitterly cold the ice lay over the water as far as one could see all the people in the town be out on the ice there be dancing and music and feasting and sledge-racing i fancy i could hear something of it all as i lay in my poor little chamber and when it be get toward evening the moon be up but be not yet very bright i look from my bed through the window and i see how there rise up over the sea a strange white cloud i lay and watch it watch the black dot in it which grow bigger and bigger and then i know what it forebode that sign be not often see but i be old and experienced i know it and i shiver with horror twice before in my life have i see that sign and i know that there would be a terrible storm and a spring flood it would burst over the poor thing on the ice who be drinking and dancing and merry-making young and old the whole town be out on the ice who be to warn they if no one see it or no one know what i know i feel so terrify i feel all alive as i have not feel for year i get out of bed force the window open i could see the folk running and dancing over the ice i could see the gay-colored flag i could hear the boy shout ` hurra ' and the girl and lad a-sing all be so merry and all the time the white cloud with its black speck rise higher and higher i scream as loud as i could but no one hear I i be too far off soon would the storm break loose the ice would break in piece and all that crowd would sink and drown hear I they could not get out to they i could not what be to be do then we lord send I a good thought i could set fire to my bed better let my house be burn to the ground than that so many should miserably perish so i kindle a light i see the red flame mount up i get out at the door but then i fall down i lay there i could not get up again but the flame burst out through the window and over the roof they see it down below and they all run as fast as they could to help I the poor old crone they believe would be burn there be not one who do not come to help I i hear they come and i hear too such a rustling in the air and then a thunder as of heavy cannon-shot for the spring-flood be loosen the ice and it all break up but the folk be all come off it to the trench where the spark be fly about I i have they all safe but i could not bear the cold and the fright and that be how i have come up here can the gate of heaven be open to such a poor old creature as i i have no house now at the trench where can i go if they refuse I here then the gate open and the angel bid poor margaret enter as she pass the threshold she drop a blade of straw -- straw from she bed -- that bed which she have set alight to save the people on the ice and lo it have change into gold dazzling gold yet flexible withal and twist into various form look that be what yonder poor woman bring say the angel but what dost thou bring truly i know well that thou hast do nothing not even make brick it be a pity thou canst not go back again to fetch at least one brick -- not that it be good for anything when it be make no but because anything the very least do with a good will be something but thou mayst not go back and i can do nothing for thee then poor margaret plead for he thus : he brother give I all the brick and broken bit wherewith i build my poor little house -- that be a great kindness toward a poor old soul like I may not all those bit and fragment put together be reckon as one brick for he it will be a act of mercy he need it and this be the home of mercy to thy brother whom thou didst despise say the angel to he whose call in respect of worldly honor be the lowest shalt thou owe this mite of heavenly coin thou shalt not be send away thou shalt have leave to stand here without and think over thy manner of life down below but within thou canst not enter until thou hast do something that be good -- something i fancy i could have express that better think the critic but he do not say it aloud and that be already -- something the jewish girl by han christian andersen there be in the charity-school among the other child a little jewish girl so clever and good the best in fact of they all but one of the lesson she could not attend -- the one when religion be teach for this be a christian school then she hold she geography book before she to learn from it or she do she sum but the lesson be quickly learn the sum be soon do the book might be there open before she but she do not read she be listen and the teacher soon notice that she be attend more intently even than any of the rest read you book the teacher urge mildly and earnestly but she look at he with she black sparkling eye and when he put question to she also she know more than all the other she have listen understand and keep he word she father be a poor honest man and when first he bring she to the school he have make the stipulation that she should not be teach the christian faith to let she go away during the scripture lesson might however have give offence and raise thought of various kind in the mind of the other child and so she stay but this could not go on any longer the teacher go to she father and tell he that either he must take he daughter away from the school or consent to she become a christian i can not bear to see those burn eye that yearning that thirst of the soul as it be after the word of the gospel say the teacher and the father burst into tear i know but little myself of we own religion but she mother be a daughter of israel of strong and firm faith and on she die bed i make a vow that we child should never receive christian baptism that vow i must keep it be to I as a convenant with god and the little jewish girl be take away from the school of the christian year roll by in one of the smallest town of jutland serve as maid in a plain burgher 's house a poor girl of the mosaic faith this be sarah she hair be black as ebony she eye dark and yet brilliant and full of light such as you see among the daughter of the east and the expression in the countenance of the grown-up girl be still that of the child who sit on the school-room bench listen with thoughtful and wistful eye each Sunday sound from the church the peal of the organ to the song of the congregation and the tone float over the street into the house where the jewish girl attend to she work diligent and faithful in she call remember the sabbath day to keep it holy this be she law but she sabbath be a day of labor to the christian and only in she heart could she keep it holy and that be not enough for she but when the thought arise in she soul what matter it before god about day and hour and on the Sunday of the christian she hour of devotion remain undisturbed if then the organ 's peal and the psalm-tune reach over to she where she stand in the kitchen even this become a quiet and consecrated spot she would read then the treasure and peculiar property of she people the old testament and this alone for she keep deep in she heart what she father have tell the teacher and herself when she be take from the school -- the vow make to she die mother that sarah should not be baptize not forsake the faith of she father the new testament be and should remain forever a seal book to she and yet she know much of it it shine to she through the recollection of childhood one evening she sit in a corner of the parlor and hear she master reading aloud she might listen she think for this be not the gospel nay 'twa out of a old story-book he read : she might stay and he read of a hungarian knight take captive by a turkish pasha who have he yoke with ox to the plow and he be drive with lash and have to suffer pain and ignominy beyond endurance but at home the knight 's wife sell all she jewel and mortgage castle and land and he friend contribute large sum for enormous be the ransom demand still it be raise and he be deliver out of thraldom and disgrace sick and suffer he come to he home but soon resound far and near the summons to war against the foe of christianity the sick man hear the call and have neither peace nor rest any longer he be place on he charger the blood come again to he cheek he strength seem to return and he ride forth to victory the very pasha who have he yoke to the plow and make he suffer pain and scorn become he captive he be carry home to the castle dungeon but before he first hour there have elapse the knight come and ask the prisoner what dost thou think awaiteth thee i know say the turk retribution yes the christian 's retribution say the knight christ teach we to forgive we enemy to love we fellow-men god be love depart in peace to thy home and thy dear one and be gentle and good to those who suffer then the prisoner burst into tear how could i believe such a thing could be possible torment and suffering i look forward to as a certainty and i take poison which must kill I within a few hour i shall die there be no remedy but before i die make know to I the faith that embrace such a amount of love and mercy it be great and divine in it let I die let I die a christian and he prayer be grant this be the legend the history which be read they all listen to it with attention but deepest sink it into the heart of she who sit alone in the corner -- the servant maid -- sarah the jewess heavy tear stand in she black sparkling eye while she sit here as once on the school-bench and feel the greatness of the gospel the tear roll down she cheek let not my child become a christian be the mother 's last word on she die bed and they ring through she soul with those of the law honor thy father and thy mother still i have not be baptize they call I ` the jewess ' the neighbor ' boy do so hoot at I last Sunday as i stand outside the open church door and look in where the altar-light burn and the congregation sing ever since my school-day up to this hour -- even though i have try to close my eye against it -- a power from christianity have like a sunbeam shine into my heart but my mother i will not give thee sorrow in thy grave i will not betray the vow my father make to thee i will not read the christian 's bible have not i the god of my father on he let I rest my head and year roll by the husband die the wife be leave behind in hard plight now she could no longer afford to have a maid but sarah do not forsake the widow she become she help in distress and keep the household together she work till late in the night and get bread for the house by the labor of she hand there be no near relative to help a family where the mother grow weaker each day linger for month on a bed of sickness sarah gentle and pious watch nurse and work and become the blessing of the poor home there lie the bible say the invalid read to I this wearisome evening i sadly want to hear god 's word and sarah bow she head she fold she hand round the bible which she open and read aloud to the sick woman now and again the tear well forth but she eye shine clearer even as the darkness clear from she soul mother thy child shall not receive the baptism of the christian shall not be name in they communion in this we will be unite here on earth but above this there be -- be a greater unity -- even in god ` he go with we beyond the grave ' ` it be he who pour water upon he that be thirsty and flood upon the dry ground ' i understand it i do not know myself how i come to it through he it be -- in he -- christ and she tremble as she name the holy name a baptism of fire stream through she stronger than she frame could bear and she bent down more powerless even than she by whom she watch poor sarah they say she be wear out with labor and watch they take she to the hospital for the poor there she die thence she be bear to she grave not to the christian ' graveyard that be not the place for the jewish girl : no outside by the wall she grave be dig and god 's sun which shine upon the grave of the christian shine also upon that of the jewish girl and the hymn which be sing by the grave of the christian resound by she grave beyond the wall thither too reach the promise : there be resurrection in christ in he the savior who say to he disciple ` john truly baptize with water but ye shall be baptize with the holy ghost ' the story of a mother by han christian andersen a mother sit by she little child : she be very sorrowful and fear that it would die its little face be pale and its eye be close the child draw its breath with difficulty and sometimes so deeply as if it be sigh and then the mother look more sorrowfully than before on the little creature then there be a knock at the door and a poor old man come in wrap up in something that look like a great horse-cloth for that keep warm and he require it for it be cold winter without everything be cover with ice and snow and the wind blow so sharply that it cut one 's face and as the old man tremble with cold and the child be quiet for a moment the mother go and put some beer on the stove in a little pot to warm it for he the old man sit down and rock the cradle and the mother seat herself on a old chair by he look at she sick child that draw its breath so painfully and seize the little hand you think i shall keep it do you not she ask the good god will not take it from I and the old man -- he be _ death _ -- nod in such a strange way that it might just as well mean _ yes _ as _ no _ and the mother cast down she eye and tear roll down she cheek she head become heavy : for three day and three night she have not close she eye and now she sleep but only for a minute then she start up and shiver with cold what be that she ask and look round on all side but the old man be go and she little child be go he have take it with he and there in the corner the old clock be hum and whir the heavy leaden weight run down to the floor -- plump -- and the clock stop but the poor mother rush out of the house cry for she child out in the snow sit a woman in long black garment and she say death have be with you in you room i see he hasten away with you child : he stride faster than the wind and never bring back what he have take away only tell I which way he have go say the mother tell I the way and i will find he i know he say the woman in the black garment but before i tell you you must sing I all the song that you have sing to you child i love those song i have hear they before i be night and i see you tear when you sing they i will sing they all all say the mother but do not detain I that i may overtake he and find my child but night sit dumb and still then the mother wring she hand and sing and weep and there be many song but yet more tear and then night say go to the right into the dark fir wood for i see death take that path with you little child deep in the forest there be a cross road and she do not know which way to take there stand a blackthorn bush with not a leaf nor a blossom upon it for it be in the cold winter time and icicle hang from the twig have you not see death go by with my little child yes reply the bush but i shall not tell you which way he go unless you warm I on you bosom i be freezing to death here i be turn to ice and she press the blackthorn bush to she bosom quite close that it might be well warm and the thorn pierce into she flesh and she blood ooze out in great drop but the blackthorn shoot out fresh green leaf and blossom in the dark winter night : so warm be the heart of a sorrowing mother and the blackthorn bush tell she the way that she should go then she come to a great lake on which there be neither ship nor boat the lake be not freeze enough to carry she nor sufficiently open to allow she to wade through and yet she must cross it if she be to find she child then she lay herself down to drink the lake and that be impossible for any one to do but the sorrowing mother think that perhaps a miracle might be work no that can never succeed say the lake let we rather see how we can agree i be fond of collect pearl and you eye be the two clearest i have ever see : if you will weep they out into I i will carry you over into the great greenhouse where death life and cultivate flower and tree each of these be a human life oh what would i not give to get my child say the afflict mother and she weep yet more and she eye fall into the depths of the lake and become two costly pearl but the lake lift she up as if she sit in a swing and she be waft to the opposite shore where stand a wonderful house mile in length one could not tell if it be a mountain contain forest and cave or a place that have be build but the poor mother could not see it for she have weep she eye out where shall i find death who go away with my little child she ask he have not arrive here yet say a old gray-haired woman who be go about and watch the hothouse of death how have you find you way here and who help you the good god have help I she reply he be merciful and you will be merciful too where shall i find my little child i do not know it say the old woman and you can not see many flower and tree have fade this night and death will soon come and transplant they you know very well that every human being have he tree of life or he flower of life just as each be arrange they look like other plant but they heart beat child 's heart can beat too think of this perhaps you may recognize the beating of you child 's heart but what will you give I if i tell you what more you must do i have nothing more to give say the afflict mother but i will go for you to the end of the earth i have nothing for you to do there say the old woman but you can give I you long black hair you must know yourself that it be beautiful and it please I you can take my white hair for it and that be always something do you ask for nothing more ask she i will give you that gladly and she give she beautiful hair and receive in exchange the old woman 's white hair and then they go into the great hothouse of death where flower and tree be grow marvellously intertwine there stand the fine hyacinth under glass bell some quite fresh other somewhat sickly water snake be twine about they and black crab cling tightly to the stalk there stand gallant palm-tree oak and plantain and parsley and bloom thyme each tree and flower have its name each be a human life : the people be still alive one in china another in greenland scatter about in the world there be great tree thrust into little pot so that they stand quite crowded and be nearly burst the pot there be also many a little weakly flower in rich earth with moss round about it care for and tend but the sorrowful mother bent down over all the smallest plant and hear the human heart beating in each and out of million she recognize that of she child that be it she cry and stretch out she hand over a little crocus flower which hang down quite sick and pale do not touch the flower say the old dame but place yourself here and when death come -- i expect he every minute -- then do not let he pull up the plant but threaten he that you will do the same to the other plant then he 'll be frighten he have to account for they all not one may be pull up till he receive commission from heaven and all at once there be a icy cold rush through the hall and the blind mother feel that death be arrive how do you find you way hither say he how have you be able to come quicker than i i be a mother she answer and death stretch out he long hand toward the little delicate flower but she keep she hand tight about it and hold it fast and yet she be full of anxious care lest he should touch one of the leaf then death breathe upon she hand and she feel that he breath be colder than the icy wind and she hand sink down powerless you can do nothing against I say death but the merciful god can she reply i only do what he command say death i be he gardener i take all he tree and flower and transplant they into the great paradise garden in the unknown land but how they will flourish there and how it be there i may not tell you give I back my child say the mother and she implore and weep all at once she grasp two pretty flower with she two hand and call to death i 'll tear off all you flower for i be in despair do not touch they say death you say you be so unhappy and now you would make another mother just as unhappy another mother say the poor woman and she let the flower go there be you eye for you say death i have fish they up out of the lake they gleam up quite brightly i do not know that they be yours take they back -- they be clearer now than before -- and then look down into the deep well close by i will tell you the name of the two flower you want to pull up and you will see what you be about to frustrate and destroy and she look down into the well and it be a happiness to see how one of they become a blessing to the world how much joy and gladness she diffuse around she and the woman look at the life of the other and it be make up of care and poverty misery and woe both be the will of god say death which of they be the flower of misfortune and which the bless one she ask that i may not tell you answer death but this much you shall hear that one of these two flower be that of you child it be the fate of you child that you see -- the future of you own child then the mother scream aloud for terror which of they belong to my child tell I that release the innocent child let my child free from all that misery rather carry it away carry it into god 's kingdom forget my tear forget my entreaty and all that i have do i do not understand you say death will you have you child back or shall i carry it to that place that you know not then the mother wring she hand and fall on she knee and pray to the good god hear I not when i pray against thy will which be at all time the best hear I not hear I not and she let she head sink down on she bosom and death go away with she child into the unknown land the little match girl by han christian andersen it be terribly cold it snow and be already almost dark and evening come on the last evening of the year in the cold and gloom a poor little girl barehead and barefoot be walk through the street when she leave she own house she certainly have have slipper on but of what use be they they be very big slipper and she mother have use they till then so big be they the little maid lose they as she slip across the road where two carriage be rattle by terribly fast one slipper be not to be find again and a boy have seize the other and run away with it he think he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he have child of he own so now the little girl go with she little naked foot which be quite red and blue with the cold in a old apron she carry a number of match and a bundle of they in she hand no one have buy anything of she all day and no one have give she a farthing shiver with cold and hunger she creep along a picture of misery poor little girl the snowflake cover she long fair hair which fall in pretty curl over she neck but she do not think of that now in all the window light be shine and there be a glorious smell of roast goose for it be new year 's eve yes she think of that in a corner form by two house one of which project beyond the other she sit down cower she have draw up she little foot but she be still colder and she do not dare to go home for she have sell no match and do not bring a farthing of money from she father she would certainly receive a beating and besides it be cold at home for they have nothing over they but a roof through which the wind whistle though the largest rent have be stop with straw and rag she little hand be almost benumb with the cold ah a match might do she good if she could only draw one from the bundle and rub it against the wall and warm she hand at it she draw one out r-r-atch how it splutter and burn it be a warm bright flame like a little candle when she hold she hand over it it be a wonderful little light it really seem to the little girl as if she sit before a great polished stove with bright brass foot and a brass cover how the fire burn how comfortable it be but the little flame go out the stove vanish and she have only the remains of the burn match in she hand a second be rub against the wall it burn up and when the light fall upon the wall it become transparent like a thin veil and she could see through it into the room on the table a snow-white cloth be spread upon it stand a shine dinner service the roast goose smoke gloriously stuff with apple and dry plum and what be still more splendid to behold the goose hop down from the dish and waddle along the floor with a knife and fork in its breast to the little girl then the match go out and only the thick damp cold wall be before she she light another match then she be sit under a beautiful christmas tree it be greater and more ornamented than the one she have see through the glass door at the rich merchant 's thousand of candle burn upon the green branch and color picture like those in the print shop look down upon they the little girl stretch forth she hand toward they then the match go out the christmas light mount higher she see they now as star in the sky : one of they fall down form a long line of fire now some one be die think the little girl for she old grandmother the only person who have love she and who be now dead have tell she that when a star fall down a soul mount up to god she rub another match against the wall it become bright again and in the brightness the old grandmother stand clear and shine mild and lovely grandmother cry the child o take I with you i know you

grandmother fast and the match burn with such a glow that it become brighter than in the middle of the day grandmother have never be so large or so beautiful she take the little girl in she arm and both fly in brightness and joy above the earth very very high and up there be neither cold nor hunger nor care -- they be with god but in the corner lean against the wall sit the poor girl with red cheek and smile mouth freeze to death on the last evening of the old year the new year 's sun rise upon a little corpse the child sit there stiff and cold with the match of which one bundle be burn
