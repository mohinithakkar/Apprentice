produce by riikka talonpoika ginny brewer and pg distribute proofreader play-making _ a manual of craftsmanship _ by william archer 1912 prefatory note this book be to all intent and purpose entirely new no considerable portion of it have already appear although here and there short passage and phrase from article of bygone year be embedded -- indistinguishably i hope -- in the text i have try wherever it be possible to select my example from publish play which the student may read for himself and so check my observation one reason among other which lead I to go to shakespeare and ibsen for so many of my illustration be that they be the most generally accessible of playwright if the reader should feel that i have be over lavish in the use of footnote i have two excuse to allege the first be that more than half of the follow chapter be write on shipboard and in place where i have scarcely any book to refer to so that a great deal have to be leave to subsequent enquiry and revision the second be that several of my friend dramatist and other have be kind enough to read my manuscript and to suggest valuable afterthought london _ January _ 1912 to brander matthew guide philosopher and

prologue _ chapter i _ introductory there be no rule for write a play it be easy indeed to lay down negative recommendation -- to instruct the beginner how _ not _ to do it but most of these do n't be rather obvious and those which be not obvious be apt to be questionable it be certain for instance that if you want you play to be act anywhere else than in china you must not plan it in sixteen act of a hour apiece but where be the tyro who need a text-book to tell he that on the other hand most theorist of to-day would make it a axiom that you must not let you character narrate they circumstance or expound they motive in speech address either directly to the audience or ostensibly to they solitary self but when we remember that of all dramatic opening there be none finer than that which show richard plantagenet limp down the empty stage to say -- now be the winter of we discontent make glorious summer by this sun of york and all the cloud that lour would upon we house in the deep bosom of the ocean bury -- we feel that the axiom require large qualification there be no absolute rule in fact except such as be dictate by the plainest common sense aristotle himself do not so much dogmatize as analyze classify and generalize from the practice of the attic dramatist he say you have better rather than you must it be horace in a age of deep dramatic decadence who re-state the pseudo-aristotelian formula of the alexandrian as though they be unassailable dogma of art how come it then that there be a constant demand for text-book of the art and craft of drama how come it that so many people -- and i among the number -- who could not write a play to save they life be eager to tell other how to do so and stranger still how come it that so many people be willing to sit at the foot of these instructor it be not so with the novel popular as be that form of literature guide to novel-writing if they exist at all be comparatively rare why be people possess with the idea that the art of dramatic fiction differ from that of narrative fiction in that it can and must be teach the reason be clear and be so far valid as to excuse if not to justify such work as the present the novel as soon as it be legibly write exist for what it be worth the page of black and white be the sole intermediary between the creative and the perceptive brain even the act of printing merely widen the possible appeal : it do not alter its nature but the drama before it can make its proper appeal at all must be run through a highly complex piece of mechanism -- the theater -- the precise condition of which be to most beginner a fascinating mystery while they feel a strong inward conviction of they ability to master it they be possess with a idea often exaggerated and superstitious of its technical complexity have as a rule little or no opportunity of closely examine or experiment with it they be eager to read it up as they might any other machine that be the case of the average aspirant who have neither the instinct of the theater fully develop in he blood nor such a congenital lack of that instinct as to be wholly inapprehensive of any technical difficulty or problem the intelligent novice standing between these extreme tend as a rule to overrate the efficacy of theoretical instruction and to expect of analytic criticism more than it have to give there be thus a fine opening for pedantry on the one side and quackery on the other to rush in the pedant in this context be he who construct a set of rule from metaphysical or psychological first principle and profess to bring down a dramatic decalogue from the sinaus of some lecture-room in the university of weissnichtwo the quack on the other hand be he who generalize from the worst practice of the most vulgar theatrical journeyman and have no higher ambition than to interpret the oracle of the box-office if he succeed in so do he function would not be wholly despicable but as he be generally devoid of insight and as moreover the oracle of the box-office vary from season to season if not from month to month he lucubration be about as valuable as those of zadkiel or old moore -lrb- 1 -rrb- what then be the excuse for such a discussion as be here attempt have admit that there be no rule for dramatic composition and that the quest of such rule be apt to result either in pedantry or quackery why should i myself set forth upon so fruitless and foolhardy a enterprise it be precisely because i be alive to its danger that i have some hope of avoid they rule there be none but it do not follow that some of the thousand who be fascinate by the art of the playwright may not profit by have they attention call in a plain and practical way to some of its problem and possibility i have myself feel the need of some such handbook when would-be dramatist have come to I for advice and guidance it be easy to name excellent treatise on the drama but the aim of such book be to guide the judgment of the critic rather than the creative impulse of the playwright there be also valuable collection of dramatic criticism but any practical hint that they may contain be scatter and unsystematic on the other hand the advice one be apt to give to beginner -- go to the theater study its condition and mechanism for yourself -- be in fact of very doubtful value it might in many case be wiser to warn the aspirant to keep himself unspotted from the playhouse to send he there be to imperil on the one hand he originality of vision on the other he individuality of method he may fall under the influence of some great master and see life only through he eye or he may become so habituate to the current trick of the theatrical trade as to lose all sense of they conventionality and falsity and find himself in the end better fit to write what i have call a quack handbook than a living play it would be ridiculous of course to urge a aspirant positively to avoid the theater but the common advice to steep himself in it be beset with danger it may be ask why if i have any guidance and help to give i do not take it myself and write play instead of instruct other in the art this be a variant of a ancient and fallacious jibe against criticism in general it be quite true that almost all critic who be worth they salt be stickit artist assuredly if i have the power i should write play instead of write about they but one may have a great love for a art and some insight into its principle and method without the innate faculty require for actual production on the other hand there be nothing to show that if i be a creative artist i should be a good mentor for beginner a accomplished painter may be the best teacher of painter but a accomplished dramatist be scarcely the best guide for dramatist he can not analyze he own practice and discriminate between that in it which be of universal validity and that which may be good for he but would be bad for any one else if he happen to be a great man he would inevitably even if unconsciously seek to impose upon he disciple he individual attitude towards life if he be a lesser man he would teach they only he trick but dramatist do not as a matter of fact take pupil or write handbook -lrb- 2 -rrb- when they expound they principle of art it be generally in answer to or in anticipation of criticism -- with a view in short not to help other but to defend themselves if beginner then be to find any systematic guidance they must turn to the critic not to the dramatist and no person of common sense hold it a reproach to a critic to tell he that he be a stickit playwright if question be worth discuss at all they be worth discuss gravely when in the follow page i be find treat with all solemnity matter of apparently trivial detail i beg the reader to believe that very possibly i do not in my heart overrate they importance one thing be certain and must be emphasize from the outset : namely that if any part of the dramatist 's art can be teach it be only a comparatively mechanical and formal part -- the art of structure one may learn how to tell a story in good dramatic form : how to develop and marshal it in such a way as best to seize and retain the interest of a theatrical audience but no teaching or study can enable a man to choose or invent a good story and much less to do that which alone lend dignity to dramatic story-telling -- to observe and portray human character this be the aim and end of all serious drama and it will be apt to appear as though in the follow page this aim and end be ignore in reality it be not so if i hold comparatively mechanical question of pure craftsmanship to be worth discuss it be because i believe that only by aid of competent craftsmanship can the greatest genius enable he creation to live and breathe upon the stage the profoundest insight into human nature and destiny can not find valid expression through the medium of the theater without some understanding of the peculiar art of dramatic construction some people be bear with such a instinct for this art that a very little practice render they master of it some people be bear with a hollow in they cranium where the bump of drama ought to be but between these extreme as i say before there be many people with moderately develop and cultivable faculty and it be these who i trust may find some profit in the follow discussion -lrb- 3 -rrb- let they not forget however that the topic treat of be merely the indispensable rudiment of the art and be not for a moment to be mistake for its ultimate and incommunicable secret beethoven could not have compose the ninth symphony without a mastery of harmony and counterpoint but there be thousand of master of harmony and counterpoint who could not compose the ninth symphony the art of theatrical story-telling be necessarily relative to the audience to whom the story be to be tell one must assume a audience of a certain status and characteristic before one can rationally discuss the best method of appeal to its intelligence and its sympathy the audience i have throughout assume be draw from what may be call the ordinary educate public of london and new york it be not a ideal or a specially select audience but it be somewhat above the average of the theatre-going public that average be sadly pull down by the myriad frequenter of musical farce and absolutely worthless melodrama it be such a audience as assemble every night at say the half-dozen best theater of each city a peculiarly intellectual audience it certainly be not i gladly admit that theatrical art owe much in both country to voluntary organization of intelligent or would-be intelligent -lrb- 4 -rrb- playgoer who have combine to provide themselves with form of drama which specially interest they and do not attract the great public but i be entirely convince that the drama renounce its chief privilege and glory when it waive its claim to be a popular art and be content to address itself to coterie however high-browed shakespeare do not write for a coterie : yet he produce some work of considerable subtlety and profundity molière be popular with the ordinary parterre of he day : yet he play have endure for over two century and the end of they vitality do not seem to be in sight ibsen do not write for a coterie though special and regrettable circumstance have make he in england something of a coterie-poet in scandinavium in germany even in america he cast he spell over great audience if not through long run -lrb- which be a vice of the merely commercial theater -rrb- at any rate through frequently-repeated representation so far as i know history record no instance of a playwright fail to gain the ear of he contemporary and then be recognize and appreciate by posterity alfr de musset might perhaps be cite as a case in point but he do not write with a view to the stage and make no bid for contemporary popularity as soon as it occur to people to produce he play they be find to be delightful let no playwright then make it he boast that he can not disburden he soul within the three hour ' limit and can not produce play intelligible or endurable to any audience but a band of adept a popular audience however do not necessarily mean the mere riff-raff of the theatrical public there be a large class of playgoer both in england and america which be capable of appreciate work of a high intellectual order if only it do not ignore the fundamental condition of theatrical presentation it be a audience of this class that i have in mind throughout the follow page and i believe that a playwright who despise such a audience will do so to the detriment not only of he popularity and profit but of the artistic quality of he work some people may exclaim : why should the dramatist concern himself about he audience that may be all very well for the mere journeyman of the theater the hack who write to a actor-manager 's order -- not for the true artist he have a soul above all such petty consideration art to he be simply self-expression he write to please himself and have no thought of currying favor with a audience whether intellectual or idiotic to this i reply simply that to a artist of this way of think i have nothing to say he have a perfect right to express himself in a whole literature of so-called play which may possibly be study and even act by society organize to that laudable end but the dramatist who declare he end to be mere self-expression stultify himself in that very phrase the painter may paint the sculptor model the lyric poet sing simply to please himself -lrb- 5 -rrb- but the drama have no meaning except in relation to a audience it be a portrayal of life by means of a mechanism so devise as to bring it home to a considerable number of people assemble in a give place the public it have be well say constitute the theater the moment a playwright confines he work within the two or three hour ' limit prescribe by western custom for a theatrical performance he be currying favor with a audience that limit be impose simply by the physical endurance and power of sustained attention that can be demand of western human being assemble in a theater doubtless a author could express himself more fully and more subtly if he ignore these limitation the moment he submit to they he renounce the pretence that mere self-expression be he aim i know that there be haughty-soul who make no such submission and express themselves in drama which so far as they proportion be concerned might as well be epic poem or historical romance -lrb- 6 -rrb- to they i repeat i have nothing to say the one and only subject of the follow discussion be the best method of fitting a dramatic theme for representation before a audience assemble in a theater but this be it note do not necessarily mean write down to the audience in question it be by obey not by ignore the fundamental condition of he craft that the dramatist may hope to lead he audience upward to the highest intellectual level which he himself can attain these page in short be address to student of play-writing who sincerely desire to do sound artistic work under the condition and limitation of the actual living playhouse this do not mean of course that they ought always to be study what the public want the dramatist should give the public what he himself want -- but in such form as to make it comprehensible and interesting in a theater \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : it be against technic in this sense of the term that the hero of mr howell 's admirable novel _ the story of a play _ protest in vigorous and memorable term they talk say maxwell about a knowledge of the stage as if it be a difficult science instead of a very simple piece of mechanism whose limitation and possibility anyone may see at a glance all that they knowledge of it come to be claptrap pure and simple they think that they exit and entrance be great matter and that they must come on with such a speech and go off with another but it be not of the least importance how they come or go if they have something interesting to say or do maxwell it must be remember be speak of technic as expound by the star actor who be shilly-shallying -- as star actor will -- over the production of he play he would not in he calmer moment deny that it be of little use to have something interesting to say unless you know how to say it interestingly such a denial would simply be the negation of the very idea of art -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : a dramatist of my acquaintance add this footnote : but by the lord they have to give advice i believe i write more play of other people 's than i do of my own -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : it may be hope too that even the accomplished dramatist may take some interest in consider the reason for thing which he do or do not do by instinct -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : this be not a phrase of contempt the would-be intelligent playgoer be vastly to be prefer to the playgoer who make a boast of he unintelligence -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : in all the art however the very idea of craftsmanship imply some sort of external percipient or in other word some sort of a audience in point of sheer self-expression a child 's scrabbling with a box of crayon may deserve to rank with the most masterly canvas of velasquez or vermeer the real difference between the dramatist and other artist be that they can be _ they own audience _ in a sense in which he can not -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : let I guard against the possibility that this might be interpret as a sneer at _ the dynast _ -- a great work by a great poet -rrb- _ chapter ii _ the choice of a theme the first step towards write a play be manifestly to choose a theme even this simple statement however require careful examination before we can grasp its full import what in the first place do we mean by a theme and secondly in what sense can we or ought we to choose one theme may mean either of two thing : either the subject of a play or its story the former be perhaps its proper or more convenient sense the theme of _ romeo and juliet _ be youthful love cross by ancestral hate the theme of _ othello _ be jealousy the theme of _ le tartufe _ be hypocrisy the theme of _ caste _ be fond heart and coronet the theme of _ get married _ be get marry the theme of _ maternité _ be maternity to every play it be possible at a pinch to assign a theme but in many play it be evident that no theme expressible in abstract term be present to the author 's mind nor be these always play of a low class it be only by a somewhat artificial process of abstraction that we can formulate a theme for _ as you like it _ for _ the way of the world _ or for _ hedda gabler _ the question now arise : ought a theme in its abstract form to be the first germ of a play ought the dramatist to say go to i will write a play on temperance or on woman 's suffrage or on capital and labor and then cast about for a story to illustrate he theme this be a possible but not a promising method of procedure a story make to the order of a moral concept be always apt to advertise its origin to the detriment of its illusive quality if a play be to be a moral apologue at all it be well to say so frankly -- probably in the title -- and aim not at verisimilitude but at neatness and appositeness in the work out of the fable the french _ proverbe _ proceeds on this principle and be often very witty and charming -lrb- 1 -rrb- a good example in english be _ a pair of spectacles _ by mr sydney grundy found on a play by labiche in this bright little comedy every incident and situation bear upon the general theme and please we not by its probability but by its ingenious appropriateness the dramatic fable in fact hold very much the same rank in drama as the narrative fable hold in literature at large we take pleasure in they on condition that they be witty and that they do not pretend to be what they be not a play manifestly suggest by a theme of temporary interest will often have a great but no less temporary success for instance though there be a good deal of clever character-drawing in _ a englishman 's home _ by major du maurier the theme be so evidently the source and inspiration of the play that it will scarcely bear revival in america where the theme be of no interest the play fail it be possible no doubt to name excellent play in which the theme in all probability precede both the story and the character in the author 's mind such play be most of m brieux 's such play be mr galsworthy 's _ strife _ and _ justice _ the french play in my judgment suffer artistically from the obtrusive predominance of the theme -- that be to say the abstract element -- over the human and concrete factor in the composition mr galsworthy 's more delicate and unemphatic art elude this danger at any rate in _ strife _ we do not remember until all be over that he character represent class and he action be one might almost say a sociological symbol if then the theme do as a matter of fact come first in the author 's conception he will do well either to make it patently and confessedly dominant as in the _ proverbe _ or to take care that as in _ strife _ it be not suffer to make its domination feel except as a afterthought -lrb- 2 -rrb- no outside force should appear to control the free rhythm of the action the theme may sometimes be not a idea a abstraction or a principle but rather a environment a social phenomenon of one sort or another the author 's primary object in such a case be not to portray any individual character or tell any definite story but to transfer to the stage a animated picture of some broad aspect or phase of life without concentrate the interest on any one figure or group there be theorist who would by definition exclude from the domain of drama any such cinematograph-play as they would probably call it but we shall see cause as we go on to distrust definition especially when they seek to clothe themselves with the authority of law tableau-play of the type here in question may even claim classical precedent what else be ben jonson 's _ bartholomew fair _ what else be schiller 's _ wallenstein lager _ amongst more recent play hauptmann 's _ die weber _ and gorky 's _ nachtasyl _ be perhaps the best example of the type the drawback of such theme be not that they do not conform to this or that canon of art but that it need a exceptional amount of knowledge and dramaturgic skill to handle they successfully it be far easier to tell a story on the stage than to paint a picture and few playwright can resist the temptation to foist a story upon they picture thus mar it by a inharmonious intrusion of melodrama or farce this have often be do upon deliberate theory in the belief that no play can exist or can attract playgoer without a definite and more or less exciting plot thus the late jame a herne insert into a charming idyllic picture of rural life entitle _ shore acre _ a melodramatic scene in a lighthouse which be hopelessly out of key with the rest of the play the dramatist who know any particular phase of life so thoroughly as to be able to transfer its characteristic incident to the stage may be advise to defy both critical and managerial prejudice and give he tableau-play just so much of story as may naturally and inevitably fall within its limit one of the most admirable and enthralling scene i ever see on any stage be that of the trafalgar square suffrage meeting in miss elizabeth robin 's _ vote for woman _ throughout a whole act it hold we spellbound while the story of the play stand still and we forget its existence it be only within a few minute of the end when the story be drag in neck and crop that the reality of the thing vanish and the interest with it \* \* \* \* \* if a abstract theme be not a advisable starting-point what be a character a situation or a story on this point it would be absurd to lay down any rule the more so as in many case a playwright be quite unable to say in what form the germ of a play first float into he mind the suggestion may come from a newspaper paragraph from a incident see in the street from a emotional adventure or a comic misadventure from a chance word drop by a acquaintance or from some flotsam or jetsam of phrase or fable that have drift from the other end of history often too the original germ whatever it may be be transform beyond recognition before a play be do -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the mind of the playwright fig grow from thistle and a silk purse -- perhaps a fortunatus ' purse -- may often be make from a sow 's ear the whole delicate texture of ibsen 's _ doll 's house _ be weave from a commonplace story of a woman who forge a cheque in order to redecorate she drawing-room stevenson 's romance of _ prince otto _ -lrb- to take a example from fiction -rrb- grow out of a tragedy on the subject of semiramis one thing however we may say with tolerable confidence : whatever may be the germ of a play -- whether it be a anecdote a situation or what not -- the play will be of small account as a work of art unless character at a very early point enter into and condition its development the story which be independent of character -- which can be carry through by a give number of ready-made puppet -- be essentially a trivial thing unless at a early stage of the organize process character begin to take the upper hand -- unless the playwright find himself think oh yes george be just the man to do this or that be quite foreign to jane 's temperament -- he may be pretty sure that it be a piece of mechanism he be put together not a drama with flesh and blood in it the difference between a live play and a dead one be that in the former the character control the plot while in the latter the plot control the character which be not to say of course that there may not be clever and entertaining play which be dead in this sense and dull and unattractive play which be live a great deal of ink have be waste in controversy over a remark of aristotle 's that the action or _ mutho _ not the character or _ êthos _ be the essential element in drama the statement be absolutely true and wholly unimportant a play can exist without anything that can be call character but not without some sort of action this be imply in the very word drama which mean a do not a mere say or exist it would be possible no doubt to place don quixote or falstaff or peer gynt on the stage and let he develop he character in mere conversation or even monologue without ever move from he chair but it be a truism that deed not word be the demonstration and test of character wherefore from time immemorial it have be the recognize business of the theater to exhibit character in action historically too we find that drama have everywhere originate in the portrayal of a action -- some exploit or some calamity in the career of some demigod or hero thus story or plot be by definition tradition and practical reason the fundamental element in drama but do it therefore follow that it be the noblest element or that by which its value should be measure assuredly not the skeleton be in a sense the fundamental element in the human organism it can exist and with a little assistance retain its form when strip of muscle and blood and nerve whereas a boneless man would be a amorphous heap more helpless than a jelly-fish but do we therefore account the skeleton man 's noblest part scarcely it be by he blood and nerve that he live not by he bone and it be because he bone be comparatively speak dead matter that they continue to exist when the flesh have fall away from they it be therefore if not a misreading of aristotle -lrb- 4 -rrb- at any rate a perversion of reason to maintain that the drama live by action rather than by character action ought to exist for the sake of character : when the relation be reverse the play may be a ingenious toy but scarcely a vital work of art \* \* \* \* \* it be time now to consider just what we mean when we say that the first step towards play-writing be the choice of a theme in many case no doubt it be the plain and literal fact that the impulse to write some play -- any play -- exist so to speak in the abstract unassociated with any particular subject and that the would-be playwright proceeds as he think to set he imagination to work and invent a story but this frame of mind be to be regard with suspicion few play of much value one may guess have result from such a abstract impulse invention in these case be apt to be nothing but recollection in disguise the shake of a kaleidoscope form of fragmentary reminiscence i remember once in some momentary access of ambition try to invent a play i occupy several hour of a long country walk in as i believe create out of nothing at all a dramatic story when at last i have model it into some sort of coherency i step back from it in my mind as it be and contemplate it as a whole no sooner have i do so than it begin to seem vaguely familiar where have i see this story before i ask myself and it be only after cudgel my brain for several minute that i find i have re-invent ibsen 's _ hedda gabler _ thus when we think we be choose a plot out of the void we be very apt to be in fact ransack the store-house of memory the plot which choose we be much more to be depend upon -- the idea which come when we least expect it perhaps from the most unlikely quarter clamor at the gate of birth and will not let we rest till it be clothe in dramatic flesh and blood -lrb- 5 -rrb- it may very well happen of course that it have to wait -- that it have to be pigeon-hole for a time until its due turn come -lrb- 6 -rrb- occasionally perhaps it may slip out of its pigeon-hole for a air only to be put back again in a slightly more developed form then at last its convenient season will arrive and the play will be work out write and launch into the struggle for life in the sense of select from among a number of embryonic theme store in he mind the playwright have often to make a deliberate choice but when move by a purely abstract impulse he go out of set purpose to look for a theme it may be doubt whether he be likely to return with any very valuable treasure-trove -lrb- 7 -rrb- the same principle hold good in the case of the ready-made poetic or historical theme which be -- rightly or wrongly -- consider suitable for treatment in blank verse whether and how far the blank verse drama can nowadays be regard as a vital and viable form be a question to be consider later in the meantime it be sufficient to say that whatever principle of conception and construction apply to the modern prose drama apply with equal cogency to the poetic drama the verse-poet may perhaps take one or two licens deny to the prose-poet for instance we may find reason to think the soliloquy more excusable in verse than in prose but fundamentally the two form be rule by the same set of condition which the verse-poet no less than the prose-poet can ignore only at he peril unless indeed he renounce from the outset all thought of the stage and choose to produce that cumbrous nondescript a closet drama of such we do not speak but glance and pass on what law indeed can apply to a form which have no proper element but like the amphibious animal describe by the sailor can not live on land and die in the water to return to we immediate topic the poet who essay dramatic composition on mere abstract impulse because other poet have do so or because he be tell that it pay be only too likely to produce willy-nilly a closet drama let he beware of say to himself i will gird up my loin and write a play shall it be a phaedra or a semiramis or a sappho or a cleopatra a julian or a attilum or a savanarolum or a cromwell a drama conceive in this reach-me-down fashion will scarcely have the breath of life in it if on the other hand in the course of he legendary romantic or historical read some character should take hold upon he imagination and demand to be interpret or some episode should as it be startle he by put on vivid dramatic form before he mind 's eye then let he by all means yield to the inspiration and try to mould the theme into a drama the real labor of creation will still lie before he but he may face it with the hope of produce a live play not a long-drawn rhetorical anachronism whether of the rotund or of the spasmodic type \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : for instance _ il ne faut jurer de rien il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée un bienfait n'est jamais perdu _ there be also a large class of piece of which the title though not itself a proverb make direct allusion to some fable or proverbial say : for example _ les brebis de panurge la chasse aux corbeaux la cigale chez les fourmis _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : i learn on the best authority that i be wrong in point of fact as to the origin of _ strife _ the play arise in mr galsworthy 's mind from he actually have see in conflict the two man who be the prototype of anthony and robert and thus note the waste and inefficacy arise from the clash of strong character unaccompanied by balance it be accident that lead he to place the two man in a environment of capital and labor in reality both of they be if not capitalist at any rate on the side of capital this interesting correction of fact do not invalidate the theory above state -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : mr henry arthur jone write to I : sometimes i start with a scene only sometimes with a complete idea sometimes a play split into two play sometimes two or three idea combine into a concrete whole always the final play be alter out of all knowledge from its first idea a interesting account of the way in which two very different play by m de curel : _ l'enver d'une sainte _ and _ l'invitée _ -- grow out of one and the same initial idea may be find in _ l'année psychologique _ 1894 p 121 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : in my discussion of this point i have rather simplify aristotle 's position he appear to make action the essential element in tragedy and not merely the necessary vehicle of character in a play he say they do not act in order to portray the character they include the character for the sake of the action so that it be the action in it _ ie _ its fable or plot that be the end and purpose of the tragedy and the end be everywhere the chief thing besides this a tragedy be impossible without action but there may be one without character -lrb- bywater 's translation -rrb- the last sentence be in my view the gist of the matter the precede sentence greatly overstate the case there be a lively controversy on the subject in the _ time _ literary supplement in may 1902 it arise from a review of mr phillip 's _ paolo and

unless he have so feel or see something that he feel as it mature in he mind that he must express it and in dramatic form -rrb- _ chapter iii _ dramatic and undramatic it may be well at this point to consider for a little what we mean when we use the term dramatic we shall probably not arrive at any definition which can be apply as a infallible touchstone to distinguish the dramatic from the undramatic perhaps indeed the upshot may rather be to place the student on he guard against trouble too much about the formal definition of critical theorist the orthodox opinion of the present time be that which be generally associate with the name of the late ferdinand brunetière the theater in general say that critic be nothing but the place for the development of the human will attack the obstacle oppose to it by destiny fortune or circumstance and again : drama be a representation of the will of man in conflict with the mysterious power or natural force which limit and belittle we it be one of we throw live upon the stage there to struggle against fatality against social law against one of he fellow-mortal against himself if need be against the ambition the interest the prejudice the folly the malevolence of those who surround he -lrb- 1 -rrb- the difficulty about this definition be that while it describe the matter of a good many drama it do not lay down any true differentium -- any characteristic common to all drama and possess by no other form of fiction many of the greatest play in the world can with difficulty be bring under the formulum while the majority of romance and other story come under it with ease where for instance be the struggle in the _ agamemnon _ there be no more struggle between clytemnestra and agamemnon than there be between the spider and the fly who walk into he net there be not even a struggle in clytemnestra 's mind agamemnon 's doom be seal from the outset and she merely carry out a pre-arranged plot there be contest indeed in the succeed play of the trilogy but it will scarcely be argue that the _ agamemnon _ take alone be not a great drama even the _ oedipus _ of sophocle though it may at first sight seem a typical instance of a struggle against destiny do not really come under the definition oedipus in fact do not struggle at all he struggle in so far as that word can be apply to he misguided effort to escape from the toil of fate be all thing of the past in the actual course of the tragedy he simply writhe under one revelation after another of bygone error and unwitting crime it would be a mere play upon word to recognize as a dramatic struggle the writhe of a worm on a hook and do not this description apply very closely to the part play by another great protagonist -- othello to wit there be no struggle no conflict between he and iago it be iago alone who exert any will neither othello nor desdemona make the smallest fight from the moment when iago set he machination to work they be like people slide down a ice-slope to a inevitable abyss where be the conflict in _ as you like it _ no one surely will pretend that any part of the interest or charm of the play arise from the struggle between the banish duke and the usurper or between orlando and oliver there be not even the conflict if so it can be call which nominally bring so many hundred of play under the brunetière canon -- the conflict between a eager lover and a more or less reluctant maid or take again ibsen 's _ ghost _ -- in what valid sense can it be say that that tragedy show we will struggle against obstacle oswald doubtless wish to live and he mother desire that he should live but this mere will for life can not be the differentium that make of _ ghost _ a drama if the reluctant descent of the downward path to death constitute drama then tolstoy 's _ death of ivan ilytch _ would be one of the greatest drama ever write -- which it certainly be not yet again if we want to see will struggle against obstacle the classic to turn to be not _ hamlet _ not _ lear _ but _ robinson crusoe _ yet no one except a pantomime librettist ever see a drama in defoe 's narrative in a platonic dialogue in _ paradise lose _ in _ john gilpin _ there be a struggle of will against obstacle there be none in _ hannele _ which nevertheless be a deeply-moving drama such a struggle be characteristic of all great fiction from _ clarissa harlowe _ to _ the house with the green shutter _ whereas in many play the struggle if there be any at all be the merest matter of form -lrb- for instance a quite conventional love-story -rrb- while the real interest reside in something quite different the plain truth seem to be that conflict be _ one _ of the most dramatic element in life and that many drama -- perhaps most -- do as a matter of fact turn upon strife of one sort or another but it be clearly a error to make conflict indispensable to drama and especially to insist -- as do some of brunetière 's follower -- that the conflict must be between will and will a stand-up fight between will and will -- such a fight as occur in say the _ hippolytus _ of euripide or racine 's _ andromaque _ or molière 's _ tartufe _ or ibsen 's _ pretender _ or duma 's _ françillon _ or sudermann 's _ heimat _ or sir arthur pinero 's _ gay lord quex _ or mr shaw 's _ candida _ or mr galsworthy 's _ strife _ -- such a stand-up fight i say be no doubt one of the intensest form of drama but it be comparatively rare at any rate as the formulum of a whole play in individual scene a conflict of will be frequent enough but it be after all only one among a multitude of equally tell form of drama no one can say that the balcony scene in _ romeo and juliet _ be undramatic or the galeoto fú il libro scene in mr stephen phillip 's _ paolo and francesca _ yet the point of these scene be not a clash but a ecstatic concordance of will be the death-scene of cleopatra undramatic or the banquet scene in _ macbeth _ or the pastoral act in _ the winter 's tale _ yet in none of these be there any conflict of will in the whole range of drama there be scarcely a passage which one would call more specifically dramatic than the screen scene in _ the school for scandal _ yet it would be the veriest quibble to argue that any appreciable part of its effect arise from the clash of will against will this whole comedy indeed suffice to show the emptiness of the theory with a little strain it be possible to bring it within the letter of the formulum but who can pretend that any considerable part of the attraction or interest of the play be due to that possibility the champion of the theory moreover place it on a metaphysical basis finding in the will the essence of human personality and therefore of the art which show human personality raise to its highest power it seem unnecessary however to apply to schopenhauer for a explanation of whatever validity the theory may possess for a sufficient account of the matter we need go no further than the simple psychological observation that human nature love a fight whether it be with club or with sword with tongue or with brain one of the earliest form of mediaeval drama be the estrif or flyting -- the scolding-match between husband and wife or between two rustic gossip this motive be glorified in the quarrel between brutus and cassius degrade in the patter of two knockabout comedian certainly there be nothing more tell in drama than a piece of cut-and-thrust dialogue after the fashion of the ancient stichomythium when a whole theme involve conflict or even a single scene of the nature describe as a passage-at-arm come naturally in the playwright 's way by all means let he seize the opportunity but do not let he reject a theme or scene as undramatic merely because it have no room for a clash of war will there be a variant of the conflict theory which underline the word obstacle in the above-quoted dictum of brunetière and lay down the rule : no obstacle no drama though far from be universally valid this form of the theory have a certain practical usefulness and may well be bear in mind many a play would have remain unwritten if the author have ask himself be there a sufficient obstacle between my two lover or in more general term between my character and the realization of they will there be nothing more futile than a play in which we feel that there be no real obstacle to the inevitable happy ending and that the curtain might just as well fall in the middle of the first act as at the end of the third comedy abound -lrb- though they reach the stage only by accident -rrb- in which the obstacle between corydon and phylli between lord edwin and lady angelina be not even a defect or peculiarity of character but simply some trumpery misunderstanding -lrb- 2 -rrb- which can be keep afoot only so long as every one concerned hold he or she common sense in studious abeyance pyramus and thisbe without the wall may be take as the formulum for the whole type of play but even in play of a much higher type the author might often ask himself with advantage whether he could not strengthen he obstacle and so accentuate the struggle which form the matter of he play though conflict may not be essential to drama yet when you set forth to portray a struggle you may as well make it as real and intense as possible it seem to I that in the late william vaughn moody 's drama _ the great divide _ the body of the play after the stir first act be weaken by we sense that the happy ending be only be postpone by a violent effort we have be assure from the very first -- even before ruth jordan have set eye on stephen ghent -- that just such a rough diamond be the ideal of she dream it be true that after they marriage the rough diamond seriously misconduct himself towards she and we have then to consider the rather unattractive question whether a single act of brutality on the part of a drunken husband ought to be hold so unpardonable as to break up a union which otherwise promise to be quite satisfactory but the author have take such pain to emphasize the fact that these two people be really make for each other that the answer to the question be not for a moment in doubt and we become rather impatient of the obstinate sulkiness of ruth 's attitude if there have be a real disharmony of character to be overcome instead of or in addition to the sordid misadventure which be in fact the sole barrier between they the play would certainly have be stronger and perhaps more permanently popular in a play by mr jame bernard fagan _ the prayer of the sword _ we have a much clearer example of a inadequate obstacle a youth name andrea have be bring up in a monastery and destine for the priesthood but he taste and aptitude be all for a military career he be however on the verge of take he priestly vow when accident call he forth into the world and he have the good fortune to quell a threaten revolution in a romantic duchy rule over by a duchess of surpass loveliness with she he naturally fall in love and the tragedy lie or ought to lie in the conflict between this earthly passion and he heavenly calling and election but the author have take pain to make the obstacle between andrea and ilarium absolutely unreal the fact that andrea have as yet take no irrevocable vow be not the essence of the matter vow or no vow there would have be a tragic conflict if andrea have feel absolutely certain of he call to the priesthood and have defy heaven and imperil he immortal soul because of he overwhelming passion that would have be a tragic situation but the author have carefully avoid it from the very first -- before andrea have ever see ilarium -- it have be impress upon we that he have no priestly vocation there be no struggle in he soul between passion and duty there be no struggle at all in he soul he struggle be all with external force and influence wherefore the play which a real obstacle might have convert into a tragedy remain a sentimental romance -- and be forget \* \* \* \* \* what then be the essence of drama if conflict be not it what be the common quality of theme scene and incident which we recognize as specifically dramatic perhaps we shall scarcely come nearer to a helpful definition than if we say that the essence of drama be _ crisis _ a play be a more or less rapidly-developing crisis in destiny or circumstance and a dramatic scene be a crisis within a crisis clearly further the ultimate event the drama may be call the art of crisis as fiction be the art of gradual development it be the slowness of its process which differentiate the typical novel from the typical play if the novelist do not take advantage of the facility offer by he form for portray gradual change whether in the way of growth or of decay he renounce he own birthright in order to trespass on the domain of the dramatist most great novel embrace considerable segment of many life whereas the drama give we only the culminate point -- or shall we say the intersect culmination -- two or three destiny some novelist have excel precisely in the art with which they have make the gradation of change in character or circumstance so delicate as to be imperceptible from page to page and measurable as in real life only when we look back over a considerable period the dramatist on the other hand deal in rapid and startling change the peripety as the greek call they which may be the outcome of long slow process but which actually occur in very brief space of time nor be this a merely mechanical consequence of the narrow limit of stage presentation the crisis be as real though not as inevitable a part of human experience as the gradual development even if the material condition of the theater permit the presentation of a whole _ middlemarch _ or _ anna karénine _ -- as the condition of the chinese theater actually do -- some dramatist we can not doubt would voluntarily renounce that license of prolixity in order to cultivate a art of concentration and crisis the greek drama subject to the faithful eye as horace phrase it the culminate point of the greek epic the modern drama place under the lens of theatrical presentment the culminate point of modern experience but manifestly it be not every crisis that be dramatic a serious illness a law-suit a bankruptcy even a ordinary prosaic marriage may be a crisis in a man 's life without be necessarily or even probably material for drama how then do we distinguish a dramatic from a non-dramatic crisis generally i think by the fact that it develop or can be make naturally to develop through a series of minor crisis involve more or less emotional excitement and if possible the vivid manifestation of character take for instance the case of a bankruptcy most people probably who figure in the _ gazette _ do not go through any one or two or three critical moment of special tension special humiliation special agony they gradually drift to leeward in they affair undergo a series of small discouragement small vicissitude of hope and fear small unpleasantness which they take lightly or hardly accord to they temperament or the momentary state of they liver in this average process of financial decline there may be -- there have be -- matter for many excellent novel but scarcely for a drama that admirable chapter in _ little dorrit _ wherein dickens describe the gradual degradation of the father of the marshalsea show how a master of fiction deal with such a subject but it would be quite impossible to transfer this chapter to the stage so too with the bankruptcy of colonel newcome -- certain emotional crisis arise from it have indeed be place on the stage but only after all thackeray 's knowledge of the world and fine gradation of art have be eliminate mr hardy 's _ mayor of casterbridge _ have i think be dramatize but not i think with success a somewhat similar story of financial ruin the grimly powerful _ house with the green shutter _ have not even tempt the dramatiser there be in this novel indeed many potentially dramatic crisis the trouble be that they be too numerous and individually too small to be suitable for theatrical presentment moreover they be crisis affect a taciturn and inarticulate race -lrb- 3 -rrb- a fact which place further difficulty in the way of the playwright in all these case in short the bankruptcy portray be a matter of slow development with no great outstanding moment and be consequently suit for treatment in fiction rather than in drama but bankruptcy sometimes occur in the form of one or more sudden sharp crisis and have therefore be utilize again and again as a dramatic motive in a hundred domestic drama or melodrama we have see the head of a happy household open a newspaper or a telegram announce the failure of some enterprise in which all he fortune be embark so obviously dramatic be this incident that it have become sadly hackneyed again we have bankruptcy follow upon a course of gamble generally in stock here there be evident opportunity which have be frequently utilize for a series of crisis of somewhat violent and commonplace emotion in american drama especially the duel of wall street the combat of bull and bear form a very popular theme which clearly fall under the brunetière formulum few american dramatist can resist the temptation of show some masterful financier feverishly watch the ticker which proclaim he a millionaire or a beggar the ticker have not be invent in the day when ibsen write _ the league of youth _ otherwise he would doubtless have make use of it in the fourth act of that play the most popular of all björnson 's play be specifically entitle _ a bankruptcy _ here the poet have have the art to select a typical phase of business life which naturally present itself in the form of a ascend curve so to speak of emotional crisis we see the energetic active business man with a number of iron in the fire aware in he heart that he be insolvent but not absolutely clear as to he position and hope against hope to retrieve it we see he give a great dinner-party in order to throw dust in the eye of the world and to secure the support of a financial magnate who be the guest of honor the financial magnate be incline to bite and go off leave the merchant under the impression that he be save this be a interesting and natural but scarcely a thrilling crisis it do not therefore discount the supreme crisis of the play in which a cold clear-headed business man who have be depute by the bank to look into the merchant 's affair prove to he point by point that it would be dishonest of he to flounder any longer in the swamp of insolvency into which he can only sink deeper and drag more people down with he then the bankrupt produce a pistol and threaten murder and suicide if the arbiter of he fate will not consent to give he one more chance but he frenzy break innocuous against the other 's calm relentless reason here we have i repeat a typically dramatic theme : a great crisis bring out vivid manifestation of character not only in the bankrupt himself but in those around he and naturally unfold itself through a series of those lesser crisis which we call interesting and move scene the play be scarcely a great one partly because its end be perfunctory partly because björnson poet though he be have not ibsen 's art of throw in a little poetry into he modern drama i have summarize it up to its culminate point because it happen to illustrate the difference between a bankruptcy dramatic in its nature and treatment and those undramatic bankruptcy to which reference have be make in _ la douloureuse _ by maurice donnay bankruptcy be incidentally employ to bring about a crisis of a different order a ball be proceed at the house of a parisian financier when the whisper spread that the host be ruin and have commit suicide in a room above whereupon the guest after a moment of flustered consternation go on supping and dancing -lrb- 4 -rrb- we be not at all deeply interested in the host or he fortune the author 's purpose be to illustrate rather crudely the heartlessness of plutocratic bohemia and by means of the bankruptcy and suicide he bring about what may be call a crisis of collective character -lrb- 5 -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* as regard individual incident it may be say in general that the dramatic way of treat they be the crisp and staccato as oppose to the smooth or legato method it may be think a point of inferiority in dramatic art that it should deal so largely in shock to the nerve and should appeal by preference wherever it be reasonably possible to the cheap emotion of curiosity and surprise but this be a criticism not of dramatic art but of human nature we may wish that mankind take more pleasure in pure apprehension than in emotion but so long as the fact be otherwise that way of handle a incident by which the greatest variety of poignancy of emotion can be extract from it will remain the specifically dramatic way we shall have to consider later the relation between what may be call primary and secondary suspense or surprise -- that be to say between suspense or surprise actually experience by the spectator to whom the drama be new and suspense or surprise experience only sympathetically on behalf of the character by a spectator who know perfectly what be to follow the two form of emotion be so far similar that we need not distinguish between they in consider the general content of the term dramatic it be plain that the latter or secondary form of emotion must be by far the commoner and the one to which the dramatist of any ambition must make he main appeal for the longer he play endure the larger will be the proportion of any give audience which know it beforehand in outline if not in detail as a typical example of a dramatic way of handle a incident so as to make a supreme effect of what might else have be a anti-climax one may cite the death of othello shakespeare be face by no easy problem desdemona be dead emilium dead iago wound and doom to the torture how be othello to die without merely satiate the audience with a glut of blood how be he death to be make not a foregone conclusion a mere conventional suicide but the culminate moment of the tragedy in no single detail perhaps do shakespeare ever show he dramatic genius more unmistakably than in he solution of this problem we all remember how as he be be lead away othello stay he captor with a gesture and thus address they : soft you a word or two before you go i have do the state some service and they know ' t no more of that i pray you in you letter when you shall these unlucky deed relate speak of I as i be nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice then must you speak of one that love not wisely but too well of one not easily jealous but be work perplex would in the extreme of one whose hand like the base indian throw a pearl away richer than all he tribe of one whose subdue eye albeit unused to the melting mood drop tear as fast as the arabian tree they medicinal gum set you down this and say besides that in aleppo once where a malignant and a turban would turk beat a venetian and traduce the state i take by the throat the circumcise dog and smite he -- thus what be the essence of shakespeare 's achievement in this marvellous passage what be it that he have do he have throw he audience just as othello have throw he captor off they guard and substitute a sudden shock of surprise for a tedious fulfilment of expectation in other word he have handle the incident crisply instead of flaccidly and so give it what we may call the specific accent of drama another consummate example of the dramatic handling of detail may be find in the first act of ibsen 's _ little eyolf _ the lame boy eyolf have follow the rat-wife down to the wharf have fall into the water and be drown this be the bare fact : how be it to be convey to the child 's parent and to the audience a greek dramatist would probably have have recourse to a long and elaborately worked-up messenger-speech a pathetic recitation that be the method best suit to the condition and to what may be call the prevail tempo of the greek theater i be far from say that it be a bad method : no method be bad which hold and move a audience but in this case it would have have the disadvantage of concentrate attention on the narrator instead of on the child 's parent on the mere event instead of on the emotion it engender in the modern theater with greater facility for reproduce the actual movement of life the dramatist naturally aim at convey to the audience the grow anxiety the suspense and the final horror of the father and mother the most commonplace playwright would have see this opportunity and try to make the most of it every one can think of a dozen commonplace way in which the scene could be arrange and write and some of they might be quite effective the great invention by which ibsen snatch the scene out of the domain of the commonplace and raise it to the height of dramatic poetry consist in leave it doubtful to the father and mother what be the meaning of the excitement on the beach and the confused cry which reach they ear until one cry come home to they with terrible distinctness the crutch be float it would be hard to name any single phrase in literature in which more dramatic effect be concentrated than in these four word -- they be only two word in the original however dissimilar in its nature and circumstance this incident be comparable with the death of othello inasmuch as in each case the poet by a supreme felicity of invention have succeed in do a give thing in absolutely the most dramatic method conceivable here we recognize in a consummate degree what have be call the finger of the dramatist and i know not how better to express the common quality of the two incident than in say that each be touch with extraordinary crispness so as to give to what in both case have for some time be expect and foresee a sudden thrill of novelty and unexpectedness that be how to do a thing dramatically -lrb- 6 -rrb- and now after all this discussion of the dramatic in theme and incident it remain to be say that the tendency of recent theory and of some recent practice have be to widen the meaning of the word until it burst the bond of all definition play have be write and have find some acceptance in which the endeavor of the dramatist have be to depict life not in moment of crisis but in its most level and humdrum phase and to avoid any crispness of touch in the presentation of individual incident dramatic in the eye of writer of this school have become a term of reproach synonymous with theatrical they take they cue from maeterlinck 's famous essay on the tragic in daily life in which he lay it down that : a old man seat in he armchair wait patiently with he lamp beside he -- submit with bent head to the presence of he soul and he destiny -- motionless as he be do yet live in reality a deeper more human and more universal life than the lover who strangle he mistress the captain who conquer in battle or the husband who ` avenge he honor ' they do not observe that maeterlinck in he own practice constantly deal with crisis and often with violent and startling one at the same time i be far from suggest that the reaction against the traditional dramatic be a wholly mistaken movement it be a valuable corrective of conventional theatricalism and it have at some point positively enlarged the domain of dramatic art any movement be good which help to free art from the tyranny of a code of rule and definition the only really valid definition of the dramatic be : any representation of imaginary personage which be capable of interesting a average audience assemble in a theater we must say representation of imaginary personage in order to exclude a lecture or a prize-fight and we must say a average audience -lrb- or something to that effect -rrb- in order to exclude a dialogue of plato or of landor the recitation of which might interest a specially select public any further attempt to limit the content of the term dramatic be simply the expression of a opinion that such-and-such form of representation will not be find to interest a audience and this opinion may always be rebut by experiment in all that i have say then as to the dramatic and the non-dramatic i must be take as meaning : such-and-such form and method have be find to please and will probably please again they be so to speak safer and easier than other form and method but it be the part of original genius to override the dictate of experience and nothing in these page be design to discourage original genius from make the attempt we have already see indeed that in a certain type of play -- the broad picture of a social phenomenon or environment -- it be preferable that no attempt should be make to depict a marked crisis there should be just enough story to afford a plausible excuse for raise and for lower the curtain -lrb- 7 -rrb- let we not however seem to grant too much to the innovator and the quietist to say that a drama should be or tend to be the presentation of a crisis in the life of certain character be by no means to insist on a mere arbitrary convention it be to make at once a induction from the overwhelming majority of exist drama and a deduction from the nature and inherent condition of theatrical presentation the fact that theatrical condition often encourage a violent exaggeration of the characteristically dramatic element in life do not make these element any the less real or any the less characteristically dramatic it be true that crispness of handle may easily degenerate into the pursuit of mere picture-poster situation but that be no reason why the artist should not seek to achieve crispness within the bound prescribe by nature and common sense there be a drama -- i have myself see it -- in which the heroine flee from the villain be stop by a yawning chasm the pursuer be at she heel and it seem as though she have no resource but to hurl herself into the abyss but she be accompany by three indian servant who happen by the mercy of providence to be accomplish acrobat the second climb on the shoulder of the first the third on the shoulder of the second and then the whole trio fall forward across the chasm the top one grasp some bush or creeper on the other side so that a living bridge be form on which the heroine -lrb- herself it would seem something of a acrobat -rrb- can cross the dizzy gulf and bid defiance to the baffled villain this be clearly a dramatic crisis within we definition but no less clearly it be not a piece of rational or commendable drama to say that such-and-such a factor be necessary or highly desirable in a dramatic scene be by no means to imply that every scene which contain this factor be good drama let we take the case of another heroine -- nina in sir arthur pinero 's _ he house in order _ the second wife of filmer jesson she be continually be offer up as a sacrifice on the altar dedicate to the memory of he adored first wife not only she husband but the relative of the sainted annabel make she life a burden to she then it come to she knowledge -- she obtain absolute proof -- that annabel be anything but the saint she be believe to be by a single word she can overturn the altar of she martyrdom and shatter the dearest illusion of she persecutor shall she speak that word or shall she not here be a crisis which come within we definition just as clearly as the other -lrb- 8 -rrb- only it happen to be entirely natural and probable and eminently illustrative of character ought we then to despise it because of the element it have in common with the picture-poster situation of preposterous melodrama surely not let those who have the art -- the extremely delicate and difficult art -- of make drama without the characteristically dramatic ingredient do so by all means but let they not seek to lay a embargo on the judicious use of these ingredient as they present themselves in life \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : _ etude critique _ vol vii pp 153 and 207 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : in the most aggravate case the misunderstanding be

have guarantee the creation of peer should it prove necessary for the passing of the parliament bill one paper publish the news under this head-line : dramatic announcement by the prime minister and the parliamentary correspondent of another paper write : with dramatic suddenness and swiftness the prime minister hurl he thunderbolt at the waver tory party yesterday as a matter of fact the letter be probably not hurl more suddenly or swiftly than the most ordinary invitation to dinner : nor can its contents have be particularly surprising to any one it be probably the conclusiveness the finality of the announcement that strike these writer as dramatic the letter put a end to all dubiety with a short sharp shock it be in fact crisp as a rule however dramatic be employ by the modern journalist simply as a rather pretentious synonym for the still more hackneyed startling -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : as a specimen and a successful specimen of this new technic i may cite miss elizabeth baker 's very interesting play _ chain _ there be absolutely no story in it no complication of incident not even any emotional tension worth speaking of another recent play of something the same type _ the way the money go _ by lady bell be quite thrilling by comparison there we see a workman 's wife bow down by a terrible secret which threaten to wreck she whole life -- the secret that she have actually run into debt to the amount of # 30 she situation be dramatic in the ordinary sense of the word very much as nora 's situation be dramatic when she know that krogstad 's letter be in helmer 's hand but in _ chain _ there be not even this simple form of excitement and suspense a city clerk oppress by the deadly monotony and narrowness of he life think of go to australia -- and do not go : that be the sum and substance of the action also by way of underplot a shopgirl oppress by the deadly monotony and narrowness of she life think of escape from it by marry a middle-aged widower -- and do not do it if any one have tell the late francisque sarcey or the late clement scott that a play could be make out of this slender material which should hold a audience absorb through four act and stir they to real enthusiasm these eminent critic would have think he a madman yet miss baker have achieve this feat by the simple process of supplement competent observation with a fair share of dramatic instinct -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : if the essence of drama be crisis it follow that nothing can be more dramatic than a momentous choice which may make or mar both the character and the fortune of the chooser and of other there be a element of choice in all action which be or seem to be the product of free will but there be a peculiar crispness of effect when two alternative be clearly formulate and the choice be make after a mental struggle accentuate perhaps by impassioned advocacy of the conflict interest such scene be _ coriolanus _ v 3 the scene between ellida wangel

fore-works as he use to call they have now be translate under the title of _ from ibsen 's workshop _ -lrb- scribner -rrb- and may be study with the greatest profit not that the student should mechanically imitate even ibsen 's routine of composition which indeed vary considerably from play to play the great lesson to be learn from ibsen 's practice be that the play should be keep fluid or plastic as long as possible and not suffer to become immutably fix either in the author 's mind or on paper before it have have time to grow and ripen many if not most of ibsen 's greatest individual inspiration come to he as afterthought after the play have reach a point of development at which many author would have hold the process of gestation end and the work of art ripe for birth among these inspire afterthought may be reckon nora 's great line million of woman have do that -- the most crush repartee in literature -- hedvig 's threaten blindness with all that ensue from it and little eyolf 's crutch use to such purpose as we have already see this be not to say that the drawing-up of a tentative scenario ought not to be one of the playwright 's first proceedings indeed if he be able to dispense with a scenario on paper it can only be because he mind be so clear and so retentive of its own idea as to enable he to carry in he head always ready for reference a more or less detailed scheme go-as-you-please composition may be possible for the novelist perhaps even for the writer of a one-act play a mere piece of dialogue but in a dramatic structure of any considerable extent proportion balance and the interconnection of part be so essential that a scenario be almost as indispensable to a dramatist as a set of plan to a architect there be one dramatist of note whom one suspect of sometimes work without any definite scenario and invent as he go along that dramatist i need scarcely say be mr bernard shaw i have no absolute knowledge of he method but if he scheme out any scenario for _ get married _ or _ misalliance _ he have sedulously conceal the fact -- to the detriment of the play -lrb- 1 -rrb- the scenario or skeleton be so manifestly the natural ground-work of a dramatic performance that the playwright of the italian _ commedium dell ' arte _ write nothing more than a scheme of scene and leave the actor to do the rest the same practice prevail in early elizabethan day as one or two m plat design to be hang up in the wing be extant to testify the transition from extempore act regulate by a scenario to the formal learning of part fall within the historical period of the german stage it seem probable that the romantic playwright of the sixteenth and seventeenth century both in england and in spain may have adopt a method not unlike that of the drama of improvisation that be to say they may have draw out a scheme of entrance and exit and then let they character discourse -lrb- on paper -rrb- as they fancy prompt so at least the copious fluency of they dialogue seem to suggest but the typical modern play be a much more close-knit organism in which every word have to be weigh far more carefully than it be by playwright who stand near to the day of improvisation and could indulge in the large utterance of the early god consequently it would seem that until a play have be think out very clearly and in great detail any scheme of entrance and exit ought to be merely provisional and subject to indefinite modification a modern play be not a framework of story loosely drape in a more or less gorgeous robe of language there be or ought to be a close interdependence between action character and dialogue which forbid a playwright to tie he hand very far in advance as a rule then it would seem to be a unfavourable sign when a drama present itself at a early stage with a fix and unalterable outline the result may be a powerful logical well-knit piece of work but the breath of life will scarcely be in it room should be leave as long as possible for unexpected development of character if you character be innocent of unexpected development the less character they -lrb- 2 -rrb- not that i personally have any faith in those writer of fiction be they playwright or novelist who contend that they do not speak through the mouth of they personage but rather let they personage speak through they i do not invent or create i have hear a eminent novelist say : i simply record my character speak and act and i write down they saying and doings this author may be a fine psychologist for purpose of fiction but i question he insight into he own mental process the apparent spontaneity of a character 's proceedings be a pure illusion it mean no more than that the imagination once set in motion along a give line move along that line with a ease and freedom which seem to its possessor preternatural and almost uncanny -lrb- 3 -rrb- most author however who have any real gift for character-creation probably fall more or less under this illusion though they be sane enough and modest enough to realize that a illusion it be -lrb- 4 -rrb- a character will every now and then seem to take the bit between he tooth and say and do thing for which he creator feel himself hardly responsible the playwright 's scheme should not then until the latest possible moment become so hard and fast as to allow he character no elbow room for such manifestation of spontaneity and this be only one of several form of afterthought which may arise as the play develop the playwright may all of a sudden see that a certain character be superfluous or that a new character be need or that a new relationship between two character would simplify matter or that a scene that he have place in the first act ought to be in the second or that he can dispense with it altogether or that it reveal too much to the audience and must be wholly recast -lrb- 5 -rrb- these be only a few of the re-adjustment which have constantly to be make if a play be shape itself by a process of vital growth and that be why the playwright may be advise to keep he material fluid as long as he can ibsen have write large portion of the play now know to we as _ rosmersholm _ before he decide that rebecca should not be marry to rosmer he also at a comparatively late stage do away with two daughter whom he have at first give to rosmer and decide to make she childlessness the main cause of bea 's tragedy perhaps i insist too strongly on the advisability of treat a dramatic theme as clay to be model and remodel rather than as wood or marble to be carve unalterably and once for all if so it be because of a personal reminiscence in my early youth i have like everybody else ambition in the direction of play-writing and it be my inability to keep a theme plastic that convince I of my lack of talent it please I greatly to draw out a detailed scenario work up duly to a situation at the end of each act and once make that scenario be like a cast-iron mould into which the dialogue have simply to be pour the result be that the play have all the merit of a logical well-ordered essay my situation work out like the qed 's of euclid my character obstinately refuse to come to life or to take the bit between they tooth they be simply cog-wheel in a pre-arranged mechanism in one respect my two or three play be model -- in respect of brevity and conciseness i be never trouble by the necessity of cut down -- so cruel a necessity to many playwright -lrb- 6 -rrb- my difficulty be rather to find enough for my character to say -- for they never want to say anything that be not strictly germane to the plot it be this that make I despair of play-writing and realize that my mission be to teach other people how to write play and similarly the aspirant who find that he people never want to say more than he can allow they to say -- that they never rush headlong into blind alley or do thing that upset the balance of the play and have to be resolutely undo -- that aspirant will do well not to be over-confident of he dramatic calling and election there may be author who can write vital play as shakespeare be say -lrb- on rather poor evidence -rrb- -lrb- 7 -rrb- to have do without blot a line but i believe they to be rare in we day the great playwright be more likely to be he who do not shrink on occasion from blot a act or two there be a modern french dramatist who write with success such play as i might have write have i combine a strong philosophical faculty with great rhetorical force and fluency the drama of m paul hervieu have all the neatness and cogency of a geometrical demonstration one imagine that for m hervieu the act of composition mean merely the careful filling in of a scenario as neat and complete as a schedule -lrb- 8 -rrb- but for that very reason despite they undoubted intellectual power m hervieu 's drama command we respect rather than we enthusiasm the dramatist should aim at _ be _ logical without _ seem _ so -lrb- 9 -rrb- it be sometimes say that a playwright ought to construct he play backwards and even to write he last act first -lrb- 10 -rrb- this doctrine belong to the period of the well-made play when climax be regard as the one thing needful in dramatic art and anticlimax as the unforgivable sin nowadays we do not insist that every play should end with a tableau or with a emphatic _ mot de la fin _ we be more willing to accept a quiet even a indecisive ending -lrb- 11 -rrb- nevertheless it be and must ever be true that at a very early period in the scheming of he play the playwright ought to assure himself that he theme be capable of a satisfactory ending of course this phrase do not imply a happy end but one which satisfy the author as be artistic effective inevitable -lrb- in the case of a serious play -rrb- or in one word right a obviously makeshift end can never be desirable either from the ideal or from the practical point of view many excellent play have be wreck on this rock the very frequent complaint that the last act be weak be not always or necessarily a just reproach but it be so when the author have clearly be at a loss for a end and have simply huddle he play up in a conventional and perfunctory fashion it may even be say that some apparently promising theme be deceptive in they promise since they be inherently incapable of a satisfactory end the playwright should by all means make sure that he have not run up against one of these blind-alley theme -lrb- 12 -rrb- he should at a early point see clearly the end for which he be make and be sure that it be a end which he actively desire not merely one which satisfy convention or which will have to do some dramatist when a play be provisionally map out do not attempt to begin at the beginning and write it as a coherent whole but make a dash first at the more salient and critical scene or those which specially attract they imagination on such a point every author must obviously be a law unto himself from the theoretical point of view one can only approve the practice since it certainly make for plasticity it be evident that a detach scene write while those that lead up to it be as yet but vaguely conceive must be subject to indefinite modification -lrb- 13 -rrb- in several of ibsen 's very roughest draft we find short passage of dialogue sketch out even before the name have be assign to the character show that some of he earliest idea come to he as it be ready dramatize one would be tempt to hope much of a author who habitually and unaffectedly thus lisp in dialogue for the dialogue come ought the playwright at a early stage in the process of each act to have the detail of its scene clearly before he ought he to draw out a scene-plot and know from moment to moment just where each character be whether he be stand on the hearthrug and she sit on the settee or _ vice versa _ there be no doubt that furniture property accident of environment play a much larger part in modern drama than they do on the elizabethan the eighteenth century or even the early-victorian stage some of we who be not yet centenarian can remember to have see room on the stage with no furniture at all except two or three chair paint on the flat under such condition it be clearly useless for the playwright to trouble he head about furniture and even position might well be leave for arrangement at rehearsal this carelessness of the environment however be no longer possible whether we like it or no -lrb- and some theorist do not like it at all -rrb- scenery have cease to be a merely suggestive background against which the figure stand out in high relief the stage now aim at present a complete picture with the figure not a little out of the picture but completely in it this be so the playwright must evidently at some point in the work out of he theme visualize the stage-picture in considerable detail and we find that almost all modern dramatist do as a matter of fact pay great attention to what may be call the topography of they scene and the shift position of they character the question be : at what stage of the process of composition ought this visualization to occur here again it would be absurd to lay down a general rule but i be incline to think both theoretically and from what can be gather of the practice of the best dramatist that it be wisest to reserve it for a comparatively late stage a playwright of my acquaintance and a very remarkable playwright too use to scribble the first draft of he play in little notebook which he produce from he pocket whenever he have a moment to spare -- often on the top of a omnibus only when the first draft be complete do he proceed to set the scene as it be and map out the stage-management on the other hand one have hear of playwright whose first step in set to work upon a particular act be to construct a complete model of the scene and people it with manikin to represent the character as a general practice this be scarcely to be commend it be wiser one fancy to have the matter of the scene pretty fully roughed-out before detail of furniture property and position be arrange -lrb- 14 -rrb- it may happen indeed that some natural phenomenon some property or piece of furniture be the very pivot of the scene in which case it must of course be posit from the first from the very moment of he conceive the fourth act of _ le tartufe _ molière must have have clearly in view the table under which orgon hide and sheridan can not have get very far with the screen scene before he have mentally place the screen but even where a great deal turn on some individual object the detailed arrangement of the scene may in most case be take for grant until a late stage in its work out one proviso however must be make where any important effect depend upon a give object or a particular arrangement of the scene the playwright can not too soon assure himself that the object come well within the physical possibility of the stage and that the arrangement be optically -lrb- 15 -rrb- possible and effective few thing indeed be quite impossible to the modern stage but there be many that have much better not be attempt it need scarcely be add that the more serious a play be or aspire to be the more carefully should the author avoid any such effect as call for the active collaboration of the stage-carpenter machinist or electrician even when a mechanical effect can be produce to perfection the very fact that the audience can not but admire the ingenuity display and wonder how it be do imply a failure of that single-minded attention to the essence of the matter in hand which the dramatist would strive to beget and maintain a small but instructive example of a difficult effect such as the prudent playwright will do well to avoid occur in the third act of ibsen 's _ little eyolf _ during the greater part of the act the flag in allmer 's garden be hoist to half-mast in token of mourn until at the end when he and rita attain a serener frame of mind he run it up to the truck now from the poetic and symbolic point of view this flag be all that can be desire but from the practical point of view it present grave difficulty nothing be so pitifully ineffective as a flag in a dead calm droop nervelessly against the mast and though no doubt by a ingenious arrangement of electric fan it might be possible to make this flag flutter in the breeze the very fact of its do so would tend to set the audience wonder by what mechanism the effect be produce instead of attend to the soul-struggle of rita and allmer it would be absurd to blame ibsen for override theatrical prudence in such a case i merely point out to beginner that it be wise before rely on a effect of this order to make sure that it be not only possible but convenient from the practical point of view in one or two other case ibsen strain the resource of the stage the illumination in the last act of _ pillar of society _ can not be carry out as he describe it or rather if it be carry out on some exceptionally large and well-equipped stage the feat of the mechanician would eclipse the invention of the poet on the other hand the abode of the wild duck in the play of that name be a conception entirely consonant with the optics of the theater for no detail at all need be or ought to be visible and a vague effect of light be all that be require only in he last melancholy effort do ibsen in a play design for representation demand scenic effect entirely beyond the resource of any theater not specially fit for spectacular drama and possible even in such a theater only in some ridiculously makeshift form there be two point of routine on which i be compel to speak in no uncertain voice -- two practice which i hold to be almost equally condemnable in the first place no playwright who understand the evolution of the modern theater can nowadays use in he stage-direction the abhorrent jargon of the early nineteenth century when one come across a manuscript bespatter with such cabalistic sign as r2e rc lc lue and so forth one see at a glance that the writer have neither study dramatic literature nor think out for himself the condition of the modern theater but have find he dramatic education between the buff cover of _ french 's act edition _ some beginner imagine that a plentiful use of such abbreviation will be take as a proof of they familiarity with the stage whereas in fact it only show they unfamiliarity with theatrical history they might as well set forth to describe a modern battleship in the nautical terminology of captain marryat right first entrance leave upper entrance and so forth be term belong to the period when there be no box room or set exterior on the stage when the side of each scene be compose of wing shove on in groove and entrance could be make between each pair of wing thus r 1 e mean the entrance between the proscenium and the first wing on the right r 2 e mean the entrance between the first pair of wing and so forth lue mean the entrance at the leave between the last wing and the back cloth now groove and wing have disappear from the stage the box room be enter like any room in real life by door or french window and the only rational course be to state the position of you door in you opening stage-direction and thereafter to say in plain language by which door a entrance or a exit be to be make in exterior scene where for example tree or clump of shrubbery answer in a measure to the old wing the old terminology may not be quite meaningless but it be far better eschew it be a good general rule to avoid so far as possible expression which show that the author have a stage scene and not a episode of real life before he eye man of the theater be the last to be impress by theatrical jargon and when the play come to be print the general reader be merely bewildered and annoyed by technicality which tend moreover to disturb he illusion a still more emphatic warning must be give against another and more recent abuse in the matter of stage-direction the lue 's indeed be bind very soon to die a natural death the people who require to be warn against they be as a rule scarcely worth warn but it be precisely the cleverest people -lrb- to use clever in a somewhat narrow sense -rrb- who be apt to be lead astray by mr bernard shaw 's practice of expand he stage-direction into essay disquisition monologue pamphlet this be a practice which go far to justify the belief of some foreign critic that the english or since mr shaw be in question let we say the inhabitant of the british island be congenitally incapable of produce a work of pure art we novelist -- field thackeray george eliot -- have be sufficiently though perhaps not unjustly call over the coal for they habit of come in front of they canvas and either gossip with the reader or preach at he but if it be a sound maxim that the novelist should not obtrude he personality on he reader how much more be this true of the dramatist when the dramatist step to the footlights and begin to lecture all illusion be go it may be say that as a matter of fact this do not occur : that on the stage we hear no more of the disquisition of mr shaw and he imitator than we do of the curt and often non-existent stage-direction of shakespeare and he contemporary to this the reply be twofold first the very fact that these disquisition be write prove that the play be design to be print and read and that we be therefore justified in apply to it the standard of what may be call literary illusion second when a playwright get into the habit of talk around he character he inevitably even if unconsciously slacken he endeavor to make they express themselves as completely as may be in they own proper medium of dramatic action and dialogue you can not with impunity mix up two distinct form of art -- the drama and the sociological essay or lecture to mr shaw of course much may and must be forgive he stage-direction be so brilliant that some one some day will assuredly have they speak by a lecturer in the orchestra while the action stand still on the stage thus he will have beget a bastard but highly entertaining form of art my protest have no practical application to he for he be a standing exception to all rule it be to the younger generation that i appeal not to be mislead by he seductive example they have little chance of rival he as sociological essayist but if they treat they art seriously and as a pure art they may easily surpass he as dramatist by adopt he practice they will tend to produce not fine work of art but inferior sociological document they will impair they originality and spoil they play in order to do comparatively badly what mr shaw have do incomparably well the common-sense rule as to stage direction be absolutely plain be they short or be they long they ought always to be _ impersonal _ the playwright who crack joke in he stage-direction or indulge in grace of style be intrude himself between the spectator and the work of art to the inevitable detriment of the illusion in prepare a play for the press the author should make he stage-direction as brief as be consistent with clearness few reader will burden they memory with long and detailed description when a new character of importance appear a short description of he or she personal appearance and dress may be helpful to the reader but even this should be keep impersonal moreover as a play have always to be read before it can be rehearse or act it be no bad plan to make the stage-direction from the first such as tend to bring the play home clearly to the reader 's mental vision and here i may mention a principle base on more than mere convenience which some playwright observe with excellent result not merely in write stage-direction but in visualize a scene the idea of the stage should as far as possible be banish from the author 's mind he should see and describe the room the garden the sea-shore or whatever the place of he action may be not as a stage-scene but as a room garden or sea-shore in the real world the cultivation of this habit ought to be and i believe be in some case a safeguard against theatricality \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : sardou write careful and detailed scenario duma _ fil _ hold it a waste of time to do so pailleron write enormous scenario meilhac very brief one or none at all mr galsworthy rather to my surprise disdain and even condemn the scenario hold that a theme become lifeless when you put down its skeleton on paper sir arthur pinero say : before begin to write a play i always make sure by means of a definite scheme that there be _ a _ way of do it but whether i ultimately follow that way be a totally different matter mr alfr sutro practically confess to a scenario he say : before i start write the dialogue of a play i make sure that i shall have a absolutely free hand over the entrance and exit : in other word that there be ample and legitimate reason for each character appear in any particular scene and ample motive for he leave it mr granville barker do not put on paper a detailed scenario he say : i plan the general scheme and particularly the balance of the play in my head but this of course do not depend entirely on entrance and exit mr henry arthur jone say : i know the lead scene and the general course of action in each act before i write a line when i have get the whole story clear and divide into act i very carefully construct the first act as a series of scene between such and such of the character when the first act be write i carefully construct the second act in the same way -- and so on i sometimes draw up twenty scenario for a act before i can get it to go straight -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : a friend of the late clyde fitch write to I : fitch be often astonished at the way in which he character develop he try to make they do certain thing : they do other -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : this account of the matter seem to find support in a statement by m françois de curel a accomplished psychologist to the effect that during the first few day of work at a play he be clearly conscious of create but that gradually he get into the skin of he character and appear to work by instinct no doubt some artist be actually subject to a sort of hallucination during which they seem rather to record than to invent the doings of they character but this somewhat morbid condition should scarcely be cultivate by the dramatist whose intelligence should always keep a light rein on he more instinctive mental process see _ l'année psychologique _ 1894 p 120 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : sir arthur pinero say : the beginning of a play to I be a little world of people i live with they get familiar with they and _ they _ tell I the story this may sound not unlike the remark of the novelist above quote but the intention be quite different sir arthur simply mean that the story come to he as the character take on life in he imagination mr ha jone write : when you have a character or several character you have not a play you may keep these in you mind and nurse they till they combine in a piece of action but you have not get you play till you have theme character and action all fuse the process with I be as purely automatic and spontaneous as dream in fact it be really dream while you be awake -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : here say a well-known playwright be a common experience you be strike by a idea with which you fall in love ` ha ' you say ` what a superb scene where the man shall find the miss will under the sofa if that do not make they sit up what will ' you begin the play the first act go all right and the second act go all right you come to the third act and somehow it will not go at all you battle with it for week in vain and then it suddenly occur to you ` why i see what be wrong it be that confound scene where the man find the will under the sofa out it must come ' you cut it out and at once all go smooth again but you have

_ in the preface to _ la princesse george _ you should not begin you work he say until you have you conclude scene movement and speech clear in you mind how can you tell what road you ought to take until you know where you be go it be perhaps a more apparent than real contradiction of this rule that until _ iri _ be three part finish sir arthur pinero intend the play to end with the throttling of iris by maldonado the actual end be tantamount to a murder though iris be not actually kill -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : see chapter xviii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 12 : see chapter xx -rrb- -lrb- footnote 13 : most of the dramatist whom i have consult be oppose to the principle of rough out the big scene first and then imbed they as it be in they context sir arthur pinero go the length of say : i can never go on to page 2 until i be sure that page 1 be as right as i can make it indeed when a act be finish i send it at once to the printer confident that i shall not have to go back upon it mr alfr sutro say : i write a play straight ahead from begin to end take practically as long over the first act as over the last three and mr granville barker : i always write the beginning of a play first and the end last : but as to write ` straight ahead ' -- it sound like what one may be able to do in heaven but almost all dramatist i take it jot down brief passage of dialogue which they may or may not eventually work into the texture of they play -rrb- -lrb- footnote 14 : one be not surprise to learn that sardou do he stage-management as he go along and always know exactly the position of he

the ear of the audience they have to be shout in a way -lrb- say m sarcey -rrb- that be fatal to the desire illusion -rrb- _ chapter v _ dramati persona the theme be choose the next step will probably be to determine what character shall be employ in develop it most playwright i take it draw up a provisional dramati persona before begin the serious work of construction ibsen seem always to have do so but in some of he play the list of person be at first considerably larger than it ultimately become the frugal poet sometimes save up the character reject from one play and use they in another thus boletta and hilda wangel be originally intend to have be the daughter of rosmer and bea and the delightful foldal of _ john gabriel borkman _ be a character leave over from _ the lady from the sea _ the playwright can not proceed far in plan out he work without determine roughly at any rate what auxiliary character he mean to employ there be in every play essential character without whom the theme be unthinkable and auxiliary character not indispensable to the theme but simply convenient for fill in the canvas and carry on the action it be not always possible to decide whether a character be essential or auxiliary -- it depend upon how we define the theme in _ hamlet _ for example hamlet claudius and gertrude be manifestly essential : for the theme be the hesitancy of a young man of a certain temperament in take vengeance upon the seducer of he mother and murderer of he father but be ophelia essential or merely auxiliary essential if we consider hamlet 's pessimistic feeling as to woman and the breeding of sinner a necessary part of he character auxiliary if we take the view that without this feeling he would still have be hamlet and the action to all intent and purpose the same the remain character on the other hand be clearly auxiliary this be true even of the ghost : for hamlet might have learn of he father 's murder in fifty other way polonius laerte horatio and the rest might all have be utterly different or might never have exist at all and yet the essence of the play might have remain intact it would be perfectly possible to write a _ hamlet _ after the manner of racine in which there should be only six personage instead of shakespeare 's six-and-twenty : and in this estimate i assume ophelium to be a essential character the dramati persona would be : hamlet he confidant ophelia she confidant and the king and queen who would serve as confidant to each other indeed a economy of one person might be affect by make the queen -lrb- as she naturally might -rrb- play the part of confidant to ophelia shakespeare to be sure do not deliberately choose between he own method and that of racine classic concentration be wholly unsuited to the physical condition of the elizabethan stage on which external movement and bustle be imperatively demand but the modern playwright have a wide latitude of choice in this purely technical matter he may work out he plot with the smallest possible number of character or he may introduce a crowd of auxiliary personage the good craftsman will be guide by the nature of he theme in a broad social study or a picturesque romance you may have as many auxiliary figure as you please in a subtle comedy or a psychological tragedy the essential character should have the stage as much as possible to themselves in becque 's _ la parisienne _ there be only four character and a servant in rostand 's _ cyrano de bergerac _ there be fifty-four personage name in the playbill to say nothing of supernumerary in _ peer gynt _ a satiric phantasmagory ibsen introduce some fifty individual character with numberless supernumerary in _ a enemy of the people _ a social comedy he have eleven character and a crowd for _ ghost _ and _ rosmersholm _ psychological tragedy six person apiece be sufficient it can scarcely be necessary at this time of day to say much on the subject of nomenclature one do occasionally in manuscript of a quite hopeless type find the millionaire 's daughter figure as miss aurea golden and she poor but sprightly cousin as miss lalage gay but the veriest tyro realize as a rule that this sort of punning characterization go out with the eighteenth century or survive into the nineteenth century only as a flagrant anachronism like knee-breeches and hair-powder a curious essay might be write on the reason why such name as sir john brute sir tunbelly clumsy sir peter teazle sir anthony absolute sir lucius o'trigger lord foppington lord rake colonel bully lovewell heartfree gripe shark and the rest be regard as a matter of course in the comedy of manners but have become offensive to-day except in deliberate imitation of the eighteenth-century style the explanation do not lie merely in the contrast between conventional comedy and realistic drama we forefather -lrb- whatever lamb may say -rrb- do not consciously place they comedy in a realm of convention but generally consider themselves and sometimes be realist the fashion of label-name if we may call they so come down from the elizabethan who again borrow it from the mediaeval morality -lrb- 1 -rrb- shakespeare himself give we master slender and justice shallow but it be in the jonsonian comedy of type that the practice of advertise a humor or passion in a name -lrb- english or italian -rrb- establish itself most firmly hence such strange appellative as sir epicure mammon sir amorous la foole morose wellbred downright fastidius brisk volpone corbaccio sordido and fallace after the restoration jonson beaumont and fletcher and massinger be for a time more popular than shakespeare so that the label-name seem to have the sanction of the giant that be before the flood even when comedy begin to deal with individual rather than mere incarnation of a single humor the practice of give they obvious pseudonym hold its ground probably it be reinforce by the analogous practice which obtain in journalism in which real person be constantly allude to -lrb- and libel -rrb- under fictitious designation more or less transparent to the initiate thus a label-name do not carry with it a sense of unreality but rather perhaps a vague suggestion of covert reference to a real person i must not here attempt to trace the stage by which the fashion go out it could doubtless be show that the process of change run parallel to the shrinkage of the apron and the transformation of the platform-stage into the picture-stage that transformation be complete about the middle of the nineteenth century and it be about that time that label-name make they latest appearance in work of any artistic pretension -- witness the lady gay spanker of _ london assurance _ and the captain dudley -lrb- or deadly -rrb- smooth of _ money _ faint trace of the practice survive in tw robertson as in he master thackeray but it be in he earliest play of any note that he call a journalist stylus in he later comedy the name be admirably choose : they be characteristic without eccentricity or punning one feel that eccle in _ caste _ could not possibly have bear any other name how much less living would he be have he be call mr soaker or mr tosspot characteristic without eccentricity -- that be what a name ought to be as the characteristic quality depend upon a hundred indefinable subconscious association it be clearly impossible to suggest any principle of choice the only general rule that can be lay down be that the key of the nomenclature so to speak may rightly vary with the key of the play -- that farcical name be within limit admissible in farce eccentric name in eccentric comedy while soberly appropriate name be alone in place in serious play some dramatist be habitually happy in they nomenclature other much less so ibsen would often change a name three or four time in the course of write a play until at last he arrive at one which seem absolutely to fit the character but the appropriateness of he name be naturally lose upon foreign audience one word may perhaps be say on the recent fashion -- not to say fad -- of suppress in the print play the traditional list of dramati persona björnson in some of he later play be so far as i be aware the first of the modern to adopt this plan i do not know whether he example have influence certain english playwright or whether they arrive independently at the same austere principle by sheer force of individual genius the matter be a trifling one -- so trifling that the departure from establish practice have something of the air of a pedantry it be not on the whole to be approve it add perceptibly to the difficulty which some reader experience in pick up the thread of a play and it deprive other reader of a real and appreciable pleasure of anticipation there be a peculiar and not irrational charm in look down a list of quite unknown name and thinking : in the course of three hour i shall know these people : i shall have read they heart : i shall have live with they through a great crisis in they life : some of they may be my friend for ever it be one of the glory and privilege of the dramatist 's call that he can arouse in we this eager and poignant expectation and i can not commend he wisdom in deliberately take the edge off it and make we feel as though we be not sit down to a play but to a sort of conversational novel a list of character it be true may also affect one with acute anticipation of boredom but i have never yet find a play less tedious by reason of the suppression of the dramati persona \* \* \* \* \* -lrb-

time probable enough in daily life for example a slave might be call onesimus useful or a soldier polemon to imply he warlike function but both name would be familiar to the audience in actual use -rrb- _ book ii _ the begin _ chapter vi _ the point of attack : shakespeare and ibsen though as we have already note the writing of play do not always follow the chronological sequence of event in discuss the process of they evolution we be bind to assume that the playwright begin at the beginning and proceeds in orderly fashion by way of the middle to the end it be one of aristotle 's requirement that a play should have a beginning middle and end and though it may seem that it scarcely need a aristotle to lay down so self-evident a proposition the fact be that playwright be more than sufficiently apt to ignore or despise the rule -lrb- 1 -rrb- especially be there a tendency to rebel against the requirement that a play should have a end we have see a good many play of late which do not end but simply leave off : at they head we might perhaps place ibsen 's _ ghost _ but let we not anticipate for the moment what we have to inquire be where and how a play ought to begin in life there be no such thing as beginning even a man 's birth be a quite arbitrary point at which to launch he biography for the determine factor in he career be to be find in person event and condition that exist before he be ever think of for the biographer however and for the novelist as a writer of fictitious biography birth form a good conventional starting-point he can give a chapter or so to ancestry and then relate the adventure of he hero from the cradle onward but the dramatist as we have see deal not with protracted sequence of event but with short sharp crisis the question for he therefore be : at what moment of the crisis or of its antecedent he have better ring up he curtain at this point he be like the photographer study he finder in order to determine how much of a give prospect he can get in the answer to the question depend on many thing but chiefly on the nature of the crisis and the nature of the impression which the playwright desire to make upon he audience if he play be a comedy and if he object be gently and quietly to interest and entertain the chance be that he begin by show we he personage in they normal state concisely indicate they character circumstance and relation and then let the crisis develop from the outset before we eye if on the other hand he play be of a more stir description and he want to seize the spectator 's attention firmly from the start he will probably go straight at he crisis plunge perhaps into the very middle of it even at the cost of have afterwards to go back in order to put the audience in possession of the antecedent circumstance in a third type of play common of late year and especially affect by ibsen the curtain rise on a surface aspect of profound peace which be presently find to be but a thin crust over a absolutely volcanic condition of affair the origin of which have to be trace backwards it may be for many year let we glance at a few of shakespeare 's opening and consider at what point he attack he various theme of he comedy all except one begin with a simple conversation show a state of affair from which the crisis develop with more or less rapidity but in which it be as yet imperceptibly latent in no case do he plunge into the middle of he subject leave its antecedent to be state in what be technically call a exposition neither in tragedy nor in comedy indeed be this shakespeare 's method in he historical play he rely to some extent on he hearer ' knowledge of history whether gather from book or from previous play of the historical series and where such knowledge be not to be look for he would expound the situation in good set term like those of a euripidean prologue but the chronicle-play be a species apart and practically a extinct species : we need not pause to study its method in he fictitious play with two notable exception it be shakespeare 's constant practice to bring the whole action within the frame of the picture opening at such a point that no retrospect should be necessary beyond what could be convey in a few casual word the exception be _ the tempest _ and _ hamlet _ to which we shall return in due course how do _ the merchant of venice _ open with a long conversation exhibit the character of antonio the friendship between he and bassanio the latter 's financial strait and he purpose of woo portium the second scene display the character of portium and inform we of she father 's device with regard to she marriage but this information be convey in three or four line not till the third scene do we see or hear of shylock and not until very near the end of the act be there any foreshadowing of what be to be the main crisis of the play not a single antecedent event have to be narrate to we for the mere fact that antonio have be uncivil to shylock and show disapproval of he business method can scarcely be regard as a preliminary outside the frame of the picture in _ as you like it _ there be no preliminary to be state beyond the fact that orlando be at enmity with he elder brother and that duke frederick have usurp the coronet and dukedom of rosalind 's father these fact be make apparent without any sort of formal exposition the crisis of the play rapidly announce itself in the wrestling-match and its sequel in _ much ado about nothing _ there be even less of antecedent circumstance to be impart we learn in the first scene indeed that beatrice and benedick have already meet and cross sword but this be not in the least essential to the action the play might have be to all intent and purpose the same have they never hear of each other until after the rise of the curtain in _ twelfth night _ there be a semblance of a retrospective exposition in the scene between viola and the captain but it be of the simplest nature and convey no information beyond what at a later period would have be impart on the playbill thus -- orsino duke of illyrium in love with olivium olivia a heiress in mourning for she brother and so forth in _ the tame of the shrew _ there be no antecedent whatever to be state it be true that lucentio in the opening speech be good enough to inform tranio who he be and what he be do there -- fact with which tranio be already perfectly acquaint but this be merely a conventional opening excuse by the fashion of the time it be in no sense a necessary exposition for the rest the crisis of the play -- the battle between katherine and petruchio -- begin develop and end before we very eye in _ the winter 's tale _ a brief conversation between camillo and archidamus inform we that the king of bohemia be pay a visit to the king of sicilium and that be absolutely all we need to know it be not even necessary that it should be convey to we in this way the situation would be entirely comprehensible if the scene between camillo and archidamus be omit it be needless to go through the whole list of comedy the broad fact be that in all the play commonly so describe except only _ the tempest _ the whole action come within the frame of the picture in _ the tempest _ the poet employ a form of opening which otherwise he reserve for tragedy the first scene be simply a animated tableau calculate to arrest the spectator 's attention without convey to he any knowledge either of situation or character such gleam of character as do in fact appear in the dialogue be scarcely perceive in the hurly-burly of the storm then in the calm which ensue prospero expound to miranda in great detail the antecedent of the crisis now develop it might almost seem indeed that the poet in this he poetic last-will-and-testament intend to warn he successor against the danger of a long narrative exposition for prospero 's story send miranda to sleep be this as it may we have here a case in which shakespeare deliberately adopt the plan of place on the stage not the whole crisis but only its culmination leave its earlier stage to be convey in narrative -lrb- 2 -rrb- it would have be very easy for he to have begin at the beginning and show we in action the event narrate by prospero this course would have involve no greater leap either in time or space than he have perpetrate in the almost contemporary _ winter 's tale _ and it can not be say that there would have be any difficulty in compress into three act or even two the essential of the action of the play as we know it he reason for depart from he usual practice be probably connect with the particular occasion for which the play be write he want to produce a masque rather than a drama we must not therefore attach too much significance to the fact that in almost the only play in which shakespeare seem to have build entirely out of he own head with no previous play or novel to influence he he adopt the plan of go straight to the catastrophe in which he have be anticipate by sophocle -lrb- _ oedipus rex _ -rrb- and be to be follow by ibsen -lrb- _ ghost _ _ rosmersholm _ etc -rrb- come now to the five great tragedy we find that in four of they shakespeare begin as in _ the tempest _ with a picturesque and stir episode calculate to arrest the spectator 's attention and awaken he interest while convey to he little or no information the opening scene of _ romeo and juliet _ be simply a brawl bring home to we vividly the family feud which be the root of the tragedy but inform we of nothing beyond the fact that such a feud exist this be indeed absolutely all that we require to know there be not a single preliminary circumstance outside the limit of the play that have to be explain to we the whole tragedy germinate and culminate within what the prologue call the two hour ' traffick of the stage the opening colloquy of the witch in _ macbeth _ strike the eerie keynote but do nothing more then in the second scene we learn that there have be a great battle and that a nobleman name macbeth have win a victory which cover he with laurel this can in no sense be call a exposition it be the account of a single event not of a sequence and that event be contemporary not antecedent in the third scene the meeting of macbeth and banquo with the witch we have what may be call a exposition reverse not a narrative of the past but a foreshadowing of the future here we touch on one of the subtlest of the playwright 's problem -- the art of arouse anticipation in just the right measure but that be not the matter at present in hand -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the opening scene of _ othello _ it be true that some talk pass between iago and roderigo before they raise the alarm and awaken brabantio but it be carefully non-expository talk it expound nothing but iago 's character far from be a real exception to the rule that shakespeare like to open he tragedy with a very crisply dramatic episode _ othello _ may rather be call its most conspicuous example the rousing of brabantio be immediately follow by the encounter between he man and othello 's which so finely bring out the lofty character of the moor and only in the third scene that of the doge 's council do we pass from shout and sword to quiet discussion and in a sense exposition othello 's great speech while a vital portion of the drama be in so far a exposition that it refer to event which do not come absolutely within the frame of the picture but they be very recent very simple event if othello 's speech be omit or cut down to half a dozen line we should know much less of he character and desdemona 's but the mere action of the play would remain perfectly comprehensible _ king lear _ necessarily open with a great act of state the partition of the kingdom a few word between kent and gloucester show we what be afoot and then at one plunge we be in the thick of the drama there be no opportunity here for one of those picturesque tableau exciting rather than informative which initiate the other tragedy it would have have to be artificially drag in and it be the less necessary as the partition scene take on in a very few line just that arrest stimulate quality which the poet seem to have desire in the opening of a play of this class finally when we turn to _ hamlet _ we find a consummate example of the crisply-touched opening tableau make a nervous rather than a intellectual appeal inform we of nothing but exciting a vivid though quite vague anticipation the silent transit of the ghost desire to speak yet tongue-tied be certainly one of shakespeare 's unrivalled masterpiece of dramatic craftsmanship one could pretty safely wager that if the _ ur-hamlet _ on which shakespeare work be to come to light to-morrow this particular trait would not be find in it but oddly enough into the middle of this admirable opening tableau shakespeare insert a formal exposition introduce in the most conventional way marcellus for some unexplained reason be ignorant of what be evidently common knowledge as to the affair of the realm and ask to be inform whereupon horatio in a speech of some twenty-five line set forth the past relation between norway and denmark and prepare we for the appearance of fortinbra in the fourth act in modern stage version all this fall away and nobody who have not study the print text be conscious of its absence the commentator indeed have prove that fortinbra be a immensely valuable element in the moral scheme of the play but from the point of view of pure drama there be not the slightest necessity for this norwegian-danish embroilment or its consequence -lrb- 4 -rrb- the real exposition -- for _ hamlet _ differ from the other tragedy in require a exposition -- come in the great speech of the ghost in scene v the contrast between this speech and horatio 's lecture in the first scene exemplify the difference between a dramatize and a undramatized exposition the crisis as we now learn begin month or year before the rise of the curtain it begin when claudius inveigle the affection of gertrude and it would have be possible for the poet to have start from this point and show we in action all that he in fact convey to we by way of narration he reason for choose the latter course be abundantly obvious -lrb- 5 -rrb- hamlet the younger be to be the protagonist : the interest of the play be to center in he mental process to have awaken we interest in hamlet the elder would therefore have be a superfluity and a irrelevance moreover -lrb- to say nothing of the fact that the ghost be doubtless a popular figure in the old play and demand by the public -rrb- it be highly desirable that hamlet 's knowledge of the usurper 's crime should come to he from a supernatural witness who could not be cross-questioned or call upon to give material proof this be the readiest as well as the most picturesque method of beget in he that condition of doubt real or affect which be necessary to account for he behavior but to have show we in action the matter of the ghost 's revelation would have be hopelessly to ruin its effect a repetition in narrative of matter already see in action be the grossest of technical blunder -lrb- 6 -rrb- hamlet senior in other word be indispensable in the spirit be superfluous in the flesh but there be another and equally cogent reason for begin the play after the commission of the initial crime or crime to have do otherwise would have be to discount not only the ghost but the play-scene by a piece of consummate ingenuity which may of course have be conceive by the earlier playwright the initial incident of the story be in fact present to we in the guise of a play within the play and as a means to the achievement of one of the greatest dramatic effect in all literature the moment the idea of the play-scene present itself to the author 's mind it become absolutely unthinkable that he should to put it vulgarly queer the pitch for the player by show we the real fact of which they performance be to be the counterfeit presentment the dramatic effect of the incident be incalculably heighten when they be present as in a looking-glass before the guilty pair with the eye of the avenger boring into they soul and have we not here perhaps a clue to one of the most frequent and essential meaning of the word dramatic may we not say that the dramatic quality of a incident be proportionate to the variety -lrb- 7 -rrb- and intensity of the emotion involve in it all this may appear too obvious to be worth set forth at such length very likely it never occur to shakespeare that it be possible to open the play at a earlier point so that he can hardly be say to have exercise a deliberate choice in the matter nevertheless the very obviousness of the consideration involve make this a good example of the importance of discover just the right point at which to raise the curtain in the case of _ the tempest _ shakespeare plunge into the middle of the crisis because he object be to produce a philosophico-dramatic entertainment rather than a play in the strict sense of the word he want room for the enchantment of ariel the brutishness of caliban the humor of stephano and trinculo -- all element extrinsic to the actual story but in _ hamlet _ he adopt a similar course for purely dramatic reason -- in order to concentrate he effect and present the dramatic element of he theme at they highest potency in sum then it be shakespeare 's usual practice history apart to bring the whole action of he play within the frame of the picture leave little or nothing to narrative exposition the two notable exception to this rule be those we have just examine -- _ hamlet _ and _ the tempest _ furthermore he usually open he comedy with quiet conversational passage present the antecedent of the crisis with great deliberation in he tragedy on the other hand he be apt to lead off with a crisp somewhat startling passage of more or less vehement action appeal rather to the nerve than to the intelligence -- such a passage as gustav freytag in he _ technik des drama _ happily entitle a _ einleitende akkord _ a introductory chord it may be add that this rule hold good both for _ coriolanus _ and for _ julius caesar _ in which the keynote be briskly strike in highly animated scene of commotion among the roman populace let we now look at the practice of ibsen which offer a sharp contrast to that of shakespeare to put it briefly the play in which ibsen get he whole action within the frame of the picture be as exceptional as those in which shakespeare do not do so ibsen 's practice in this matter have be compare with that of the greek dramatist who also be apt to attack they crisis in the middle or even towards the end rather than at the begin it must not be forget however that there be one great difference between he position and theirs they could almost always rely upon a general knowledge on the part of the audience of the theme with which they be deal the purpose even of the euripidean prologue be not so much to state unknown fact as to recall fact vaguely remember to state the particular version of a legend which the poet propose to adopt and to define the point in the development of the legend at which he be about to set he figure in motion ibsen on the other hand draw upon no storehouse of tradition he have to convey to he audience everything that he want they to know and this be often a long and complex series of fact the earliest play in which ibsen can be say to show maturity of craftsmanship be _ the viking at helgeland _ it be curious to note that both in _ the viking _ and in _ the pretender _ two play which be in some measure comparable with shakespearean tragedy he open with a firmly-touched _ einleitende akkord _ in _ the viking _ ornulf and he son encounter and fight with sigurd and he man very much after the fashion of the montague and capulet in _ romeo and juliet _ in _ the pretender _ the rival faction of haakon and skule stand outside the cathedral of bergen intently await the result of the ordeal which be proceed within and though they do not there and then come to blow the air be electrical with they conflict ambition and passion he modern play on the other hand ibsen open quietly enough though usually with some more or less arrest little incident calculate to arouse immediate curiosity one may cite as characteristic example the hurry colloquy between engstrand and regina in _ ghost _ rebecca and madam helseth in _ rosmersholm _ watch to see whether rosmer will cross the mill-race and in _ the master builder _ old brovik 's querulous outburst immediately follow by the entrance of solness and he mysterious behavior towards kaia the opening of _ hedda gabler _ with its long conversation between miss tesman and the servant bertha come as near as ibsen ever do to the conventional exposition of the french stage conduct by a footman and a parlour-maid engage in dust the furniture on the other hand there never be a more masterly opening in its sheer simplicity than nora 's entrance in _ a doll 's house _ and the little silent scene that precede the appearance of helmer regard _ the viking _ as ibsen 's first mature production and survey the whole series of he subsequent work in which he have stage presentation directly in view -lrb- 8 -rrb- we find that in only two out of the fifteen play do the whole action come within the frame of the picture these two be _ the league of youth _ and _ a enemy of the people _ in neither of these have any antecedent to be state neither turn upon any disclosure of bygone event or emotion we be indeed afford brief glimpse into the past both of stensgaard and of stockmann but the glimpse be incidental and inessential it be certainly no mere coincidence that if one be ask to pick out the piece of thinnest texture in all ibsen 's mature work one would certainly select these two play far be it from I to disparage _ a enemy of the people _ as a work of art it be incomparably greater than such a piece as _ pillar of society _ but it be not so richly weave not as it be so deep in pile write in half the time ibsen usually devote to a play it be a outburst of humorous indignation a _ jeu d'esprit _ one might almost say though the _ jeu _ of a giant _ esprit _ observe the effect of comparative tenuity in these two play we can not but surmise that the secret of the depth and richness of texture so characteristic of ibsen 's work lay in he art of closely interweave a drama of the present with a drama of the past _ a enemy of the people _ be a straightforward spirited melody _ the wild duck _ and _ rosmersholm _ be subtly and intricately harmonize go a little more into detail we find in ibsen 's work a extraordinary progress in the art of so unfold the drama of the past as to make the gradual revelation no mere preface or prologue to the drama of the present but a integral part of its action it be true that in _ the viking _ he already show himself a master in this art the great revelation -- the disclosure of the fact that sigurd not gunnar do the deed of prowess which hiördis demand of the man who should be she mate -- this crucial revelation be bring about in a scene of the utmost dramatic intensity the whole drama of the past indeed -- both its fact and its emotion -- may be say to be drag to light in the very stress and pressure of the drama of the present not a single detail of it be narrate in cold blood as for example prospero relate to miranda the story of they marooning or horatio expound the norwegian-danish political situation i be not hold up _ the viking _ as a great masterpiece it have many weakness both of substance and of method but in this particular art of indistinguishably blend the drama of the present with the drama of the past it be already consummate _ the pretender _ scarcely come into the comparison it be ibsen 's one chronicle-play and like shakespeare he do not shrink from employ a good deal of narrative though he narrative it must be say be always introduce under such circumstance as to make they a vital part of the drama it be when we come to the modern play that we find the poet fall back upon conventional and somewhat clumsy method of exposition which he only by degree though by rapid degree unlearn _ the league of youth _ as we have see require no exposition all we have to learn be the exist relation of the character which appear quite naturally as the action proceeds but let we look at _ pillar of society _ here we have to be place in possession of a whole antecedent drama : the intrigue of karsten bernick with dina dorf 's mother the threaten scandal johan tönnesen 's vicarious acceptance of bernick 's responsibility the subsidiary scandal of lona hessel 's outburst on learning of bernick 's engagement to she half-sister the report of a embezzlement commit by johan before he departure for america all this have to be convey to we in retrospect or rather in the first place we have to be inform of the false version of these incident which be current in the little town and on which bernick 's moral and commercial prestige be build up what device then do ibsen adopt to this end he introduce a sewing-bee of tattle woman one of whom happen to be a stranger to the town and unfamiliar with its gossip into she willing ear the other pour the popular version of the bernick story and this impartment effect the group of gossip disappear to be hear of no more these lady perform the function in fact of the first second and third gentleman so common in elizabethan and pseudo-elizabethan play -lrb- 9 -rrb- they be not quite so artless in they conventionality for they bring with they the social atmosphere of the tattle little town which be a essential factor in the drama moreover they exposition be not a simple narrative of fact it be to some extent subtilize by the circumstance that the fact be not fact and that the gist of the drama be to lie in the gradual triumph of the truth over this tissue of falsehood still explain it as we may the fact remain that in no later play do ibsen initiate we into the preliminary of he action by so hackneyed and unwieldy a device it be no conventional canon but a maxim of mere common sense that the dramatist should be chary of introduce character who have no personal share in the drama and be mere mouthpiece for the conveyance of information nowhere else do ibsen so flagrantly disregard so obvious a principle of dramatic economy -lrb- 10 -rrb- when we turn to he next play _ a doll 's house _ we find that he have already make a great step in advance he have progress from the first second and third gentleman of the elizabethan to the confidant -lrb- 11 -rrb- of the french classic drama he even attempt not very successfully to disguise the confidant by give she a personal interest a effective share in the drama nothing can really dissemble the fact that the long scene between nora and mr linden which occupy almost one-third of the first act be simply a formal exposition outside the action of the play just as it be providential that one of the house-wife of the sewing-bee in _ pillar of society _ should have be a stranger to the town so it be the luckiest of chance -lrb- for the dramatist 's convenience -rrb- that a old school-friend should have drop in from the cloud precisely half-an-hour before the entrance of krogstad bring to a sudden head the great crisis of nora 's life this happy conjuncture of event be manifestly artificial : a trick of the dramatist 's trade : a point at which he art do not conceal he art mr linden do not like the dame of the sewing-bee fade out of the saga she even through she influence on krogstad play a determine part in the development of the action but to all intent and purpose she remain a mere confidant a pretext for nora 's review of the history of she married life there be two other specimen of the genus confidant in ibsen 's later play arnholm in _ the lady from the sea _ be little more dr herdal in _ the master builder _ be that and nothing else it may be allege in he defense that the family physician be the professional confidant of real life in _ ghost _ ibsen make a sudden leap to the extreme of he retrospective method i be not one of those who consider this play ibsen 's masterpiece : i do not even place it technically in the first rank among he work and why because there be here no reasonable equilibrium between the drama of the past and the drama of the present the drama of the past be almost everything the drama of the present next to nothing as soon as we have probe to the depths the alving marriage and its consequence the play be over and there be nothing left but for regina to set off in pursuit of the joy of life and for oswald to collapse into imbecility it be scarcely a exaggeration to call the play all exposition and no drama here for the first time however ibsen perfect he peculiar gift of impart tense dramatic interest to the unveiling of the past while in one sense the play be all exposition in another sense it may quite as truly be say to contain no exposition for it contain no narrative deliver in cold blood in mere calm retrospection as a necessary preliminary to the drama which be in the meantime wait at the door in other word the exposition be all drama it _ be _ the drama the person who be tear the veil from the past and for whom the veil be be tear be intensely concern in the process which actually constitute the dramatic crisis the discovery of this method or its rediscovery in modern drama -lrb- 12 -rrb- be ibsen 's great technical achievement in he best work the progress of the unveiling occasion a marked development or series of change in the actual and present relation of the character the drama of the past and the drama of the present proceed so to speak in interlace rhythm or as i say before in a rich complex harmony in _ ghost _ this harmony be not so rich as in some later play because the drama of the present be disproportionately meager none the less or all the more be it a conspicuous example of ibsen 's method of raise he curtain not at the beginning of the crisis but rather at the beginning of the catastrophe in _ a enemy of the people _ as already state he momentarily desert that method and give we a action which begin develop and end entirely within the frame of the picture but in the two follow play _ the wild duck _ and _ rosmersholm _ he touch the highest point of technical mastery in he interweaving of the past with the present i shall not attempt any analysis of the fabric of these play the process would be long tedious and unhelpful for no one could hope to employ a method of such complexity without something of ibsen 's genius and genius will evolve its method for itself let I only ask the reader to compare the scene between old werle and greger in the first act of _ the wild duck _ with the scene between nora and mr linden in the first act of _ a doll 's house _ and mark the technical advance both scene be in a sense scene of exposition both be mainly design to place we in possession of a sequence of bygone fact but while the _ doll 's house _ scene be a piece of quiet gossip bring about -lrb- as we have note -rrb- by rather artificial means and with no dramatic tension in it the _ wild duck _ scene be a piece of tense one might almost say fierce drama fulfil the brunetière definition in that it show we two character a father and son at open war with each other the one scene be outside the real action the other be a integral part of it the one belong to ibsen 's tentative period the other usher in one might almost say he period of consummate mastery -lrb- 13 -rrb- _ rosmersholm _ be so obviously nothing but the catastrophe of a antecedent drama that a attempt have actually be make to rectify ibsen 's suppose mistake and to write the tragedy of the deceased bea it be make by a unskilful hand but even a skilful hand would scarcely have do more than prove how rightly ibsen judge that the recoil of rebecca 's crime upon herself and rosmer would prove more interesting and in a very real sense more dramatic than the somewhat vulgar process of the crime itself the play be not so profound in its humanity as _ the wild duck _ but it be ibsen 's masterpiece in the art of withdraw veil after veil from the technical point of view it will repay the closest study we need not look closely at the remain play _ hedda gabler _ be perhaps that in which a sound proportion between the past and the present be most successfully preserve the interest of the present action be throughout very vivid but it be all root in fact and relation of the past which be elicit under circumstance of high dramatic tension here again it be instructive to compare the scene between hedda and thea in the first act with the scene between nora and mr linden both be scene of exposition : and each be in its way character-revealing but the earlier scene be a passage of quite unemotional narrative the later be a passage of palpitating drama in the play subsequent to _ hedda gabler _ it can not be deny that the past take the upper hand of the present to a degree which could only be justify by the genius of a ibsen three-fourth of the action of _ the master builder _ _ little eyolf _ _ john gabriel borkman _ and _ when we dead awaken _ consist of what may be call a passionate analysis of the past ibsen have the art of make such a analysis absorbingly interesting but it be not a formulum to be commend for the practical purpose of the everyday stage

situation be not a idea a idea have a begin a middle and a end : a exposition a development a conclusion any one can relate a dramatic situation : the art lie in prepare it get it accept render it possible especially in untie the knot -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : this be what we regard as peculiarly the method of ibsen there be however this essential difference that instead of narrate he preliminary in cold blood ibsen in he best work _ dramatize _ the narration -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : see chapter xii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : this must not be take to imply that in a good stage-version of the play fortinbra should be altogether omit mr forbe robertson in he lyceum revival of 1897 find several advantage in he retention among the rest it permit the retention of one of hamlet 's most characteristic soliloquy -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : i omit all speculation as to the form which the story assume in the _ ur-hamlet _ we have no evidence on the point and as the poet be no doubt free to remodel the material as he think fit even in follow he original he be make a deliberate artistic choice -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : shakespeare commit it in _ romeo and juliet _ where he make friar laurence in the conclude scene retell the whole story of the tragedy even in so early a play such a manifest redundancy seem unaccountable a narrative of thing already see may of course be a trait of character in the person deliver it but in that case it will generally be mendacious -lrb- for instance falstaff and the man in buckram -rrb- or it may be introduce for the sake of its effect upon the character to whom the narration be address but in these case its purpose be no longer to convey information to the audience -- it belong not to the intelligence department but to the department of analysis -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : i say variety rather than complexity because i take it that the emotion of all concern be here too intense to be very complex the effect of the scene would appear to lie in the rapidly increase intensity of comparatively simple emotion in hamlet in the king in the queen and in the amaze and bewildered courtier -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : this exclude _ love 's comedy brand peer gynt _ and _ emperor and galilean _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : see for example _ king henry viii _ act iv and the opening scene of tennyson 's _ queen mary _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : this rule of economy do not necessarily exclude a group of character perform something like the function of the antique chorus that be to say comment upon the action from a more or less disinterested point of view the function of _ kaffee-klatsch _ in _ pillar of society _ be not at all that of the chorus but rather that of the euripidean prologue somewhat thinly disguise -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : it be perhaps worth nothing that gabriele d'annunzio in _ la gioconda _ revert to and outdo the french classic convention by give we three actor and four confidant the play consist of a crisis in three life passively though sympathetically contemplate by what be in effect a chorus of two man and two woman it would be interesting to inquire why in this particular play such a abuse of the confidant seem quite admissible if not conspicuously right -rrb- -lrb- footnote 12 : dryden in he _ essay of dramatic poesy _ represent this method as be characteristic of greek tragedy as a whole the tragic poet he say set the audience as it be at the post where the race be to be conclude and save they the tedious expectation of see the poet set out and ride the beginning of the course they suffer you not to behold he till he be in sight of the goal and just upon you dryden seem to think that the method be force upon they by the rule of time -rrb- -lrb- footnote 13 : it be a rash enterprise to reconstruct ibsen but one can not help wonder how he would have plan _ a doll 's house _ have he write it in the ` eighty instead of the ` seventy one can imagine a long opening scene between helmer and nora in which a great deal of the necessary information might have be convey while it would have heighten by contrast the effect of the great final duologue as we now possess it such information as could not possibly have be convey in dialogue with helmer might one would think have be leave for nora 's first scene with krogstad the effect of which it would have enhance perhaps mr linden might with advantage have be retain though not in she present character of confidant in order to show nora in relation to another woman -rrb- _ chapter vii _ exposition : its end and its means we have pass in rapid survey the practice of shakespeare and ibsen in respect of they point and method of attack upon they theme what practical lesson can we now deduce from this examination one thing be clear : namely that there be no inherent superiority in one method over another there be masterpiece in which the whole crisis fall within the frame of the picture and masterpiece in which the greater part of the crisis have to be convey to we in retrospect only the catastrophe be transact before we eye genius can manifest itself equally in either form but each form have its peculiar advantage you can not in a retrospective play like _ rosmersholm _ attain anything like the magnificent onward rush of othello which move -- like to the pontick sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er feel retire ebb but keep due on to the propontick and the hellespont the movement of _ rosmersholm _ be rather like that of a wind river which flow with a full and steady current but seem sometimes to be almost retrace its course if then you aim at rapidity of movement you will choose a theme which leave little or nothing to retrospect and conversely if you have a theme the whole of which fall easily and conveniently within the frame of the picture you will probably take advantage of the fact to give you play animated and rapid movement there be a undeniable attraction in a play which constitute so to speak one brisk and continuous adventure begin develop and end before we eye for light comedy in particular be this a desirable form and for romantic play in which no very search character-study be attempt _ the tame of the shrew _ no doubt pass for a light comedy in shakespeare 's day though we describe it by a briefer name its rapid bustling action be possible because we be always ready to take the character of a shrew for grant it would have be a very different play have the poet require to account for katharine 's peculiarity of temper by a retrospective study of she heredity and upbringe many eighteenth-century comedy be single-adventure play or dual-adventure play in the sense that the main action sometimes stand aside to let a underplot take the stage both _ she stoop to conquer _ and _ the rival _ be good example of the rapid working-out of a intrigue engender develop and resolve all within the frame of the picture single-adventure play of a more modern type be the elder duma 's _ mademoiselle de belle-isle _ the younger duma 's _ francillon _ sardou 's _ divorçons _ sir arthur pinero 's _ gay lord quex _ mr shaw 's _ devil 's disciple _ oscar wilde 's _ importance of be earnest _ mr galsworthy 's _ silver box _ widely as these play differ in type and tone they be alike in this that they do not attempt to present very complex character-study or to probe the deep of human experience the last play cite _ the silver box _ may perhaps be think a exception to this rule but though the experience of the hapless charwoman be pitiful enough hers be a simple soul so inured to suffer that a little more or less be no such great matter the play be a admirable genre-picture rather than a search tragedy the point to be observe be that under modern condition it be difficult to produce a play of very complex psychological moral or emotional substance in which the whole crisis come within the frame of the picture the method of attack the crisis in the middle or towards the end be really a device for relax in some measure the narrow bound of theatrical representation and enable the playwright to deal with a larger segment of human experience it may be ask why modern condition should in this respect differ from elizabethan condition and why if shakespeare could produce such profound and complex tragedy as _ othello _ and _ king lear _ without a word of exposition or retrospect the modern dramatist should not go and do likewise the answer to this question be not simply that the modern dramatist be seldom a shakespeare that be true but we must look deeper than that there be in fact several point to be take into consideration for one thing -- this be a minor point -- shakespeare have really far more elbow-room than the playwright of to-day _ othello _ and _ king lear _ to say nothing of _ hamlet _ be exceedingly long play something like a third of they be omit in modern representation and when we speak of they richness and complexity of characterization we do not think simply of the play as we see they compress into act limit but of the play as we know they in the study it be possible no doubt for modern playwright to let themselves go in the matter of length and then print they play with bracket or other mark to show the passage omit in representation this be however essentially a inartistic practice and one can not regret that it have go out of fashion another point to be consider be this : be othello and lear really very complex character-study they be extremely vivid : they be project with enormous energy in action whose violence afford scope for the most vehement self-expression but be they not in reality colossally simple rather than complex it be true that in lear the phenomenon of insanity be reproduce with astonishing minuteness and truth but this do not imply any elaborate analysis or demand any great space hamlet be complex and be i talk for victory i should point out that _ hamlet _ be of all the tragedy precisely the one which do not come within the frame of the picture but the true secret of the matter do not lie here : it lie in the fact that hamlet unpack he heart to we in a series of soliloquy -- a device employ scarcely at all in the portrayal of othello and lear and deny to the modern dramatist -lrb- 1 -rrb- yet again the social position and environment of the great shakespearean character be take for grant no time be spend in place they in a give stratum of society or in establish they heredity tradition education and so forth and finally the very copiousness of expression permit by the rhetorical elizabethan form come to shakespeare 's aid the modern dramatist be hamper by all sort of reticence he have often to work rather in indirect suggestion than in direct expression he have in short to submit to a hundred hamper condition from which shakespeare be exempt wherefore even if he have shakespeare 's genius he would find it difficult to produce a very profound effect in a crisis work out from first to last before the eye of the audience nevertheless as before state such a crisis have a charm of its own there be a peculiar interest in watch the rise and development out of nothing as it be of a dramatic complication for this class of play -lrb- despite the shakespearean precedent -rrb- a quiet opening be often advisable rather than a strong _ einleitende akkord _ from calm through storm to calm be its characteristic formulum whether the conclude calm be one of life and serenity or of despair and death to my personal taste one of the keenest form of theatrical enjoyment be that of see the curtain go up on a picture of perfect tranquillity wonder from what quarter the drama be go to arise and then watch it gather on the horizon like a cloud no bigger than a man 's hand of this type of open _ a enemy of the people _ provide we with a classic example and among english play we may cite mr shaw 's _ candida _ mr barker 's _ waste _ and mr besier 's _ don _ in which so sudden and unlooked-for a cyclone swoop down upon the calm of a english vicarage a admirable instance of a fantastic type may be find in _ prunellum _ by messr barker and housman -lrb- 2 -rrb- there be much to be say however in favor of the opening which do not present a aspect of delusive calm but show the atmosphere already charge with electricity compare for instance the opening of _ the case of rebellious susan _ by mr henry arthur jone with that of a french play of very similar theme -- duma 's _ francillon _ in the latter we see the storm-cloud slowly gather up on the horizon in the former it be already on the point of break right overhead mr jone place we at the beginning where duma leave we at the end of he first act it be true that at the end of mr jone 's act he have not advance any further than duma the french author show he heroine gradually work up to a nervous crisis the english author introduce he heroine already at the height of she paroxysm and the act consist of the unavailing effort of she friend to smooth she down the upshot be the same but in mr jone 's act we be as the french say in full drama all the time while in duma 's we await the come of the drama and only by exert all he wit not to say over-exerting it do he prevent we feeling impatient i be not claim superiority for either method i merely point to a good example of two different way of attack the same problem in _ the benefit of the doubt _ by sir arthur pinero we have a crisply dramatic opening of the very best type a few word from a contemporary criticism may serve to indicate the effect it produce on a first-night audience -- we be in the thick of the action at once or at least in the thick of the interest so that the exposition instead of be so to speak a mere platform from which the train be presently to start become a inseparable part of the movement the sense of dramatic irony be strongly and yet delicately suggest we foresee a peripety apparent prosperity suddenly crumble into disaster within the act itself and when it come it awaken we sympathy and redouble we interest almost the same word might be apply to the opening of _ the climber _ by the late clyde fitch one of the many individual scene which make one deeply regret that mr fitch do not live to do full justice to he remarkable talent one of the ablest of recent opening be that of mr galsworthy 's _ silver box _ the curtain rise upon a solid dull upper-middle-class dining-room empty and silent the electric light burn the tray with whiskey siphon and cigarette-box mark the midnight hour then we have the stumble fumble entrance of jack barthwick beatifically drunk he maudlin babble and he ill-omened hospitality to the haggard loafer who follow at he heel another example of a high-pitched opening scene may be find in mr perceval landon 's _ the house opposite _ here we have a midnight parting between a married woman and she lover in the middle of which the man glance at the light window of the house opposite see a figure move in such a way as to suggest that a crime be be perpetrate as a matter of fact a old man be murder and he housekeeper be accuse of the crime the hero if so he can be call know that it be a man not a woman who be in the victim 's room that night and the problem be : how can he give he evidence without betray a woman 's secret by admit he presence in she house at midnight i neither praise nor blame this class of story i merely cite the play as one in which we plunge straight into the crisis without any introductory period of tranquillity the interest of mr landon 's play lay almost wholly in the story there be just enough character in it to keep the story go so to speak the author might on the other hand have concentrate we attention on character and make he play a soul-tragedy but in that case it would doubtless have be necessary to take we some way backward in the heroine 's antecedent and the history of she marriage in other word if the play have go deeper into human nature the preliminary of the crisis would have have to be trace in some detail possibly in a first act introductory to the actual opening but more probably and better in a exposition follow the crisply touch _ einleitende akkord _ this bring we to the question how a exposition may best be manage it may not unreasonably be contend i think that when a exposition can not be thoroughly dramatize -- that be wring out in the stress of the action from the character primarily concern -- it may best be dismiss rapidly and even conventionally by any not too improbable device that be the principle on which sir arthur pinero have always proceed and for which he have be unduly censure by critic who make no allowance for the narrow limit impose by custom and the constitution of the modern audience upon the playwright of to-day in _ he house in order _ -lrb- one of he greatest play -rrb- sir arthur effect part of he exposition by the simple device of make hilary jesson a candidate for parliament and bring on a reporter to interview he private secretary the incident be perfectly natural and probable all one can say of it be that it be perhaps a over-simplification of the dramatist 's task -lrb- 3 -rrb- _ the second mr tanqueray _ require a unusual amount of preliminary retrospect we have to learn the history of aubrey tanqueray 's first marriage with the mother of ellean as well as the history of paulum ray 's past life the mechanism employ to this end have be much criticize but seem to I admirable aubrey give a farewell dinner-party to he intimate friend misquith and jayne cayley drummle too be expect but have not arrive when the play open without name the lady aubrey announce to he guest he approach marriage he propose to go out with they and have one or two note to write before do so moreover he be not sorry to give they a opportunity to talk over the announcement he have make so he retire to a side-table in the same room to do he write misquith and jayne exchange a few speech in a undertone and then cayley drummle come in bring the story of george orreyd 's marriage to the unmentionable miss hervey this story be so unpleasant to tanqueray that to get out of the conversation he return to he write but still he can not help listen to cayley 's comment on george orreyd 's disappearance and at last the situation become so intolerable to he that he purposely leave the room bidding the other two tell cayley the news the technical manipulation of all this seem to I above reproach -- dramatically effective and yet life-like in every detail if one be bind to raise a objection it would be to the coincidence which bring to cayley 's knowledge on one and the same evening two such exactly similar misalliance in he own circle of acquaintance but these be just the coincidence that do constantly happen every one know that life be full of they the exposition might no doubt have be more economically effect cayley drummle might have figure as sole confidant and chorus or even he might have be dispense with and all that be necessary might have appear in colloquy between aubrey and paulum on the one hand aubrey and ellean on the other but cayley as sole confidant -- the charle he friend of eighteenth-century comedy -- would have be more plainly conventional than cayley as one of a trio of aubrey 's old crony represent the society he be sacrifice in enter upon this experimental marriage and to have convey the necessary information without any confidant or chorus at all would -lrb- one fancy -rrb- have strain probability or still worse impaired consistency of character aubrey could not naturally discuss he late wife either with she successor or with she daughter while as for paulum 's past all he want be to avert he eye from it i do not say that these difficulty might not have be overcome for in the vocabulary of the truly ingenious dramatist there be no such word as impossible but i do suggest that the result would scarcely have be worth the trouble and that it be hyper-criticism which object to a exposition so natural and probable as that of _ the second mr tanqueray _ simply on the ground that certain character be introduce for the purpose of convey certain information it would be foolish to expect of every work of art a absolutely austere economy of means sometimes however sir arthur pinero injudiciously emphasize the artifice employ to bring about a exposition in _ the thunderbolt _ for instance in order that the mortimore ' family solicitor may without reproach ask for information on matter with which a family solicitor ought to be fully conversant it have to be explain that the senior partner of the firm who have the mortimore business specially in hand have be call away to london and that a junior partner have take he place such a rubbing-in as it be of a obvious device ought at all hazard to be avoid if the information can not be otherwise impart -lrb- as in this case it surely could -rrb- the solicitor have better be allow to ask one or two improbable question -- it be the lesser evil of the two when the whole of a give subject can not be get within the limit of presentation be there any means of determine how much should be leave for retrospect and at what point the curtain ought to be raise the principle would seem to be that slow and gradual process and especially separate line of causation should be leave outside the frame of the picture and that the curtain should be raise at the point where separate line have converge and where the crisis begin to move towards its solution with more or less rapidity and continuity the idea of rapidity and continuity may be conveniently sum up in the hackneyed and often misapplied term unity of action though the unity of time and place be long ago explode as binding principle -- indeed they never have any authority in english drama -- yet it be true that a broken-backed action whether in time or space ought so far as possible to be avoid a action with a gap of twenty year in it may be all very well in melodrama or romance but scarcely in higher and more serious type of drama -lrb- 4 -rrb- especially be it to be desire that interest should be concentrate on one set of character and should not be fritter away on subsidiary or preliminary personage take for instance the case of _ the second mr tanqueray _ it would have be theoretically possible for sir arthur pinero to have give we either -lrb- or both -rrb- of two preliminary scene : he might have show we the first mr tanqueray at home and at the same time have introduce we more at large to the character of aubrey and ellean or he might have depict for we one of the previous association of paulum ray -- might perhaps have let we see she keep house with hugh ardale but either of these opening would have be disproportionate and superfluous it would have excite or try to excite we interest in something that be not the real theme of the play and in character which be to drop out before the real theme -- the aubrey-paula marriage -- be reach therefore the author in all probability never think of begin at either of these point he pass instinctively to the point at which the two line of causation converge and from which the action could be carry continuously forward by one set of character he know that we could learn in retrospect all that it be necessary for we to know of the first mr tanqueray and that to introduce she in the flesh would be merely to lead the interest of the audience into a blind alley and to break the back of he action again in _ he house in order _ it may seem that the intrigue between maurewarde and the immaculate annabel with its tragic conclusion would have make a stir introductory act but to have present such a act would have be to destroy the unity of the play which centre in the character of nina annabel be another story and to have tell or rather show we more of it than be absolutely necessary would have be to distract we attention from the real theme of the play while at the same time fatally curtail the all-too-brief time available for the working-out of that theme there be case no doubt when verbal exposition may advantageously be avoid by means of a dramatize prologue -- a single act constitute a little drama in itself and generally separate by a considerable space of time from the action proper but this method be scarcely to be commend except as aforesaid for purpose of melodrama and romance a prologue be for such play as _ the prisoner of zenda _ and _ the only way _ not for such play as _ he house in order _ the question whether a legato or a staccato opening be the more desirable must be decide in accordance with the nature and opportunity of each theme the only rule that can be state be that when the attention of the audience be require for a exposition of any length some attempt ought to be make to awaken in advance they general interest in the theme and character it be dangerous to plunge straight into narrative or unemotional discussion without have first make the audience actively desire the information to be convey to they especially be it essential that the audience should know clearly who be the subject of the discussion or narrative -- that they should not be mere name to they it be a grave flaw in the construction of mr granville barker 's otherwise admirable play _ waste _ that it should open with a long discussion by people whom we scarcely know of other people whom we do not know at all whose name we may or may not have note on the playbill trebell lord charle cantelupe and blackborough ought certainly to have be present to we in the flesh however briefly and summarily before we be ask to interest ourselves in they character and the political situation arise from they there be however one limitation to this principle a great effect be sometimes attain by retard the entrance of a single lead figure for a whole act or even two while he be so constantly talk about as to beget in the audience a vivid desire to make he personal acquaintance thus molière 's tartufe do not come on the stage until the third act of the comedy which bear he name ibsen 's john gabriel borkman be unseen until the second act though -lrb- through he wife 's ear -rrb- we have already hear he pacing up and down he room like a wolf in he cage dubedat in _ the doctor 's dilemma _ be not reveal to we in the flesh until the second act but for this device to be successful it be essential that only one lead character -lrb- 5 -rrb- should remain unseen on whom the attention of the audience may by that very fact be rivet in _ waste _ for instance all would have be well have it suit mr barker 's purpose to leave trebell invisible till the second act while all the character in the first act clearly present to we canvass he from they various point of view keen expectancy in short be the most desirable frame of mind in which a audience can be place so long as the expectancy be not ultimately disappointed but there be no less desirable mental attitude than that of strain after gleam of guidance in a expository twilight the advantage of a staccato opening -- or to vary the metaphor a brisk highly aerated introductory passage -- be clearly exemplify in _ a doll 's house _ it would have be quite possible for ibsen to have send up he curtain upon nora and mr linden seat comfortably before the stove and exchange confidence as to they respective career nothing indispensable would have be omit but how languid would have be the interest of the audience as it be a brief bright scene have already introduce we not only to nora but to helmer and arouse a eager desire for further insight into the affair of this -- to all appearance -- radiantly happy household therefore we settle down without impatience to listen to the fireside gossip of the two old school-fellow the problem of how to open a play be complicate in the english theater by consideration wholly foreign to art until quite recently it use to be hold impossible for a playwright to raise he curtain upon he lead character or character because the actor-manager would thus be baulk of he carefully arrange entrance and reception and furthermore because twenty-five per cent of the audience would probably arrive about a quarter of a hour late and would thus miss the opening scene or scene it use at one time to be the fashion to add to the advertisement of a play a entreaty that the audience should be punctually in they seat as the interest begin with the rise of the curtain one have see this assertion make with regard to play in which as a matter of fact the interest have not begin at the fall of the curtain nowadays manager and even lead lady be a good deal less insistent on they reception than they use to be they realize that it may be a distinct advantage to hold the stage from the very outset there be few more effective opening than that of _ the second mr tanqueray _ where we find aubrey tanqueray seat squarely at he bachelor dinner-table with misquith on he right and jayne on he left it may even be take as a principle that where it be desire to give to one character a special prominence and predominance it ought if possible to be the first figure on which the eye of the audience fall in a sherlock holme play for example the curtain ought assuredly to rise on the great sherlock enthrone in baker street with dr watson sit at he foot the solitary entrance of richard iii throw he figure into a relief which could by no other means have be attain so too it would have be a mistake on sophocle ' part to let any one but the protagonist open the _ oedipus rex _ so long as the fashion of late dinner continue however it must remain a measure of prudence to let nothing absolutely essential to the comprehension of a play be say or do during the first ten minute after the rise of the curtain here again _ a doll 's house _ may be cite as a model though ibsen certainly have no thought of the british dinner-hour in plan the play the opening scene be just what the ideal opening scene ought to be -- invaluable yet not indispensable the late-comer who miss it deprive himself of a preliminary glimpse into the character of nora and helmer and the relation between they but he miss nothing that be absolutely essential to he comprehension of the play as a whole this then would appear to be a sound maxim both of art and prudence : let you first ten minute by all means be crisp arrest stimulating but do not let they embody any absolutely vital matter ignorance of which would leave the spectator in the dark as to the general design and purport of the play \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : see chapter xxiii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : henrus becque 's two best-known play aptly exemplify the two type of open in _ les corbeaux _ we have almost a entire act of calm domesticity in which the only hint of come trouble be a allusion to vigneron 's attack of vertigo in _ la parisienne _ clotilde and lafont be in the thick of a vehement quarrel over a letter it proceed for ten minute or so at the end of which clotilde say prenez garde voilà mon marus -- and we find that the two be not husband and wife but wife and lover -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : mr craigie -lrb- john oliver hobbe -rrb- open she very successful play _ the ambassador _ with a scene between juliet desborough and she sister alice a nun who apparently leave she convent specially to hear she sister 's confession and then return to it for ever this be certainly not a economical form of exposition but it be not unsuited to the type of play -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : in that charming comedy _ rosemary _ by messr parker and carson there be a gap of fifty year between the last act and its predecessor but the so-called last act be only a epi-monologue -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : or at most two closely connected character : for instance a husband and wife -rrb- _ chapter viii _ the first act both in the theory and in practice of late year war have be declare in certain quarter against the division of a play into act student of the elizabethan stage have persuade themselves by what i believe to be a complete misreading of the evidence that shakespeare do not as it be think in act but conceive he play as continuous series of event without any pause or intermission in they flow it can i think be prove beyond any shadow of doubt that they be wrong in this that the act division be perfectly familiar to shakespeare and be use by he to give to the action of he play a rhythm which ought not in representation to be obscure or falsify it be true that in the elizabethan theater there be no need of long interact for the change of scene and that such interact be a abuse that call for remedy but we have abundant evidence that the act division be sometimes mark on the elizabethan stage and have no reason to doubt that it be always more or less recognize and be present to shakespeare 's mind no less than to ibsen 's or pinero 's influence in part perhaps by the elizabethan theorist but mainly by the freakishness of he own genius mr bernard shaw have take to write play in one continuous gush of dialogue and have put forward more or less seriously the claim that he be thereby revive the practice of the greek in a prefatory note to _ get married _ he say -- there be a point of some technical interest to be note in this play the customary division into act and scene have be disused and a return make to unity of time and place as observe in the ancient greek drama in the foregoing tragedy _ the doctor 's dilemma _ there be five act the place be altered five time and the time be spread over a undetermined period of more than a year no doubt the strain on the attention of the audience and on the ingenuity of the playwright be much less but i find in practice that the greek form be inevitable when the drama reach a certain point in poetic and intellectual evolution its adoption be not on my part a deliberate display of virtuosity in form but simply the spontaneous fall of a play of idea into the form most suitable to it which turn out to be the classical form it be hard to say whether mr shaw be here write seriously or in a mood of solemn facetiousness perhaps he himself be not quite clear on the point there can be no harm at any rate in assume that he genuinely believe the unity of _ get married _ to be a return to the unity observe in say the _ oedipus rex _ and examine a little into so pleasant a illusion it be if i may so phrase it a double-barrelled illusion _ get married _ have not the unity of the greek drama and the greek drama have not the unity of _ get married _ whatever unity be predicable of either form of art be a wholly different thing from whatever unity be predicable of the other mr shaw in fact be consciously or unconsciously play with word very much as lamb do when he say to the sportsman be that you own hare or a wig there be roughly speak three sort of unity : the unity of a plum-pudd the unity of a string or chain and the unity of the parthenon let we call they respectively unity of concoction unity of concatenation and structural or organic unity the second form of unity be that of most novel and some play they present a series of event more or less closely intertwine or interlink with one another but not build up into any symmetrical interdependence this unity of longitudinal extension do not here concern we for it be not that of either shaw or sophocle plum-pudding unity on the other hand -- the unity of a number of ingredient stir up together put in a cloth boil to a certain consistency and then serve up in a blue flame of lambent humor -- that be precisely the unity of _ get married _ a jumble of idea prejudice point of view and whimsicality on the subject of marriage be tie up in a cloth and boil into a sort of glutinous fusion or confusion so that when the cloth be take off they do not at once lose the coherent rotundity confer upon they by pressure from without in a quite real sense the comparison do more than justice to the technical quality of the play for in a good plum-pudding the due proportion of the ingredient be carefully study whereas mr shaw fling in recklessly whatever come into he head at the same time it be undeniably true that he show we a number of people in one room talk continuously and without a single pause on different aspect of a given theme if this be unity then he have achieve it in the theater as a matter of fact the plum-pudding be serve up in three chunk instead of one but this be a mere concession to human weakness the play have all the globular unity of a pill though it happen to be too big a pill to be swallow at one gulp turn now to the _ oedipus _ -- i choose that play as a typical example of greek tragedy -- what sort of unity do we find it be the unity not of a continuous mass or mash but of carefully calculate proportion order interrelation of part -- the unity of a fine piece of architecture or even of a living organism the inorganic continuity of _ get married _ it do not possess if that be what we understand by unity then shaw have it and sophocle have not the _ oedipus _ be as clearly divide into act as be _ hamlet _ or _ hedda gabler _ in modern parlance we should probably call it a play in five act and a epilogue it so happen that the greek theater do not possess a curtain and do possess a chorus consequently the greek dramatist employ the chorus as we employ the curtain to emphasize the successive stage of he action to mark the rhythm of its progress and incidentally to provide resting-place for the mind of the audience -- interval during which the strain upon they attention be relax or at any rate vary it be not even true that the greek habitually aim at such continuity of time as we find in _ get married _ they treat time ideally the imaginary duration of the story be as a rule widely different from the actual time of representation in this respect the _ oedipus _ be something of a exception since the event might at a pinch be conceive as pass within the two hour ' traffick of the stage but in many case a whole day or even more must be understand to be compress within these two hour it be true that the continuous presence of the chorus make it impossible for the greek to overleap month and year as we do on the modern stage but they do not aim at that strict coincidence of imaginary with actual time which mr shaw believe himself to have achieve -lrb- 1 -rrb- even he however subject the event which take place behind the scene to a good deal of ideal compression of course when mr shaw protest that in _ get married _ he do not indulge in a deliberate display of virtuosity of form that be only he fun you can not well have virtuosity of form where there be no form what he do be to rely upon he virtuosity of dialogue to enable he to dispense with form whether he succeed or not be a matter of opinion which do not at present concern we the point to be note be the essential difference between the formless continuity of _ get married _ and the sedulous order and balance of clearly differentiate part which go to the structure of a greek tragedy a dramatist who can so develop he story as to bring it within the quasi-aristotelean unity perform a curious but not particularly difficult or valuable feat but this do not or ought not to imply the abandonment of the act-division which be no mere convention but a valuable means of mark the rhythm of the story when on the other hand you have no story to tell the act-division be manifestly superfluous but it need no virtuosity to dispense with it it be a grave error then to suppose that the act be a mere division of convenience impose by the limited power of attention of the human mind or by the need of the human body for occasional refreshment a play with a well-marked well-balanced act-structure be a higher artistic organism than a play with no act-structure just as a vertebrate animal be higher than a mollusc in every crisis of real life -lrb- unless it be so short as to be a mere incident -rrb- there be a rhythm of rise progress culmination and solution we be not always perhaps not often conscious of these stage but that be only because we do not reflect upon we experience while they be pass or map they out in memory when they be past we do however constantly apply to real-life crisis expression borrow more or less directly from the terminology of the drama we say somewhat incorrectly thing have come to a climax meaning thereby a culmination or we say the catastrophe be at hand or again what a fortunate _ dénouement _ be this as it may it be the business of the dramatist to analyze the crisis with which he deal and to present they to we in they rhythm of growth culmination solution to this end the act-division be -- not perhaps essential since the rhythm may be mark even in a one-act play -- but certainly of enormous and invaluable convenience si l'acte n'existait pas il faudrait l'inventer but as a matter of fact it have exist wherever in the western world the drama have develop beyond its rudest beginning it be doubtless the necessity for mark this rhythm that aristotle have in mind when he say that a dramatic action must have a begin a middle and a end take in its simplicity this principle would indicate the three-act division as the ideal scheme for a play as a matter of fact many of the best modern play in all language fall into three act one have only to note _ monsieur alphonse françillon la parisienne amoureuse a doll 's house ghost the master builder little eyolf johannisfeuer caste candida the benefit of the doubt the importance of be earnest the silver box _ and furthermore many old play which be nominally in five act really fall into a triple rhythm and might better have be divide into three alexandrian precept handed on by horace give to the five act division a purely arbitrary sanction which induce playwright to mask the natural rhythm of they theme beneath this artificial one -lrb- 2 -rrb- but in truth the three-act division ought no more to be elevated into a absolute rule than the five-act division we have see that a play consist or ought to consist of a great crisis work out through a series of minor crisis a act then ought to consist either of a minor crisis carry to its temporary solution or of a well-marked group of such crisis and there can be no rule as to the number of such crisis which ought to present themselves in the development of a given theme on the modern stage five act may be regard as the maximum simply by reason of the time-limit impose by social custom on a performance but one frequently see a melodrama divide into five act and eight tableau or even more which practically mean that the play be in eight or nine or ten act but that there will be only the four conventional interact in the course of the evening the playwright should not let himself be constrain by custom to force he theme into the arbitrary mould of a state number of act three act be a good number four act be a good number -lrb- 3 -rrb- there be no positive objection to five act should he find himself hanker after more act he will do well to consider whether he be not at one point or another fail in the art of condensation and trespassing on the domain of the novelist there be undoubted convenience in the rule of the modern stage : one act one scene a change of scene in the middle of a act be not only materially difficult but tend to impair the particular order of illusion at which the modern drama aim -lrb- 4 -rrb- roughly indeed a act may be define as any part of a give crisis which work itself out at one time and in one place but more fundamentally it be a segment of the action during which the author desire to hold the attention of he audience unbroken and unrelaxed it be no mere convention however which decree that the flight of time be best indicate by a interact when the curtain be down the action on the stage remain as it be in suspense the audience let its attention revert to the affair of real life and it be quite willing when the mimic world be once more reveal to suppose that any reasonable space of time have elapse while its thought be occupy with other matter it be much more difficult for it to accept a wholly imaginary lapse of time while its attention be centre on the mimic world some playwright have of late year adopt the device of drop they curtain once or even twice in the middle of a act to indicate a interval of a few minute or even of a hour -- for instance of the time between go in to dinner and the return of the lady to the drawing-room sir arthur pinero employ this device with good effect in _ iris _ so do mr granville barker in _ waste _ and mr galsworthy in _ the silver box _ it be certainly far preferable to that ideal treatment of time which be common in the french drama of the nineteenth century and survive to this day in play adapt or imitate from the french i remember see in london not very long ago a one-act play on the subject of rouget de l'isle in the space of about half-an-hour he hand the manuscript of the marseillaise to a opera-singer whom he adore she take it away and sing it at the opera it catch the popular ear from that one performance and the die rouget hear it sing by the pass multitude in the street within about fifteen minute of the moment when it first leave he hand -lrb- the whole piece i repeat occupy about half-an-hour but as a good deal of that time be devote to preliminary not more than fifteen minute can have elapse between the time when the cantatrice leave rouget 's garret and the time when all pari be sing the marseillaise -rrb- this be perhaps a extreme instance of the ideal treatment of time but one could find numberless case in the work of scribe labiche and other in which the transaction of many hour be represent as occur within the limit of a single act we modern practice eschew such licens it will often compress into a act of half-an-hour more event than would probably happen in real life in a similar space of time but not such a train of occurrence as to transcend the limit of possibility it must be remembered however that the standard of verisimilitude naturally and properly vary with the seriousness of the theme under treatment improbability be admissible in light comedy and still more in farce which would wreck the fortune of a drama purport to present a sober and faithful picture of real life act then mark the time-stage in the development of a give crisis and each act ought to embody a minor crisis of its own with a culmination and a temporary solution it would be no gain but a loss if a whole two hour ' or three hour ' action could be carry through in one continuous movement with no relaxation of the strain upon the attention of the audience and without a single point at which the spectator might review what be past and anticipate what be to come the act-division positively enhance the amount of pleasurable emotion through which the audience pass each act ought to stimulate and temporarily satisfy a interest of its own while definitely advance the main action the psychological principle be evident enough namely that there be more sensation to be get out of three or four comparatively brief experience suit to we power of perception than out of one protracted experience force on we without relief without contrast in such a way as to fatigue and deaden we faculty who would not rather drink three four or five glass of wine than put the bottle to he lip and let its contents pour down he throat in one long draught who would not rather see a stained-glass window break into three four or five cunningly-proportioned light than a great flat sheet of color glass be its design never so effective it use to be the fashion in mid victorian melodrama to give each act a more or less alluring title of its own i be far from recommend the revival of this practice but it might be no bad plan for a beginner in sketch out a play to have in he mind or in he private note a descriptive head-line for each act thereby assure himself that each have a character of its own and at the same time contribute its due share to the advancement of the whole design let we apply this principle to a shakespearean play -- for example to _ macbeth _ the act heading might run somewhat as follow -- act i -- temptation act ii -- murder and usurpation act iii -- the frenzy of crime and the haunting of remorse act iv -- gathering retribution act v -- retribution consummate can it be doubt that shakespeare have in he mind the rhythm mark by this act-division i do not mean of course that these phrase or anything like they be present to he consciousness but merely that he think in act and mentally assigned to each act its definite share in the development of the crisis turn now to ibsen let we draw up a act-scheme for the simplest and most straightforward of he play _ a enemy of the people _ it might run as follow : act i -- the incurable optimist -- dr stockmann announce he discovery of the insanitary condition of the bath act ii -- the compact majority -- dr stockmann find that he will have to fight vested interest before the evil he have discover can be remedy but be assure that the compact majority be at he back act iii -- the turn of fortune -- the doctor fall from the pinnacle of he optimistic confidence and learn that he will have the compact majority not _ at _ but _ on _ he back act iv -- the compact majority on the warpath -- the crowd finding that its immediate interest be identical with those of the privileged few join with the bureaucracy in shout down the truth and organize a conspiracy of silence act v -- optimism disillusioned but indomitable -- dr stockmann gag and throw back into poverty be tempt to take flight but determine to remain in he native place and fight for its moral if not for its physical sanitation each of these act be a little drama in itself while each lead forward to the next and mark a distinct phase in the development of the crisis when the younger duma ask he father that master of dramatic movement to initiate he into the secret of dramatic craftsmanship the great alexandre reply in this concise formulum : let you first act be clear you last act brief and the whole interesting of the wisdom of the first clause there can be no manner of doubt whether incidentally or by way of formal exposition the first act ought to show we clearly who the character be what be they relation and relationship and what be the nature of the gathering crisis it be very important that the attention of the audience should not be overstrain in follow out needlessly complex genealogy and kinship how often at the end of a first act do one turn to one 's neighbor and say be edith and adelum sister or only half-sister or do you gather what be the villain 's claim to the title if a story can not be make clear without a elaborate study of one or more family tree beware of it in all probability it be of very little use for dramatic purpose but before give it up see whether the relationship and other relation can not be simplify complexity which at first seem indispensable will often prove to be mere useless encumbrance in _ pillar of society _ ibsen go as far as any playwright ought to go in postulate fine degree of kinship -- and perhaps a little further karsten bernick have marry into a family whose gradation put something of a strain on the apprehension and memory of a audience we have to bear in mind that mr bernick have -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- a half-sister lona hessel -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- a full brother johan tönnesen -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- a cousin hilmar tönnesen then bernick have a unmarried sister martha another relationship however simple to be bear in mind and finally when we see dina dorf living in bernick 's house and know that bernick have have a intrigue with she mother we be apt to fall into the error of suppose she to be bernick 's daughter there be only one line which prove that this be not so -- a remark to the effect that when madam dorf come to the town dina be already old enough to run about and play angel in the theater any one who do not happen to hear or notice this remark be almost certain to misapprehend dina 's parentage take one thing with another then the bernick family group be rather more complex than be strictly desirable ibsen 's reason for make lona hessel a half-sister instead of a full sister of mr bernick be evident enough he want she to be a considerably older woman of a very different type of character and it be necessary in order to explain karsten 's desertion of lona for betty that the latter should be a heiress while the former be penniless these reason be clear and apparently adequate yet it may be doubt whether the dramatist do not lose more than he gain by introduce even this small degree of complexity it be certainly not necessary to explain the difference of age and character between lona and betty while as for the money there would have be nothing improbable in suppose that a wealthy uncle have mark he disapproval of lona 's strong-mindedness by bequeath all he property to she younger sister again there be no reason why hilmar should not have be a brother of johan and betty -lrb- 5 -rrb- in which case we should have have the simple family group of two brother and two sister instead of the comparatively complex relationship of a brother and sister a half-sister and a cousin these may seem very trivial consideration : but nothing be really trivial when it come to be place under the powerful lens of theatrical presentation any give audience have only a certain measure of attention at command and to claim attention for inessential be to diminish the stock available for essential in only one other play do ibsen introduce any complexity of relationship and in that case it do not appear in the exposition but be reveal at a critical moment towards the close in _ little eyolf _ asta and allmer be introduce to we at first as half-sister and half-brother and only at the end of the second act do it appear that asta 's mother -lrb- allmer ' stepmother -rrb- be unfaithful to she husband and that asta be the fruit of this infidelity there be no blood kinship between she and allmer the danger of rely upon such complexity be show by the fact that so acute a critic as m jule lemaître in writing of _ little eyolf _ mistake the situation and think that asta flee from allmer because he be she brother whereas in fact she flee because he be not i have the honor of call m lemaître 's attention to this error which he handsomely acknowledge complexity of kinship be of course not the only complexity which should so far as possible be avoid every complexity of relation or of antecedent circumstance be in itself a weakness which if it can not be eliminate must so to speak be live down no dramatic critic i think can have fail to notice that the good play be those of which the story can be clearly indicate in ten line while it very often take a column to give even a confused idea of the plot of a bad play here then be a preliminary test which may be commend to the would-be playwright in order to ascertain whether the subject he be contemplate be or be not a good one : can he state the gist of it in a hundred word or so like the argument of a boccaccian novellum the test of course be far from be infallible for a theme may err on the side of over-simplicity or emptiness no less than on the side of over-complexity but it be at any rate negatively useful : if the playwright find that he can not make he story comprehensible without a long explanation of a intricate network of fact he may be pretty sure that he have get hold of a bad theme or of one that stand sorely in need of simplification -lrb- 6 -rrb- it be not sufficient however that a first act should fulfil duma 's requirement by place the situation clearly before we : it ought also to carry we some way towards the heart of the drama or at the very least to point distinctly towards that quarter of the horizon where the cloud be gather up in a three-act play this be evidently demand by the most elementary principle of proportion it would be absurd to make one-third of the play merely introductory and to compress the whole action into the remain two-third but even in a four - or five-act play the interest of the audience ought to be strongly enlist and its anticipation head in a definite direction before the curtain fall for the first time when we find a dramatist of repute neglect this principle we may suspect some reason with which art have no concern several of sardou 's social drama begin with two act of more or less smart and entertaining satire or caricature and only at the end of the second or beginning of the third act -lrb- out of five -rrb- do the drama proper set in what be the reason of this simply that under the system of royalty prevalent in france it be greatly to the author 's interest that he play should fill the whole evening sardou need no more than three act for the development of he drama to have spread it out thinner would have be to weaken and injure it wherefore he prefer to occupy a hour or so with clever dramatic journalism rather than share the evening and the fee with another dramatist so at least i have hear he practice explain perhaps he own account of the matter may have be that he want to paint a broad social picture to serve as a background for he action the question how far a audience ought to be carry towards the heart of a dramatic action in the course of the first act be always and inevitably one of proportion it be clear that too much ought not to be tell so as to leave the remain act meager and spun-out nor should any one scene be so intense in its interest as to outshine all subsequent scene and give to the rest of the play a effect of anti-climax if the strange and fascinating creation of ibsen 's last year be to be judge by ordinary dramaturgic canon we should have to admit that in _ little eyolf _ he be guilty of the latter fault since in point of sheer strength in the common acceptation of the word the situation at the end of the first act could scarcely be outdo in that play or any other the beginner however be far more likely to put too little than too much into he first act : he be more likely to leave we interest insufficiently stimulate than to carry we too far in the development of he theme my own feeling be that as a general rule what freytag call the _ erregende moment _ ought by all means to fall within the first act what be the _ erregende moment _ one be incline to render it the firing of the fuse in legal parlance it might be interpret as the join of issue it mean the point at which the drama hitherto latent plainly declare itself it mean the germination of the crisis the appearance on the horizon of the cloud no bigger than a man 's hand i suggest then that this _ erregende moment _ ought always to come within the first act -- if it be to come at all there be play as we have see which depict life on so even a plane that it be impossible to say at any give point here the drama set in or the interest be heighten there _ pillar of society _ be in a sense ibsen 's prentice-work in the form of drama which he afterwards perfect wherefore it afford we numerous illustration of the problem we have to consider do he or do he not give we in the first act sufficient insight into he story i be incline to answer the question in the negative the first act put we in possession of the current version of the bernick-tönnesen family history but it give we no clear indication that this version be a elaborate tissue of falsehood it be true that bernick 's evident uneasiness and embarrassment at the mere idea of the reappearance of lona and johan may lead we to suspect that all be not as it seem but simple annoyance at the inopportune arrival of the black sheep of the family might be sufficient to account for this to all intent and purpose we be completely in the dark as to the course the drama be about to take and when at the end of the first act lona hessel march in and flutter the social dovecote we do not know in what light to regard she or why we be suppose to sympathize with she the fact that she be eccentric and that she talk of let in fresh air combine with we previous knowledge of the author 's idiosyncrasy to assure we that she be he heroine but so far as the evidence actually before we go we have no means of form even the vaguest provisional judgment as to she true character this be almost certainly a mistake in art it be useless to urge that sympathy and antipathy be primitive emotion and that we ought to be able to regard a character objectively rating it as true or false not as attractive or repellent the answer to this be twofold firstly the theater have never be and never will be a moral dissect room nor have the theatrical audience anything in common with a class of student dispassionately follow a professor 's demonstration of cold scientific fact secondly in the particular case in point the dramatist make a manifest appeal to we sympathy there can be no doubt that we be intend to take lona 's part as against the representative of propriety and convention assemble at the sewing-bee but we have be vouchsafe no rational reason for so do in other word the author have not take we far enough into he action to enable we to grasp the true import and significance of the situation he rely for he effect either on the general principle that a eccentric character must be sympathetic or on the knowledge possess by those who have already see or read the rest of the play either form of reliance be clearly inartistic the former appeal to irrational prejudice the latter ignore what we shall presently find to be a fundamental principle of the playwright 's art -- namely that with certain doubtful exception in the case of historical theme he must never assume previous knowledge either of plot or character on the part of he public but must always have in he mind 's eye a first-night audience which know nothing but what he choose to tell it my criticism of the first act of _ pillar of society _ may be sum up in say that the author have omit to place in it the _ erregende moment _ the issue be not join the true substance of the drama be not clear to we until in the second act bernick make sure there be no listener and then hold out both hand to johan say : johan now we be alone now you must give I leave to thank you and so forth why should not this scene have occur in the first act materially there be no reason whatever it would need only the change of a few word to lift the scene bodily out of the second act and transfer it to the first why do ibsen not do so he reason be not hard to divine he wish to concentrate into two great scene with scarcely a moment 's interval between they the revelation of bernick 's treachery first to johan second to lona he gain he point : the sledge-hammer effect of these two scene be undeniable but it remain a question whether he do not make a disproportionate sacrifice whether he do not empty he first act in order to overfill he second i do not say he do : i merely propound the question for the student 's consideration one thing we must recognize in dramatic art as in all other human affair namely that perfection if not unattainable be extremely rare we have often to make a deliberate sacrifice at one point in order to gain some greater advantage at another to incur imperfection here that we may achieve perfection there it be no disparagement to the great master to admit that they frequently show we rather what to avoid than what to do negative instruction indeed be in its essence more desirable than positive the latter tend to make we mere imitator whereas the former in save we from danger leave we originality unimpair it be curious to note that in another play ibsen do actually transfer the _ erregende moment _ the join of issue from the second act to the first in he early draft of _ rosmersholm _ the great scene in which rosmer confess to kroll he change of view do not occur until the second act there can be no doubt that the balance and proportion of the play gain enormously by the transference after all however the essential question be not how much or how little be convey to we in the first act but whether we interest be thoroughly arouse and what be of equal importance skilfully carry forward before go more at large into this very important detail of the playwright 's craft it may be well to say something of the nature of dramatic interest in general \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : there be several case in greek drama in which a hero leave the stage to fight a battle and return victorious in a few minute see for example the _ supplice _ of euripide -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : so far be shakespeare from ignore the act-division that it be a question whether he art do not sometimes suffer from the suppose necessity of let a fourth act intervene between the culmination in the third act and the catastrophe in the fifth -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : i think it may be say that the majority of modern serious play be in four act it be a favorite number with sir arthur pinero mr henry arthur jone mr clyde fitch and mr alfr sutro -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : this must not be take to mean that in no case be a change of scene within the act advisable the point to be consider be whether the author do or do not want to give the audience time for reflection -- time to return to the real world -- between two episode if it be of great importance that they should not do so then a rapid change of scene may be the less of two evil in this case the light should be keep lower in order to show that no interact be intend but the fashion of change the scene on a pitch-dark stage without drop the curtain be much to be deprecate if the revolving stage should ever become a common institution in english-speaking country dramatist would doubtless be more tempt than they be at present to change they scene within the act but i doubt whether the tendency would be wholly advantageous no absolute rule however can be lay down and it may well be maintain that a true dramatic artist could only profit by the greater flexibility of he medium -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : he be in the first draft and lona hessel be only a distant relative of bernick 's -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : the greek who know most thing know the value of manageable dimension and simple structure in a work of art and have a word to express that combination of quality -- the word _ eusynopton _ -rrb- _ chapter ix _ curiosity and interest the paradox of dramatic theory be this : while we aim be of course to write play which shall achieve immortality or shall at any rate become highly popular and consequently familiar in advance to a considerable proportion of any give audience we be all the time study how to awaken and to sustain that interest or more precisely that curiosity which can be feel only by those who see the play for the first time without any previous knowledge of its action under modern condition especially the spectator who come to the theater with they mind a absolute blank as to what be await they be comparatively few for newspaper criticism and society gossip very soon bruit abroad a general idea of the plot of any play which attain a reasonable measure of success why then should we assume in the ideal spectator to whom we address ourselves a state of mind which we hope and trust will not be the state of mind of the majority of actual spectator to this question there be several answer the first and most obvious be that to one audience at any rate every play must be absolutely new and that it be this first-night audience which in great measure determine its success or failure many play have survive a first-night failure and still more have go off in a rapid decline after a first-night success but these caprice of fortune be not to be count on the only prudent course be for the dramatist to direct all he thought and care towards conciliate or dominate a audience to which he theme be entirely unknown -lrb- 1 -rrb- and so coming triumphant through he first-night ordeal this principle be subject to a certain qualification in the case of historic and legendary theme in treat such subject the dramatist be not relieve of the necessity of develop he story clearly and interestingly but have on the contrary a additional charge impose upon he -- that of not flagrantly defy or disappointing popular knowledge or prejudice charle i must not die in a green old age oliver cromwell must not display the manners and grace of sir charle grandison charle ii must not be represent as a model of domestic virtue historian may indict a hero or whitewash a villain at they leisure but to the dramatist a hero must be -lrb- more or less -rrb- a hero a villain -lrb- more or less -rrb- a villain if accept tradition so decree it -lrb- 2 -rrb- thus popular knowledge can scarcely be say to lighten a dramatist 's task but rather to impose a new limitation upon he in some case however he can rely on a general knowledge of the historic background of a give period which may save he some exposition a english audience for instance do not require to be tell what be the difference between cavalier and roundhead nor do any audience i imagine look for a historical disquisition on the reign of terror the dramatist have only to bring on some ruffianly character in phrygian cap who address each other as citizen and citizeness and at once the imagination of the audience will supply the roll of the tumbrel and the silhouette of the guillotine in the background to return to the general question : not only must the dramatist reckon with one all-important audience which be totally ignorant of the story he have to tell he must also bear in mind that it be very easy to exaggerate the proportion of any give audience which will know he plot in advance even when he play have be perform a thousand time there be inexhaustible possibility of ignorance in the theatrical public a story be tell on pretty good authority of a late eminent statesman who visit the lyceum one night when sir henry irving be appear as hamlet after the third act he go to the actor 's dressing-room express great regret that duty call he back to westminster and beg sir henry to tell he how the play end as it have interested he greatly -lrb- 3 -rrb- one of we most eminent novelist have assure I that he never see or read _ macbeth _ until he be present at -lrb- i think -rrb- mr forbe robertson 's revival of the play he be then nearer fifty than forty these no doubt be freak instance but in any give audience even at the most hackneyed classical play there will be a certain percentage of child -lrb- who contribute as much as they elder to the general temper of a audience -rrb- and also a percentage of adult ignoramus and if this be so in the case of play which have hold the stage for generation be study in school and be every day cite as matter of common knowledge how much more certain may we be that even the most popular modern play will have to appeal night after night to a considerable number of people who have no previous acquaintance with either its story or its character the playwright may absolutely count on have to make such a appeal but he must remember at the same time that he can by no means count on keep any individual effect more especially any notable trick or device a secret from the generality of he audience mr jm barrie -lrb- to take a recent instance -rrb- sedulously conceal throughout the greater part of _ little mary _ what be mean by that ever-recurring expression and probably rely to some extent on a effect of amuse surprise when the disclosure be make on the first night the effect come off happily enough but on subsequent night there would rarely be a score of people in the house who do not know the secret the great majority might know nothing else about the play but that they know similarly in the case of any mechanical _ truc _ as the french call it or feat of theatrical sleight-of-hand it be futile to trust to its take unawares any audience after the first nine-tenth of all subsequent audience be sure to be on the look-out for it and to know or think they know how it be do -lrb- 4 -rrb- these be the thing which theatrical gossip print and oral most industriously disseminate the fine detail of a plot be much less easily convey and less likely to be remember to sum up this branch of the argument : however oft-repeated and much-discussed a play may be the playwright must assume that in every audience there will be a appreciable number of person who know practically nothing about it and whose enjoyment will depend like that of the first-night audience on the skill with which he develop he story on the other hand he can never rely on take a audience by surprise at any particular point the class of effect which depend on surprise be precisely the class of effect which be certain to be discount -lrb- 5 -rrb- we come now to a third reason why a playwright be bind to assume that the audience to which he address himself have no previous knowledge of he fable it be simply that no other assumption have or can have any logical basis if the audience be not to be conceive as ignorant how much be it to be assume to know there be clearly no possible answer to this question except a purely arbitrary one have no relation to the fact in any audience after the first there will doubtless be a hundred degree of knowledge and of ignorance many people will know nothing at all about the play some people will have see or read it yesterday and will thus know all there be to know while between these extreme there will be every variety of clearness or vagueness of knowledge some people will have read and remember a detailed newspaper notice other will have read the same notice and forget almost all of it some will have hear a correct and vivid account of the play other a vague and misleading summary it would be absolutely impossible to enumerate all the degree of previous knowledge which be pretty certain to be represent in a average audience and to which degree of knowledge be the playwright to address himself if he be to have any firm ground under he foot he must clearly adopt the only logical course and address himself to a spectator assume to have no previous knowledge whatever to proceed on any other assumption would not only be to ignore the all-powerful first-night audience but to plunge into a veritable morass of inconsistency dubiety and slovenliness these consideration however have not yet take we to the heart of the matter we have see that the dramatist have no rational course open to he but to assume complete ignorance in he audience but we have also see that as a matter of fact only one audience will be entirely in this condition and that the more successful the play be the more widely will subsequent audience tend to depart from it do it not follow that interest of plot interest of curiosity as to come event be at best a evanescent factor in a play 's attractiveness -- of a certain importance no doubt on the first night but less and less efficient the longer the play hold the stage in a sense this be undoubtedly true we see every day that a mere story-play -- a play which appeal to we solely by reason of the adroit stimulation and satisfaction of curiosity -- very rapidly exhaust its success no one care to see it a second time and spectator who happen to have read the plot in advance find its attraction discount even on a first hearing but if we jump to the conclusion that the skilful marshalling and development of the story be a unimportant detail which matter little when once the first-night ordeal be past we shall go very far astray experience show we that dramatic _ interest _ be entirely distinct from mere _ curiosity _ and survive when curiosity be dead though a skilfully-told story be not of itself enough to secure long life for a play it materially and permanently enhance the attraction of a play which have other and higher claim to longevity character poetry philosophy atmosphere be all very good in they way but they all show to greater advantage by aid of a well-ordered fable in a picture i take it draw be not everything but draw will always count for much this separation of interest from curiosity be partly explicable by one very simple reflection however well we may know a play beforehand we seldom know it by heart or nearly by heart so that though we may anticipate a development in general outline we do not clearly foresee the order of its detail which therefore may give we almost the same sort of pleasure that it give we when the story be new to we most playgoer will i think bear I out in say that we constantly find a great scene or act to be in reality richer in invention and more ingenious in arrangement than we remember it to be we come now to another point that must not be overlook it need no subtle introspection to assure we that we the audience do we own little bit of act and instinctively place ourselves at the point of view of a spectator before whose eye the drama be unroll itself for the first time if the play have any richness of texture we have many sensation that he can not have we be conscious of irony and subtlety which necessarily escape he or which he can but dimly divine but in regard to the actual development of the story we imagine ourselves back into he condition of ignorance with this difference that we can more fully appreciate the dramatist 's skill and more clearly resent he clumsiness or slovenliness we sensation in short be not simply condition by we knowledge or ignorance of what be to come the mood of dramatic receptivity be a complex one we instinctively and without any effort remember that the dramatist be bind by the rule of the game or in other word by the inherent condition of he craft to unfold he tale before a audience to which it be unknown and it be with implicit reference to these condition that we enjoy and appreciate he skill even the most unsophisticated audience realize in some measure that the playwright be a artist present a picture of life under such-and-such assumption and limitation and appraise he skill by its own vague and instinctive standard as we culture increase we more and more consistently adopt this attitude and take pleasure in a playwright 's marshalling of material in proportion to its absolute skill even if that skill no longer produce its direct and pristine effect upon we in many case indeed we pleasure consist of a delicate blending of surprise with realize anticipation we foresee and be pleased to recognize the art of the whole achievement while detail which have grow dim to we give we each its little thrill of fresh admiration regard in this aspect a great play be like a great piece of music : we can hear it again and again with ever-new realization of its subtle beauty its complex harmony and with unfailing interest in the merit and demerit of each particular rendering but we must look deeper than this if we would fully understand the true nature of dramatic interest the last paragraph have bring we to the verge of the inmost secret but we have yet to take the final step we have yet to realize that in truly great drama the foreknowledge possess by the audience be not a disadvantage with certain incidental mitigation and compensation but be the source of the highest pleasure which the theater be capable of afford we in order to illustrate my meaning i propose to analyze a particular scene not certainly among the loftiest in dramatic literature but particularly suit to my purpose inasmuch as it be familiar to every one and at the same time full of the essential quality of drama i mean the screen scene in _ the school for scandal _ in she english man of letter volume on sheridan mr oliphant discuss this scene speaking in particular of the moment at which the screen be overturn reveal lady teazle behind it she say -- it would no doubt have be higher art could the dramatist have deceive he audience as well as the personage of the play and make we also party in the surprise of the discovery there could scarcely be a completer reversal of the truth than this hopeless comment as professor brander matthew have justly call it the whole effect of the long and highly-elaborated scene depend upon we knowledge that lady teazle be behind the screen have the audience either not know that there be anybody there or suppose it to be the little french milliner where would have be the breathless interest which have hold we through a whole series of precede scene when sir peter reveal to joseph he generous intention towards he wife the point lie in the fact that lady teazle overhear and this be doubly the case when he allude to joseph as a suitor for the hand of marium so too with the following scene between joseph and charle in itself it would be flat enough the fact that sir peter be listen lend it a certain piquancy but this be ten time multiply by the fact that lady teazle too hear all that pass when joseph be call from the room by the arrival of the pretended old stanley there would be no interest in he embarrassment if we believe the person behind the screen to be the french milliner and when sir peter yield to the temptation to let charle into the secret of he brother 's frailty and we feel every moment more certain that the screen will be overthrow where would be the excitement the tension if we do not know who be behind it the real drama in fact pass behind the screen it lie in the terror humiliation and disillusionment which we know to be course each other through lady teazle 's soul and all this mr oliphant would have sacrifice for a single moment of crude surprise now let we hear professor matthew 's analysis of the effect of the scene he say : the playgoer 's interest be really not so much as to what be to happen as the way in which this event be go to affect the character involve he think it likely enough that sir peter will discover that lady teazle be pay a visit to joseph surface but what he be really anxious to learn be the way the husband will take it what will lady teazle have to say when she be discover where she have no business to be how will sir peter receive she excuse what will the effect be on the future conduct of both husband and wife these be the question which the spectator be eager to have answer this be a admirable exposition of the frame of mind of the drury lane audience of may 8 1777 who first see the screen overturn but in the thousand of audience who have since witness the play how many individual on a average have any doubt as to what lady teazle would have to say and how sir peter would receive she excuse it would probably be safe to guess that for a century past two-third of every audience have clearly foreknow the outcome of the situation professor matthew himself have edit sheridan 's play and probably know _ the school for scandal _ almost by heart yet we may be pretty sure that any reasonably good performance of the screen scene will to-day give he pleasure not so very much inferior to that which he feel the first time he see it in this pleasure it be manifest that mere curiosity as to the immediate and subsequent conduct of sir peter and lady teazle can have no part there be absolutely no question which professor matthew or any playgoer who share he point of view be eager to have answer assume then that we be all familiar with the screen scene and assume that we nevertheless take pleasure in see it reasonably well act -lrb- 6 -rrb- let we try to discover of what element that pleasure be compose it be no doubt somewhat complex for one thing we have pleasure in meeting old friend sir peter lady teazle charle even joseph be agreeable creature who have all sort of pleasant association for we again we love to encounter not only familiar character but familiar joke like goldsmith 's diggory we can never help laugh at the story of ould grouse in the gunroom the best order of dramatic wit do not become stale but rather grow upon we we relish it at least as much at the tenth repetition as at the first but while these consideration may partly account for the pleasure we take in see the play as a whole they do not explain why the screen scene in particular should interest and excite we another source of pleasure as before indicate may be renew recognition of the ingenuity with which the scene be piece together however familiar we may be with it short of actually know it by heart we do not recall the detail of its dovetailing and it be a delight to realize afresh the neatness of the manipulation by which the tension be heighten from speech to speech and from incident to incident if it be object that this be a pleasure which the critic alone be capable of experience i venture to disagree the most unsophisticated playgoer feel the effect of neat workmanship though he may not be able to put he satisfaction into word it be evident however that the mere intellectual recognition of fine workmanship be not sufficient to account for the emotion with which we witness the screen scene a similar though of course not quite identical effect be produce by scene of the utmost simplicity in which there be no room for delicacy of dovetail or neatness of manipulation where then be we to seek for the fundamental constituent in dramatic interest as distinct from mere curiosity perhaps mr oliphant 's glaring error may put we on the track of the truth mr oliphant think that sheridan would have show higher art have he keep the audience as well as sir peter and charle ignorant of lady teazle 's presence behind the screen but this as we see be precisely the reverse of the truth : the whole interest of the scene arise from we knowledge of lady teazle 's presence have sheridan fall into mr oliphant 's mistake the little shock of surprise which the first-night audience would have feel when the screen be throw down would have be no compensation at all for the comparative tameness and pointlessness of the precede passage thus we see that the greater part of we pleasure arise precisely from the fact that we know what sir peter and charle do not know or in other word that we have a clear vision of all the circumstance relation and implication of a certain conjuncture of affair in which two at least of the person concern be ignorantly and blindly move towards issue of which they do not dream we be in fact in the position of superior intelligence contemplate with miraculous clairvoyance the stumbling and tumbling of poor blind mortal stray through the labyrinth of life we seat in the theater be like a throne on the epicurean olympus whence we can view with perfect intelligence but without participation or responsibility the intricate reaction of human destiny and this sense of superiority do not pall upon we when othello come on the scene radiant and confident in desdemona 's love we knowledge of the fate await he make he a hundred time more interesting than could any mere curiosity as to what be about to happen it be we prevision of nora 's exit at the end of the last act that lend its dramatic poignancy to she entrance at the beginning of the first there be nothing absolutely new in this theory -lrb- 7 -rrb- the irony of fate have long be recognize as one of the main element of dramatic effect it have be especially dwell upon in relation to greek tragedy of which the theme be all know in advance even to first-day audience we should take but little interest in see the purple carpet spread for agamemnon 's triumphal entry into he ancestral hall if it be not for we foreknowledge of the net and the axe prepare for he but familiar as be this principle i be not aware that it have hitherto be extend as i suggest that it should be to cover the whole field of dramatic interest i suggest that the theorist have hitherto dwell far too much on curiosity -lrb- 8 -rrb- -- which may be define as the interest of ignorance -- and far too little on the feeling of superiority of clairvoyance with which we contemplate a foreknown action whether of a comic or of a tragic cast of course the action must be essentially if not in every detail true to nature we can derive no sense of superiority from we foreknowledge of a arbitrary or preposterous action and that i take it be the reason why a good many play have a initial success of curiosity but cease to attract when they plot become familiar again we take no pleasure in foreknow the fate of wholly uninteresting people which be as much as to say that character be indispensable to endure interest in drama with these proviso i suggest a reconstruction of we theory of dramatic interest in which mere first-night curiosity shall be relegate to the subordinate place which by right belong to it nevertheless we must come back to the point that there be always the ordeal of the first night to be face and that the play be comparatively few which have lived-down a bad first-night it be true that specifically first-night merit be a trivial matter compare with what may be call thousandth-performance merit but it be equally true that there be no inconsistency between the two order of merit and that a play will never be less esteem on its thousandth performance for have achieve a conspicuous first-night success the practical lesson which seem to emerge from these consideration be that a wise theatrical policy would seek to diminish the all-importance of the first-night and to give a play a greater chance of recovery than it have under present condition from the depressing effect of a inauspicious production this be the more desirable as its initial misadventure may very likely be due to external and fortuitous circumstance wholly unconnected with its inherent quality at the same time we be bind to recognize that from the very nature of the case we present inquiry must be far more concerned with first-night than with thousandth-performance merit craftsmanship can within limit be acquire genius can not and it be craftsmanship that pilot we through the peril of the first performance genius that carry we on to the apotheosis of the thousandth therefore we primary concern must be with the arouse and sustain of curiosity though we should never forget that it be only a means to the ultimate enlistment of the higher and more abiding form of interest \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : the view that the dramatist have only to think of please himself be elsewhere deal with -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : two dramatist who have read these page in proof exclaim at this passage the one say no no the other ask why i can only reiterate that where there exist a strong and generally accept tradition the dramatist not only run counter to it at he peril but go outside the true domain of he art in so do new truth in history must be establish either by new document or by a careful and detailed re-interpretation of old document but the stage be not the place either for the production of document or for historical exegesis it be needless to say that where the popular mind be unbiased the dramatist 's hand be free for instance i presume that one might in england take any view one pleased of the character of mary queen of scot but a highly unfavourable view would scarcely be accept by scottish audience similarly it would be both dangerous and unprofitable to present on the english stage any very damaging scandal about queen elizabeth historical criticism i understand do not accept the view that robespierre be mainly responsible for the reign of terror and that he death betoken a general revolt against he sanguinary tyranny but it would be very hard for any dramatist to secure general acceptance for a more accurate reading of he character and function some further remark on this subject will be find in chapter xiii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : a malicious anecdote to a similar effect be current in the early day of sir henry irving 's career it be say that at bristol one night when mr irving as hamlet take he call after the first act a man turn to he neighbor in the pit and say can you tell I sir do that young man appear much in this play he neighbor inform he that hamlet be rather largely concern in the action whereupon the inquirer remark oh then i be off -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : if it be well do it may remain highly effective in spite of be discount by previous knowledge for instance the clock-trick in _ raffle _ be none the less amusing because every one be on the look-out for it -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : the question whether it be ever politic for a playwright to keep a secret from he audience be discuss elsewhere what i have here in mind be not a ordinary secret but a more or less tricky effect of surprise -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : the pleasure receive from exceptionally good acting be of course a different matter i assume that the acting be merely competent enough to pass muster without irritate we and so distracting we attention -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : i myself express it in slightly different term nearly ten year ago curiosity i say be the accidental relish of a single night whereas the essential and abiding pleasure of the theater lie in foreknowledge in relation to the character in the drama the audience be as god look before and after sit in the theater we taste for a moment the glory of omniscience with vision unseal we watch the groping of purblind mortal after happiness and smile at they stumbling they blunder they futile quest they misplace exultation they groundless panic to keep a secret from we be to reduce we to they level and deprive we of we clairvoyant aloofness there may be a pleasure in that too we may join with zest in the game of blind-man 's - buff but the theater be in its essence a place where we be privileged to take off the bandage we wear in daily life and to contemplate with laughter or with tear the blindfold gambol of we neighbor -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : here a acute critic write : on the whole i agree but i do think there be dramatic interest to be have out of curiosity through the identification so to speak of the audience with the discover person on the stage it be a interest of sympathy not to be despise rather than a interest of actual curiosity -rrb- _ chapter x _ foreshadowing not forestall we return now to the point at which the foregoing disquisition -- it be not a digression -- become necessary we have arrive at the general principle that the playwright 's chief aim in he first act ought to be to arouse and carry forward the interest of the audience this may seem a tolerably obvious statement but it be worth while to examine a little more closely into its implication as to arouse the interest of the audience it be clear that very little specific advice can be give one can only say find a interesting theme state its preliminary clearly and crisply and let issue be join without too much delay there can be no rule for find a interesting theme any more than for catch the blue bird at a later stage we may perhaps attempt a summary enumeration of theme which be not interesting which have exhaust any interest they ever possess and repay careful avoidance but such a enumeration would be out of place here where we be study principle of form apart from detail of matter the arouse of interest however be one thing the carrying-forward of interest be another and on the latter point there be one or two thing that may profitably be say each act as we have see should consist of or at all event contain a subordinate crisis contributory to the main crisis of the play : and the art of act-construction lie in give to each act a individuality and interest of its own without so round it off as to obscure even for a moment its subsidiary and in the case of the first act its introductory relation to the whole this be a point which many dramatist ignore or undervalue very often when the curtain fall on a first or a second act one say this be a fairly good act in itself but whither do it lead what be to come of it all it awaken no definite anticipation and for two pin one would take up one 's hat and go home the author have neglect the art of carrying-forward the interest it be curious to note that in the most unsophisticated form of melodrama this art be deliberately ignore in play of the type of _ the worst woman in london _ it appear to be a absolute canon of art that every act must have a happy ending -- that the curtain must always fall on the hero or preferably the comic man in a attitude of triumph while the villain and villainess cower before he in baffled impotence we have perfect faith of course that the villain will come up smile in the next act and proceed with he nefarious practice but for the moment virtue have it all its own way this however be a very artless formulum which have somehow develop of recent year and it be doubtful whether even the audience to which these play appeal would not in reality prefer something a little less inept in the matter of construction as soon as we get above this level at all event the foster of anticipation become a matter of the first importance the problem be not to cut short the spectator 's interest or to leave it flutter at a loose end but to provide it either with a clearly-foreseen point in the next act towards which it can reach onward or with a definite enigma the solution of which be impatiently await in general term a bridge should be provide between one act and another along which the spectator 's mind can not but travel with eager anticipation and this be particularly important or particularly apt to be neglect at the end of the first act at a later point if the interest do not naturally and inevitably carry itself forward the case be hopeless indeed to illustrate what be mean by the carrying-forward of interest let I cite one or two instance in which it be achieve with conspicuous success in oscar wilde 's first modern comedy _ lady windermere 's fan _ the heroine lady windermere have learn that she husband have of late be see to call very frequently at the house of a certain mr erlynne whom nobody know she suspicion thus arouse she search she husband 's desk discover a private and lock bank-book cut it open and find that one large cheque after another have be draw in favor of the lady in question at this inopportune moment lord windermere appear with a request that mr erlynne shall be invite to they reception that evening lady windermere indignantly refuse she husband insist and finally with he own hand fill in a invitation-card and send it by messenger to mr erlynne here some playwright might have be content to finish the act it be sufficiently evident that lady windermere will not submit to the apparent insult and that something exciting may be look for at the reception in the follow act but oscar wilde be not content with this vague expectancy he first define it and then he underline the definition in a perfectly natural and yet ingenious and skilful way the day happen to be lady windermere 's birthday and at the beginning of the act she husband have give she a beautiful ostrich-feather fan when he send off the invitation she turn upon he and say if that woman cross my threshold i shall strike she across the face with this fan here again many a dramatist might be content to bring down he curtain the announcement of lady windermere 's resolve carry forward the interest quite clearly enough for all practical purpose but even this do not satisfy wilde he imagine a refinement simple probable and yet immensely effective which put a extraordinarily keen edge upon the expectancy of the audience he make lady windermere ring for she butler and say : parker be sure you pronounce the name of the guest very distinctly to-night sometimes you speak so fast that i miss they i be particularly anxious to hear the name quite clearly so as to make no mistake i well remember the effect which this little touch produce on the first night the situation be in itself open to grave objection there be no plausible excuse for lord windermere 's obstinacy in force mr erlynne upon he wife and risk a violent scandal in order to postpone a explanation which he must know to be ultimately inevitable though one have not as yet learn the precise fact of the case one feel pretty confident that he lordship 's conduct would scarcely justify itself but interest be largely independent of critical judgment and for my own part i can aver that when the curtain fall on the first act a five-pound note would not have bribe I to leave the theater without assist at lady windermere 's reception in the second act that be the frame of mind which the author should try to beget in he audience and oscar wilde then almost a novice have in this one little passage between lady windermere and the butler show himself a master of the art of dramatic story-telling the dramatist have higher function than mere story-telling but this be fundamental and the true artist be the last to despise it -lrb- 1 -rrb- for another example of a first act bring to what one may call a judiciously tantalizing conclusion i turn to mr rc carton 's comedy _ wheel within wheel _ lord eric chantrell have just return from abroad after many year ' absence he drive straight to the bachelor flat of he old chum egerton vartrey at the flat he find only he friend 's valet vartrey himself have be summon to scotland that very evening and the valet be on the point of follow he he know however that he master would wish he old friend to make himself at home in the flat so he presently go off leave the newcomer install for the night lord eric go to the bedroom to change he clothes and the stage be thus leave vacant we hear a latch-key turning in the outer door a lady in evening dress enter go up to the bureau at the back of the stage and calmly proceed to break it open and ransack it while she be thus burglariously employ lord eric enter and can not refrain from a slight expression of surprise the lady take the situation with humorous calmness they fall into conversation and it be manifest that at every word lord eric be more and more fascinate by the fair house-breaker she learn who he be and evidently know all about he but she be careful to give he no inkling of she own identity at last she take she leave and he express such a eager hope of be allow to renew they acquaintance that it amount to a declaration of a peculiar interest in she thereupon she address he to this effect : have it occur to you to wonder how i get into you friend 's room i will show you how -- and produce a latch-key she hold it up with all its questionable implication before he eye then she lay it on the table say : i leave you to draw you own conclusion and depart a better opening for a light social comedy could scarcely be devise we have no difficulty in guess that the lady who be not quite young and have clearly a strong sense of humor be freakishly turn appearance against herself by way of throw a dash of cold water on lord eric 's sudden flame of devotion but we long for a clear explanation of the whole quaint little episode and here again no reasonable offer would tempt we to leave the theater before we curiosity be satisfy the remainder of the play though amusing be unfortunately not up to the level of the first act else _ wheel within wheel _ would be a little classic of light comedy for a third example of interest carefully carry forward i turn to a recent norwegian play _ the idyll _ by peter egge at the very rise of the curtain we find inga gar wife of a author and journalist dr gar reading with evident token of annoyance and distaste a new book of poem by one rolfe ringve before she marriage inga be a actress of no great talent ringve make himself conspicuous by praise she far beyond she merit and when at last a engagement between they be announce people shrug they shoulder and say : they be go to regularize the situation as a matter of fact -lrb- of this we have early assurance -rrb- though ringve have be she ardent lover inga have neither love he nor be he mistress ringve be call abroad she have during he absence break off she engagement to he and have then about a year before the play open married dr gar to whom she be devote while gar be away on a short lecture tour ringve have publish the book of love-poem which we find she reading they be very remarkable poem they have already make a great stir in the literary world and interest be all the keener for the fact that they be evidently inspire by he passion for inga and be couch in such a tone of intimacy as to create a highly injurious impression of the relation between they gar have just come home have no suspicion of the nature of the book and when a editor who cherish a grudge against he conceive the malicious idea of ask he to review ringve 's masterpiece he consent with alacrity one or two small incident have in the meantime show we that there be a little rift in the idyllic happiness of inga and gar arise from she inveterate habit of tell trifling fib to avoid face the petty annoyance of life for instance when gar ask she casually whether she have read ringve 's poem a foolish denial slip out though she know that the cut page of the book will give she the lie these incident point to a state of unstable equilibrium in the relation between husband and wife wherefore when we see gar at the end of the act prepare to read ringve 's poem we curiosity be very keen as to how he will take they we feel the next hour to be big with fate for these two people and we long for the curtain to rise again upon the threaten household the fuse have be fire we be all agog for the explosion in herr egge 's place i should have be incline to have drop my curtain upon gar with the light of the reading-lamp full upon he in the act of open the book and then to have show he at the beginning of the second act in exactly the same position with more delicate art perhaps the author interpose a little domestic incident at the end of the first act while leave it clearly impress on we mind that the reading of the poem be only postpone by a few minute that be the essential point : the actual moment upon which the curtain fall be of minor importance what be of vast importance on the other hand be that the expectation of the audience should not be baffle and that the curtain should rise upon the immediate sequel to the reading of the poem this be in the exact sense of the word _ a scène à faire _ -- a obligatory scene the author have arouse in we a reasonable expectation of it and should he choose to balk we -- to raise he curtain say a week or a month later -- we should feel that we have be trifle with the general theory of the _ scène à faire _ will presently come up for discussion in the meantime i merely make the obvious remark that it be worse than useless to awaken a definite expectation in the breast of the audience and then to disappoint it -lrb- 2 -rrb- the work of sir arthur pinero afford many example of interest very skilfully carry forward in he farce -- let no one despise the technical lesson to be learn from a good farce -- there be always a _ adventure _ afoot whose development we eagerly anticipate when the curtain fall on the first act of _ the magistrate _ we foresee the meeting of all the character at the hôtel des prince and be impatient to assist at it in _ the schoolmistress _ we would not for world miss peggy hesseltine 's party which we know await we in act ii a excellent example of a more serious order be to be find in _ the benefit of the doubt _ when poor theo rebuff by she husband 's chilly scepticism go off on some manifestly harebrained errand we divine as do she relative that she be about to commit social suicide by seek out john allingham and we feel more than curiosity as to the event -- we feel active concern almost anxiety as though we own personal interest be involve we anticipation be heighten too when we see sir fletcher portwood and mr cloy set off upon she track this give we a definite point to which to look forward while leave the actual course of event entirely undefine it fulfil one of the great end of craftsmanship in foreshadow without forestall a intensely interesting conjuncture of affair i have lay stress on the importance of carry forward the interest of the audience because it be a detail that be often overlook there be as a rule no difficulty in the matter always assume that the theme be not inherently devoid of interest one could mention many play in which the author have from sheer inadvertence fail to carry forward the interest of the first act though a very little readjustment or a trifling exercise of invention would have enable he to do so _ pillar of society _ indeed may be take as a instance though not a very flagrant one such interest as we feel at the end of the first act be vague and unfocused we be sure that something be to come of the return of lona and johan but we have no inkling as to what that something may be if we guess that the so-called black sheep of the family will prove to be the white sheep it be only because we know that it be ibsen 's habit to attack respectability and criticize accept moral value -- it be not because of anything that he have tell we or hint to we in the play itself in no other case do he leave we interest at such a loose end as in this he prentice-work in modern drama in _ the league of youth _ a earlier play but of a altogether lighter type the interest be much more definitely carry forward at the end of the first act stensgaard have attack chamberlain bratsberg in a rousing speech and the chamberlain have be induce to believe that the attack be direct not against himself but against he enemy monsen consequently he invite stensgaard to he great dinner-party and this invitation stensgaard regard as a cowardly attempt at conciliation we clearly see a crisis loom ahead when this misunderstanding shall be clear up and we consequently look forward with lively interest to the dinner-party of the second act -- which end as a matter of fact in a brilliant scene of comedy the principle to recapitulate be simply this : a good first act should never end in a blank wall there should always be a window in it with at least a glimpse of something attractive beyond in _ pillar of society _ there be a window indeed but it be of ground glass \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : that great story-teller alexandra duma _ pere _ those a straightforward way of carry forward the interest at the end of the first act of _ henrus iii et sa cour _ the due de guise insult by saint-mégrin beckon to he henchman and say as the curtain fall _ qu'on I cherche les mêmes hommes qui ont assassiné dugast _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : there be limit to the validity of this rule as apply to minor incident for example it may sometimes be a point of art to lead the audience to expect the appearance of one person when in fact another be about to enter but it be exceedingly dangerous to baffle the carefully foster anticipation of a important scene see chapter xvii and xxi -rrb- _ book iii _ the middle _ chapter xi _ tension and its suspension in the day of the five-act dogma each act be suppose to have its special and pre-ordained function freytag assign to the second act as a rule the _ steigerung _ or heighten -- the working-up one might call it -- of the interest but the second act in modern play have often to do all the work of the three middle act under the older dispensation wherefore the theory of they special function have more of a historical than of a practical interest for we present purpose we may treat the interior section of a play as a unit whether it consist of one two or three act the first act may be regard as the porch or vestibule through which we pass into the main fabric -- solemn or joyous fantastic or austere -- of the actual drama sometimes indeed the vestibule be reduce to a mere threshold which can be cross in two stride but normally the first act or at any rate the greater part of it be of a introductory character let we conceive then that we have pass the vestibule and be now to study the principle on which the body of the structure be rear in the first place be the architectural metaphor a just one be there or ought there to be any analogy between a drama and a finely-proportioned building the question have already be touch on in the opening paragraph of chapter viii but we may now look into it a little more closely what be the characteristic of a fine piece of architecture manifestly a organic relation a carefully-planned interdependence between all its part a great building be a complete and round whole just like a living organism it be inform by a inner law of harmony and proportion and can not be run up at haphazard with no definite and pre-determined design can we say the same of a great play i think we can even in those play which present a picture rather than a action we ought to recognize a principle of selection proportion composition which if not absolutely organic be at any rate the reverse of haphazard we may not always be able to define the principle to put it clearly in word but if we feel that the author have be guide by no principle that he have proceed on mere hand-to-mouth caprice that there be no inner law of harmony and proportion in he work then we instinctively relegate it to a low place in we esteem hauptmann 's _ weaver _ certainly can not be call a piece of dramatic architecture like _ rosmersholm _ or _ iri _ but that do not mean that it be a mere rambling series of tableau it be not easy to define the principle of unity in that brilliant comedy _ the madras house _ but we nevertheless feel that a principle of unity exist or if we do not so much the worse for the play and its author there be indeed a large class of play often popular and sometimes meritorious in relation to which the architectural metaphor entirely break down they be what may be call run fire play we have all see child set a number of wooden block on end at equal interval and then tilt over the first so that it fall against the second which in turn fall against the third and so on till the whole row with a rapid clack-clack-clack lie flat upon the table this be call a run fire and this be the structural principle of a good many play we feel that the playwright be so to speak invent as he go along -- that the action like the child 's fantastic serpentine of block might at any moment take a turn in any possible direction without falsify its antecedent or we expectation no part of it be necessarily involve in any other part if the play be find too long or too short a act might be cut out or write in without necessitate any considerable readjustment in the other act the play be really a series of episode which might odd bob sir in judicious hand extend from here to mesopotamy the episode may grow out of each other plausibly enough but by no pre-ordained necessity and with no far-reaching interdependence we live in such play from moment to moment foresee nothing desire nothing and though this frame of mind may be mildly agreeable it involve none of that complexity of sensation with which we contemplate a great piece of architecture or follow the development of a finely-constructed drama to this order belong many cape-and-sword play and detective drama -- play like _ the adventure of lady ursulum _ _ the red robe _ the musketeer romance that be at one time so popular and most play of the _ sherlock holme _ and _ raffle _ type but piece of a more ambitious order have be know to follow the same formulum -- some of the work for instance of mr charle mcevoy to say nothing of mr bernard shaw we may take it i think that the architectural analogy hold good of every play which can properly be say to be construct construction mean dramatic architecture or in other word a careful pre-arrangement of proportion and interdependency but to carry beyond this point the analogy between the two art would be fantastic and unhelpful the one exist in space the other in time the one seek to beget in the spectator a state of placid though it may be of aspiring contemplation the other a state of more or less acute tension the resemblance between music and architecture be as be well know much more extensive and illuminating it might not be wholly fanciful to call music a sort of middle term between the two other art a great part of the secret of dramatic architecture lie in the one word tension to engender maintain suspend heighten and resolve a state of tension -- that be the main object of the dramatist 's craft what do we mean by tension clearly a stretch out a stretch forward of the mind that be the characteristic mental attitude of the theatrical audience if the mind be not stretch forward the body will soon weary of its immobility and constraint attention may be call the momentary correlative of tension when we be intent on what be to come we be attentive to what be there and then happen the term tension be sometimes apply not to the mental state of the audience but to the relation of the character on the stage a scene of high tension be primarily one in which the actor undergo a great emotional strain but this be after all only a means towards heighten of the mental tension of the audience in such a scene the mind stretch forward no longer to something vague and distant but to something instant and imminent in discuss what freytag call the _ erregende moment _ we might have define it as the starting-point of the tension a reasonable audience will if necessary endure a certain amount of exposition a certain positing of character and circumstance before the tension set in but when it once have set in the playwright must on no account suffer it to relax until he deliberately resolve it just before the fall of the curtain there be of course minor rhythm of tension and resolution like the harmonic vibration of a violin-string that be imply when we say that a play consist of a great crisis work out through a series of minor crisis but the main tension once initiate must never be relax if it be the play be over though the author may have omit to note the fact not infrequently he begin a new play under the impression that he be finish the old one that be what shakespeare do in _ the merchant of venice _ the fifth act be a independent afterpiece though its independence be slightly disguise by the fact that the _ erregende moment _ of the new play follow close upon the end of the old one with no interact between a very exacting technical criticism might accuse ibsen of verge towards the same fault in _ a enemy of the people _ there the tension be practically resolve with dr stockmann 's ostracism at the end of the fourth act at that point if it do not know that there be another act to come a audience might go home in perfect content the fifth act be a sort of epilogue or sequel build out of the material of the precede drama but not form a integral part of it with a brief exposition to set forth the antecedent circumstance it would be quite possible to present the fifth act as a independent comedietta but here a point of great importance call for we notice though the tension once start must never be relax : though it ought on the contrary to be heighten or tighten -lrb- as you choose to put it -rrb- from act to act yet there be time when it may without disadvantage or even with marked advantage be temporarily suspend in other word the stretching-forward without in any way slacken may fall into the background of we consciousness while other matter the relevance of which may not be instantly apparent be suffer to occupy the foreground we know all too well in everyday experience that tension be not really relax by a temporary distraction the dread of a come ordeal in the witness-box or on the operating-table may be forcibly crush down like a child 's jack-in-the-box but we be always conscious of the effort to compress it and we know that it will spring up again the moment that effort cease sir arthur pinero 's play _ the profligate _ be write at a time when it be the fashion to give each act a sub-title and one of its act be head the sword of damocle that be indeed the inevitable symbol of dramatic tension : we see a sword of damocle -lrb- even though it be only a farcical blade of paint lathe -rrb- impend over someone 's head : and when once we be confident that it will fall at the fated moment we do not mind have we attention momentarily divert to other matter a rather flagrant example of suspend attention be afford by hamlet 's advice to the player we know that hamlet have hang a sword of damocle over the king 's head in the shape of the mimic murder-scene and while it be prepare we be quite willing to have we attention switch off to certain abstract question of dramatic criticism the scene might have be employ to heighten the tension instead of give the player -lrb- in true princely fashion -rrb- a lesson in the general principle of they art hamlet might have specially coach they in the business of the scene to be enact and thus doubly impressed on the audience he resolve to tent the king to the quick i be far from suggest that this would have be desirable but it would obviously have be possible -lrb- 1 -rrb- shakespeare as the experience of three century have show do right in judge that the audience be already sufficiently intent on the come ordeal and would welcome a interlude of aesthetic theory there be time moreover when it be not only permissible to suspend the tension but when by so do a great artist can produce a peculiar and admirable effect a sudden interruption on the very brink of a crisis may as it be whet the appetite of the audience for what be to come we see in the porter scene in macbeth a suspension of this nature but shakespeare use it sparingly unless indeed we be to consider as a deliberate point of art the retardation of movement commonly observable in the fourth act of he tragedy ibsen on the other hand deliberately employ this device on three conspicuous occasion the entrance of dr rank in the last act of _ a doll 's house _ be a wholly unnecessary interruption to the development of the crisis between nora and helmer the scene might be entirely omit without leave a perceptible hiatus in the action yet who do not feel that this brief respite lend gather impetus to the main action when it be resume the other instance be offer by the two apparition of ulric brendel in _ rosmersholm _ the first occur when rosmer be on the very verge of he momentous confession to kroll the second when rosmer and rebecca be on the very verge of they last great resolve and in each case we feel a distinct value -lrb- apart from the inherent quality of the brendel scene -rrb- in the very fact that the tension have be momentarily suspend such a _ rallentando _ effect be like the apparent pause in the rush of a river before it thunder over a precipice the possibility of suspend tension be of wider import than may at first sight appear but for it we drama would have to be all bone and muscle like the figure in a anatomical textbook as it be we be able without relax tension to shift it to various plane of consciousness and thus find leisure to reproduce the surface aspect of life with some of its accident and irrelevance for example when the playwright have at the end of he first act succeed in carry onward the spectator 's interest and give he something definite to look forward to it do not at all follow that the expected scene situation revelation or what not should come at the beginning of the second act in some case it must do so when as in _ the idyll _ above cite the spectator have be carefully induce to expect some imminent conjuncture which can not be postpone but this can scarcely be call a typical case more commonly when a author have enlist the curiosity of he audience of some definite point he will be in no great hurry to satisfy and dissipate it he may devote the early part of the second act to working-up the same line of interest to a higher pitch or he may hold it in suspense while he prepare some further development of the action the closeness with which a line of interest once start ought to be follow up must depend in some measure on the nature and tone of the play if it be a serious play in which character and action be very closely intertwine any pause or break in the conjoint development be to be avoid if on the other hand it be a play of light and graceful dialogue in which the action be a pretext for set the character in motion rather than the chief mean towards they manifestation then the playwright can afford to relax the rate of he progress and even to wander a little from the straight line of advance in such a play even the old institution of the underplot be not inadmissible though the underplot ought scarcely to be a plot but only some very slight thread of interest involve no strain on the attention -lrb- 2 -rrb- it may almost be call a established practice on the english stage to let the dalliance of a pair of boy-and-girl lover relieve the main interest of a more or less serious comedy and there be no particular harm in such a convention if it be not out of keep with the general character of the play in some play the substance -- the character-action if one may so call it -- be the main and indeed the only thing in other the substance though never unimportant be in some degree subordinate to the embroidery and it be for the playwright to judge how far this subordination may safely be carry one principle however may be emphasize as almost universally valid and that be that the end of a act should never leave the action just where it stand at the begin a audience have a instinctive sense of and desire for progress it do not like to realize that thing have be merely mark time even if it have be thoroughly entertain from moment to moment during the progress of a act it do not like to feel at the end that nothing have really happen the fall of the curtain give time for reflection and for the order of impression which while the action be afoot be more or less vague and confuse it be therefore of great importance that each act should to put it briefly bear look back upon -- that it should appear to stand in due proportion to the general design of the play and should not be feel to have be empty or irrelevant or disappointing this be indeed a plain corollary from the principle of tension suspend it may be sometimes with positive advantage but it must not be suspend too long and suspension for a whole act be equivalent to relaxation to sum up : when once a play have begin to move its movement ought to proceed continuously and with gathering momentum or if it stand still for a space the stoppage ought to be deliberate and purposeful it be fatal when the author think it be move while in fact it be only revolve on its own axis \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : this method of heighten the tension would have be somewhat analogous to that employ by oscar wilde in lady windermere 's instruction to she butler cite on p 115 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : dryden -lrb- _ of dramatic poesy _ p 56 ed arnold 1903 -rrb- say : we play besides the main design have underplot or by-concernment of less considerable person and intrigue which be carry on with the motion of the main plot as they say the orb of the fix star and those of the planet though they have motion of they own be whirl about by the motion of the _ primum mobile _ in which they be contain this be a admirable description of the ideal underplot as conceive by we forefather but we find that two line of tension jar with and weaken each other -rrb- _ chapter xii _ preparation : the finger-post we shall find on look into it that most of the technical maxim that have any validity may be trace back directly or indirectly to the great principle of tension the art of construction be sum up first in give the mind of a audience something to which to stretch forward and secondly in not let it feel that it have stretch forward in vain you will find it infinitely please say dryden -lrb- 1 -rrb- to be lead in a labyrinth of design where you see some of you way before you yet discern not the end till you arrive at it or he might have add if you foresee the end but not the means by which it be to be reach in drama as in all art the how be often more important than the what no technical maxim be more frequently cite than the remark of the younger duma : the art of the theater be the art of preparation this be true in a larger sense than he intend but at the same time there be limit to its truth which we must not fail to observe duma as we know be a inveterate preacher use the stage as a pulpit for the promulgation of moral and social idea which be in they day consider very advanced and daring the primary meaning of he maxim then be that a startling idea or a scene wherein such a idea be imply ought not to be spring upon a audience wholly unprepared to accept it for instance in _ monsieur alphonse _ a husband on discover that he wife have have a intrigue before they marriage and that a little girl whom she wish to adopt be really she daughter instantly raise she from the ground where she lie grovel at he foot and say : créature de dieu toi qui as faillus et te repens relève toi je te pardonne this evangelical attitude on the part of admiral de montaiglin be in itself very surprising and perhaps not wholly admirable to the parisian public of 1873 but dumas have so prepared the _ coup de théâtre _ that it pass with very slight difficulty on the first night and with none at all at subsequent performance and revival how have he prepare it why by play in a score of subtle way upon the sympathy and antipathy of the audience for instance as sarcey point out he have make m de montaiglin a sailor accustom during he distant voyage to long reverie in view of the boundless ocean whence he have acquire a mystical habit of mind duma certainly would never have place this pardon in the mouth of a stockbroker so far so good but preparation in the sense of the word be a device of rhetoric or of propaganda rather than of dramatic craftsmanship it be a method of astutely undermine or outflank prejudice desire to enforce a general principle you invent a case which be specially favourable to you argument and insinuate it into the acceptance of the audience by every possible subtlety of adjustment you trust it would seem that people who have applaud a act of pardon in a extreme case will be so much the readier to exercise that high prerogative in the less carefully prepared case which present themselves in real life this may or may not be a sound principle of persuasion as we be not here consider the drama as a art of persuasion we have not to decide between this and the opposite or shawesque principle of shocking and startling a audience by the utmost violence of paradox there be something to be say for both method -- for conversion by pill-and-jelly and for conversion by nitroglycerine revert now to the domain of pure craftsmanship can it be say that the art of the theater be the art of preparation yes it be very largely the art of delicate and unobtrusive preparation of help a audience to divine whither it be go while leave it to wonder how it be to get there on the other hand it be also the art of avoid laborious artificial and obvious preparation which lead to little or nothing a due proportion must always be observe between the preparation and the result to illustrate the meaning of preparation as the word be here employ i may perhaps be allow to reprint a passage from a review of mr israel zangwill 's play _ child of the ghetto _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- to those who have not read the novel it must seem as though the mere illustration of jewish life entirely overlay and overwhelm the action it be not so in reality one who know the story beforehand can often see that it be progress even in scene which seem purely episodic and unconnected either with each other or with the general scheme but mr zangwill have omit to provide finger-post if i may so express it to show those who do not know the story beforehand whither he be lead they he have neglect the great art of forecasting of keep anticipation on the alert which be half the secret of dramatic construction to forecast without discount you effect -- that be all the law and the prophet in the first act of _ child of the ghetto _ for instance we see the marriage in jest of hannah to sam levine follow by the instant divorce with all its curious ceremony this be amusing so far as it go but when the divorce be complete the whole thing seem to be over and do with we have see some people in whom as yet we take no particular interest enmesh in a difficulty arise from a strange and primitive formalism in the interpretation of law and we have see the meshes cut to the satisfaction of all party and the incident to all appearance close there be no finger-post to direct we anticipation on the way it should go and those who have not read the book can not possibly guess that this mock marriage instantly and ceremoniously dissolve can have any ulterior effect upon the fortune of any one concerned thus the whole scene however curious in itself seem motiveless and resultless how the requisite finger-post be to be provide i can not tell that be not my business but a skilful dramatist would have make it he then in the second act amid illustration of social life in the ghetto we have the meeting of hannah with david brandon a prettily-written scene of love-at-first-sight but so far as any one can see there be every prospect that the course of true love will run absolutely smooth again we lack a finger-post to direct we interest forward nor do we see anything that seem to bring this act into vital relation with its predecessor those who have read the book know that david brandon be a ` cohen ' a priest a descendant of aaron and that a priest may not marry a divorce woman know this we have a sense of irony of impending disaster which render the love-scene of the second act dramatic but to those and they must always be a majority in any give audience who do not know this the scene have no more dramatic quality than lie in its actual substance which although pretty enough be entirely commonplace not till the middle of the third act -lrb- out of four -rrb- be the obstacle reveal and we see that the mighty maze be not without a plan here then the drama begin after two act and a half of preparation during which we be vouchsafe no inkling of what be prepare it be capital drama when we come to it really human really tragic the arbitrary prohibition of the mosaic law have no religious or moral force either for david or for hannah they feel it to be they right almost they duty to cast off they shackle in any community save that of strict judaism they be perfectly free to marry but in thus flout the letter of the law hannah well know that she will break she father 's heart even as she struggle to shake they off the tradition of she race take firmer hold on she and in the highly dramatic last act -lrb- a not unskilful adaptation to the stage of the crucial scene of the book -rrb- she bow she neck beneath the yoke and renounce love that the law may be fulfil to state the matter in other term we be conscious of no tension in the earlier act of this play because we have not be permit to see the sword of damocle hang over the head of hannah and david brandon for lack of preparation of pointing-forward we feel none of that god-like superiority to the people of the mimic world which we have recognize as the characteristic privilege of the spectator we know no more than they do of the implication of they act and the network of embarrassment in which they be involve themselves indeed we know less than they do : for hannah as a well brought-up jewess be no doubt vaguely aware of the disability attach to a divorce woman a gentile audience on the other hand can not possibly foresee how -- some consequence yet hang in the star shall bitterly begin he fearful date with this night 's revel and lack that foreknowledge it miss the specifically dramatic effect of the scene the author invite it to play at blind-man 's - buff with the character instead of unseal its eye and enable it to watch the game from its olympian coign of vantage let the dramatist then never neglect to place the requisite finger-post on the road he would have we follow it be not of course necessary that we should be conscious of all the implication of any given scene or incident but we must know enough of they not only to create the requisite tension but to direct it towards the right quarter of the compass retrospective elucidation be valueless and sometimes irritating it be in nowise to the author 's interest that we should say ah if we have only know this or foresee that in time the effect of such-and-such a scene would have be entirely different we have no use for finger-post that point backwards -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the work of sir arthur pinero i recall two case in which the lack of a finger-post impair the desire effect : slightly in the one instance in the other very considerably the third act of that delightful comedy _ the princess and the butterfly _ contain no sufficient indication of fay zulianus 's jealousy of the friendship between sir george lamorant and the princess pannonium we be rather at a loss to account for the coldness of she attitude to the princess and she perverse naughtiness in go off to the opera ball this render the end of the act practically ineffective we so little foresee what be to come of fay 's midnight escapade that we take no particular interest in it and be rather disconcert by the care with which it be lead up to and the prominence assign to it this however be a trifling fault far different be the case in the last act of _ the benefit of the doubt _ which go near to ruin what be otherwise a very fine play the defect indeed be not purely technical : on look into it we find that the author be not in fact work towards a end which can be call either inevitable or conspicuously desirable he failure to point forward be no doubt partly due to he have nothing very satisfactory to point forward to but it be only in retrospect that this become apparent what we feel while the act be in progress be simply the lack of any finger-post to afford we a inkling of the end towards which we be proceed through scene after scene we appear to be make no progress but go round and round in a depressing circle the tension in a word be fatally relax it may perhaps be suggest as a maxim that when a author find a difficulty in place the requisite finger-post as he near the end of he play he will do well to suspect that the end he have in view be defective and to try if he can not amend it in the ancient and in the modern romantic drama oracle portent prophecy horoscope and such-like intromission of the supernatural afford a very convenient aid to the placing of the requisite finger-post -- foreshadow without forestall it have often be say that _ macbeth _ approach the nearest of all shakespeare 's tragedy to the antique model : and in nothing be the resemblance clearer than in the employment of the witch to point they skinny finger into the fated future in _ romeo and juliet _ inward foreboding take the place of outward prophecy i have quote above romeo 's prevision of some consequence yet hang in the star and beside it may be place juliet 's -- i have no joy of this contract to-night it be too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lighten in _ othello _ on the other hand the most modern of all he play shakespeare have recourse neither to outward boding nor to inward foreboding but plant a plain finger-post in the soil of human nature when he make brabantio say -- look to she moor if thou hast eye to see : she have deceive she father and may thee mr stephen phillip in the first act of _ paolo and francesca _ outdo all he predecessor ancient or modern in he daring use of sibylline prophecy he make giovannus 's blind foster-mother angelum foretell the tragedy in almost every detail save that in she vision she can not see the face of francesca 's lover mr phillip i take it be here reinforce ancient tradition by a reference to modern psychical research he trust to we conceive such clairvoyance to be not wholly impossible and give it what may be call provisional credence whether the device be artistic or not we need not here consider i merely point to it as a conspicuous example of the use of the finger-post -lrb- 4 -rrb- it need scarcely be say that a misleading finger-post be carefully to be avoid except in the rare case where it may be advisable to beget a momentary misapprehension on the part of the audience which shall be almost instantly correct in some pleasant or otherwise effective fashion -lrb- 5 -rrb- it be naturally difficult to think of striking instance of the misleading finger-post for play which contain such a blunder be not apt to survive even in the memory a small example occur in a clever play name _ a modern aspasium _ by mr hamilton fyfe edward meredith have two household : a london house over which he lawful wife muriel preside and a country cottage where dwell he mistress margaret with she two child one day muriel 's automobile break down near margaret 's cottage and while the tyre be be repair margaret give she visitor tea neither of they know the other throughout the scene we be naturally wonder whether a revelation be to occur and when towards the close muriel go to margaret 's room to put she hat straight we have no longer any doubt on the subject it be practically inevitable that she should find in the room she husband 's photograph or some object which she should instantly recognize as he and should return to the stage in full possession of the secret this be so probable that nothing but a miracle can prevent it : we mentally give the author credit for bring about he revelation in a very simple and natural way and we be proportionately disappoint when we find that the miracle have occur and that muriel return to the sitting-room no wiser than she leave it very possibly the general economy of the play demand that the revelation should not take place at this juncture that question do not here concern we the point be that have determine to reserve the revelation for he next act the author ought not by send muriel into margaret 's bedroom to have awaken in we a confident anticipation of its occur there and then a romantic play by mr j b fagan entitle _ under which king _ offer another small instance of the same nature the date be 1746 certain despatch of vast importance have to be carry by a hanoverian officer from moidart to fort william the jacobite arrange to drug the officer and to make assurance doubly sure in case the drug should fail to act they post a highland marksman in a narrow glen to pick he off as he pass the drug do act but he lady-love to save he military honor assume male attire and ride off with the despatch we hear she horse 's hoof go clatter down the road and then as the curtain fall we hear a shot ring out into the night this shot be a misleading finger-post nothing come of it : we find in the next act that the marksman have miss but marksmen under such circumstance have no business to miss it be a breach of the dramatic propriety we feel that the author have be trifle with we in inflict on we this purely mechanical and momentary scare the case would be different if the young lady know that the marksman be lie in ambush and determine to run the gantlet in that case the incident would be a trait of character but unless my memory deceive I that be not the case on the stage every bullet should have its billet -- not necessarily in the person aim at but in the emotion or anticipation of the audience this bullet may indeed give we a momentary thrill of alarm but it be dearly buy at the expense of subsequent disillusionment we have now to consider the subject of over-preparation too obtrusive preparation mountainous preparation lead only to a mouse-like effect this be the characteristic error of the so-called well-made play the play of elaborate and ingenious intrigue the trouble with the well-made play be that it be almost always and of necessity ill-made very rarely do the playwright succeed in weave a web which be at once intricate consistent and clear in nineteen case out of twenty there be glare flaw that have to be overlook or else the pattern be so involve that the mind 's eye can not follow it and become bewildered and fatigue a classical example of both fault may be find in congreve 's so-called comedy _ the double-dealer _ this be in fact a powerful drama somewhat in the sardou manner but congreve have none of sardou 's deftness in manipulate a intrigue maskwell be not only a double-dealer but a triple -- or quadruple-dealer so that the brain soon grow dizzy in the vortex of he villainy the play it may be note be a failure there be a quite legitimate pleasure to be find no doubt in a complex intrigue which be also perspicuous play such as alexandre duma 's _ mademoiselle de belle-isle _ or the pseudo-historical drama of scribe - _ adrienne lecouvreur bertrand et raton un verre d'eau les trois maupin _ etc -- be amusing toy like those social or military tableau the figure of which you can set in motion by drop a penny in the slot but the trick of this sort of preparation have long be find out and even unsophisticated audience be scarcely to be thrill by it we may accept it as a sound principle base on common sense and justify by experience that a audience should never be tempt to exclaim what a marvellously clever fellow be this playwright how infinitely cleverer than the dramatist who construct the tragi-comedy of life this be what we inevitably exclaim as we watch victorien sardou in whom french ingenuity culminate and caricature itself lay the foundation of one of he labyrinthine intrigue the absurdity of preparation in this sense could scarcely be better satirize than in the follow page from francisque sarcey 's criticism of _ no intime _ -lrb- know in english as _ peril _ -rrb- -- a page which be intend not as satire but as eulogy -- at the sixth performance i meet during the first interact a man of infinite taste who complain of the lengthiness of this first act : what a lot of detail he say which serve no purpose and have better have be omit what be the use of that long story about the cactus with a flower that be unique in all the world why trouble we with that dahlia-root which m caussade 's neighbor have throw over the garden wall be it necessary to inflict on we all that talk about the fox that play havoc in the garden what have we to do with that mischievous beast and that tolozan with he endless digression what do we care about he idea on love on metempsychosis on friendship etc all this stuff only retard the action on the contrary i reply all this be just what be go to interest you you be impatient of these detail because you be look out for the scene of passion which have be promise you but reflect that without these preparation the scene of passion would not touch you that cactus-flower will play its part you may be sure that dahlia-root be not there for nothing that fox to which you object and of which you will hear more talk during two more act will bring about the solution of one of the most entertaining situation in all drama m sarcey do not tell we what he interlocutor reply but he might have say like the hero of _ le réveillon _ : be you sure there be no mistake be you defend sardou or attack he for another example of ultra-complex preparation let I turn to a play by mr sydney grundy entitle _ the degenerate _ mr grundy though a adept of the scribe school have do so much strong and original work that i apologize for exhume a play in which he almost burlesque he own method but for that very reason it be difficult to find a more convincing or more deterrent example of misdirected ingenuity the detail of the plot need not be recite it be sufficient to say that the curtain have not be raise ten minute before we attention have be draw to the fact that a certain lady saumarez have she monogram on everything she wear even to she glove : whence we at once foresee that she be destine to get into a compromise situation to escape from it but to leave a glove behind she in due time the compromise situation arrive and we find that it not only require a room with three door -lrb- 6 -rrb- but that a locksmith have to be specially call in to provide two of these door with peculiar lock so that when once shut they can not be open from inside except with a key what interest can we take in a situation turn on such contrivance sane technic laugh at locksmith and after all this preparation the situation prove to be a familiar trick of theatrical thimble-rigging : you lift the thimble and instead of pea a behold pea b -- instead of lady saumarez it be mrs trevelyan who be conceal in isidore de lorano 's bedroom sir william saumarez must be a exceedingly simple-minded person to accept the substitution and exceedingly unfamiliar with the french drama of the ` seventy and ` eighty if he have he wit about he he would say : i know this dodge : it come from sardou lady saumarez have just slip out by that door up r and if i look about i shall certainly find she fan or she glove or she handkerchief somewhere on the premise the author may object that such criticism would end in paralyse the playwright and that if man always profit by the lesson of the stage the world would long ago have become so wise that there would be no more room in it for drama which live on human folly you will tell I next he may say that i must not make groundless jealousy the theme of a play because every one who have see othello would at once detect the machination of a iago the retort be logically specious but it mistake the point it would certainly be rash to put any limit to human gullibility or to deny that sir william saumarez in the give situation might conceivably be hoodwink the question be not one of psychology but of theatrical expediency : and the point be that when a situation be at once highly improbable in real life and exceedingly familiar on the stage we can not help mentally caricature it as it proceed and be thus prevent from lend it the provisional credence on which interest and emotion depend a instructive contrast to _ the degenerate _ may be find in a nearly contemporary play _ mr dane 's defense _ by mr henry arthur jone the first three act of this play may be cite as a excellent example of dexterous preparation and development we interest in the sequence of event be arouse sustained and work up to a high tension with consummate skill there be no feverish overcrowding of incident as be so often the case in the great french story-play -- _ adrienne lecouvreur _ for example or _ fédora _ the action move onwards unhasting unresting and the finger-post be place just where they be want the observance of a due proportion between preparation and result be a matter of great moment even when the result achieve be in itself very remarkable it may be dearly purchase by a too long and too elaborate process of preparation a famous play which be justly chargeable with this fault be _ the gay lord quex _ the third act be certainly one of the most breathlessly absorb scene in modern drama but by what long and serpentine and gritty path do we not approach it the elaborate series of trifling incident by means of which sophy fullgarney be first bring from new bond street to fauncey court and then substitute for the duchess 's maid be at no point actually improbable and yet we feel that a vast effort have be make to attain a end which owe to the very length of the sequence of chance at last assume a air of improbability there be little doubt that the substructure of the great scene might have be very much simpler i imagine that sir arthur pinero be betray into complexity and over-elaboration by he desire to use as a background for he action a study of that curious phase of modern life the manicurist 's parlor to those who find this study interesting the disproportion between preliminary and result may be less apparent it certainly do not interfere with the success of the play in its novelty but it may very probably curtail its lease of life what should we know of _ the school for scandal _ to-day if it consist of nothing but the screen scene and two laborious act of preparation a too obvious preparation be very apt to defeat its end by beget a perversely quizzical frame of mind in the audience the desire effect be discount like a conjure trick in which the mechanism be too transparent let I recall a trivial but instructive instance of this error the occasion be the first performance of _ pillar of society _ at the gaiety theater london -- the first ibsen performance ever give in england at the end of the third act krap consul bernick 's clerk knock at the door of he master 's office and say it be blow up to a stiff gale be the _ indian girl _ to sail in spite of it whereupon bernick though he know that the _ indian girl _ be hopelessly unseaworthy reply the _ indian girl _ be to sail in spite of it it have occur to someone that the effect of this incident would be heighten if krap before knock at the consul 's door be to consult the barometer and show by he demeanor that it be fall rapidly a barometer have accordingly be hang up stage near the veranda entrance and as the scenic apparatus of a gaiety matinée be in those day always of the scantiest it be practically the one decoration of a room otherwise bare almost to indecency it have stare the audience full in the face through three long act and when at the end of the third krap go up to it and tap it a sigh of relief run through the house as much as to say at last so _ that _ be what it be for -- to the no small detriment of the situation here the fault lay in the obtrusiveness of the preparation have the barometer pass practically unnoticed among the other detail of a well-furnished hall it would at any rate have be innocent and perhaps helpful as it be it seem to challenge the curiosity of the audience say i be evidently here with some intention guess now what the intention can be the producer have fail in the art which conceal art another little trait from a play of those far-past day illustrate the same point it be a drawing-room drama of the scribe school near the beginning of a act some one spill a bottle of red ink and mop it up with he -lrb- or she -rrb- handkerchief leave the handkerchief on the escritoire the act proceed from scene to scene and the handkerchief remain unnoticed but every one in the audience who know the rule of the game keep he eye on the escritoire and be certain that that ink have not be spill for nothing in due course a situation of great intensity be reach wherein the villain produce a pistol and fire at the heroine who faint as a matter of fact he have miss she but she quick-witted friend seize the gory handkerchief and wave it in the air persuade the villain that the shot have take deadly effect and that he must flee for he life even in those day such a unblushing piece of trickery be find more comic than impressive it be a case of preparation give itself away a somewhat later play _ the mummy and the humming bird _ by mr isaac henderson contain a good example of over-elaborate preparation the earl of lumley lose in he chemical study with a more than newtonian absorption suffer he young wife to form a sentimental friendship with a scoundrel of a italian novelist signor d'orelli remain at home one evening when lady lumley and a party of friend include d'orellus have go off to dine at a restaurant the earl chance to look out of the window and observe a organ-grinder make doleful music in the snow he heart be touch and he invite the music-monger to join he in he study and share he informal dinner the conversation between they be carry on by means of sign for the organ-grinder know no english and the earl be painfully and improbably ignorant of italian he do not even know that roma mean rome and londra london this ignorance however be part of the author 's ingenuity it lead to the establishment of a sort of object-speech by aid of which the earl learn that he guest have come to england to prosecute a vendetta against the man who ruin he happy sicilian home i need scarcely say that this villain be none other than d'orelli and when at last he and the countess elope to pari the object-speech enable giuseppe to convey to the earl by aid of a brandy-bottle a siphon a broken plate and half-a-crown not only the place of they destination but the very hotel to which they be go this be a fair example of that ingenuity for ingenuity 's sake which be once think the very essence of the playwright 's craft but have long ago lose all attraction for intelligent audience we may take it as a rule that any scene which require a obviously purposeful scenic arrangement be thereby discount it may be strong enough to live down the disadvantage but a disadvantage it be none the less in a play of mr carton 's _ the home secretary _ a paper of great importance be know to be contain in a official despatch-box when the curtain rise on the last act it reveal this despatch-box on a table right opposite a french window while at the other side of the room a high-backed arm-chair discreetly avert its face every one could see at a glance that the romantic anarchist be go to sneak in at the window and attempt to abstract the despatch-box while the heroine be to lie perdue in the high-backed chair and when at the fate moment all this punctually occur one could scarcely repress a ah of sarcastic satisfaction similarly in a able play name mr and mr daventry mr frank harri have conceive a situation which require that the scene should be specially build for eavesdropping -lrb- 7 -rrb- as soon as the curtain rise and reveal a screen draw halfway down the stage with a sofa ensconce behind it we know what to expect of course mr daventry be to lie on the sofa and overhear a duologue between she husband and he mistress : the only puzzle be to understand why the guilty pair should neglect the precaution of look behind the screen as a matter of fact mr daventry before she lay down switch off the light and daventry and lady langham find the room dark assume it to be empty with astounding foolhardiness consider that the house be full of guest and this a much frequented public room daventry proceed to lock the door and continue he conversation with lady langham in the firelight thus when the lady 's husband come knock at the door mr daventry be able to rescue the guilty pair from a apparently hopeless predicament by calmly switch on the light and open the door to sir john langham the situation be undoubtedly a strong one but the tendency of modern technic be to hold strength too dearly purchase at such reckless expense of preparation there be then very clear limit to the validity of the duma maxim that the art of the theater be the art of preparation certain it be that over-preparation be the most fatal of error the clumsiest thing a dramatist can possibly do be to lay a long and elaborate train for the ignition of a squib we take pleasure in a event which have be prepare in the sense that we have be lead to desire it and have wonder how it be to be bring about but we scoff at a occurrence which nothing but we knowledge of the trick of the stage could possibly lead we to expect yet which know these trick we have foresee from afar and resent in advance \* \*

obligatory scene i do not know whether it be francisque sarcey who invent the phrase _ scène à faire _ but it certainly owe its currency to that valiant champion of the theatrical theater if i may so express it note that in this term i intend no disrespect my conception of the theatrical theater may not be exactly the same as m sarcey 's but at all event i share he abhorrence of the untheatrical theater what be the _ scène à faire _ sarcey have use the phrase so often and in so many context that it be impossible to tie he down to any strict definition instead of try to do so i will give a typical example of the way in which he usually employ the term in _ les fourchambault _ by emile augier the first act introduce we to the household of a merchant of havre who have marry a wealthy but extravagant woman and have a son and daughter who be be gradually corrupt by they mother 's worldliness we learn that fourchambault senior have in he youth betray a young woman who be a governess in he family he want to marry she but he relation malign she character and he cast she off nor do he know what have become of she and she child in the second act we pass to the house of a energetic and successful young shipowner name bernard who live alone with he mother bernard as we divine be secretly devote to a young lady name marie letellier a guest in the fourchambault house to whom young leopold fourchambault be pay undesirable attention one day bernard casually mention to he mother that the house of fourchambault be on the verge of bankruptcy nothing less than a quarter of a million franc will enable it to tide over the crisis mme bernard to she son 's astonishment beg he to lend the totter firm the sum require he object that unless the business be better manage the loan will only postpone the inevitable disaster well then my son she reply you must go into partnership with m fourchambault i with that imbecile he exclaim my son she say gravely and emphatically you must -- it be you duty -- i demand it of you ah cry bernard i understand -- he be my father after ecstatically laud this situation and the scene which have lead up to it m sarcey continue -- when the curtain fall upon the word he be my father i at once see two _ scènes à faire _ and i know that they will be _ faite _ : the scene between the son and the father whom he be to save the scene between bernard and he half-brother leopold who be in love with the same woman the one dishonourably and the other secretly and nobly what will they say to each other i have no idea but it be precisely this _ expectation mingle with uncertainly _ that be one of the charm of the theater i say to myself ah they will have a encounter what will come of it and that this be the state of mind of the whole audience be prove by the fact that when the two character of the _ scènes à faire _ stand face to face a thrill of anticipation run round the whole theater this then be the obligatory scene as sarcey generally understand it -- a scene which for one reason or another a audience expect and ardently desire i have italicize the phrase expectation mingle with uncertainty because it express in other term the idea which i have seek to convey in the formulum foreshadowing without forestall but before we can judge of the merit of m sarcey 's theory we must look into it a little more closely i shall try then to state it in my own word in what i believe to be its most rational and defensible form a obligatory scene be one which the audience -lrb- more or less clearly and consciously -rrb- foresee and desire and the absence of which it may with reason resent on a rough analysis it will appear i think that there be five way in which a scene may become in this sense obligatory : -lrb- 1 -rrb- it may be necessitate by the inherent logic of the theme -lrb- 2 -rrb- it may be demand by the manifest exigency of specifically dramatic effect -lrb- 3 -rrb- the author himself may have render it obligatory by seem unmistakably to lead up to it -lrb- 4 -rrb- it may be require in order to justify some modification of character or alteration of will too important to be take for grant -lrb- 5 -rrb- it may be impose by history or legend these five class of obligatory scene may be docket respectively as the logical the dramatic the structural the psychological and the historic m sarcey generally employ the term in one of the first three sens without clearly distinguish between they it be indeed not always easy to determine whether the compulsion -lrb- assume it to exist at all -rrb- lie in the very essence of the theme or situation or only in the author 's manipulation of it be sarcey right in assume such a compulsion to be a constant and dominant factor in the playwright 's craft i think we shall see reason to believe he right in hold that it frequently arise but wrong if he go the length of maintain that there can be no good play without a definite _ scène à faire _ -- as eighteenth-century landscape painter be say to have hold that no one could be a master of he art till he know where to place the brown tree i remember no passage in which sarcey explicitly lay down so hard and fast a rule but several in which he seem to take it for grant -lrb- 1 -rrb- it may be ask whether -- and if so why -- the theory of the obligatory scene hold good for the dramatist and not for the novelist perhaps it have more application to the novel than be commonly suppose but in so far as it apply peculiarly to the drama the reason be pretty clear it lie in the strict concentration impose on the dramatist and the high mental tension which be or ought to be characteristic of the theatrical audience the leisurely and comparatively passive novel-reader may never miss a scene which a audience with its instinct of logic and of economy keenly alert may feel to be inevitable the dramatist be bind to extract from he material the last particle of that particular order of effect which the stage and the stage alone can give we if he fail to do so we feel that there have be no adequate justification for set in motion all the complex mechanism of the theater he play be like a badly-designed engine in which a large part of the potential energy be dissipate to no purpose the novelist with a far wider range of effect at he command and employ no special mechanism to bring they home to we be much more free to select and to reject he be exempt from the law of rigid economy to which the dramatist must submit far from be bind to do thing in the most dramatic way he often do wisely in reject that course as unsuited to he medium fundamentally no doubt the same principle apply to both art but with a wholly different stringency in the case of the drama advisable in the novelist 's vocabulary be translate by imperative in the dramatist 's the one be play a long-drawn game in which the loss of a trick or two need not prove fatal the other have stake he all on a single rubber \* \* \* \* \* obligatory scene of the first type -- those necessitate by the inherent logic of the theme -- can naturally arise only in play to which a definite theme can be assign if we say that woman 's claim to possess a soul of she own even in marriage be the theme of _ a doll 's house _ then evidently the last great balancing of account between nora and helmer be a obligatory scene it would have be quite possible for ibsen to have complete the play without any such scene : he might for instance have let nora fulfil she intention of drown herself but in that case he play would have be merely a tragic anecdote with the point omit we should have feel vague intimation of a general idea hover in the air but it would have remain undefined and undeveloped as we review however the series of ibsen 's play and notice how difficult it be to point to any individual scene and say this be clearly the _ scène à faire _ we feel that though the phrase may express a useful idea in a conveniently brief form there be no possibility of make the presence or absence of a _ scène à faire _ a general test of dramatic merit in _ the wild duck _ who would not say that theoretically the scene in which greger open hialmar 's eye to the true history of he marriage be obligatory in the highest degree yet ibsen as a matter of fact do not present it to we : he send the two man off for a long walk together : and who do not feel that this be a stroke of consummate art in _ rosmersholm _ as we know he have be accuse of neglect not merely the scene but the play _ à faire _ but who will now maintain that accusation in _ john gabriel borhman _ if we define the theme as the clash of two devour egoism ibsen have in the third act give we the obligatory scene but he have do it unfortunately with a enfeebled hand whereas the first and second act though largely expository and even -lrb- in the foldal scene -rrb- episodic rank with he greatest achievement for abundant example of scene render obligatory by the logic of the theme we have only to turn to the work of those remorseless dialectician mm hervieu and brieux in such a play as _ la course du flambeau _ there be scarcely a scene that may not be call a obligatory deduction from the thesis duly enunciate with no small parade of erudition in the first ten minute of the play it be that in hand on the _ vital lampada _ as plato and le bon poète lucrèce express it the love of the parent for the child become a devour mania to which everything else be sacrifice while the love of the child for the parent be a tame and essentially selfish emotion absolutely powerless when it come into competition with the passion which be concern with the transmission of the vital flame this theorem have be state what be the first obligatory scene evidently one in which a mother shall refuse a second marriage with a man whom she love because it would injure the prospects and wind the feeling of she adored daughter then when the adore daughter herself marry the mother must make every possible sacrifice for she and the daughter must accept they all with indifference as mere matter of course but what be the final triumphant proof of the theorem why of course the mother must kill she mother to save the daughter 's life and this ultra-obligatory scene m hervieu duly serve up to we marie-jeanne -lrb- the daughter -rrb- be order to the engadine sabine -lrb- the mother -rrb- be warn that madame fontenais -lrb- the grandmother -rrb- must not go to that altitude on pain of death but by a series of violently artificial device thing be so arrange that marie-jeanne can not go unless madame fontenais go too and sabine rather than endanger she daughter 's recovery do not hesitate to let she mother set forth unwittingly to she doom in the last scene of all marie-jeanne light-heartedly prepare to leave she mother and go off with she husband to the end of the earth sabine learn that the man she love and reject for marie-jeanne 's sake be for ever lose to she and to complete the demonstration madame fontenais fall dead at she foot these scene be unmistakably _ scènes à faire _ dictate by the logic of the theme but they belong to a conception of art in which the free rhythm of life be ruthlessly sacrifice to the need of a demonstration obligatory scene of this order be mere diagram draw with ruler and compass -- the obligatory illustration of a extravagantly over-systematic lecture m brieux in some of he play -lrb- not in all -rrb- be no less logic-ridden than m hervieu take for instance _ les trois filles de m dupont _ : every character be a term in a syllogism every scene be dictate by a imperious craving for symmetry the main theorem may be state in some such term as these : the french marriage system be immoral and abominable yet the married woman be on the whole less pitiable than she unmarried sister in order to prove this thesis in due form we begin at the beginning and show how the marriage of antonin mairaut and julie dupont be bring about by the dishonest cupidity of the parent on both side the dupont flatter themselves that they have cheat the mairaut the mairaut that they have swindle the dupont while antonin deliberately simulate artistic taste to deceive julie and julie as deliberately make a show of business capacity in order to take in antonin every scene between father and daughter be balance by a corresponding scene between mother and son every touch of hypocrisy on the one side be scrupulously set off against a trait of dishonesty on the other julie 's passion for child be emphasize antonin 's aversion from they be underline but lest he should be accuse of see everything in black m brieux will not make the parent altogether detestable still hold the balance true he let m mairaut on the one side and madame dupont on the other develop amiable impulse and protest at a give moment against the infamy commit and countenance by they respective spouse and in the second and third act the edifice of deception symmetrically build up in the first act be no less symmetrically demolish the parent expose and denounce each other 's villainy julie and antonin in a great scene of conjugal recrimination lay bare the hypocrisy of allurement that have bring they together julie then determine to escape from the loathsome prison-house of she marriage and this bring we to the second part of the theorem the title show that julie have two sister but hitherto they have remain in the background why do they exist at all why have providence bless m dupont with three fair daughter and no more because providence foresee exactly the number m brieux would require for he demonstration be there not three course open to a penniless woman in we social system -- marriage wage-earning industry and wage-earning profligacy well m dupont must have one daughter to represent each of these contingency julie have illustrate the misery of marriage caroline and angèle shall illustrate respectively the still greater misery of unmarried virtue and unmarried vice when julie declare she intention of break away from the house of bondage she sister rise up symmetrically one on either hand and implore she rather to bear the ill she have than to fly to other that she know not of symmetry of symmetry all be symmetry in the poetic of m brieux but life do not fall into such obvious pattern the obligatory scene which be impose upon we not by the logic of life but by the logic of demonstration be not a _ scène à faire _ but a _ scène à fuir _ mr bernard shaw in some sense the brieux of the english theater be not a man to be dominate by logic or by anything else under the sun he have however give we one or two excellent example of the obligatory scene in the true and really artistic sense of the term the scene of candida 's choice between eugene and morell crown the edifice of _ candida _ as nothing else could give the character and they respective attitude towards life this sententious thrashing-out of the situation be inevitable so too in _ mr warren 's profession _ the great scene of the second act between vivie and she mother be a superb example of a scene impose by the logic of the theme on the other hand in mr henry arthur jone 's finely conceive though unequal play _ michael and he lose angel _ we miss what be surely a obligatory scene the play be in fact a contest between the paganism of audrie lesden and the ascetic sacerdotal idealism of michael feversham in the second act paganism snatch a momentary victory and we confidently expect in the third act a set and strenuous effort on audrie 's part to break down in theory the ascetic ideal which have collapse in practice it be probable enough that she might not succeed in drag she lover forth from what she regard as the prison-house of a superstition but the logic of the theme absolutely demand that she should make the attempt mr jone have prefer to go astray after some comparatively irrelevant and commonplace matter and have thus leave he play incomplete so too in _ the triumph of the philistine _ mr jone make the mistake of expect we to take a tender interest in a pair of lover who have have never a love-scene to set we interest agoing they be introduce to each other in the first act and we shrewdly suspect -lrb- for in the theater we be all inveterate match-maker -rrb- that they be go to fall in love but we have not the smallest positive evidence of the fact before we find in the second act that misunderstanding have arise and the lady decline to look at the gentleman the actress who play the part at the st jame 's theater be blame for fail to enlist we sympathy in this romance but what actress can make much of a love part which up to the very last moment be all suspicion and jealousy fancy _ romeo and juliet _ with the love-scenes omit by special request \* \* \* \* \* in a second class accord to we analysis we place the obligatory scene which be impose by the manifest exigency of specifically dramatic effect here it must of course be note that the conception of specifically dramatic effect vary in some degree from age to age from generation to generation and even one may almost say from theater to theater scene of violence and slaughter be banish from the greek theater mainly no doubt because rapid movement be render difficult by the hieratic trappings of the actor and be altogether foreign to the spirit of tragedy but it can scarcely be doubt that the tragic poet be the less inclined to rebel against this convention because they extract specifically dramatic effect of a very high order out of they messenger-scene even in the modern theater we be thrill by the description of hippolytus drag at he own chariot wheel or creusa and creon devour by medea 's veil of fire -lrb- 2 -rrb- on the elizabethan stage the murder of agamemnon would no doubt have be subject to we faithful eye like the blind of gloucester or the suffocation of edward ii but who shall say that there be less specifically dramatic effect in aeschylus 's method of mirroring the scene in the clairvoyant ecstasy of cassandra i be much inclined to think that the dramatic effect of highly emotional narrative be underrate in the modern theater again at one class of theater the author of a sport play -- be bind to exhibit a horse-race on the stage or he be hold to have shirk he obligatory scene at another class of theater we shall have a scene perhaps in a box in the grand stand where some lady gay spanker shall breathlessly depict from start to finish the race which be visible to she but invisible to the audience at a third class of the theater the specifically dramatic effect to be extract from a horse-race be find in a scene in a black-country slum where a group of working-man and woman be feverishly await the evening paper which shall bring they the result of the st leger involve for some of they opulence -- to the extent perhaps of a # 5 note -- and for other ruin -lrb- 3 -rrb- the difficulty of decide that any one form of scene be predestine by the law of dramatic effect be illustrate in tolstoy 's grisly drama _ the power of darkness _ the scene in which nikita kill akoulina 's child be feel to be too horrible for representation whereupon the author write a alternative scene between mitritch and anna which pass simultaneously with the murder scene in a adjoining room the two scene fulfil exactly the same function in the economy of the play it can be act with either of they it might be act with both and it be impossible to say which produce the intenser or more specifically dramatic effect the fact remain however that there be almost always a dramatic and undramatic a more dramatic and a less dramatic way of do a thing and a author who allow we to foresee and expect a dramatic way of attain a give end and then choose a undramatic or less dramatic way be guilty of have miss the obligatory scene for a general discussion of what we mean by the term dramatic and undramatic the reader may refer back to chapter iii here i need only give one or two particular illustration it will be remember that one of the _ scènes à faire _ which m sarcey foresaw in _ les fourchambault _ be the encounter between the two brother the illegitimate bernard and the legitimate leopold it would have be quite possible and quite natural to let the action of the play work itself out without any such encounter or to let the encounter take place behind the scene but this would have be a patent ignore of dramatic possibility and m sarcey would have have ample reason to pour the vial of he wrath on augier 's head he be right however in he confidence that augier would not fail to make the scene and how do he make it the one thing inevitable about it be that the truth should be reveal to leopold but there be a dozen different way in which that might have be effect perhaps in real life bernard would have say something to this effect : young man you be make questionable advance to a lady in whom i be interested i beg that you will cease to persecute she and if you ask by what right i do so i reply that i be in fact you elder brother that i have save we father from ruin that i be henceforth the predominant partner in he business and that if you do not behave yourself i shall see that you allowance be withdraw and that you have no longer the means to lead a idle and dissolute life this would have be a ungracious but not unnatural way of go about the business have augier choose it we should have have no right to complain on the score of probability but it would have be evident to the least imaginative that he have leave the specifically dramatic opportunity of the scene entirely undeveloped let we now see what he actually do marie letellier compromise by leopold 's conduct have leave the fourchambault house and take refuge with mme bernard bernard love she devotedly but do not dream that she can see anything in he uncouth personality and imagine that she love leopold accordingly he determine that leopold shall marry she and tell he so leopold scoff at the idea bernard insist and little by little the conflict rise to a tone of personal altercation at last leopold say something slighting of mile letellier and bernard -- who be it note have begin with no intention of reveal the kinship between they -- lose he self-control and cry ah there speak the blood of the man who slander a woman in order to prevent he son from keep he word to she i recognize in you you grandfather who be a miserable calumniator repeat that word say leopold bernard do so and the other strike he across the face with he glove for a perceptible interval bernard struggle with he rage in silence and then : it be well for you he cry that you be my brother we need not follow the scene in the sentimental turning which it then take whereby it come about of course that bernard not leopold marry mile letellier the point be that augier have justify sarcey 's confidence by make the scene thoroughly and specifically dramatic in other word by charge it with emotion and work up the tension to a very high pitch and sarcey be no doubt right in hold that this be what the whole audience instinctively expect and that they would have be more or less consciously disappoint have the author baulk they expectation a instructive example of the failure to make a dramatically obligatory scene may be find in _ agatha _ by mr humphry ward and mr loui parker agatha be believe to be the child of sir richard and lady fancourt but at a give point she learn that a gentleman whom she have know all she life as cousin ralph be in reality she father she have a middle-aged suitor colonel ford whom she be very willing to marry but at the end of the second act she refuse he because she shrink from the idea on the one hand of conceal the truth from he on the other hand of reveal she mother 's trespass this be not in itself a very strong situation for we feel the barrier between the lover to be unreal colonel ford be a man of sense the secret of agatha 's parentage can make no real difference to he nothing material -- no point of law or of honor -- depend on it he will learn the truth and all will come right between they the only point on which we interest can center be the question how he be to learn the truth and here the author go very far astray there be two and only two really dramatic way in which colonel ford can be enlighten lady fancourt must realize that agatha be wreck she life to keep she mother 's secret and must either herself reveal it to colonel ford or must encourage and enjoin agatha to do so now the author choose neither of these way : the secret slip out through a chance misunderstanding in a conversation between sir richard fancourt and the colonel this be a typical instance of a error of construction and why -- because it leave to chance what should be a act of will drama mean a thing do not merely a thing that happen and the playwright who let accident effect what might naturally and probably be a result of volition or in other word of character sin against the fundamental law of he craft in the case before we lady fancourt and agatha -- the two character on whom we interest be centre -- be deprive of all share in one of the crucial moment of the action whether the actual disclosure be make by the mother or by the daughter there ought to have be a great scene between the two in which the mother should have insist that by one or other the truth must be tell it would have be a painful a delicate a difficult scene but it be the obligatory scene of the play and have we be allow clearly to foresee it at the end of the second act we interest would have be decisively carry forward the scene too might have give the play a moral relevance which in fact it lack the readjustment of agatha 's scheme of thing so as to make room for she mother 's history might have be make explicit and partly intellectual instead of implicit inarticulate and wholly emotional this case then clearly fall under we second head we can not say that it be the logic of the theme which demand the scene for no thesis or abstract idea be enunciate nor can we say that the course of event be unnatural or improbable we complaint be that without be at all less natural they might have be highly dramatic and that in fact they be not so in a very different type of play we find another example of the ignore of a dramatically obligatory scene the author of that charming fantasy _ the passing of the third floor back _ be long ago guilty of a play name _ the rise of dick halward _ chiefly memorable for have elicit from mr bernard shaw one of the most brilliant page in english dramatic criticism the hero of this play after a adventurous youth in mexico have go to the bar but get no briefs and be therefore unable to marry a lady who announce that no suitor need apply who have less than # 5000 a year one fine day dick receive from mexico the will of a old comrade which purport to leave to he absolutely half a million dollar gold but the will be accompany by a letter in which the old comrade state that the property be really leave to he only in trust for the testator 's long-lost son whom dick be enjoin to search out and endow with a capital which at 5 per cent represent accurately the desiderate # 5000 a year as a matter of fact -lrb- but this be not to we present purpose -rrb- the long-lost son be actually at that moment share dick 's chamber in the temple dick however do not know this and can not resist the temptation to destroy the old miner 's letter and grab the property we know of course that retribution be bind to descend upon he but do not dramatic effect imperatively require that for a brief space at any rate he should be see -- with whatever qualm of conscience he nature might dictate -- enjoy he ill-gotten wealth mr jerome however baulk we of this just expectation in the very first scene of the second act we find that the game be up the deceased miner write he letter to dick seat in the doorway of a hut a chance photographer take a snap-shot at he and on return to england the chance photographer have nothing more press to do than to chance upon the one man who know the long-lost son and to show he the photograph of the die miner whom he at once recognize by aid of a microscope the letter he be write can be decipher and thus dick 's fraud be bring home to he now one would suppose that a author who have invent this monstrous and staggering concatenation of chance must hope to justify it by some highly dramatic situation in the obvious and commonplace sense of the word it be not difficult indeed to foresee such a situation in which dick halward should be confront as if by magic with the very word of the letter he have so carefully destroy i be far from say that this scene would in fact have justify its amazing antecedent but it would have show a realization on the author 's part that he must at any rate attempt some effect proportionate to the strain he have place upon we credulity mr jerome show no such realization he make the man who hand dick the copy of the letter explain beforehand how it have be obtain so that dick though doubtless surprised and disgusted be not in the least thunderstruck and manifest no emotion here then mr jerome evidently miss a scene render obligatory by the law of the maximum of specifically dramatic effect \* \* \* \* \* the third or structural class of obligatory scene may be more briefly deal with see that we have already in the last chapter discuss the principle involve in this class we have place by definition scene which the author himself have render obligatory by seem unmistakably to lead up to they -- or in other word scene indicate or seem to be indicate by deliberately-planted finger-post it may appear as though the case of dick halward which we have just be examine in reality come under this head but it can not actually be say that mr jerome either do or seem to point by finger-post towards the obligatory scene he rather appear to have be blankly unconscious of its possibility we have note in the foregoing chapter the unwisdom of plant misleading finger-post here we have only to deal with the particular case in which they seem to point to a definite and crucial scene a example give by m sarcey himself will i think make the matter quite clear m jule lemaître 's play _ révoltée _ tell the story of a would-be intellectual ill-conditioned young woman marry to a plain and ungainly professor of mathematics whom she despise we know that she be in danger of yield to the fascination of a seductive man-about-town and have show we this danger the author proceed to emphasize the manly and sterling character of the husband he have the gentleness that go with strength but where he affection or he honor be concern he be not a man to be trifle with this have be several time impressed upon we we naturally expect that the wife be to be rescue by some striking manifestation of the husband 's masterful virility but no such matter rescue she be indeed but it be by the intervention of she half-brother who fight a duel on she behalf and be bring back wound to restore peace to the mathematician 's household : that man of science have be quite passive throughout save for some ineffectual remonstrance it happen that in this case we know just where the author go astray hélène -lrb- the wife -rrb- be the unacknowledged daughter of a great lady mme de vove and the subject of the play as the author first conceive it be the relation between the mother the illegitimate daughter and the legitimate son the daughter 's husband take only a subordinate place but lemaître choose as a model for the husband a man whom he have know and admire and he allow himself to depict in vivid color he strong and sympathetic character without notice that he be thereby upset the economy of he play and give he audience reason to anticipate a line of development quite different from that which he have in mind inadvertently in fact he plant not one but two or three misleading finger-post \* \* \* \* \* we come now to the fourth or psychological class of obligatory scene -- those which be require in order to justify some modification of character or alteration of will too important to be take for grant a obvious example of a obligatory scene of this class may be find in the third act of _ othello _ the poet be bind to show we the process by which iago instil he poison into othello 's mind he have back himself so to speak to make this process credible to we and by a masterpiece of dexterity and daring he win he wager have he omit this scene -- have he show we othello at one moment full of serene confidence and at he next appearance already convince of desdemona 's guilt -- he would have omit the pivot and turn -- point of the whole structure it may seem fantastic to conceive that any dramatist could blunder so grossly but there be not a few play in which we observe a scarcely less glaring hiatus a case in point may be find in lord tennyson 's _ becket _ i be not one of those who hold tennyson merely contemptible as a dramatist i believe that have he take to playwrit nearly half-a-century earlier and study the root principle of craftsmanship instead of blindly accept the elizabethan convention he might have do work as fine in the mass as be the best moment of _ queen mary _ and _ harold _ as a whole _ becket _ be one of he weakest production but the prologue and the first act would have form a excellent first and third act for a play of wholly different sequel have he interpose in a second act the obligatory scene require to elucidate becket 's character the historic and psychological problem of thoma becket be he startling transformation from a easy-going luxurious worldly statesman into a gaunt ecclesiastic fanatically fight for the rights of he see of he order and of rome in any drama which profess to deal -lrb- as this do -rrb- with he whole career the intellectual interest can not but center in a analysis of the force that bring about this seem new-birth of he soul it would have be open to the poet no doubt to take up he history at a later point when he be already the full-fledged clerical and ultramontane but this tennyson do not do he be at pain to present to we the magnificent chancellor the bosom friend of the king and mild reprover of he vice and then without the smallest transition hey presto he be the intransigent priest bitterly combate the constitution of clarendon it be true that in the prologue the poet place one or two finger-post -- small conventional foreshadowing of come trouble for instance the game of chess between king and chancellor end with a victory for becket who say -- you see my bishop have bring you king to a standstill you be beat the symbolical game of chess be a well-worn dramatic device becket moreover seem to feel some vague disquietude as to what may happen if he accept the archbishopric but there be nothing to show that he be conscious of any bias towards the intransigent clericalism of the later act the character-problem in fact be not only not solve but be ignore the obligatory scene be skip over in the interval between the prologue and the first act one of the finest play of we time -- sir arthur pinero 's _ iri _ -- lack in my judgment a obligatory scene the character of iris be admirably true so far as it go but it be incomplete the author seem to have evade the crucial point of he play -- the scene of she installation in maldonado 's flat to perfect he psychological study he be bind to bridge the chasm between the iris of the third act and the iris of the fourth he build two end of the bridge in the incident of the cheque-book at the close of the one act and in the state of hebetude in which we find she at the opening of the other but there remain a great gap at which the imagination boggle the author have try to throw a retrospective footway across it in iris 's confession to trenwith in the fifth act but i do not find that it quite meet the case it would no doubt have be very difficult to keep the action within reasonable limit have a new act take the place of the exist fourth but sir arthur pinero would probably have produce a completer work of art have he face this difficulty and contrived to compress into a single last act something like the matter of the exist fourth and fifth it may be that he deliberately prefer that iris should give in narrative the history of she decline but i do not consider this a case in support of that slight plea for impassioned narrative which i venture to put forth a few page back she confession to trenwith would have be far more dramatic and move have it be about one-fourth part as long and one-fourth part as articulate \* \* \* \* \* of the scene impose by history or legend it be unnecessary to say very much we see in chapter ix that the theater be not the place for expound the result of original research which cast a new light on historic character it be not the place for whitewashing richard iii or represent he as a man of erect and graceful figure it be not the place for prove that guy fawke be a earnest presbyterian that nell gwynn be a lady of the strictest moral or that george washington be incapable of tell the truth the playwright who deal with henry viii be bind to present he in the schoolboy 's phrase as a great widower william the silent must not be a chatterbox torquemada a humanitarian ivan the terrible a conscientious opponent of capital punishment and legend have its fixed point no less than history in the theater indeed there be little distinction between they : history be legend and legend history a dramatist may if he please -lrb- though it be a difficult task -rrb- break wholly unfamiliar ground in the past but where a historic legend exist he must respect it at he peril from all this it be a simple deduction that where legend -lrb- historic or otherwise -rrb- associate a particular character with a particular scene that be by any means presentable on the stage that scene become obligatory in a drama of which he be the lead figure the fact that shakespeare could write a play about king john and say nothing about runnymede and magna charta show that that incident in constitutional history have not yet pass into popular legend when sir herbert tree revive the play he repair the poet 's omission by means of a insert tableau even shakespeare have not the hardihood to let caesar fall without say the ides of march be come and et tu brute nero be bind to fiddle while rome burn or the audience will know the reason why -lrb- 4 -rrb- historic criticism will not hear of the thou hast conquer galilean which legend attribute to julian the apostate yet ibsen not only make he say it but may almost be say to find in the phrase the keynote of he world-historic drama tristram and iseult must drink a love-philtre or they be not tristram and iseult it would be the extreme of paradox to write a paolo-and-francesca play and omit the scene of quel giorno più non vi leggemmo avante the case be not very frequent however in which a individual incident be thus impose by history or legend the practical point to be note be rather that when a author introduce a strongly-marked historical character he must be prepare to give he at least one good opportunity of act up to the character which legend -- the best of evidence in the theater -- assign to he when such a personage be present to we it ought to be at he highest potency we do not want to see -- from marlborough 's eye the tear of dotage flow and swift expire a driveller and a show if you deal with napoleon for instance it be perfectly clear that he must dominate the stage as soon as you bring in the name the idea of napoleon bonaparte man have eye and ear for nothing else and they demand to see he in a general way act up to they general conception of he that be what messr lloyd osbourne and austin strong forget in they otherwise clever play _ the exile _ it be useless to prove historically that at a give moment he be passive supine unconscious while people around he be eagerly plot he escape and restoration that may have be so but it be not what a audience want to see it want to see napoleon napoleonize for anomaly and uncharacteristic episode in napoleon 's career we must go to book the playhouse be not the place for they it be true that a dramatist like mr bernard shaw may at he own risk and peril set forth to give we a new reading of caesar or of napoleon which may or may not be dramatically acceptable -lrb- 5 -rrb- but this be not what messr osbourne and strong try to do they napoleon be the napoleon of tradition -- only he fail to act in a concatenation accord there be a few figure in history -- and napoleon be one of they -- which so thrill the imagination that they mere name can dominate the stage better perhaps than they bodily presence in _ l'aiglon _ by m rostand napoleon be in fact the hero though he lie dead in he far-off island under the southern cross another such figure be abraham lincoln in jame herne 's sadly underrated play _ griffith davenport _ we be always conscious of mr lincoln in the background and the act in which governor morton of indiana bring the president 's instruction to davenport might fairly be call a obligatory scene inasmuch as it give we the requisite sense of personal nearness to the master-spirit without involve any risk of belittlement through imperfection of representation there be a popular melodrama pass in palestine under the roman throughout the course of which we constantly feel the influence of a strange new prophet unseen but wonder-working who if i remember rightly be personally present to we only in a final tableau wherein he appear ride into jerusalem amid the hosanna of the multitude the execution of _ ben hur _ be crude and commonplace but the conception be by no means inartistic historical figure of the highest rank may perhaps be best adumbrate in this fashion with or without one personal appearance so brief that there shall be no danger of anti-climax the last paragraph remind we that the accomplished playwright show he accomplishment quite as much in he recognition and avoidance of the _ scène à ne pas faire _ as in he divination of the obligatory scene there be always the chance that no one may miss a scene demand by logic or psychology but a audience know too well when it have be bore or distressed by a superfluous or inconsequent or wantonly painful scene some twenty year ago in criticize a play name _ le maître d'arme _ m sarcey take the author gravely to task in the name of aristotle and common sense for follow the modern and reprehensible tendency to present slice of life rather than construct and develop drama especially he reproach they with deliberately omit the _ scène à faire _ a young lady be seduce he say and for the sake of she child implore she betrayer to keep he promise of marriage he renew the promise without the slightest intention of fulfil it and go on board he yacht in order to make he escape she discover he purpose and follow he on board the yacht what be the scene ask m sarcey -- here i translate literally -- which you expect you the public it be the scene between the abandon fair one and she seducer the author may make it in a hundred way but make it he must instead of which the critic proceed we be fob off with a storm-scene a rescue and other sensational incident and hear no word of what pass between the villain and he victim here i think m sarcey be mistake in he application of he pet principle word can not express we unconcern as to what pass between the heroine and the villain on board the yacht -- nay more we gratitude for be spare that painful and threadbare scene of recrimination the plot demand observe that the villain shall not relent we know quite well that he can not for if he do the play would fall to piece why then should we expect or demand a sordid squabble which can lead to nothing we -- and by we i mean the public which relish such play -- can not possibly have any keen appetite for copious re-hash of such very cold mutton as the appeal of the penitent heroine to the recalcitrant villain and the moral seem to be that in this class of play -- the drama if one may call it so of foregone character -- the _ scène à faire _ be precisely the scene to be omit in play of a more ambitious class skill be often show by the indication in place of the formal presentment even of a important scene which the audience may or might have expect to witness in full we have already note such a case in _ the wild duck _ : ibsen know that what we really require to witness be not the actual process of greger 's disclosure to hialmar but its effect a small but quite noticeable example of a scene thus rightly leave to the imagination occur in mr somerset maugham 's first play _ a man of honor _ in the first act jack halliwell he wife and he sister-in-law call upon he friend basil ken the sister-in-law hilda murray be a rich widow and she and kent presently go out on the balcony together and be lose to view then it appear in a scene between the halliwell that they fully believe that kent be in love with mr murray and be now propose to she but when the two re-enter from the balcony it be evident from they mien that whatever may have pass between they they be not affianced lover and we presently learn that though kent be in fact strongly attract to mr murray he consider himself bind in honor to marry a certain jenny bush a fleet street barmaid with whom he have become entangled many playwright would so to speak have dot the i 's of the situation by give we the scene between kent and mr murray but mr maugham have do exactly right in leave we to divine it we know all that at this point we require to know of the relation between they to have tell we more would have be to anticipate and discount the course of event a more striking instance of a scene rightly place behind the scene occur in m de curel 's terrible drama _ les fossiles _ i need not go into the singularly unpleasing detail of the plot suffice it to say that a very peculiar condition of thing exist in the family of the duc de chantemelle it have be fully discuss in the second act between the duke and he daughter claire who have be induce to accept it for the sake of the family name but a person more immediately concern be robert de chantemelle the only son of the house -- will he also accept it quietly a nurse who be acquaint with the black secret misbehave herself and be to be pack off as she be a violent woman robert insist on dismiss she himself and leave the room to do so the rest of the family be sure that in she rage she will blurt out the whole story and they wait in breathless anxiety for robert 's return what follow need not be tell : the point be that this scene -- the scene of tense expectancy as to the result of a crisis which be take place in another room of the same house -- be really far more dramatic than the crisis itself would be the audience already know all that the angry virago can say to she master and of course no discussion of the merit of the case be possible between these two therefore m de curel be conspicuously right in spare we the scene of vulgar violence and give we the scene of far higher tension in which robert 's father wife and sister expect he return they apprehension deepen with every moment that he delay we see then that there be such a thing as a false _ scène à faire _ -- a scene which at first sight seem obligatory but be in fact much better take for grant it may be absolutely indispensable that it should be suggest to the mind of the audience but neither indispensable nor advisable that it should be present to they eye the judicious playwright will often ask himself be it the actual substance of this scene that i require or only its repercussion \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : for example in he criticism of becque 's _ la parisienne -lrb- quarante ans de théâtre _ vi p 364 -rrb- he tell how at the end of the second act one of he neighbor say to he eh bien vous voilà bien attrapé où est la _ scène à faire _ i freely admit he continue that there be no _ scène à faire _ if there have be no third act i should not have be greatly astonish when you make it you business to recite on the stage article from the _ vie parisienne _ it make no difference whether you stop at the end of the second article or at the end of the third this clearly imply that a play in which there be no _ scène à faire _ be nothing but a series of newspaper sketch becque one fancy might have reply that the scene between clotilde and monsieur simpson at the beginning of act iii be precisely the _ scène à faire _ demand by the logic of he cynicism -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : i need scarcely direct the reader 's attention to mr gilbert murray 's noble rendering of these speech -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : such a scene occur in that very able play _ the way the money go _ by lady bell -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : in mr stephen phillip 's play he do not actually play on the lyre but he improvise and recite a ode to the conflagration -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : and after all mr shaw do not run counter to the legend he exhibit caesar and napoleon in they well-known attitude : only by a odd metempsychosis the soul of mr shaw have somehow enter into they -rrb- _ chapter xiv _ the peripety in the greek theater as every one know the _ peripeteium _ or reversal of fortune -- the turning of the table as we might say -- be a clearly-defined and recognize portion of the dramatic organism it be often associate with the _ anagnorisis _ or recognition mr gilbert murray have recently show cause for believe that both these dramatic form descend from the ritual in which greek drama take its origin -- the ritual celebrate the death and resurrection of the season of mellow fruitfulness if this theory be true the _ peripeteium _ be at first a change from sorrow to joy -- joy in the rebirth of the beneficent power of nature and to this day a sudden change from gloom to exhilaration be a popular and effective incident -- as when at the end of a melodrama the handcuffs be transfer from the wrist of the virtuous naval lieutenant to those of the wicked baronet and through the disclosure of a strawberry-mark on he left arm the lieutenant be recognize as the long-lost heir to a dukedom and # 50000 a year but when as soon happen in greece the form appropriate to a celebration of the death and resurrection of dionysus come to be blent with the tomb-ritual of a hero the term _ peripeteium _ acquire a special association with a sudden decline from prosperity into adversity in the middle age this be think to be the very essence and meaning of tragedy as we may see from chaucer 's line : tragedie be to seyn a certeyn storie as oldë bokës maken we memorie of he that stand in gret prosperitee and be y-fallen out of heigh degree into miserie and endeth wrecchedly aristotle cite a good instance of a peripety -- to anglicize the word -- where in the _ lynceus _ the hero be lead away to execution follow by danaus as executioner but as the effect of the antecedent danaus be execute and lynceus escape but here as in so many other context we must turn for the classic example to the _ oedipus rex _ jocasta hearing from the corinthian stranger that polybus king of corinth the reputed father of oedipus be dead send for she husband to tell he that the oracle which doom he to parricide be defeat since polybus have die a natural death oedipus exult in the news and triumph over the oracle but as the scene proceed the further revelation make by the same stranger lead jocasta to recognize in oedipus she own child who be expose on mount kithairon and in the subsequent scene the evidence of the old shepherd bring oedipus himself to the same crush realization no completer case of _ anagnorisis _ and _ peripeteium _ could well be conceive -- whatever we may have to say of the means by which it be lead up to -lrb- 1 -rrb- have the conception of the peripety as a almost obligatory element in drama any significance for the modern playwright obligatory of course it can not be : it be easy to cite a hundred admirable play in which it be impossible to discover anything that can reasonably be call a peripety but this i think we may safely say : the dramatist be fortunate who find in the development of he theme without unnatural strain or too much preparation opportunity for a great scene highly-wrought arrest absorb wherein one or more of he character shall experience a marked reversal either of inward soul-state or of outward fortune the theory of the peripety in short practically resolve itself for we into the theory of the great scene play there be many and excellent play in which some one scene stand out from all the rest impress itself with peculiar vividness on the spectator 's mind and nine time out of ten this scene will be find to involve a peripety it can do no harm then if the playwright should ask himself : can i without any undue sacrifice so develop my theme as to entail upon my lead character naturally and probably a experience of this order the peripety of real life be frequent though they be apt to be too small in scale or else too fatally conclusive to provide material for drama one of the commonest perhaps be that of the man who enter a physician 's consulting-room to seek advice in some trifling ailment and come out again half a hour later doom either to death or to some calamity worse than death this situation have be employ not ineffectively by sir arthur conan doyle in the first act of a romantic drama _ the fire of fate _ but it be very difficult to find any dramatic sequel to a peripety involve mere physical disaster -lrb- 2 -rrb- the moral peripety -- the sudden dissipation of some illusion or defeat of some imposture or crumble of some castle in the air -- be a no less characteristic incident of real life and much more amenable to the playwright 's use certainly there be few thing more impressive in drama than to see a man or woman -- or a man and woman -- come upon the stage radiant confident assure that god 's in he heaven all 's right with the world and leave it crushed and desperate after a gradual and yet swift descent into avernus such a scene be of the very marrow of drama it be a play within a play a concentrated quintessentiated crisis in the third act of _ othello _ we have a peripety handle with consummate theatrical skill to I -- i confess it with bated breath -- the craftsmanship seem greatly superior to the psychology othello when we look into it succumb with incredible facility to iago 's poison pin-prick but no audience dream of look into it and there lie the proof of shakespeare 's technical mastery in the trial scene in _ the merchant of venice _ we have another great peripety it illustrate the obvious principle that where the drama consist in a conflict between two person or party the peripety be generally a double one -- the sudden collapse of shylock 's case imply a equally sudden restoration of antonio 's fortune perhaps the most striking peripety in ibsen be stockmann 's fall from jubilant self-confidence to defiant impotence in the third act of _ a enemy of the people _ think that he have the compact majority at he back he assume the burgomaster 's insignia of office and lord it over he incensed brother only to learn by blow on blow of disillusionment that the compact majority have rat that he be to be deprive of he position and income and that the commonest freedom of speech be to be deny he in _ a doll 's house _ there be two peripety : nora 's fall from elation to despair in the first scene with krogstad and the collapse of helmer 's illusion in the last scene of all a good instance of the great scene which involve a marked peripety occur in sardou 's _ dora _ once famous in england under the title of _ diplomacy _ the scene of the three man show how tékli a hungarian exile call upon he old friend andré de maurillac on the day of andré 's marriage and congratulate he on have elude the wiles of a dangerous adventuress dora de rio-zarès by whom he have once seem to be attract but it be precisely dora whom andré have marry and learn this tékli try to withdraw or minimize he imputation for a moment a duel seem imminent but andré 's friend favrolle adjure he to keep he head and the three man proceed to thrash the matter out as calmly as possible with the result that in the course of half-an-hour or so it seem to be prove beyond all doubt that the woman andré adore and whom he have just marry be a treacherous spy who sell to tyrannical foreign government the life of political exile and the honor of the man who fall into she toil the crush suspicion be ultimately disprove by one of the trick in which sardou delighted but that do not here concern we artificial as be its cause and its consequence the scene of the three man while it last hold we breathless and absorb and andré 's fall from the pinnacle of happiness to the depth of misery be a typical peripety equally typical and infinitely more tragic be another postnuptial peripety -- the scene of the mutual confession of angel clare and tess in mr hardy 's great novel as it stand on the print page this scene be a superb piece of drama its greatness have be obscure in the english theater by the general unskilfulness of the dramatic version present one magnificent scene do not make a play in america on the other hand the fine acting of mr fiske secure popularity for a version which be perhaps rather better than that which we see in england i have say that dramatic peripety be not infrequent in real life and they scene as be natural be often lay in the law court it be unnecessary to recall the awful reversal of fortune that overtake one of the most brilliant of modern dramatist about the same period another drama of the english court end in a startling and terrible peripety a young lady be stay as a guest with a half-pay officer and he wife a valuable pearl belong to the hostess disappear and the hostess accuse she guest of have steal it the young lady who have meanwhile marry bring a action for slander against she quondam friend for several day the case continue and everything seem to be go in the plaintiff 's favor major blank the defendant 's husband be ruthlessly cross-examine by sir charle russell afterwards lord chief justice of england with a view to show that he be the real thief he make a very bad witness and thing look black against he the end be near and every one anticipate a verdict in the plaintiff 's favor when there come a sudden change of scene the steal pearl have be sell to a firm of jeweller who have record the number of the bank of england note with which they pay for it one of these note be produce in court and lo it be endorse with the name of the plaintiff -lrb- 3 -rrb- in a moment in the twinkling of a eye the whole edifice of mendacity and perjury fall to piece the thief be arrest and imprison but the peripety for she be less terrible than for she husband who have marry she in chivalrous faith in she innocence would it have be -- or may it some day prove to be -- possible to transfer this well-made drama of real life bodily to the stage i be incline to think not it look to I very much like one of those blind alley theme of which mention have be make there be matter indeed for most painful drama in the relation of the husband and wife both before and after the trial but from the psychological point of view one can see nothing in the case but a distressing and inexplicable anomaly -lrb- 4 -rrb- at the same time the bare fact of the sudden and tremendous peripety be irresistibly dramatic and mr henry arthur jone have admit that it suggest to he the great scene of the unmasking of felicium hindemarsh in _ mr dane 's defense _ it be instructive to note the delicate adjustment which mr jone find necessary in order to adapt the theme to dramatic use in the first place not wish to plunge into the depths of tragedy he leave the heroine unmarried though on the point of marriage in the second place he make the blot on she past not a theft follow by a attempt to shift the guilt on to other shoulder but a error of conduct due to youth and inexperience serious in itself but render disastrous by tragic consequence over which she felicia have no control thus mr jone raise a real and fairly sufficient obstacle between he lover without render he heroine entirely unsympathetic or present she in the guise of a bewildering moral anomaly thirdly he transfer the scene of the peripety from a court of justice with its difficult adjunct and tedious procedure to the private study of a great lawyer at the opening of the scene between mr dane and sir daniel carteret she be no doubt still anxious and ill-at-ease but reasonably confident of have avert all danger of exposure sir daniel too -lrb- like sir charle russell in the pearl suit -rrb- be practically convince of she innocence he merely want to get the case absolutely clear for the final confounding of she accuser at first all go smoothly mr dane 's answer to he question be pat and plausible then she make a single almost imperceptible slip of the tongue : she say we have governess instead of i have governess sir daniel prick up he ear : we you say you be a only child who be we my cousin and i she answer sir daniel think it odd that he have not hear of this cousin before but he continue he interrogatory without serious suspicion then it occur to he to look up in a topographical dictionary the little town of tawhampton where mr dane spend she youth he read the bald account of it end thus the living be a vicarage net yearly value # 376 and have be hold since 1875 by -- and he turn round upon she -- by the rev franci hindemarsh hindemarsh mr dane : he be my uncle sir daniel : you uncle mr dane : sir daniel i have do wrong to hide from you that felicium hindemarsh be my cousin sir daniel : felicium hindemarsh be you cousin mr dane : can not you understand why i have hide it the whole affair be so terrible and so she stumble on from one inevitable admission to another until the damning truth be clear that she herself be felicia hindemarsh the central though not the most guilty figure in a horrible scandal this scene be worthy of study as a excellent type of what may be call the judicial peripety the crush cross-examination in which it be possible to combine the tension of the detective story with no small psychological subtlety in mr jone 's scene the psychology be obvious enough but it be a admirable example of nice adjustment without any obtrusive ingenuity the whole drama in short up to the last act be in the exact sense of the word a well-made play -- complex yet clear ingenious yet natural in the comparative weakness of the last act we have a common characteristic of latter-day drama which will have to be discuss in due course in this case we have a peripety of external fortune for a clearly-marked moral peripety we may turn to the great scene between vivie and she mother in the second act of _ mr warren 's profession _ whatever may be think of the matter of this scene its movement be excellent after a short sharp opening which reveal to mr warren the unfilial disposition of she daughter and reduce she to whimper dismay the follow little passage occur : mr warren : you be very rough with I vivie vivie : nonsense what about bed it be past ten mr warren -lrb- passionately -rrb- : what be the use of my go to bed do you think i could sleep vivie : why not i shall then the mother turn upon the daughter 's stony self-righteousness and pour forth she sordid history in such a way as to throw a searchlight on the condition which make such history possible until exhaust by she outburst she say oh dear i do believe i be get sleepy after all and vivie reply i believe it be i who will not be able to sleep now mr shaw we see be at pain to emphasize he peripety some great scene consist not of one decisive turning of the table but of a whole series of minor vicissitude of fortune such a scene be the third act of _ the gay lord quex _ a prolonged and thrilling duel in which sophy fullgarney pass by degree from impertinent exultation to abject surrender and then spring up again to a mood of reckless defiance in the great scene of _ the thunderbolt _ on the other hand -- the scene of thaddeus 's false confession of have destroy he brother 's will -- though there be in fact a great peripety it be not that which attract and absorb we interest all the greedy mortimore family fall from the height of jubilant confidence in they new-found wealth to the depth of disappointment and exasperation but this be not the aspect of the scene which grip and move we we attention be centre on thaddeus 's struggle to take he wife 's misdeed upon himself and he failure can not be describe as a peripety see that it sink he only one degree lower in the slough of despair like the scene in mr dane 's defense this be practically a piece of judicial drama -- a hard-fought cross-examination but as there be no reversal of fortune for the character in whom we be chiefly interested it scarcely rank as a scene of peripety -lrb- 5 -rrb- before leave this subject we may note that a favorite effect of romantic drama be a upward reversal of fortune through the recognition -- the _ anagnorisis _ -- of some great personage in disguise victor hugo excel in the superb gesture appropriate to such a scene : witness the passage in _ hernanus _ before the tomb of charlemagne where the obscure bandit claim the right to take he place at the head of the prince and noble whom the newly-elected emperor have order off to execution : hernanus : dieu qui donne le sceptre et qui te le donna m ' a fait duc de segorbe et duc de cardona marquis de monroy comte albatéra vicomte de gor seigneur de lieux dont j' ignore le compte je sui jean d'aragon grand maître d'avis né dans l'exil fil proscrit d'un père assassiné par sentence du tien rous carlos de castille \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- _ aux autres conjurés _ -rrb- couvron nous grand d'espagnol -lrb- _ tous les espagnols se couvrent _ -rrb- oui nos têtes ô roi ont le droit de tomber couvertes devant toi a effective scene of this type occur in _ monsieur beaucaire _ where the suppose hairdresser be on the point of be eject with contumely from the pump-room at bath when the french ambassador enter drop on he knee kiss the young man 's hand and present he to the astounded company as the duc d'orléans comte de valois and i know not what besides -- a personage who immeasurably outshine the noblest of he insulter quieter but not less tell be the peripety in _ the little father of the wilderness _ by messr lloyd osbourne and austin strong the père marlotte who by he heroism and self-devotion have add vast territory to the french possession in america be summon to the court of loui xv and naturally conclude that the king have hear of he service and wish to reward they he find on the contrary that he be wanted merely to decide a foolish bet and he be treat with the grossest insolence and contempt just as he be depart in humiliation the governor-general of canada arrive with a suite of officer and indian the moment they be aware of père marlotte 's presence they all kneel to he and pay he deeper homage than they have pay to the king who accept the rebuke and join in they demonstration a famous peripety of the romantic order occur in _ hm pinafore _ where on the discovery that captain corcoran and ralph rackstraw have be change at birth ralph instantly become captain of the ship while the captain decline into a able-bodied seaman this be one of the instance in which the idealism of art eke out the imperfection of reality \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : that great spiritual drama know as the book of job open after the prologue in heaven with one of the most startling of peripety -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the first act of mr gilbert murray 's _ carlyon sahib _ contain a incident of this nature but it can scarcely be call a peripety since the victim remain unconscious of he doom -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : for the benefit of american reader it may be well to state that the person who change a bank of england note be

the builder of bridge by mr alfr sutro -rrb- _ chapter xv _ probability chance and coincidence aristotle indulge in a often-quoted paradox to the effect that in drama the probable impossible be to be prefer to the improbable possible with all respect this seem to be a somewhat cumbrous way of state the fact that plausibility be of more importance on the stage than what may be call demonstrable probability there be no time in the rush of a dramatic action for a mathematical calculation of the chance for and against a give event or for experimental proof that such and such a thing can or can not be do if a thing seem plausible a audience will accept it without cavil if it seem incredible on the face of it no evidence of its credibility will be of much avail this be merely a corollary from the fundamental principle that the stage be the realm of appearance not of reality where paste jewel be at least as effective as real one and a paint forest be far more sylvan than a few wilted and drooping sapling insecurely plant upon the board that be why a improbable or otherwise inacceptable incident can not be validly defend on the plea that it actually happen : that it be on record in history or in the newspaper in the first place the dramatist can never put it on the stage as it happen the bare fact may be historical but it be not the bare fact that matter the dramatist can not restore it to its place in that intricate plexus of cause and effect which be the essence and meaning of reality he can only give he interpretation of the fact and one know not how to calculate the chance that he interpretation may be a false one but even if this difficulty could be overcome if the dramatist could prove that he have reproduce the event with photographic and cinematographic accuracy he position would not thereby be improve he would still have fail in he peculiar task which be precisely that of interpretation not truth but verisimilitude be he aim for the stage be the realm of appearance in which intrusive reality become unreal there be as i have say incalculable chance to one that the playwright 's version of a give event will not coincide with that of the recording angel : but it may be true and convincing in relation to human nature in general in which case it will belong to the sphere of great art or on a lower level it may be agreeable and entertaining without be conspicuously false to human nature in which case it will do no harm since it make no pretence to historic truth it may be object that the sixteenth-century public and even in the next century the great duke of marlborough get they knowledge of english history from shakespeare and the other writer of chronicle-play well i leave it to historian to determine whether this very defective and in great measure false vision of the past be better or worse than none the danger at any rate if danger there be be now past and do with even we general no longer go to the theater or to the first folio for they history the dramatist may with a easy conscience interpret historic fact in the light of he general insight into human nature so long as he do not so falsify the record event that common knowledge cry out against he -lrb- 1 -rrb- plausibility then not abstract or concrete probability and still less literal faithfulness to record fact be what the dramatist be bind to aim at to understand this as a belittle of he art be to misunderstand the nature of art in general the plausibility of bad art be doubtless contemptible and may be harmful but to say that good art must be plausible be only to say that not every sort of truth or every aspect of truth be equally suitable for artistic representation -- or in more general term that the artist without prejudice to he allegiance to nature must respect the condition of the medium in which he work we standard of plausibility however be far from be invariable to each separate form of art a different standard be applicable in what may roughly be call realistic art the term plausible and probable be very nearly interchangeable where the dramatist appeal to the sanction of we own experience and knowledge he must not introduce matter against which we experience and knowledge cry out a very small inaccuracy in a picture which be otherwise photographic will often have a very disturbing effect in play of society in particular the criticism no one do such thing be hold by a large class of playgoer to be conclusive and destructive one have know people despise a play because lady so-and-so 's manner of speak to she servant be not what they -lrb- the caviller -rrb- be accustom to on the other hand one have hear a whole production highly applaud because the button on a particular uniform be absolutely right this merely mean that when a effort after literal accuracy be apparent the attention of the audience seize on the most trifling detail and be apt to magnify they importance nicety of language in especial be keenly and often unjustly criticize if a particular expression do not happen to be current in the critic 's own circle he conclude that nobody use it and that the author be a pedant or a vulgarian in view of this inevitable tendency the prudent dramatist will try to keep out of he dialogue expression that be peculiar to he own circle and to use only what may be call everybody 's english or the language undoubtedly current throughout the whole class to which he personage belong it may be here point out that there be three different plane on which plausibility may or may not be achieve there be first the purely external plane which concern the producer almost as much as the playwright on this plane we look for plausibility of costume of manners of dialect of general environment then we have plausibility of what may be call uncharacteristic event -- of such event as be independent of the will of the character and be not condition by they psychology on this plane we have to deal with chance and accident coincidence and all circumstance over which we have no control for instance the playwright who make the marseillaise become popular throughout pari within half-an-hour of its have leave the composer 's desk be guilty of a breach of plausibility on this plane so too if i be to make my hero enter parliament for the first time and rise in a single session to be prime minister of england -- there would be no absolute impossibility in the feat but it would be a rather gross improbability of the second order on the third plane we come to psychological plausibility the plausibility of event dependent mainly or entirely on character for example -- to cite a much disputed instance -- be it plausible that nora in _ a doll 's house _ should suddenly develop the mastery of dialectic with which she crush helmer in the final scene and should desert she husband and child slam the door behind she it need scarcely be say that plausibility on the third plane be vastly the most important a very austere criticism might even call it the one thing worth consideration but as a matter of fact when we speak of plausibility it be almost always the second plane -- the plane of uncharacteristic circumstance -- that we have in mind to plausibility of the third order we give a more impose name -- we call it truth we say that nora 's action be true -- or untrue -- to nature we speak of the truth with which the madness of lear the malignity of iago the race hatred of shylock be portray truth in fact be the term which we use in case where the test to be apply be those of introspection intuition or knowledge sub-consciously garner from spiritual experience where the test be external and matter of common knowledge or tangible evidence we speak of plausibility it would be a mistake however to imagine that because plausibility of the third degree or truth be the noblest attribute of drama it be therefore the one thing needful in some form of drama it be greatly impaired or absolutely nullify if plausibility of the second degree its necessary preliminary be not carefully secure in the case above imagine for instance of the young politician who should become prime minister immediately on enter parliament : it would matter nothing with what profundity of knowledge or subtlety of skill the character be draw : we should none the less decline to believe in he some dramatist as a matter of fact find it much easier to attain truth of character than plausibility of incident every one who be in the habit of read manuscript play must have come across the would-be playwright who have a good deal of general ability and a considerable power of characterization but seem to be congenitally deficient in the sense of external reality so that the one thing he -lrb- or she -rrb- can by no means do be to invent or conduct a action that shall be in the least like any sequence of event in real life it be naturally difficult to give example for the play compose under this curious limitation be apt to remain in manuscript or to be produce for one performance and forget there be however one recent play of this order which hold a certain place in dramatic literature i do not know that mr granville barker be well-advised in print _ the marry of anne leete _ along with such immeasurably maturer and saner production as _ the voysey inheritance _ and _ waste _ but by do so he have serve my present purpose in provide I with a perfect example of a play as to which we can not tell whether it possess plausibility of the third degree so absolutely do it lack that plausibility of the second degree which be its indispensable condition precedent francisque sarcey be fond of insist that a audience would generally accept without cavil any postulate in reason which a author choose to impose upon it with regard to event suppose to have occur before the rise of the curtain always provide that the consequence deduce from they within the limit of the play be logical plausible and entertaining the public will swallow a camel he would maintain in the past though they will strain at a gnat in the present a classical example of this principle be -lrb- once more -rrb- the _ oedipus rex _ in which several of the initial postulate be wildly improbable : for instance that oedipus should never have inquire into the circumstance of the death of laius and that have be warn by a oracle that he be doom to marry he mother he should not have be careful before marry any woman to ascertain that she be younger than himself there be at least so much justification for sarcey 's favorite principle that we be less apt to scrutinize thing merely narrate to we than event which take place before we eye it be simply a special instance of the well-worn segnius irritant animo demissa per aurem quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus but the principle be of very limited artistic validity no one would nowadays think of justify a gross improbability in the antecedent of a play by ibsen or sir arthur pinero by mr galsworthy or mr granville barker on the plea that it occur outside the frame of the picture such a plea might indeed secure a mitigation of sentence but never a verdict of acquittal sarcey on the other hand bring up in the school of the well-made play would rather have hold it a feather in the playwright 's cap that he should have know just where and just how he might safely outrage probability -lrb- 2 -rrb- the inference be that we now take the dramatist 's art more seriously than do the generation of the second empire in france this bring we however to a important fact which must by no means be overlook there be a large class of play -- or rather there be several class of play some of they not at all to be despise -- the charm of which reside not in probability but in ingenious and delightful improbability i be of course not think of sheer fantasy like _ a midsummer night 's dream _ or _ peter pan _ or _ the blue bird _ they may indeed possess plausibility of the third order but plausibility of the second order have no application to they its writ do not run on they extramundane plane the play which appeal to we in virtue of they pleasant departure from probability be romance farce a certain order of light comedy and semi-comic melodrama -- in short the thousand and one play in which the author without altogether despise and abjure truth make it on principle subsidiary to delightfulness play of the _ prisoner of zenda _ type would come under this head : so would sir arthur pinero 's farce _ the magistrate _ _ the schoolmistress _ _ dandy dick _ so would mr carton 's light comedy _ lord and lady algy _ _ wheel within wheel _ _ lady huntworth 's experiment _ so would most of mr barrie 's comedy so would mr arnold bennett 's play _ the honeymoon _ in a previous chapter i have sketch the opening act of mr carton 's _ wheel within wheel _ which be a typical example of this style of work its charm lie in a subtle all-pervading improbability a infusion of fantasy so delicate that while at no point can one say this be impossible the total effect be far more entertaining than that of any probable sequence of event in real life the whole atmosphere of such a play should be impregnate with humor without reach that gross supersaturation which we find in the lower order of farce-play of the type of _ charlie 's aunt _ or _ niobe _ \* \* \* \* \* plausibility of development as distinct from plausibility of theme or of character depend very largely on the judicious handling of chance and the exclusion or very spare employment of coincidence this be a matter of importance into which we shall find it worth while to look somewhat closely it be not always clearly recognize that chance and coincidence be by no mean the same thing coincidence be a special and complex form of chance which ought by no means to be confound with the everyday variety we need not here analyze chance or discuss the philosophic value of the term it be enough that we all know what we mean by it in common parlance it may be well however to look into the etymology of the two word we be consider they both come ultimately from the latin cadere to fall chance be a falling-out like that of a die from the dice-box and coincidence signify one falling-out on the top of another the concurrent happen of two or more chance which resemble or somehow fit into each other if you rattle six dice in a box and throw they and they turn up at haphazard -- say two ace a deuce two fours and a six -- there be nothing remarkable in this fall out but if they all turn up six you at once suspect that the dice be cogg and if that be not so -- if there be no sufficient cause behind the phenomenon -- you say that this identical falling-out of six separate possibility be a remarkable coincidence now apply the illustration to drama i should say that the playwright be perfectly justified in let chance play its probable and even inevitable part in the affair of he character but that the moment we suspect he of cogg the dice we feel that he be take a unfair advantage of we and we imagination either cry i will not play or continue the game under protest some critic have consider it a flaw in shakespeare 's art that the catastrophe of _ romeo and juliet _ should depend upon a series of chance and especially on the miscarriage of the friar 's letter to romeo this be not i think a valid criticism we may if we be so mind pick to piece the course of action which bring these chance into play the device of the potion -- even if such a drug be know to the pharmacopoeia -- be certainly a very clumsy method of escape from the position in which juliet be place by she father 's obstinacy but when once we have accept that integral part of the legend the intervention of chance in the catastrophe be entirely natural and probable observe that there be no coincidence in the matter no interlinking or dovetailing of chance the catastrophe result from the hot-headed impetuosity of all the character which so hurry event that there be no time for the elimination of the result of chance letter do constantly go astray even under we highly-organized system of conveyance but they delay or disappearance seldom lead to tragic result because most of we have learn to take thing calmly and wait for the next post yet if we could survey the world at large it be highly probable that every day or every hour we should somewhere or other find some romeo on the verge of commit suicide because of a chance misunderstand with regard to he juliet and in a certain percentage of case the explanatory letter or telegram would doubtless arrive too late we all remember how in mr hardy 's _ tess _ the main trouble arise from the fact that the letter push under angel clare 's door slip also under the carpet of he room and so be never discover this be a entirely probable chance and the sternest criticism would hardly call it a flaw in the structure of the fable but take another case : madame x have have a child of whom she have lose sight for more than twenty year during which she have live abroad she return to france and immediately on landing at bordeaux she kill a man who accompany she the court assign she defense to a young advocate and this young advocate happen to be she son we have here a pile of chance upon chance in which the long arm of coincidence -lrb- 3 -rrb- be very apparent the coincidence would have be less startling have she return to the place where she leave she son and where she believe he to be but no she leave he in pari and it be only by a series of pure chance that he happen to be in bordeaux where she happen to land and happen to shoot a man for the sake of a certain order of emotional effect a certain order of audience be willing to accept this pile up of chance but it relegate the play to a low and childish plane of art the _ oedipus rex _ indeed -- which meet we at every turn -- be found on a absolutely astounding series of coincidence but here the conception of fate come in and we vaguely figure to ourselves some malignant power deliberately pull the string which guide its puppet into such abhorrent tangle on the modern view that character be destiny the conception of supernatural wire-pulling be exclude it be true that amazing coincidence do occur in life but when they be invent to serve a artist 's purpose we feel that he be simplify he task altogether beyond reason and substitute for normal and probable development a irrelevant plunge into the merely marvellous of the abuse of coincidence i have already give a specimen in speaking of _ the rise of dick halward _ -lrb- chapter xii -rrb- one or two more example may not be out of place i need not dwell on the significance of the fact that most of they occur in forget play in _ the man of forty _ by mr walter frith we find the follow conjuncture of circumstance : mr lewi dunster have a long-lost wife and a long-lost brother he have be for year in south africa they have meanwhile live in london but they do not know each other and have hold no communication lewi return from africa arrive in london he do not know where to find either wife or brother and have not the slightest wish to look for they yet in the first house he go to the home of a lady whose acquaintance he chance to make on the voyage he encounter both he wife and he brother not quite so startling be the coincidence on which _ mr willoughby 's kiss _ by mr frank stayton be found a upper and lower flat in west kensington be inhabit respectively by mr brandram and mr willoughby whose husband have both be many year absent in indium by pure chance the two husband come home in the same ship the two wife go to plymouth to meet they and by pure chance for they be totally unacquainted with each other they go to the same hotel whence it happen that mr willoughby meeting mr brandram in a half-lighted room take he for she husband fly to he arm and kiss he more elaborate than either of these be the tangle of coincidence in mr stuart ogilvie 's play _ the white knight _ -- giulietta the ward of david pennycuick go to study singing at milan mr harry rook pennycuick 's most intimate friend meet she by chance in milan and she become he mistress neither have the least idea that the other know pennycuick then viscount hintlesham like pennycuick a dupe of rook 's meet she by chance at monte carlo and fall in love with she he do not know that she know rook or pennycuick and she do not know that he know they arrive in england she find in the manager the promoter and the chairman of the electric white lead company she guardian she seducer and she lover when she come to see she guardian the first person she meet be she seducer and she learn that she lover have just leave the house up to that moment i repeat she do not know that any one of these man know any other yet she do not even say how small the world be -lrb- 4 -rrb- surely some such observation be obligatory under the circumstance let we turn now to a more memorable piece of work that interesting play of sir arthur pinero 's transition period _ the profligate _ here the great situation of the third act be bring about by a chain of coincidence which would be utterly unthinkable in the author 's maturer work leslie brudenell the heroine be the ward of mr cheal a solicitor she be to be marry to dunstan renshaw and as she have no home the bridal party meet at mr cheal 's office before proceed to the registrar 's no sooner have they depart than janet preece who have be betray and desert by dunstan renshaw -lrb- under a assumed name -rrb- come to the office to state she piteous case this be not in itself a pure coincidence for janet happen to come to london in the same train with leslie brudenell and she brother wilfrid and wilfrid see in she a damsel in distress recommend she to lay she trouble before a respectable solicitor give she mr cheal 's address so far then the coincidence be not startling it be natural enough that renshaw 's mistress and he betrothed should live in the same country town and it be not improbable that they should come to london by the same train and that wilfrid brudenell should give the bewildered and weep young woman a commonplace piece of advice the concatenation of circumstance be remarkable rather than improbable but when in the next act not a month later janet preece by pure chance drop in at the florentine villa where renshaw and leslie be spend they honeymoon we feel that the long arm of coincidence be stretch to its uttermost and that even the thrilling situation which follow be very dearly buy it would not have be difficult to attenuate the coincidence what have actually happen be this : janet have -lrb- we know not how -rrb- become a sort of maid-companion to a mr stonehay whose daughter be a school-friend of leslie 's the stonehay have come to florence know nothing of leslie 's presence there and they happen to visit the villa in order to see a fresco which it contain if now we have be tell that janet 's engagement by the stonehay have result from she visit to mr cheal and that the stonehay have come to florence know leslie to be there and eager to find she several link would have be strike off the chain of coincidence or to put it more exactly a fairly coherent sequence of event would have be substitute for a series of incoherent chance the same result might no doubt have be achieve in many other and neater way i merely indicate by way of illustration a quite obvious method of reduce the element of coincidence in the case the coincidence in _ the second mr tanqueray _ by which ellean meet and fall in love with one of paulum 's ex-lover have be very severely criticize it be certainly not one of the strong point of the play but unlike the series of chance we have just be examine it place no excessive strain on we credulity such coincidence do occur in real life we have all of we see or hear of they the worst we can say of this one be that it be neither positively good nor positively bad -- a piece of indifferent craftsmanship on the other hand if we turn to _ letty _ the chance which in the third act lead letchmere 's party and mandeville 's party to choose the same restaurant seem to I entirely justify it be not really a coincidence at all but one of those everyday happening which be not only admissible in drama but positively desirable as part of the ordinary surface-texture of life entirely to eliminate chance from we representation of life would be a very unreasonable austerity strictly speak indeed it be impossible for even when we have work out a unbroken chain of rational and commensurate cause and effect it remain a chance and a unlikely chance that chance should not have interfere with it all the play touch upon in the last four paragraph be in intention realistic they aim that be to say at a literal and sober representation of life in the other class of play which seek they effect not in plod probability but in delightful improbability the long arm of coincidence have its legitimate function yet even here it be not quite unfettered one of the most agreeable coincidence in fiction i take it be the simultaneous arrival in bagdad from different quarter of the globe of three one-eyed calender all blind of the right eye and all in reality the son of king but it be to be note that this coincidence be not a crucial occurrence in a story but only a part of the story-teller 's framework or mechanism -- a device for introduce fresh series of adventure this illustrate the sarceyan principle above refer to which professor brander matthew have re-state in what seem to I a entirely acceptable form -- namely that improbability which may be admit on the outskirts of a action must be rigidly exclude when the issue be join and we be in the thick of thing coincidence in fact become the more improbable in the direct ratio of they importance we have all in we own experience meet with amazing coincidence but how few of we have ever gain or lose be make happy or unhappy by a coincidence as distinct from a chance it be not precisely probable that three brother who have separate in early life and have not hear of one another for twenty year should find themselves seat side by side at a italian _ table-d'hôte _ yet such coincidence have occur and be creditable enough so long as nothing particular come of they but if a dramatist be to make these three brother meet in messina on the eve of the earthquake in order that they might all be kill and thus enable he hero -lrb- they cousin -rrb- to succeed to a peerage and marry the heroine we should say that he use of coincidence be not strictly artistic a coincidence in short which coincide with a crisis be thereby raise to the _ n_th power and be wholly inacceptable in serious art mr bernard shaw have base the action of _ you never can tell _ on the amazing coincidence that mr clandon and she child come to england after eighteen year ' absence should by pure chance run straight into the arm or rather into the tooth of the husband and father whom the mother at any rate only wish to avoid this be no bad starting-point for a extravaganza but even mr shaw though a despiser of nicety of craftsmanship introduce no coincidence into serious play such as _ candida _ or _ the doctor 's dilemma _ \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : the malignant caricature of cromwell in wg will ' _ charle _ i do not indeed prevent the acceptance of the play by the mid-victorian public but it will certainly shorten the life of the one play which might have secure for its author a lasting place in dramatic literature it be unimaginable that future generation should accept a representation of cromwell as a mouth patriot with a itching palm in one hand menace in the other greed -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : it be only fair to say that sarcey draw a distinction between antecedent _ event _ and what he call postulate of character he do not maintain that a audience ought to accept a psychological impossibility merely because it be place outside the frame of the picture see _ quarante ans de théâtre _ vii p 395 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : this phrase which occur in mr haddon chamber 's romantic melodrama _ captain swift _ be greet with a burst of laughter by the first-night audience but little do we then think that mr chamber be enrich the english language it be not on examination a particularly luminous phrase : the three or four arm of coincidence would really be more to the point but it be not always the most accurate expression that be fittest to survive -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : the abuse of coincidence be a legacy to modern drama from the latin comedy which again be found on the greek new comedy it be worth note that in the day of menander the world really be much smaller than it be to-day when thalassic have grow into oceanic civilization traveller in those day follow a few main route half a dozen great seaport be rendezvous for all the world the slave-trade be active and kidnapping and abduction with the corresponding meeting and recognition be no doubt frequent thus such a plot as that of the _ menaechmus _ be by no mean the sheer impossibility which shakespeare make it by attach indistinguishable dromio to he indistinguishable antipholus to reduplicate a coincidence be in fact to multiply it by a figure far beyond my mathematics it may be note too that the practice of expose child on which the _ oedipus _ and many play of menander be found be common in historic greece and that the hapless child be generally provide with identification-tokens _ gnorisma _ -rrb- _ chapter xvi _ logic the term logic be often very vaguely use in relation to drama french writer especially who regard logic as one of the peculiar faculty of they national genius be apt to insist upon it in and out of season but as we have already see logic be a gift which may easily be misapply it too often lead such writer as m brieux and m hervieu to sacrifice the undulant and diverse rhythm of life to a stiff and symmetrical formalism the conception of a play as the exhaustive demonstration of a thesis have never take a strong hold on the anglo-saxon mind and though some of m brieux 's play be much more than mere dramatic argument we need not in the main envy the french they logician-dramatist but though the presence of logic should never be force upon the spectator 's attention still less should he be disturb and baffle by its conspicuous absence if the playwright announce a theme at all : if he let it be see that some general idea underlie he work : he be bind to present and develop that idea in a logical fashion not to shift he ground whether inadvertently or insidiously and not to wander off into irrelevant side-issue he must face he problem squarely if he set forth to prove anything at all he must prove that thing and not some totally different thing he must beware of the red-herring across the trail for a clear example of defective logic i turn to a french play -- sardou 's _ spiritisme _ both from internal and from external evidence it be certain that m sardou be a believer in spiritualism -- in the existence of disembodied intelligence and they power of communicate with the living yet he have not the courage to assign to they a essential part in he drama the spirit hover round the outskirts of the action but do not really or effectually intervene in it the hero 's _ belief _ in they indeed help to bring about the conclusion but the apparition which so potently work upon he be a admit imposture a pious fraud earlier in the play two or three trivial and unnecessary miracle be introduce -- just enough to hint at the author 's faith without decisively affirm it for instance : towards the close of act i madame d'aubenas have go off nominally to take the night train for poitier in reality to pay a visit to she lover m de stoudza when she have go she husband and he guest arrange a séance and evoke a spirit no sooner have preliminary be settle than the spirit spell out the word o-u-v-r-e-z they open the window and behold the sky be red with a glare which prove to proceed from the burning of the train in which madame d'aubenas be suppose to have start the incident be effective enough and a little creepy but its effect be quite incommensurate with the strain upon we power of belief the thing be suppose to be a miracle of that there can be no doubt but it have not the smallest influence on the course of the play except to bring on the hurry-scurry and alarm a few minute earlier than might otherwise have be the case now if the spirit instead of merely announce the accident have inform m d'aubena that he wife be not in it -- if for example it have rap out gilberte chez stoudza -- it would have be a honest ghost -lrb- though indiscreet -rrb- and we should not have feel that we credulity have be tax to no purpose as it be the logical deduction from m sardou 's fable be that though spirit communication be genuine enough they be never of the slightest use but we can scarcely suppose that that be what he intend to convey it may be say and perhaps with truth that what sardou lack in this instance be not logic but courage : he feel that a audience would accept episodic miracle but would reject supernatural interference at a determine crisis in the play in that case he would have do better to let the theme alone : for the manifest failure of logic leave the play neither good drama nor good argument this be a totally different matter from ibsen 's treatment of the supernatural in such play as _ the lady from the sea _ _ the master builder _ and _ little eyolf _ ibsen like hawthorne suggest without affirm the action of occult power he show we nothing that be not capable of a perfectly natural explanation but he leave we to imagine if we be so disposed that there may be influence at work that be not yet formally recognize in physics and psychology in this there be nothing illogical the poet be merely appeal to a mood familiar to all of we in which we wonder whether there may not be more thing in heaven and earth than be crystallize in we scientific formula it be a grave defect of logic to state or hint at a problem and then illustrate it in such term of character that it be solve in advance in _ the liar _ by mr henry arthur jone there be a evident suggestion of the problem whether a man be ever justify in rescue a woman by means of the divorce court from marital bondage which she soul abhor the sententious sir christopher deer argue the matter at great length : but all the time we be hunger for he to say the one thing demand by the logic of the situation : to wit : whatever the abstract rights and wrong of the case this man would be a imbecile to elope with this woman who be a empty-headed empty-hearted creature incapable either of the passion or of the loathing which alone could lend any semblance of reason to a breach of social law similarly in _ the profligate _ sir arthur pinero no doubt intend we to reflect upon the question whether in enter upon marriage a woman have a right to assume in she husband the same purity of antecedent conduct which he demand of she that be a arguable question and it have be argue often enough but in this play it do not really arise for the husband present to we be no ordinary loose-liver but -lrb- it would seem -- for the case be not clearly state -rrb- a particularly base and heartless seducer whom it be evidently a misfortune for any woman to have marry the author of these two play have commit a identical error of logic : namely that of suggest a broad issue and then state such a set of circumstance that the issue do not really arise in other word they have from the outset beg the question the play it may be say be both successful in they day yes but have they be logical they day might have last a century a somewhat similar defect of logic constitute a fatal blemish in _ the ideal husband _ by oscar wilde intentionally or otherwise the question suggest be whether a single flaw of conduct -lrb- the betrayal to financier of a state secret -rrb- ought to blast a political career here again be a arguable point on the assumption that the statesman be penitent and determine never to repeat he misdeed but when we find that this particular statesman be prepare to go on betray he country indefinitely in order to save he own skin the question fall to the ground -- the answer be too obvious it happen some year ago that two play satirize yellow journalism be produce almost simultaneously in london -- _ the earth _ by mr jame b fagan and _ what the public want _ by mr arnold bennett in point of intellectual grasp or power of characterization there could be no comparison between the two writer yet i hold that from the point of view of dramatic composition _ the earth _ be the better play of the two simply because it deal logically with the theme announce instead of wander away into all sort of irrelevance mr bennett to begin with could not resist make he napoleon of the press a native of the five town and exhibit he at large in provincial middle-class surroundings all this be sheer irrelevance for the type of journalism in question be not characteristically a outcome of any phase of provincial life mr bennett may allege that sir charle worgan have to be bear somewhere and might as well be bear in bursley as anywhere else i reply that for the purpose of the play he need not have be bear anywhere he birthplace and the surroundings of he boyhood have nothing to do with what may be call he journalistic psychology which be or ought to be the theme of the play then again mr bennett show he dabble in theatrical management and fall in love -- irrelevance both as a manager no doubt he insist on do what the public want -lrb- it be nothing worse than a revival of _ the merchant of venice _ -rrb- and thus offer another illustration of the result of obey that principle but all this be beside the real issue the true gravaman of the charge against a napoleon of the press be not that he give the public what it want but that he can make the public want what _ he _ want think what _ he _ think believe what _ he _ want they to believe and do what _ he _ want they to do by dint of assertion innuendo and iteration in a hundred papers he can create a apparent public opinion or public emotion which may be direct towards the most dangerous end this point mr bennett entirely miss what he give we be in reality a comedy of middle-class life with a number of incidental allusion to yellow journalism and kindred topic mr fagan work in broader outline and it must be own in cruder color never stray from the logical line of development and take we much nearer the heart of he subject a somewhat different and very common fault of logic be exemplify in mr clyde fitch 's last play _ the city _ he theme as announce in he title and indicate in he exposition be the influence of new york upon a family which migrate thither from a provincial town but the action be not really shape by the influence of the city it might have take practically the same course if the family have remain at home the author have fail to establish a logical connection between he theme and the incident suppose to illustrate it -lrb- 1 -rrb- fantastic play which assume a order of thing more or less exempt from the limitation of physical reality ought nevertheless to be logically faithful to they own assumption some fantasy indeed which sin against this principle have have no small success in _ pygmalion and galatea _ for example there be a conspicuous lack of logic the following passage from a criticism of thirty year ago put my point so clearly that i be tempt to copy it : as we have no scientific record of a statue come to life the probable moral and intellectual condition of a be so create be leave to the widest conjecture the playwright may assume for it any stage of development he please and he audience will readily grant he assumption but if he work be to have any claim to artistic value he must not assume all sort of different stage of development at every second word he creation utter he must not make she a child in one speech a woman of the world in the next and a idiot in the next again of course it would be a extremely difficult task clearly to define in all its bearing and detail the particular intellectual condition assume at the outset and then gradually to indicate the natural growth of a fuller consciousness difficult it would be but by no means impossible nay it would be this very problem which would tempt the true dramatist to adopt such a theme mr gilbert have not essay the task he regulate galatea 's state of consciousness by the fluctuate exigency of dialogue whose humor be level straight at the head of the old haymarket pit to indicate the nature of the inconsistency which abound in every scene i may say that in the first act galatea do not know that she be a woman but understand the word beauty know -lrb- though pygmalion be the only live creature she have ever see -rrb- the meaning of agreement and difference of taste and be alive to the distinction between a original and a copy in the second act she have get the length of know the enormity of take life and appreciate the fine distinction between take it of one 's own motive and take it for money yet the next moment when leucippe enter with a fawn he have kill it appear that she do not realize the difference between man and the brute creation thus we be for ever shift from one plane of convention to another there be no fixed starting-point for we imagination no logical development of a clearly-stated initial condition the play it be true enjoy some five-and-twenty year of life but it certainly can not claim a enduring place either in literature or on the stage it be still open to the philosophic dramatist to write a logical _ pygmalion and galatea _ \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : i be here write from memory have be unable to obtain a copy of _ the city _ but my memory be pretty clear -rrb- _ chapter xvii _ keep a secret it have be often and authoritatively lay down that a dramatist must on no account keep a secret from he audience like most authoritative maxim this one seem to require a good deal of qualification let we look into the matter a little more closely so far as i can see the strongest reason against keep a secret be that try as you may you can not do it this point have already be discuss in chapter ix where we see that from only one audience can a secret be really hide a considerable percentage of any subsequent audience be certain to know all about it in advance the more striking and successful be the first-night effect of surprise the more certainly and rapidly will the report of it circulate through all stratum of the theatrical public but for this fact one could quite well conceive a fascinating melodrama construct like a detective story with a view to keep the audience in the dark as long as possible a pistol shot might ring out just before the rise of the curtain : a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- might be discover in a otherwise empty room weltering in he -lrb- or she -rrb- gore : and the remainder of the play might consist in the track down of the murderer who would of course prove to be the very last person to be suspect such a play might make a great first-night success but the more the author rely upon the mystery for he effect the more fatally would that effect be discount at each successive repetition one author of distinction m hervieu have actually make the experiment of present a enigma -- he call the play _ l'enigme _ -- and reserve the solution to the very end we know from the outset that one of two sister-in-law be unfaithful to she husband and the question be -- which the whole ingenuity of the author be centre on keep the secret and the spectator who do not know it in advance be all the time in the attitude of a detective quest for clue he be challenge to guess which of the lady be the frail one and he be far too intent on this game to think or care about the emotional process of the play i myself -lrb- i remember -rrb- guess right mainly because the name giselle seem to I more suggestive of flightiness than the staid and sober leonore wherefore i suspect that m hervieu in order to throw dust in we eye have give it to the virtuous lady but whether we guess right or wrong this clue-hunting be a intellectual sport not a artistic enjoyment if there be any aesthetic quality in the play it can only come home to we when we know the secret and the same dilemma will present itself to any playwright who seek to imitate m hervieu the actual keep of a secret then -- the appeal to the primary curiosity of actual ignorance -- may be rule out as practically impossible and when possible unworthy of serious art but there be also as we have see the secondary curiosity of the audience which though more or less cognizant of the essential fact instinctively assume ignorance and judge the development of a play from that point of view we all realize that a dramatist have no right to trust to we previous knowledge acquire from outside source we know that a play like every other work of art ought to be self-sufficient and even if at any given moment we have as a matter of fact knowledge which supplement what the playwright have tell we we feel that he ought not to have take for grant we possession of any such external and fortuitous information to put it briefly the dramatist must formally _ assume _ ignorance in he audience though he must not practically _ rely upon _ it therefore it become a point of real importance to determine how long a secret may be keep from a audience assume to have no outside knowledge and at what point it ought to be reveal when _ lady windermere 's fan _ be first produce no hint be give in the first act of the fact that mr erlynne be lady windermere 's mother so that lord windermere 's insistence on invite she to he wife 's birthday reception remain wholly unexplained but after a few night the author make lord windermere exclaim just as the curtain fall my god what shall i do i dare not tell she who this woman really be the shame would kill she it be of course say that this change have be make in deference to newspaper criticism and oscar wilde in a characteristic letter to the _ st jame 's gazette _ promptly repel this calumny at a first-night supper-party he say -- all of my friend without exception be of the opinion that the psychological interest of the second act would be greatly increase by the disclosure of the actual relationship exist between lady windermere and mr erlynne -- a opinion i may add that have previously be strongly hold and urge by mr alexander i determine consequently to make a change in the precise moment of revelation it be impossible to say whether wilde seriously believe that psychology enter into the matter at all or whether he be laugh in he sleeve in put forward this solemn plea the truth be i think that this example can not be cite either for or against the keep of a secret the essential fact be that the secret be such a bad and inacceptable one -- inacceptable i mean as a explanation of lord windermere 's conduct -- that it be probably wise to make a clean breast of it as soon as possible and get it over it may be say with perfect confidence that it be useless to keep a secret which when reveal be certain to disappoint the audience and to make it feel that it have be trifle with that be a elementary dictate of prudence but if the reason for lord windermere 's conduct have be adequate ingenious such as to give we when reveal a little shock of pleasant surprise the author need certainly have be in no hurry to disclose it it be not improbable -lrb- though my memory be not clear on the point -rrb- that part of the strong interest we undoubtedly feel on the first night arise from the hope that lord windermere 's seemingly unaccountable conduct might be satisfactorily account for as this hope be futile there be no reason at subsequent performance to keep up the pretence of preserve a secret which be probably know as a matter of fact to most of the audience and which be worthless when reveal in the second act of _ the devil 's disciple _ by mr bernard shaw we have a instance of wholly inartistic secrecy which would certainly be condemn in the work of any author who be not accept in advance as a law unto himself richard dudgeon have be arrest by the british soldier who mistake he for the reverend anthony anderson when anderson come home it take a very long time for he silly wife judith to acquaint he with a situation that might have be explain in three word and when at last he do understand it he call for a horse and he boot and rush off in mad haste as though he one desire be to escape from the british and leave dudgeon to he fate in reality he purpose be to bring up a body of continental troops to the rescue of dudgeon and this also he might -lrb- and certainly would -rrb- have convey in three word but mr shaw be so bent on let judith continue to conduct herself idiotically that he make she sensible husband act no less idiotically in order to throw dust in she eye and -lrb- incidentally -rrb- in the eye of the audience in the work of any other man we should call this not only a injudicious but a purposeless and foolish keep of a secret mr shaw may say that in order to develop the character of judith as he have conceive it he be force to make she misunderstand she husband 's motive a development of character obtain by such artificial means can not be of much worth but even grant this plea one can not but point out that it would have be easy to keep judith in the dark as to anderson 's purpose without keep the audience also in the dark and make he behave like a fool all that be require be to get judith off the stage for a few moment just before the true state of matter burst upon anthony it would then have be perfectly natural and probable that not foresee she misunderstanding he should hurry off without wait to explain matter to she but that he should deliberately leave she in she delusion and even use phrase carefully calculate to deceive both she and the audience -lrb- 1 -rrb- would be in a writer who profess to place reason above caprice a rather gross fault of art mr henry arthur jone 's light comedy _ whitewashing julium _ prove that it be possible without incur disaster to keep a secret throughout a play and never reveal it at all more accurately what mr jone do be to pretend that there be some explanation of mr julia wren 's relation with the duke of savona other than the simple explanation that she be he mistress and to keep we wait for this whitewashing disclosure when in fact he have nothing of the sort up he sleeve and the plain truth be precisely what the gossip of shanctonbury surmise julium do not even explain or justify she conduct from she own point of view she give out that a explanation will be forthcoming at the right moment but the right moment never arrive all we be tell be that she julia consider that there be never anything degrading in she conduct and this we be ask to accept as sufficient it be a daring policy to dangle before we eye a explanation which always recede as we advance towards it and prove in the end to be wholly unexplanatory the success of the play however be sufficient to show that in light comedy at any rate a secret may with impunity be keep even to the point of tantalization -lrb- 2 -rrb- let we now look at a couple of case in which the keep of a secret seem pretty clearly wrong inasmuch as it diminish tension and deprive the audience of that superior knowledge in which lie the irony of drama in a play name _ she advocate _ by mr walter frith -lrb- found on one of grenville murray 's _ french picture in english chalk _ -rrb- a kc have fall madly in love with a woman whose defense he have undertake he believe passionately in she innocence and never doubt that she love he in return he be determine to secure for she a triumphant acquittal just at the crucial moment however he learn that she love another man and overwhelm by this disillusion he have still to face the ordeal and plead she cause the conjuncture would be still more dramatic if the revelation of this love be to put a different complexion on the murder and by introduce a new motive shake the advocate 's faith in he client 's innocence but that be another matter the question here to be consider be whether the author do right in reserve the revelation to the last possible moment in my opinion he would have do better to have give we a earlier inkling of the true state of affair to keep the secret in this case be to place the audience as well as the advocate on a false trail and to deprive it of the sense of superiority it would have feel in see he march confidently towards a happiness which it know to be illusory the second case be that of _ la douloureuse _ by m maurice donnay through two act out of the four a important secret be so carefully keep that there seem to be no obstacle between the lover with whom -lrb- from the author 's point of view -rrb- we be suppose to sympathize the first act be devote to a elaborate painting of a somewhat revolting phase of parvenu society in paris towards the end of the act we learn that the sculptor philippe lauberthie be the lover of hélène ardan a married woman and at the very end she husband ardan commit suicide this act therefore be devote not as the orthodox formulum go to raise a obstacle between the lover but rather to destroy one in the second act there still seem to be no obstacle of any sort hélène 's year of widowhood be nearly over she and philippe be presently to be marry all be harmony adoration and security in the last scene of the act a cloud no bigger than a man 's hand appear on the horizon we find that gotte des trembles hélène 's bosom friend be also in love with philippe and be determine to let he know it but philippe resist she blandishments with melancholy austerity and when the curtain fall on the second act thing seem to be perfectly safe and in order hélène a widow and philippe austere -- what harm can gotte possibly do the fact be m donnay be carefully keep a secret from we philippe be not hélène 's first lover she son george be not the child of she late husband and gotte and gotte alone know the truth have we also be initiate from the outset -lrb- and nothing would have be easier or more natural -- three word exchange between gotte and hélène would have do it -rrb- we should have be at no loss to foresee the impending drama and the sense of irony would have triple the interest of the intervene scene the effect of m donnay 's third act be not a whit more forcible because it come upon we unprepared we learn at the begin that philippe 's austerity have not after all be proof against gotte 's seduction but it have now return upon he embittered by remorse and he treat gotte with sternness approach to contumely she take she revenge by reveal hélène 's secret he tell hélène that he know it and she put two and two together divine how it have come to he knowledge this long scene of mutual reproach and remorseful misery be in reality the whole drama and might have be cite in chapter xiv as a fine example of a peripety hélène enter philippe 's studio happy and serene she leave it broken-hearted but the effect of the scene be not a whit greater because in the two previous act we have be studiously deprive of the information that would have lead we vaguely to anticipate it to sum up this question of secrecy : the current maxim never keep a secret from you audience would appear to be a over-simplification of a somewhat difficult question of craftsmanship we may agree that it be often dangerous and sometimes manifestly foolish to keep a secret but on the other hand there be certainly no reason why the playwright should blurt out all he secret at the first possible opportunity the true art lie in know just how long to keep silent and just the right time to speak in the first act of _ letty _ sir arthur pinero gain a memorable effect by keep a secret not very long indeed but long enough and carefully enough to show that he know very clearly what he be do we be introduce to nevill letchmere 's bachelor apartment animated scene occur between letchmere and he brother-in-law letchmere and he sister letchmere and letty marion and hilda gun it be evident that letty dream of marriage with letchmere and for aught that we see or hear there be no just cause or impediment to the contrary it be only at the end of the very admirable scene between letchmere and mandeville that the follow little passage occur : mandeville : at all event i _ be _ qualify to tell she i be fairly go on she -- honourably go on she -- if i choose to do it letchmere : qualify mandeville : which be more than you be mr letchmere i _ be _ a single man you be not bear in mind letchmere : -lrb- _ imperturbably _ -rrb- : very true this one little touch be a masterpiece of craftsmanship it would have be the most natural thing in the world for either the sister or the brother-in-law concern about they own matrimonial difficulty to let fall some pass allusion to letchmere 's separation from he wife but the author carefully avoid this carefully allow we to make we first acquaintance with letty in ignorance of the irony of she position and then allow the truth to slip out just in time to let we feel the whole force of that irony during the last scene of the act and the greater part of the second act a finer instance of the delicate grading of tension it would be difficult to cite one thing be certain namely that if a secret be to be keep at all it must be worth the keep if a riddle be propound its answer must be please and ingenious or the audience will resent have be lead to cudgel its brain for nothing this be simply a part of the larger principle before insist on that when a reasonable expectation be arouse it can be baffle only at the author 's peril if the crux of a scene or of a whole play lie in the solution of some material difficulty or moral problem it must on no account be solve by a mere trick or evasion the dramatist be very ill-advised who set forth with pomp and circumstance to perform some intellectual or technical feat and then merely skirt round it or run away from it a fair proportion should always be observe between effort and effect between promise and performance but if the audience happen to misread the playwright 's design and form exaggerate and irrational expectation that merely mean that the playwright do not know he business or at any rate do not know he audience it be he business to play upon the collective mind of he audience as upon a keyboard -- to arouse just the right order and measure of anticipation and fulfil it or outdo it in just the right way at just the right time the skill of the dramatist as distinct from he genius or inspiration lie in the correctness of he insight into the mind of he audience \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : for instance : if you can get a word with he by pretend that you be he wife tell he to hold he tongue until morning _ that will give I all the start i need _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : in _ the idyll _ by herr egge of which some account be give in chapter x the author certainly do right in not allow the audience for a moment to share the hero 's doubt as to the heroine 's past it would have be very easy for he to have keep the secret but he take the earliest opportunity of assure we that she relation with ringve be quite innocent -rrb- _ book iv _ the end _ chapter xviii _ climax and anticlimax if it be as easy to write a good last act as a good first act we should be able to reckon three masterpiece for every one that we can name at present the reason why the last act should offer special difficulty be not far to seek we have agree to regard a play as essentially a crisis in the life of one or more person and we all know that crisis be much more apt to have a definite beginning than a definite end we can almost always put we finger upon the moment -- not indeed when the crisis begin -- but when we clearly realize its presence or its imminence a chance meet the receipt of a letter or a telegram a particular turn give to a certain conversation even the mere emergence into consciousness of a previously latent feeling or thought may mark quite definitely the moment of germination so to speak of a give crisis and it be comparatively easy to dramatize such a moment but how few crisis come to a definite or dramatic conclusion nine time out of ten they end in some petty compromise or do not end at all but simply subside like the wave of the sea when the storm have blow itself out it be the playwright 's chief difficulty to find a crisis with a end which satisfy at once he artistic conscience and the requirement of dramatic effect and the difficulty become greater the nearer we approach to reality in the day when tragedy and comedy be cast in fixed conventional mould the playwright 's task be much simpler it be thoroughly understand that a tragedy end with one or more death a comedy with one or more marriage so that the question of a strong or a weak end do not arise the end might be strongly or weakly lead up to but in itself it be fore-ordained now that these mould be break and both marriage and death may be say to have lose they prestige as the be-all and end-all of drama the playwright 's range of choice be unlimited and the difficulty of choosing have become infinitely greater we comedy be much more apt to begin than to end with marriage and death have come to be regard as a rather cheap and conventional expedient for cut the knot of life from the fact that the difficulty become greater the nearer we approach to reality it further follow that the higher the form of drama the more probable be it that the demand of truth and the requirement of dramatic effect may be find to clash in melodrama the curtain fall of its own accord so to speak when the handcuffs be transfer from the hero 's wrist to the villain 's in a adventure-play whether farcical or romantic when the adventure be over the play be do the author 's task be merely to keep the interest of the adventure afoot until he be ready to drop he curtain this be a point of craftsmanship in which playwright often fail but it be a point of craftsmanship only in play of a higher order on the other hand the difficulty be often inherent in the theme and not to be overcome by any feat of craftsmanship if the dramatist be to eschew all crisis that could not be make to resolve themselves with specifically dramatic crispness and decisiveness he would very seriously limit the domain of he art many excellent theme would be distorted and ruin by have a emphatic end force upon they it be surely much better that they should be bring to they natural unemphatic ending than that they should be either falsify or ignore i suggest then that the modern tendency to take lightly aristotle 's demand that the drama should have a begin a middle _ and a end _ arise from the nature of thing and imply not necessarily nor even probably a decline in craftsmanship but a new intimacy of relation to life and a new sincerity of artistic conscience i suggest that the weak last act of which critic so often complain be a natural development from which author ought not on occasion to shrink and of which critic ought on occasion to recognize the necessity to elevate it into a system be absurd there be certainly no more reason for deliberately avoid a emphatic ending than for mechanically force one but author and critic alike should learn to distinguish the theme which do from the theme which do not call for a definite trenchant solution and should handle they and judge they in accordance with they inherent quality let we however define we term and be sure that we know what we be talk about by a unemphatic end i be far from mean a makeshift end a end carelessly and conventionally huddle up nor do i mean a indecisive end where the curtain fall as the say go on a note of interrogation a unemphatic end as i understand it be a deliberate anticlimax a idyllic or elegiac or philosophic last act follow upon a penultimate act of very much higher tension the disposition to condemn such a end off-hand be what i be here plead against it be sometimes assume that the playwright ought always to make he action conclude within five minute of its culmination but for such a hard-and-fast rule i can find no sufficient reason the consequence of a great emotional or spiritual crisis can not always be work out or even foreshadow within so brief a space of time if after such a crisis we be unwilling to keep we seat for another half-hour in order to learn what come of it all the author have evidently fail to awaken in we any real interest in he character a good instance of the unemphatic ending be the last act of sir arthur pinero 's _ letty _ this epilogue -- so the author call it -- have be denounce as a concession to popular sentimentality and a unpardonable anticlimax a anticlimax it be beyond all doubt but it do not follow that it be a artistic blemish nothing would have be easier than not to write it -- to make the play end with letty 's awakening from she dream and she flight from letchmere 's room but the author have set forth not merely to interest we in a adventure but to draw a character and it be essential to we full appreciation of letty 's character that we should know what after all she make of she life when iri most hapless of woman go out into the dark there be nothing more that we need to know of she we could guess the sequel only too easily but the case of letty be wholly different she exit be a act of will triumph over a form of temptation peculiarly alluring to she temperament there be in she character precisely that grit which iri lack and we want to know what it would do for she this be not a case for a indecisive end a note of interrogation the author feel no doubt as to letty 's destiny and he want to leave he audience in no doubt from iris 's fate we be only too willing to avert we eye but it would have be a sensible discomfort to we to be leave in the dark about letty 's this then i regard as a typical instance of justified anticlimax another be the idyllic last act of _ the princess and the butterfly _ in which moreover despite its comparatively subdue tone the tension be maintain to the end a very different matter be the third act of _ the benefit of the doubt _ already allude to this be a pronounced case of the makeshift end inspired -lrb- to all appearance -rrb- simply by the fact that the play must end somehow and that no better idea happen to present itself admirable as be the other act one be almost incline to agree with duma that a author ought not to embark upon a theme unless he foresee a better way out of it than this it should be note too that _ the benefit of the doubt _ be a three-act play and that in a play lay out on this scale a whole act of anticlimax be necessarily disproportionate it be one thing to relax the tension in the last act out of four or five quite another thing in the last act out of three in other word the culminate point of a four-or five-act play may be place in the penultimate act in a three-act play it should come at earliest in the penultimate scene -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the work of mr henry arthur jone we find several instance of the unemphatic last act -- some clearly justified other much less so among the former i unhesitatingly reckon the fourth act of _ mr dane 's defense _ it would not have be difficult but surely most inartistic to huddle up the action in five minute after mr dane 's tragic collapse under sir daniel carteret 's cross-examination she might have take poison and die in picturesque contortion on the sofa or lionel might have defy all counsel of prudence and go off with she in spite of she past or she might have place lionel 's hand in janet 's say : the game be up bless you my child i be go into the nearest nunnery as a matter of fact mr jone bring he action to its natural close in a quiet sufficiently adroit last act and i do not see that criticism have any just complaint to make in recent french drama _ la douloureuse _ already cite afford a excellent instance of a quiet last act after the violent and heartrending rupture between the lover in the third act we feel that though this paroxysm of pain be justify by the circumstance it will not last for ever and philippe and hélène will come together again this be also m donnay 's view and he devote he whole last act quite simply to a duologue of reconciliation it seem to I a fault of proportion however that he should shift he locality from pari to the riviera and should place the brief duologue in a romantic woodland scene a act of anticlimax should be treat so to speak as unpretentiously as possible to invent a elaborate apparatus for it be to emphasize the anticlimax by throw it into unnecessary relief this may be a convenient place for a few word on the modern fashion of eschew emphasis not only in last act but at every point where the old french dramaturgy demand it and especially in act-ending _ punch _ have a pleasant allusion to this tendency in two suggest examination-papers for a academy of dramatist : a -- for the classical side only 1 what be a curtain and how should it be lead up to b -- for the modern side only 1 what be a curtain and how can it be avoid some modern playwright have flee in a sort of panic from the old picture-poster situation to the other extreme of always drop they curtain when the audience least expect it this be not a practice to be commend one have often see a audience quite unnecessarily chill by a disconcerting curtain there should be moderation even in the shrink from theatricality this shrinking be particularly marked though i do not say it be carry too far in the play of mr galsworthy even the most innocent trick of emphasis be to he snare of the evil one he would sooner die than drop he curtain on a particularly effective line it be he chief ambition that you should never discern any arrangement any intention in he work as a rule the only reason you can see for he do thus or thus be he desire that you should see no reason for it he do not carry this tendency as some do to the point of eccentricity but he certainly go as far as any one should be advise to follow a little further and you incur the danger of become affectedly unaffected artificially inartificial i be far from plead for the conventional tableau at the end of each act with all the character petrified as it be in penny-plain-twopence-coloured attitude but it be certainly desirable that the fall of the curtain should not take a audience entirely by surprise and even that the spectator should feel the moment to be rightly choose though he might be unable to give any reason for he feeling moreover -- this may seem a super-subtlety but one have see it neglect with notably bad effect -- a playwright should never let he audience expect the fall of a curtain at a give point and then balk they expectancy unless he be sure that he hold in reserve a more than adequate compensation there be nothing so dangerous as to let a play or a act drag on when the audience feel in its heart that it be really over and that the rest be silence -- or ought to be the end of mr granville barker 's fine play _ the voysey inheritance _ be injure by the fact that several minute before the curtain actually fall he have give what seem a obvious cue for curtain i do not say that what follow be superfluous what i do say be that the author ought to have be careful not to let we imagine that the colloquy between edward and alice be over when in fact it have still some minute to run a even more remarkable play _ the madras house _ be ruin on its first night by a long final anticlimax here however the fault do not lie in awaken a premature expectation of the close but in the fact that we somehow be more interested in the other character of the play than in the pair who hold the stage throughout the long conclude scene once more i turn to _ la douloureuse _ for a instance of a admirable act-ending of the quiet modern type the third act -- the terrible peripety in the love of philippe and hélène -- have run its agonizing course and work itself out the old dramaturgy would certainly have end the scene with a bang so to speak -- a swoon or a scream a tableau of desolation or at the very least a piece of tearful rhetoric m donnay do nothing of the sort he let he lover unpack they heart with word until they be exhaust broken daze with misery and have nothing more to say then hélène ask : what o'clock be it philippe look at he watch : nearly seven i must be go -- and she dry she eye smoothe she hair pull herself together in a word to face the world again the mechanical round of life re-assert its hold upon they help I with my cloak she say and he hold she mantle for she and tuck in the puffed sleeve of she blouse then he take up the lamp and light she out -- and the curtain fall a model curtain \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : the fact that a great poet can ignore such precept with impunity be prove by the exquisite anticlimax of the third act of d'annunzio 's _ la gioconda _ -rrb- _ chapter xix _ conversion the reader may have notice possibly with surprise that some of the stock term of dramatic criticism occur but rarely in these page or not at all one of they be _ dénouement _ accord to orthodox theory i ought to have make the _ dénouement _ the subject of a whole chapter if not of a whole book why have i not do so for two reason the lesser but not negligible reason be that we possess no convenient english word for the unknotting or disentangling of a complication dénouement itself can not be plausibly anglicize and no native word have as yet by common consent be accept as its equivalent i sometimes wish we could adopt and print without italics the excellent and expressive greek word lusis but i can not on my own responsibility attempt so daring a innovation the second and determining reason for not make the _ dénouement _ one of the head of my argument be that the play of intrigue be no longer the dominant dramatic form the image of disentangling have lose some of its special fitness it be only in a somewhat strained and conventional sense that the term _ nodus _ or knot can be apply to the sort of crisis with which the modern drama normally deal and if we do not naturally think of the crisis as a knot we naturally do not think of its close as a unknotting nevertheless there be frequent case in which the end of a play depend on something very like the unravelling of a tangled skein and still more often perhaps be it bring about through the loosening of some knot in the mind of one or more of the character this be the characteristic end of the old comedy the heavy father or cantankerous guardian who for four act and a half have stand between the lover suddenly change he mind and all be well even by we ancestor this be reckon a rather too simple method of disentanglement lisideius in dryden 's dialogue -lrb- 1 -rrb- in enumerate the point in which the french drama be superior to the english note that -- you never see any of they play end with a conversion or simple change of will which be the ordinary way which we poet use to end theirs it shew little art in the conclusion of a dramatick poem when they who have hinder the felicity during the four act desist from it in the fifth without some powerful cause to take they off they design the remark of lisideius be suggest by a passage in corneille who instance as a apt and artistic method of bring about the conversion of a heavy father that he daughter 's lover should earn he gratitude by rescue he from assassination conversion closely examine will be find to fall into two class : change in volition and change in sentiment it be the former class that dryden have in mind and with reference to this class the principle he indicate remain a sound one a change of resolve should never be due to a mere lapse of time -- to the necessity for bring the curtain down and let the audience go home it must always be render plausible by some new fact or new motive : some hitherto untried appeal to reason or emotion this rule however be too obvious to require enforcement it be not quite superfluous so long as the old convention of comedy endure for a century and a half after dryden 's time hard-hearted parent be apt to withdraw they opposition to they child 's felicity for no better reason than that the fifth act be draw to a close but this formulum be practically obsolete change of will on the modern stage be not always adequately motive but that be because of individual inexpertness not because of any failure to recognize theoretically the necessity for adequate motivation change of sentiment be much more important and more difficult to handle a change of will can always manifest itself in action but it be very difficult to externalize convincingly a mere change of heart when the conclusion of a play hinge -lrb- as it frequently do -rrb- on a conversion of this nature it become a matter of the first moment that it should not merely be assert but prove many a promising play have go wrong because of the author 's neglect or inability to comply with this condition it have often be observe that of all ibsen 's thoroughly mature work from _ a doll 's house _ to _ john gabriel borkman _ _ the lady from the sea _ be the loosest in texture the least masterly in construction the fact that it leave this impression on the mind be largely due i think to a single fault the conclusion of the play -- ellida 's cling to wangel and rejection of the stranger -- depend entirely on a change in wangel 's mental attitude _ of which we have no proof whatever beyond he bare assertion _ ellida in she overwrought mood be evidently incline to yield to the uncanny allurement of the stranger 's claim upon she when wangel realize that she sanity be threaten say : wangel : it shall not come to that there be no other way of deliverance for you -- at least i see none and therefore -- therefore i -- cancel we bargain on the spot now you can choose you own path in full -- full freedom ellida -lrb- _ gaze at he awhile as if speechless _ -rrb- : be this true -- true -- what you say do you mean it -- from you inmost heart wangel : yes -- from the inmost depths of my tortured heart i mean it now you own true life can return to its -- its right groove again for now you can choose in freedom and on you own responsibility ellida ellida : in freedom -- and on my own responsibility responsibility this -- this transform everything -- and she promptly give the stranger he dismissal now this be inevitably feel to be a weak conclusion because it turn entirely on a condition of wangel 's mind of which he give no positive and convincing evidence nothing material be change by he change of heart he could not in any case have restrain ellida by force or if the law give he the abstract right to do so he certainly never have the slightest intention of exercise it psychologically indeed the incident be acceptable enough the saner part of ellida 's will be always on wangel 's side and a merely verbal undoing of the bargain with which she reproach herself might quite naturally suffice to turn the scale decisively in he favor but what may suffice for ellida be not enough for the audience too much be make to hang upon a verbally announce conversion the poet ought to have invent some material -- or at the very least some impressively symbolic -- proof of wangel 's change of heart have he do so _ the lady from the sea _ would assuredly have take a higher rank among he work let I further illustrate my point by compare a very small thing with a very great the late captain marshall write a farcical romance name _ the duke of killiecrankie _ in which that nobleman have be again and again reject by the lady henrietta addison kidnap the obdurate fair one and imprison she in a crag-castle in the highland have keep she for a week in deferential durance and show she that he be not the inefficient nincompoop she have take he for he throw open the prison gate and say to she : go i set you free the moment she see the gate unlock and realize that she could indeed go when and where she please she also realize that she have not the least wish to go and fling herself into she captor 's arm here we have ibsen 's situation transpose into the key of fantasy and provide with the material guarantee of good faith which be lack in _ the lady from the sea _ the duke 's change of mind he will to set the lady henrietta free be visibly demonstrate by the actual opening of the prison gate so that we believe in it and believe that she believe in it the play be a trivial affair and be deservedly forget but the situation be effective because it obey the law that a change of will or of feeling occur at a crucial point in a dramatic action must be certify by some external evidence on pain of leave the audience unimpressed this be a more important matter than it may at first sight appear how to bring home to the audience a decisive change of heart be one of the ever-recurring problem of the playwright 's craft in _ the lady from the sea _ ibsen fail to solve it : in _ rosmersholm _ he solve it by heroic measure the whole catastrophe be determine by rosmer 's inability to accept without proof rebecca 's declaration that rosmersholm have ennoble she and that she be no longer the same woman whose relentless egoism drive bea into the mill-race rebecca herself put it to he : how can you believe I on my bare word after to-day there be only one proof she can give -- that of go the way bea go she give it : and rosmer who can not believe she if she live and will not survive she if she die go with she to she end but the case be not very frequent fortunately in which such drastic method of proof be appropriate or possible the dramatist must as a rule attain he end by less violent means and often he fail to attain it at all a play by mr haddon chamber _ the awaken _ turn on a sudden conversion -- the awakening in fact refer to in the title a professional lady-killer a note don juan have be idly make love to a country maiden whose heart be full of innocent idealism she discover he true character or at any rate he reputation and be horror-stricken while practically at the same moment he awaken to the error of he way and be seize with a passion for she as single mind and idealistic as hers for he but how be the heroine and the audience to be assure of the fact that be just the difficulty and the author take no effectual measure to overcome it the heroine of course be ultimately convinced but the audience remain sceptical to the detriment of the desire effect sceptical perhaps be not quite the right word the state of mind of a fictitious character be not a subject for actual belief or disbelief we be bind to accept theoretically what the author tell we but in this case he have fail to make we intimately feel and know that it be true -lrb- 2 -rrb- in mr alfr sutro 's play _ the builder of bridge _ dorothy faringay in she devotion to she forger brother have conceive the rather disgraceful scheme of make one of he official superior fall in love with she in order to induce he to become practically a accomplice in she brother 's crime she succeed beyond she hope edward thursfield do fall in love with she and at a great sacrifice replace the money the brother have steal but in a very powerful peripety-scene in the third act thursfield learn that dorothy have be deliberately beguile he while in fact she be engage to another man the truth be however that she have really come to love thursfield passionately and have break she engagement with the other for whom she never truly care so the author tell we and so we be willing enough to believe -- if he can devise any adequate method of make thursfield believe it mr sutro 's handling of the difficulty seem to I fairly but not conspicuously successful i cite the case as a typical instance of the problem apart from the merit or demerit of the solution it may be say that the difficulty of bring home to we the reality of a revulsion of feeling or a radical change of mental attitude be only a particular case of the playwright 's general problem of convincingly externalize inward condition and process that be true : but the special importance of a conversion which untie the knot and bring the curtain down seem to render it worthy of special consideration \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : _ of dramatic poesy _ ed arnold 1903 p 51 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : in mr

theme -- and other a blind-alley theme as its name import be one from which there be no exit it be a problem incapable of solution or rather of which all possible solution be equally unsatisfactory and undesirable the playwright can not too soon make sure that he have not stray into such a no-thoroughfare whether a end be comic or tragic romantic or ironic happy or disastrous it should satisfy something within we -- we sense of truth or of beauty or of sublimity or of justice or of humor or at the least or lowest we cynical sense of the baseness of human nature and the vanity of human aspiration but a play which satisfy neither we higher nor we lower instinct baffle we sympathy and leave we desire at fault between equally inacceptable alternative -- such a play whatever beauty of detail it may possess be a weariness of the spirit and a artistic blunder there be in literature two conspicuous example of the blind-alley theme -- two famous play wherein two heroine be place in somewhat similar dilemma which merely paralyse we sympathy and inhibit we moral judgment the first of these be _ measure for measure _ if ever there be a insoluble problem in casuistry it be that which shakespeare have here choose to present to we isabellum be force to choose between what we can only describe as two detestable evil if she resist angelo and let she brother die she recoil from a act of self-sacrifice and although we may coldly approve we can not admire or take pleasure in she action if on the other hand she determine at all cost to save she brother 's life she sacrifice be a thing from which we want only to avert the mind : it belong to the region of what aristotle call to _ miaron _ the odious and intolerable shakespeare indeed confess the problem insoluble in the fact that he leave it unsolved -- evade it by means of a mediaeval trick but where then be the use of present it what be the artistic profit of let the imagination play around a problem which merely baffle and repel it sardou indeed present the same problem not as the theme of a whole play but only of a single act and he solve it by make florium tosca kill scarpium this be a solution which at any rate satisfy we craving for crude justice and be melodramatically effective shakespeare probably ignore it partly because it be not in he source partly because for some obscure reason he suppose himself to be write a comedy the result be that though the play contain some wonderful poetry and have be from time to time revive it have never take any real hold upon popular esteem the second glaring instance of a blind-alley theme be that of _ monna vanna _ we have all of we i suppose stumble either as actor or onlooker into painful situation which not even a miracle of tact could possibly save as a rule of course they be comic and the agony they cause may find a safety-valve in laughter but sometimes there occur some detestable incident over which it be equally impossible to laugh and to weep the wisest word the most graceful act be of no avail one long only to sink into the earth or vanish into thin air such a situation on the largest possible scale be that present in _ monna vanna _ it differ from that of _ measure for measure _ in the fact that there can be no doubt as to the moral aspect of the case it be quite clear that giovanna ought to sacrifice herself to save not one pule claudio but a whole city full of man woman and child what she do be absolutely right but the conjuncture be none the less a grotesque and detestable one which ought to be talk about and think about as little as possible every word that be utter be a failure in tact guido the husband behave in the first act with a violent egoism which be certainly lack in dignity but will any one tell I what would be a dignified course for he to pursue under the circumstance the sage old marco too -- that fifteenth-century renan -- flounder just as painfully as the hot-headed guido it be the fatality of the case that he can not open he mouth without put he foot in it and a theme which expose a well-meaning old gentleman to this painful necessity be one by all means to be avoid the fact that it be a false alarm and that there be no rational explanation for prinzivalle 's wanton insult to a woman whom he reverently idolize in no way make matter better -lrb- 1 -rrb- not the least grotesque thing in the play be giovanna 's expectation that guido will receive prinzivalle with open arm because he have -- change he mind we can feel neither approval nor disapproval sympathy nor antipathy in such a deplorable conjunction of circumstance all we wish be that we have not be call upon to contemplate it -lrb- 2 -rrb- maeterlinck like shakespeare be simply dally with the idea of a squalid heroism -- so squalid indeed that neither he nor he predecessor have the courage to carry it through pray observe that the defect of these two theme be not merely that they be unpleasant it be that there be no possible way out of they which be not worse than unpleasant : humiliating and distressing let the playwright then before embark on a theme make sure that he have some sort of satisfaction to offer we at the end if it be only the pessimistic pleasure of realize some part of the bitter old and wrinkled truth about life the crime of destiny there be some profit in contemplate but its stupid vulgarity minister neither to profit nor delight \* \* \* \* \* it may not be superfluous to give at this point a little list of subject which though not blind-alley theme be equally to be avoid some of they indeed be the reverse of blind-alley theme they drawback lie in the fact that the way out of they be too tediously apparent at the head of this list i would place what may be call the white marriage theme : not because it be ineffective but because its effectiveness be very cheap and have be sadly overdo it occur in two variety : either a proud but penniless damsel be marry to a wealthy parvenu or a woman of culture and refinement be marry to a rough diamond in both case the action consist of the transformation of a nominal into a real marriage and it be almost impossible in these day to lend any novelty to the process in the good old _ lady of lyon _ the theme be deck in trappings of romantic absurdity which somehow harmonize with it one could hear in it a far-off echo of revolutionary rodomontade the social aspect of the matter be emphasize and the satire on middle-class snobbery be cruelly effective the personal aspect on the other hand -- the unfulfilment of the nominal marriage -- be lightly and discreetly handle accord to early-victorian convention in later day -- from the time of m george ohnet 's _ maître de forge _ onward -- this be the aspect on which playwright have prefer to dwell usually the theme shade off into the almost equally hackneyed _ still water run deep _ theme for there be apt to be a aristocratic lover whom the unpolished but formidable husband threaten to shoot or horsewhip and thereby overcome the last remnant of repugnance in the breast of he haughty spouse in _ the ironmaster _ the lover be call the duc de bligny or more commonly the dook de bleeny but he have appear under many alias in the chief american version of the theme mr vaughn moody 's _ great divide _ the lover be dispense with altogether be inconsistent no doubt with the austere manners of milford corner mass in one of the recent french version on the other hand -- m bernstein 's _ samson _ -- the aristocratic lover be almost as important a character as the virile masterful plebeian husband it appear from this survey -- which might be largely extend -- that there be several way of handle the theme but there be no way of renew and deconventionalize it no doubt it have a long life before it on the plane of popular melodrama but scarcely one hope on any higher plane another theme which ought to be relegate to the theatrical lumber-room be that of patient inveterate revenge this form of vindictiveness be from a dramatic point of view a outworn passion it be too obviously irrational and anti-social to pass muster in modern costume the actual vendetta may possibly survive in some semi-barbarous region and grangerford and shepherdson -lrb- as in mark twain 's immortal romance -rrb- may still be shooting each other at sight but these thing be relic of the past they do not belong to the normal typical life of we time it be useless to say that human nature be the same in all age that be one of the facile axiom of psychological incompetence far be it from I to deny that malice hatred spite and the spirit of retaliation be and will be until the millennium among the most active force in human nature but most people be come to recognize that life be too short for deliberate elaborate cold-drawn revenge they will hit back when they conveniently can they will cherish for half a lifetime a passive a obstructive ill-will they will even await for year a opportunity of get they knife into a enemy but they have grow chary of cut off they nose to spite they face they will very rarely sacrifice they own comfort in life to the mere joy of protracted elaborate reprisal vitriol and the revolver -- a outburst of rage culminate in a short sharp shock -- these belong if you will to modern life but long-drawn unhasting unresting machination with no end in view beyond a ultimate unmask a turn of the table -- in a word a strong situation -- this i take it belong to a phase of existence more leisurely than ours there be no room in we crowded century for such large and sustained passion one could mention play -- but they be happily forget -- in which retribution be delay for some thirty or forty year during which the unconscious object of it enjoy a happy and prosperous existence these no doubt be extreme instance but cold-storage revenge as a whole ought to be as rare on the stage as it be in real life the serious playwright will do well to leave it to the melodramatist a third theme to be handle with the greatest caution if at all be that of heroic self-sacrifice not that self-sacrifice like revenge be a outworn passion it still rage in daily life but no audience of average intelligence will to-day accept it with the uncritical admiration which it use to excite in the sentimental drama of last century even then -- even in 1869 -- meilhac and halévy in they ever-memorable _ froufrou _ show what disaster often result from it but it retain its prestige with the average playwright -- and with some who be above the average -- for many a day after that i can recall a play by a living english author in which a colonel in the indian army plead guilty to a damning charge of cowardice rather than allow a lady whom he chivalrously adore to learn that it be she husband who be the real coward and traitor he know that the lady detest she husband he know that they have no child to suffer by the husband 's disgrace he know that there be a quite probable way by which he might have clear he own character without cast any imputation on the other man but in a sheer frenzy of self-sacrifice he blast he own career and thereby inflict far greater pain upon the woman he love than if he have tell the truth or suffer it to be tell and twenty year afterwards when the villain be dead the hero still resolutely refuse to clear he own character lest the villain 's widow should learn the truth about she wholly unlamented husband this be a extravagant and childish case but the superstition of heroic self-sacrifice still linger in certain quarter and can not be too soon eradicate i do not mean of course that self-sacrifice be never admirable but only that it can no longer be accept as a thing inherently noble apart from its circumstance and its consequence a excellent play might be write with the express design of place the ethic of self-sacrifice in they true light perhaps the upshot might be the recognition of the simple principle that it be immoral to make a sacrifice which the person suppose to benefit by it have no right to accept another motive against which it be perhaps not quite superfluous to warn the aspiring playwright be the voix du sing it be only a few year since this miraculous voice be hear speak loud and long in he majesty 's theater london and in a play by a no less modern-minded author than the late clyde fitch it be call _ the last of the dandy _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- and its hero be count d'orsay at a give moment d'orsay learn that a young man know as lord raoul ardale be in reality he son instantly the man of the world the squire of dame go off into a deliquium of tender emotion for my bo-ô-oy he would do anything and everything he would go down to crockford 's and win a pot of money to pay my boy 's debt -- fortune could not but be kind to a doting parent in the beautiful simplicity of he soul he look forward with eager delight to tell raoul that the mother he adore be no better than she should be and that he have no right to he name or title not for a moment do he doubt that the young man would share he transport when the mother oppose he purpose of betray she secret he weep with disappointment all day he say i have be say to myself : when that sun set i shall hear he say ` good-night father ' he postulate in so many word the voix du sing trust that even if the revelation be not formally make nature would send the boy some impulse of filial affection it be hard to believe -- but it be the fact -- that well within the present century such ingenuous nonsense as this be gravely present to the public of a lead theater by a author of keen intelligence who but for a unhappy accident would now be at the zenith of he career there be few more foolish convention than that of the voix du sing perhaps however the rise generation of playwright have more need to be warn against the opposite or shawesque convention that kinship utter itself mainly in wrangle and mutual dislike among inherently feeble and greatly overdo expedient may be reckon the oath or promise of secrecy exact for no sufficient reason and keep in defiance of common sense and common humanity lord windermere 's conduct in oscar wilde 's play be a case in point though he have not even a oath to excuse he insensate secretiveness a still clearer instance be afford by clyde fitch 's play _ the girl with the green eye _ in other respects a very able play it be vitiate by the certainty that austin ought to have and would have tell the truth ten time over rather than subject he wife 's jealous disposition to the strain he put upon it it would not be difficult to prolong this catalogue of theme and motive that have come down in the world and be no longer presentable in any society that pretend to intelligence but it be needless to enter into further detail there be a general rule of sovereign efficacy for avoid such anachronism : go to life for you theme and not to the theater observe that rule and you be safe but it be easier say than do \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : i have good reason for believe that in m maeterlinck 's original scheme prinzivalle impose no such humiliating condition giovanna go of she own motive to appeal to he clemency and she success be so complete that she husband on she return could not believe that it have be win by avowable means this be a really fine conception -- what a pity that the poet depart from it -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : much have be make of the censor 's refusal to license _ monna vanna _ but i think there be more to be say for he action in this than in many other case in those country where the play have succeed i can not but suspect that the appeal it make be not wholly to the higher instinct of the public -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : i be not sure what be the precise relationship of this play to the same author 's _ beau brummel _ d'orsay 's death scene be certainly a repetition of brummel 's -rrb- _ chapter xxi _ the full close in a earlier chapter i have try to show that a certain tolerance for anticlimax for a fourth or fifth act of calm after the storm of the penultimate act be consonant with right reason and be a practically inevitable result of a really intimate relation between drama and life but it would be a complete misunderstanding of my argument to suppose that i deny the practical and even the artistic superiority of those theme in which the tension can be maintain and heighten to the very end the fact that tragedy have from of old be recognize as a higher form than comedy be partly due no doubt to the tragic poet 's traditional right to round off a human destiny in death call no man happy till he life be end say sophocle quote from a earlier sage and it need no profundity of wisdom to recognize in the happy ending of comedy a conventional ephemeral thing but when after all the peripety of life the hero home have go and ta'en he wages we feel that at any rate we have look destiny squarely in the face without evasion or subterfuge perhaps the true justification of tragedy as a form of art be that after this experience we should feel life to be not less worth living but greater and more significant than before this be no place however for a discussion of the aesthetic basis of tragedy in general -lrb- 1 -rrb- what be here require from the point of view of craftsmanship be not so much a glorification of the tragic end as a warning against its facile misuse a very great play may and often must end in death but you can not make a play great by simply kill off you protagonist death be after all a very inexpensive means of avoid anticlimax tension as we see be symbolize in the sword of damocle and it can always be maintain in a mechanical way by let you hero play about with a revolver or place a overdose of chloral well within you heroine 's reach at the time when the english drama be awake from the lethargy of the ` seventy a idea get abroad that a non-sanguinary ending be always and necessarily inartistic and that a self-respecting playwright must at all hazard kill somebody before drop he curtain this be a extravagant reaction against the purely commercial principle that the public would not on any term accept a tragic end as a matter of fact the mortality be not very great for manager be resolute in the old belief and few dramatist have the courage or authority to stand up against they but i have often hear playwright lament they inability to massacre the luckless child of they fancy who nine time out of ten have do nothing to incur such a doom the real trouble be that death seem to be the only method of avoid anticlimax it be a very sound rule that before you determine to write a tragedy you should make sure that you have a really tragic theme : that you can place you hero at such odds with life that reconciliation or mere endurance would be morally base or psychologically improbable moreover you must strike deep into character before you be justified in pass capital sentence on you personage death be a disproportionate close for a commonplace and superficially-studied life it be true that quite commonplace people do die indeed they preponderate in the bill of mortality but death on the stage confer a sort of distinction which ought not to be accord without due and sufficient cause to one god in particular we may apply the horatian maxim nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus in german aesthetic theory the conception _ tragische schuld _ -- tragic guilt -- play a large part it descend no doubt from the aristotelian maxim that a tragic hero must neither be too good nor too bad but it also belong to a moralizing conception which tacitly or explicitly assume that the dramatist 's aim ought to be to justify the way of god to man in these day we look at drama more objectively and do not insist on decide in what degree a man have deserve death if only we feel that he have necessarily or probably incur it but in order that we may be satisfy of this we must know he intimately and feel with he intensely we must in other word believe that he die because he can not live and not merely to suit the playwright 's convenience and help he to a effective curtain as we review the series of ibsen 's modern play we can not but feel that though he do not shrink from death he never employ it except perhaps in he last melancholy effort as a mere way of escape from a difficulty in five out of he thirteen modern play no one die at all -lrb- 2 -rrb- one might even say six : for oswald in _ ghost _ may live for year but i hold it as only fair to count the death of he mind as more than equivalent to bodily death solness on the plane of literal fact die by a accident on the plane of symbolic interpretation he die of the over-great demand which hilda make upon he sickly conscience little eyolf 's death can also be regard from a symbolic point of view but there be no substantial reason to think of it otherwise than as a accident john gabriel borkman die of heart seizure result from sudden exposure to extreme cold in the case of solness and borkman death be a quite natural and probable result of the antecedent condition and in the case of eyolf it be not a way out of the action but rather the way into it there remain the three case of suicide : rebecca and rosmer hedda gabler and hedvig i have already in chapter xix show how the death of rebecca be the inevitable outcome of the situation -- the one conclusive proof of she ennoblement -- and how it be almost equally inevitable that rosmer should accompany she to she end hedda gabler be constitutionally fate to suicide : a woman of low vitality overmaster egoism and acute supersensitiveness place in a predicament which leave she nothing to expect from life but tedium and humiliation the one case leave -- that of hedvig -- be the only one in which ibsen can possibly be accuse of wanton bloodshed björnson in a very moving passage in he novel _ the path of god _ do actually though indirectly make that accusation certainly there be no more heartrending incident in fiction and certainly it be a thing that only consummate genius can justify ibsen happen to possess that genius and i be not far from agree with those who hold _ the wild duck _ to be he greatest work but for playwright who be tempt to seek for effect of pathos by similar means one may without hesitation lay down this maxim : be sure you be a ibsen before you kill you hedvig this analysis of ibsen 's practice point to the fact -- for such i believe it to be -- that what the modern playwright have chiefly to guard against be the temptation to overdo suicide as a means of cut the dramatic knot in france and germany there be another temptation that of the duel -lrb- 3 -rrb- but in anglo-saxon country it scarcely present itself death other than self-inflicted be much less tempting and less apt to be resort to in and out of season the heroine whether virtuous or err who die of consumption have go greatly out of vogue a broken heart be no longer hold to be necessarily fatal the veriest tyro realize that death by crude accident be inadmissible as a determine factor in serious drama and murder be practically -lrb- though not absolutely -rrb- relegate to the melodramatic domain the one urgent question then be that of the artistic use and abuse of suicide the principle be pretty plain i think that it ought to be the artist 's as it be the man 's last resort we know that in most civilized country suicide be greatly on the increase it can not be call a infrequent incident in daily life it be certain too that the motive impel to it be apt to be of a dramatic nature and therefore suit to the playwright 's purpose but it be on the other hand such a crude and unreasoning means of exit from the tangle of existence that a playwright of delicate instinct will certainly employ it only under the strongest compulsion from he artistic conscience sir arthur pinero have three suicide on he record though one of they be so to speak nipped in the bud in _ the profligate _ as present on the stage dunstan renshaw change he mind before drain the fatal goblet and in this case the stage version be surely the right one the suicide to which the author still cling in the print text practically date the play as belong to the above-mentioned period of rebellion against the conventional happy end when the ambitious british dramatist feel that honor require he to kill he man on the smallest provocation -lrb- 4 -rrb- nearly a quarter of a century have pass since then and the disproportion between such a play and such a catastrophe be now apparent to everyone it be not that we judge renshaw 's delinquency to be over-punish by death -- that be not the question the fact be simply that the character be not large enough true enough live enough -- that the play do not probe deep enough into human experience -- to make the August intervention of death seem other than a incongruity the suicide of paulum tanqueray though it too have be much criticize be a very different matter inevitable it can not be call : if the play have be write within the past ten year sir arthur would very likely have contrived to do without it but it be in itself probable enough : both the good and the bad in paulum 's character might easily make she feel that only the dregs of life remain to she and they not worth drink the worst one can say of it be that it sin against the canon of practical convenience which enjoin on the prudent dramatist strict economy in suicide the third case zoe blundell 's leap to nothingness in that harsh and ruthless masterpiece _ mid-channel _ be as inevitable as anything can well be in human destiny zoe have make a miserable and hopeless muddle of she life in spite of she goodness of heart she have no interest and no ideal apart from the personal satisfaction which have now be poison at they source she have intervene disastrously in the destiny of other she be ill she nerve be all on edge and she be as it be drive into a corner from which there be but one easy and rapid exit here be a case if ever there be one where the end be impose upon the artist by the whole drift of he action it may be say that chance play a large part in the concatenation of event -- that for instance if leonard ferris have not happen to live at the top of a very high building zoe would not have encounter the sudden temptation to which she yield but this as i have try to show above be a baseless complaint chance be a constant factor in life now aid now thwart the will to eliminate it altogether would be to produce a most unlifelike world it be only when the playwright so manipulate and reduplicate chance as to make it seem no longer chance but purposeful arrangement that we have the right to protest another instance of indisputably justified suicide may be find in mr galsworthy 's _ justice _ the whole theme of the play be nothing but the hound to he end of a luckless youth who have get on the wrong side of the law and find all the force of society league against he in mr granville barker 's _ waste _ the artistic justification for trebell 's self-effacement be less clear and compulsive it be true that the play be suggest by the actual suicide not of a politician but of a soldier who find he career ruin by some pitiful scandal but the author have make no attempt to reproduce the actual circumstance of that case and even if he have reproduce the external circumstance the psychological condition would clearly have elude he thus the appeal to fact be as it always must be bar in two case indeed much more closely analogous to trebell 's than that which actually suggest it -- two famous case in which a scandal cut short a brilliant political career -- suicide play no part in the catastrophe these real-life instance be i repeat irrelevant the only question be whether mr barker have make we feel that a man of trebell 's character would certainly not survive the paralysing of he energy and that question every spectator must answer for himself i be far from answer it in the negative i merely suggest that the playwright may one day come across a theme for which there be no conceivable end but suicide and may wish that he have let trebell live lest people should come to regard he as a spendthrift of self-slaughter the suicide which bring to a close mr clyde fitch 's very able play _ the climber _ stand on a somewhat different level here it be not the protagonist who make away with himself nor be he destiny the main theme of the play mr fitch have paint a broad social picture in which if there be any concentration of interest it be upon blanche and warden sterling 's suicide then though it do in fact cut the chief knot of the play be to be regard rather as a characteristic and probable incident of a certain phase of life than as the culmination of a spiritual tragedy it have not the artistic significance either good or bad that it would have if the character and destiny of sterling be we main concernment \* \* \* \* \* the happy playwright one may say be he whose theme do not force upon he either a sanguinary or a tame last act but enable he without trouble the coroner to sustain and increase the tension up to the very close such theme be not too common but they do occur duma find one in _ denise _ and another in _ francillon _ where the famous il en a mentus come within two minute of the fall of the curtain in _ heimat _ -lrb- magda -rrb- and in _ johannisfeuer _ sudermann keep the tension at its height up to the fall of the curtain sir arthur pinero 's _ iri _ be a case in point so be mr shaw 's _ candida _ and _ the devil 's disciple _ so be mr galsworthy 's _ strife _ other instance will no doubt occur to the reader yet he will probably be surprise to find that it be not very easy to recall they for this be not in fact the typical modern formulum in play which do not end in death it will generally be find that the culminate scene occur in the penultimate act and that if anticlimax be avoid it be not by the maintenance of a unbroken tension by its skilful renewal and reinforcement in the last act this be a resource which the playwright will do well to bear in mind where he can not place he great scene in he last act he should always consider whether it be not possible to hold some development in reserve whereby the tension may be screw up again -- if unexpectedly so much the better some of the most successful play within my recollection have be those in which the last act come upon we as a pleasant surprise a anticlimax have seem inevitable and behold the author have find a way out of it _ a enemy of the people _ may perhaps be place in this class though as before remark the last act be almost a independent comedy have the play end with the fourth act no one would have feel that anything be lack so that in he fifth act ibsen be not so much grapple with a urgent technical problem as amusing himself by wring the last drop of humor out of the give situation a more strictly apposite example may be find in sir arthur pinero 's play _ he house in order _ here the action undoubtedly culminate in the great scene between nina and hilary jesson in the third act yet we await with eager anticipation the discomfiture of the ridgeley family and when we realize that it be to be bring about by the disclosure to filmer of annabel 's secret the manifest rightness of the proceeding give we a little shock of pleasure mr somerset maugham again in the last act of _ grace _ employ a ingenious device to keep the tension at a high pitch the matter of the act consist mainly of a debate as to whether grace insole ought or ought not to make a certain painful avowal to she husband as the negative opinion be to carry the day mr maugham see that there be grave danger that the final scene might appear a almost ludicrous anticlimax to obviate this he make grace at the beginning of the act write a letter of confession and address it to claude so that all through the discussion we have at the back of we mind the question will the letter reach he hand will the sword of damocle fall this may seem like a leaf from the book of sardou but in reality it be a perfectly natural and justified expedient it keep the tension alive throughout a scene of ethical discussion interesting in itself but pretty clearly destine to lead up to the undramatic alternative -- a policy of silence and inaction mr clyde fitch in the last act of _ the truth _ make a elaborate and daring endeavor to relieve the mawkishness of the clearly-foreseen reconciliation between warder and becky he let becky fall in with she father 's mad idea of work upon warder 's compassion by pretend that she have try to kill herself only at the last moment do she abandon the sordid comedy and so prove herself -lrb- as we be ask to suppose -rrb- cure for ever of the habit of fib mr fitch here show good technical insight mar by over-hasty execution that becky should be tempt to employ she old method and should overcome the temptation be entirely right but the actual deception attempt be so crude and hopeless that there be no plausibility in she consent to it and no merit in she desist from it in light comedy and farce it be even more desirable than in serious drama to avoid a tame and perfunctory last act very often a seemingly trivial invention will work wonder in keep the interest afoot in mr anstey 's delightful farce _ the brass bottle _ one look forward rather dolefully to a flat conclusion but by the simple device of let the jinny omit to include pringle in he act of oblivion the author be enable to make he last scene quite as amusing as any of its predecessor mr arnold bennett in _ the honeymoon _ have the audacity to play a deliberate trick on the audience in order to evade a anticlimax see that he third act could not at best be very good he purposely put the audience on a false scent make it expect a absolutely commonplace end -lrb- the marriage of flora to charle haslam -rrb- and then substitute one which if not very brilliant be at least ingenious and unforeseen thus by defeat the expectation of a superlatively bad act he make a positively insignificant act seem comparatively good such feat of craftsmanship be entertaining but too dangerous to be commend for imitation in some modern play a full close be achieve by the simple expedient of altogether omit the last act or last scene and leave the end of the play to the imagination this method be boldly and -lrb- i understand -rrb- successfully employ by mr edward sheldon in he powerful play _ the nigger _ philip morrow the popular governor of one of the southern state have learn that he grandmother be a quadroon and that consequently he have in he a much-attenuated strain of african blood in the southern state attenuation matter nothing : if the remotest filament of a man 's ancestry run back to africa he be a nigger all right philip have just suppress a race-riot in the city and from the balcony of the state capitol be to address the troops who have aid he and the assemble multitude have resolutely part from the woman he adore but can no longer marry he step out upon the balcony to announce that he be a negro that he resign the governorship and that henceforth he cast in he lot with he black brethren the stage-direction run thus -- the afternoon sun strike he figure at he appearance a shout go up -- long steady enthusiastic cheer and after a moment the big regimental band begin play very slowly my country ` ti of thee all the people in the room be smile and applaud enthusiastically and -- as phil in vain raise he hand for silence and the band crash through the national anthem and the roar of voice still rise from below -- the curtain fall one do not know whether to praise mr sheldon for have adroitly avoid a anticlimax or to reproach he with have unblushingly shirk a difficulty to my sense the play have somewhat the air of a hexameter line with the spondee cut off -lrb- 5 -rrb- one _ do _ want to see the peripety through but if the audience be content to imagine the sequel mr sheldon 's craftsmanship be justified and there be no more to be say m brieux experience some difficulty in bring he early play _ blanchette _ to a satisfactory close the third act which he originally write be find unendurably cynical a more agreeable third act be condemn as a anticlimax and for some time the play be present with no third act at all it do not end but simply leave off no doubt it be better that a play should stop in the middle than that it should drag on tediously and ineffectually but it would be foolish to make a system of such a expedient it be after all a evasion not a solution of the artist 's problem a incident which occur during the rehearsal for the first production of _ a doll 's house _ at the novelty theater london illustrate the difference between the old and what be then the new fashion of end a play the business manager of the company a man of ripe theatrical experience happen to be present one day when miss achurch and mr waring be rehearse the last great scene between nora and helmar at the end of it he come up to I in a state of high excitement this be a fine play he say this be sure to be a big thing i be greatly pleased if this scene of all other i thought carry a man like mr smith off he foot it can not fail to hold the british public but i be somewhat dash when a day or two later mr smith come up to I again in much less buoyant spirit i make a mistake about that scene he say they tell I it be the end of the _ last _ act -- i think it be the end of the _ first _ \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : the reader who wish to pursue the theme may do so to excellent advantage in professor bradley 's _ shakespearean tragedy _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : it be true that in _ a doll 's house _ dr rank announce he approach demise : but he do not actually die nor be he fate a essential part of the action of the play -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : the duel even in country whose custom permit of it be essentially a inartistic end for it leave the catastrophe to be decide either by chance or providence -- two equally inadmissible arbiter in modern drama alexandre duma _ fil _ in he preface to _ héloïse paranquet _ condemn the duel as a dramatic expedient not to mention he say the fact that it have be much over-done we be bind to recognize that providence in a fit of absence of mind sometimes suffer the rascal to kill the honest man let I recommend my young colleague he proceed never to end a piece which pretend to reproduce a phase of real life by a intervention of chance the recommendation come rather oddly from the dramatist who in _ l'etrangère _ have dispose of he vibrion the duc de septmont by make clarkson kill he in a duel perhaps he do not reckon _ l'etrangère _ as pretend to reproduce a phase of real life a duel be of course perfectly admissible in a french or german play simply as part of a picture of manners its stupid inconclusiveness may be the very point to be illustrate it be only when represent as a moral arbitrament that it become a anachronism -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : i be glad to see from mr malcolm salaman 's introduction to the print play that even in those day of we hot youth my own aesthetic principle be less truculent -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : this image be sometimes suggest by a act-ending which leave a marked situation obviously unresolved the curtain should never be drop at such a point as to leave the character in a physical or mental attitude which can not last for more than a moment and must certainly be follow then and there by important development in other word a situation ought not to be cut short at the very height of its tension but only when it have reach a point of -- at any rate momentary -- relaxation -rrb- _ book v _ epilogue _ chapter xxii _ character and psychology for the invention and order of incident it be possible if not to lay down rule at any rate to make plausible recommendation but the power to observe to penetrate and to reproduce character can neither be acquire nor regulate by theoretical recommendation indirectly of course all the technical discussion of the previous chapter tend or ought to tend towards the effective presentment of character for construction in drama of any intellectual quality have no other end but specific direction for character-drawing would be like rule for become six foot high either you have it in you or you have it not under the head of character however two point arise which may be worth a brief discussion : first ought we always to aim at development in character second what do we or ought we to mean by psychology it be a frequent critical complaint that in such-and-such a character there be no development : that it remain the same throughout a play or -lrb- so the reproach be sometimes word -rrb- that it be not a character but a invariable attitude a little examination will show we i think that though the critic may in these case be point to a real fault he do not express himself quite accurately what be character for the practical purpose of the dramatist it may be define as a complex of intellectual emotional and nervous habit some of these habit be innate and temperamental -- habit form no doubt by far-off ancestor -lrb- 1 -rrb- but this distinction do not here concern we temperamental bias be a habit like another only somewhat older and therefore harder to deflect or eradicate what do we imply then when we complain that in a give character no development have take place we imply that he ought within the limit of the play to have alter the mental habit underlie he speech and action but be this a reasonable demand be it consistent with the usual and desirable time-limit of drama in the long process of a novel there may be time for the gradual alteration of habit : in the drama which normally consist of a single crisis any real change of character would have to be of a catastrophic nature in which experience do not encourage we to put much faith it be indeed -- as dryden point out in a passage quote above -lrb- 2 -rrb- -- one of the foible of we easy-going ancestor to treat character as practically reversible when the time approach for ring down the curtain the same convention survive to this day in certain form of drama even ibsen in he earlier work have not shake it off witness the sudden ennoblement of bernick in _ pillar of society _ but it can scarcely be that sort of development which the critic consider indispensable what be it then that they have in mind by development of character i think they mean not change but rather unveil disclosure they hold not unreasonably that a dramatic crisis ought to disclose latent quality in the person chiefly concern in it and involve not indeed a change but as it be a exhaustive manifestation of character the interest of the highest order of drama should consist in the reaction of character to a series of crucial experience we should at the end of a play know more of the protagonist 's character than he himself or he most intimate friend could know at the beginning for the action should have be such as to put it to some novel and search test the word development might be very aptly use in the photographic sense a drama ought to bring out character as the photographer 's chemical bring out the form latent in the negative but this be quite a different thing from development in the sense of growth or radical change in all modern drama there be perhaps no character who develop in the ordinary sense of the word so startlingly as ibsen 's nora and we can not but feel that the poet have compress into a week a evolution which in fact would have demand many month the complaint that a character preserve the same attitude throughout means -lrb- if it be justified -rrb- that it be not a human be at all but a mere embodiment of two or three characteristic which be fully display within the first ten minute and then keep on repeat themselves like a recurrent decimal strong theatrical effect can be produce by this method which be that of the comedy of type or of humor but it be now generally and rightly hold that a character should be primarily a individual and only incidentally -lrb- if at all -rrb- capable of classification under this type or that it be a little surprising to find sarcey so recently as 1889 lay it down that a character be a master faculty or passion which absorb all the rest to study and paint a character be therefore by place a man in a certain number of situation to show how this principal motive force in he nature annihilate or direct all those which if he have be another man would probably have come into action this dogma of the ruling passion belong rather to the eighteenth century than to the close of the nineteenth \* \* \* \* \* we come now to the second of the question above propound which i will state more definitely in this form : be psychology simply a more pedantic term for character-drawing or can we establish a distinction between the two idea i do not think that as a matter of fact any difference be generally and clearly recognize but i suggest that it be possible to draw a distinction which might if accept prove serviceable both to critic and to playwright let I illustrate my meaning by a example in _ bellum donna _ by messr robert hichen and jame b fagan we have a murder-story of a not uncommon or improbable type a woman of very shady reputation marry a amiable idealist who be infatuate with she she naturally find he idealism incomprehensible and he amiability tedious he position as heir-presumptive to a peerage be shatter by the birth of a heir-apparent she become passionately enamoured of a egyptian millionaire and she set to work to poison she husband with sugar-of-lead provide by she oriental lover how she criminal purpose be thwart by a wise jewish physician be nothing to the present purpose in intent she be a murderess no less than lucrezium borgium or the marquise de brinvillier and the author have draw she character cleverly enough they have show she in the first act as a shallow-souled materialist and in the later act as a vain irritable sensual unscrupulous creature but have they give we any insight into she psychology no that be just what they have not do they have assign to she certain characteristic without which cruel and cold-blooded murder would be inconceivable but they have afford we no insight into the moral condition and mental process which make it not only conceivable but almost a everyday occurrence for the average human mind i suppose the psychology of crime and especially of fiendish hypocritical murder-by-inch have a undeniable fascination to most of we it seem a abhorrent miracle and it would interest we greatly to have it bring more or less within the range of we comprehension and co-ordinate with other mental phenomenon which we can and do understand but of such illumination we find nothing in _ bellum donna _ it leave the working of a poisoner 's mind as dark to we as ever so far as that go we might just as well have read the report of a murder-trial wherein the fact be state with perhaps some superficial speculation as to motive but no attempt be make to penetrate to underlie soul-state yet this be surely the highest privilege of art -- to take we behind and beneath those surface of thing which be apparent to the detective and the reporter the juryman and the judge have we not here then the distinction between character-drawing and psychology character-drawing be the presentment of human nature in its commonly-recognized understand and accept aspect psychology be as it be the exploration of character the bringing of hitherto unsurveyed tract within the circle of we knowledge and comprehension in other word character-drawing be synthetic psychology analytic this do not mean that the one be necessarily inferior to the other some of the greatest masterpiece of creative art have be achieve by the synthesis of known element falstaff for example -- there be no more brilliant or more living character in all fiction yet it be impossible to say that shakespeare have here take we into previously unplumbed depths of human nature as he have in hamlet or in lear no doubt it be often very hard to decide whether a give personage be a mere projection of the known or a divination of the unknown what be we to say for example of cleopatra or of shylock or of macbeth richard ii on the other hand be as clearly a piece of psychology as the nurse in _ romeo and juliet _ be a piece of character-draw the comedy of type necessarily tend to keep within the limit of the known and molière -- in spite of alceste and don juan -- be characteristically a character-drawer as racine be characteristically a psychologist ibsen be a psychologist or he be nothing earl skule and bishop nichola hedda gabler and john gabriel borkman be daring exploration of hitherto uncharted region of the human soul but ibsen too be a character-drawer when it suit he one be tempt to say that there be no psychology in brand -- he be a mere incarnation of intransigent idealism -- while peer gynt be as brilliant a psychological inspiration as don quixote dr stockmann be a vigorously-projected character hialmar ekdal a piece of search psychology finally my point could scarcely be better illustrated than by a comparison -- cruel but instructive -- between rebecca in _ rosmersholm _ and the heroine in _ bellum donna _ each be in effect a murderess though it be a moral not a mineral poison that rebecca employ but while we know nothing whatever of mr armine 's mental process rebecca 's temptation struggle sophistry hesitation resolve and revulsion of feeling be all lay bare to we so that we feel she to be no monster but a living woman comprehensible to we intelligence and however blameworthy not wholly beyond the range of we sympathy there be few greater achievement of psychology among the playwright of to-day i should call mr granville barker above all thing a psychologist it be he instinct to venture into untrodden field of character or at any rate to probe deeply into phenomenon which other have note but superficially if at all hence the occasional obscurity of he dialogue mr shaw be not primarily either a character-drawer or a psychologist but a dealer in personified idea he lead figure be as a rule either he mouthpiece or he butt when he give we a piece of real character-drawing it be generally in some subordinate personage mr galsworthy i should say show himself a psychologist in _ strife _ a character-drawer in _ the silver box _ and _ justice _ sir arthur pinero a character-drawer of great versatility become a psychologist in some of he study of feminine type -- in iris in letty in the luckless heroine of _ mid-channel _ mr clyde fitch have at least laudable ambition in the direction of psychology becky in _ the truth _ and jinny in _ the girl with the green eye _ in so far as they be successfully draw really do mean a certain advance on we knowledge of feminine human nature unfortunately owe to the author 's over-facile and over-hasty method of work they be now and then a little out of draw the most striking piece of psychology know to I in american drama be the faith healer in william vaughn moody 's drama of that name if the last act of _ the faith healer _ be as good as the rest of it one might safely call it the finest play ever write at any rate in the english language beyond the atlantic the psychologist of the modern french stage i take it be m de curel and m de porto-riche mm brieux and hervieu be like mr shaw too much concern with idea to probe very deep into character in germany hauptmann and so far as i understand he wedekind be psychologist sudermann a vigorous character-drawer it be pretty clear that if this distinction be accept it would be of use to the critic inasmuch as we should have two term for two idea instead of one popular term with a rather pedantic synonym but what would be its practical use to the artist the craftsman simply this that if the word psychology take on for he a clear and definite meaning it might stimulate at once he imagination and he ambition messr hichen and fagan for example might have ask themselves -- or each other -- be we get beneath the surface of this woman 's nature be we pluck the heart out of she mystery can not we make the specific process of a murderess 's mind clearer to ourselves and to we audience whether they would have be capable of rise to the opportunity i can not tell but in the case of other author one not infrequently feel : this man could have take we deeper into this problem if he have only think of it i do not for a moment mean that every serious dramatist should always be aim at psychological exploration the character-drawer 's appeal to common knowledge and instant recognition be often all that be require or that would be in place but there be also occasion not a few when the dramatist show himself unequal to he opportunity if he do not at least attempt to bring hitherto unrecorded or unscrutinized phase of character within the scope of we understanding and we sympathy \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : if this run counter to the latest biological orthodoxy i be sorry habit be at any rate transmissible by imitation if not otherwise -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : chapter xix -rrb- _ chapter xxiii _ dialogue and detail the extraordinary progress make by the drama of the english language during the past quarter of a century be in nothing more apparent than in the average quality of modern dialogue tolerably well-written dialogue be nowadays the rule rather than the exception thirty year ago the idea that it be possible to combine naturalness with vivacity and vigor have scarcely dawn upon the playwright 's mind he pass and repass from stilted pathos to strained and verbal wit -lrb- often mere punning -rrb- and when a reformer like tw robertson try to come a little nearer to the truth of life he be apt to fall into babyish simplicity or flat commonness criticism have not give sufficient weight to the fact that english dramatic writing labor for century -- and still labor to some degree -- under a historic misfortune it have never wholly recover from the euphuism -- to use the word in its widest sense -- of the late sixteenth century the influence of john lyly and he tribe be still traceable despite a hundred metamorphosis in some of the play of to-day and in many of the play of yesterday from the very beginning of english comedy it be accept as almost self-evident that wit -- a factitious supererogatory sparkle -- be indispensable to all dialogue of a non-tragic order language be a newly discover and irresistibly fascinating playground for the fancy conversation must be thick-strewn with verbal quibble simile figure and flourish of every description else it be unworthy to be speak on the stage we all know how freely shakespeare yield to this convention and so help to establish it sometimes not always he genius enable he to render it delightful but in most of the elizabethan -- though it be heresy to say so -- it be a extremely tedious mannerism after the restoration when modern light talk come into be in the coffee-house the fashion of the day no doubt favor a strain after wit so that the playwright be in some measure follow nature -- that very small corner of nature which they call the town -- in accept and make a law of the elizabethan convention the lead character of restoration comedy from etherege to vanbrugh be consciously and almost professionally wit simile and repartee be as indispensable a part of a gentleman 's social outfit as he wig or he rapier in congreve the word wit be almost as common as the thing when farquhar make some movement towards a return to nature he be reward with pope 's line which cling like a burr to he memory -- what pert low dialogue have farquhar writ if eighteenth-century comedy as a whole be not brilliantly write it be for lack of talent in the playwright not for lack of desire or intention goldsmith like farquhar and steele vaguely realize the superiority of humor to wit but he die too early to exercise much influence on he successor in sheridan the convention of wit reassert itself triumphantly and the scene in which lady teazle mr candor and the rest of the scandalous college sit in a semicircle and cap malicious simile come to be regard as a unapproachable model of comedy dialogue the convention maintain itself firmly down to the day of _ money _ and _ london assurance _ the dullness of the intervene period be due not to any change of theory but to sheer impotence of practice tw robertson as above mention attempt a return to nature with occasional and very partial success but wit with a dash of fanciful sentiment reassert itself in jame albery while in hj byron it degenerate into mere punning and verbal horse-play i should not be surprise if the historian of the future be to find in the play of mr henry arthur jone the first marked symptom of a reaction -- of a tendency to reject extrinsic and fanciful ornament in dialogue and to rely for its effect upon its vivid appropriateness to character and situation in the early play of sir arthur pinero there be a great deal of extrinsic ornament especially of that metaphor-hunting which be one of the characteristic form of euphuism take this for example from _ the profligate _ dunstan renshaw have express to hugh murray the opinion that marriage of contentment be the reward of husband who have take the precaution to sow they wild oats rather thickly whereupon the scotch solicitor reply -- hugh murray : contentment renshaw do you imagine that there be no autumn in the life of a profligate do you think there be no moment when the accursed crop begin to rear its million of head above ground when the rich man would give he wealth to be able to tread they back into the earth which reject the foul load to-day you have rob some honest man of a sweet companion dunstan renshaw : look here mr murray -- hugh murray : to-morrow next week next month you may be happy -- but what of the time when those wild oats thrust they ear through the very seam of the floor trodden by the wife whose respect you will have learn to covet you may drag she into the crowded street -- there be the same vile growth spring up from the chink of the pavement in you house or in the open the scent of the mildewed grain always in you nostril and in you ear no music but the wind 's rustle amongst the fat sheaf and worst of all you wife 's heart a granary burst with the load of shame you profligacy have store there i warn you -- mr lawrence kenward if we compare this passage with any page take at random from _ mid-channel _ we might think that a century of evolution lay between they instead of barely twenty year the convention of wit-at-any-price be indeed moribund but it be perhaps not quite superfluous even now to emphasize the difference between what the french call the mot d'auteur and the mot de situation the term practically explain themselves but a third class ought to be add -- the mot de caractère the mot d'auteur be the distinguishing mark of the congreve-sheridan convention it survive in full vigor -- or shall one say it sing its swan-song -- in the work of oscar wilde for instance the scene of the five man in the third act of _ lady windermere 's fan _ be a veritable running-fire of epigram wholly unconnected with the situation and very slightly related if at all to the character of the speaker the mark of the mot d'auteur be that it can with perfect ease be detach from its context i could fill this page with saying from the scene in question all perfectly comprehensible without any account of the situation among they would be one of those profound saying which wilde now and then throw off in he lightest mood like opal among soap-bubble in the world say dumby there be two tragedy one be not get what one want and the other be get it this may rank with lord illingworth 's speech in _ a woman of no importance _ : all thought be immoral its very essence be destruction if you think of anything you kill it nothing survive be think of when we hear such saying as these -- or the immortal vulgarity be the behavior of other people -- we do not enquire too curiously into they appropriateness to character or situation but none the less do they belong to a antiquated conception of drama it be useless to begin to give specimen of the mot de caractère and mot de situation all really dramatic dialogue fall under one head or the other one could easily pick out a few brilliantly effective example of each class : but as they characteristic be to fade when uproot from the soil in which they grow they would take up space to very little purpose but there be another historic influence besides that of euphuism which have be hurtful though in a minor degree to the development of a sound style in dialogue some of the later elizabethan and notably webster and ford cultivate a fashion of abrupt utterance whereby a immensity of spiritual significance -- generally tragic -- be suppose to be concentrate into a few brief word the classic example be ferdinand 's cover she face mine eye dazzle she die young in _ the duchess of malfy _ charle lamb celebrate the virtue of this pregnant staccato style with somewhat immoderate admiration and thus help to set a fashion of spasmodic pithiness in dialogue which too often result in dense obscurity not many play compose under this influence have reach the stage not one have hold it but we find in some recent write a qualify recrudescence of the spasmodic manner with a touch of euphuism throw in this be mainly due i think to the influence of george meredith who accept the convention of wit as the inform spirit of comedy dialogue and whose abnormally rapid faculty of association lead he to delight in a sort of intellectual shorthand which the normal mind find very difficult to decipher meredith be a man of brilliant genius which lend a fascination to he very mannerism but when these mannerism be transfer by lesser man to a medium much less suit to they -- that of the stage -- the result be apt to be disastrous i need not go into particulars for no play of which the dialogue place a constant strain on the intellectual muscle of the audience ever have hold or ever will hold a place in live dramatic literature i will merely note the curious fact that english -- my own language -- be the only language out of the three or four know to I in which i have ever come across a entirely incomprehensible play i could name english play both pre-meredithian and post-meredithian which might almost as well be write in chinese for all that i can make of they obscurity and precocity be generally symptom of a exaggerated dread of the commonplace the writer of dramatic prose have indeed a very difficult task if he be to achieve style without desert nature perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the difficulty lie in get criticism to give he credit for the possession of style without incur the reproach of mannerism how be one to give concentration and distinction to ordinary talk while make it still seem ordinary either the distinction will strike the critic and they will call it pompous and unreal or the ordinariness will come home to they and they will deny the distinction this be the dramatist 's constant dilemma one can only comfort he with the assurance that if he have give he dialogue the necessary concentration and have yet keep it plausibly near to the language of life he have achieve style and may snap he finger at the critic style in prose drama be the sifting of common speech it be true however that with equal concentration and equal naturalness one man may give he work a beauty of cadence and phrasing which another man may entirely miss two recent writer of english dramatic prose have stand out from they fellow in respect of the sheer beauty of they style -- i need scarcely name oscar wilde and jm synge but wilde 's dialogue can by no means be call free from mannerism -lrb- 1 -rrb- while synge write in a language which have a music of its own even before he genius take hold of it it do not seem very profitable to try to concentrate into a definition the distinctive quality of dramatic dialogue the late mr craigie -lrb- john oliver hobbe -rrb- attempt to do so in the preface to a charming play _ the ambassador _ and the result at any rate the sequel -- be that she next play _ the wisdom of the wise _ be singularly self-conscious and artificial she find in emotion the test of dramatic quality in any give utterance stage dialogue she say may or may not have many quality but it must be emotional here we have a statement which be true in a vague and general sense untrue in the definite and particular sense in which alone it could afford any practical guidance my lord the carriage wait may be in its right place a highly dramatic speech even though it be utter with no emotion and arouse no emotion in the person address what mr craigie mean i take it be that to be really dramatic every speech must have some bearing direct or indirect prospective present or retrospective upon individual human destiny the dull play the dull scene the dull speech be that in which we do not perceive this connection but when once we be interested in the individual concern we be so quick to perceive the connection even though it be exceedingly distant and indirect that the dramatist who should always hold the fear of mr craigie 's aphorism consciously before he eye would unnecessarily fetter and restrict himself even the driest scientific proposition may under special circumstance become electrical with drama the statement that the earth move round the sun do not in itself stir we pulse yet what playwright have ever invent a more dramatic utterance than that which some one invent for galileo : e pur si muove in all this to be sure i be illustrate not confute mr craigie 's maxim i have no wish to confute it for in the largest interpretation it be true but i suggest that it be true only when attenuate almost beyond recognition and quite beyond the point at which it can be of any practical help to the practical dramatist he must rely on he instinct not numb and bewilder it by constantly subject it to the dictate of hard-and-fast aesthetic theory we shall scarcely come much nearer to helpful truth than the point we have already reach in the principle that all dialogue except the merely mechanical part -- the connective tissue of the play -- should consist either of mots de caractère or of mots de situation but if we go to french critic for this principle do not let we go to french dramatist for model of practice it be part of the abide insularity of we criticism that the same writer who can not forgive a english dramatist what they conceive to be a stilted turn of phrase will pass without remark if not with positive admiration the outrageously rhetorical style which be still prevalent in french drama here for instance be a quite typical passage from _ le duel _ by m henrus lavedan a author of no small repute and it would be easy to find even more magniloquent tirade in the work of almost any of he contemporary i translate from the conclude scene between the abbé and the duchess : the abbé : in we strange life there be sometimes unexpected and decisive moment sovereign though we know not why we feel it that be all -- fulgurant moment which throw as it be a flash of lightning upon we destiny like those meteor which shine forth from time to time in the heaven and of which none can say what they purple signify whether it be a cataclysm or a apotheosis well it appear to I that we you and i be now face to face with one of these moment the duchess : so i too believe the abbé : we must take care then that it be a apotheosis that be why i want -- mon dieu madame how shall i say it to you where shall i go to find the choose word the word of pure gold of diamond the immaculate word that be worthy of we all that you be all that you be worth i know and i alone know you have open that i might read it the book of hour that be you mind i be in no wise disquieted about you or you future yet that i may be fully reassure before we part i wish i wish you to tell I to declare to I that you be at this very moment in absolute repose calm as a lake and so monsieur l'abbé go on for another page if it be say that this ornate eloquence be merely professional i reply that he brother the atheist doctor and the duchess herself be quite as copious in they rhetoric and scarcely less ornate it be a mistake to suppose that literary merit can be impart to drama by such flagrant departure from nature though some critic have not yet outgrow that superstition let the playwright take to heart a anecdote tell by professor matthew in he _ inquiry and opinion _ -- a anecdote of a new england farmer who be ask who be the architect of he house reply : oh i build that house myself but there be a man come down from boston next week to put on the architecture better no style at all than style thus plaster on \* \* \* \* \* what be to be say of the possibility of blank verse as a dramatic medium this be a thorny question to be handle with caution one can say with perfect assurance however that its possibility be problematical its difficulty and danger certain to discuss the question whether drama in verse be in its very nature nobler than drama in prose would lead we away from craftsmanship into the realm of pure aesthetics for my own part i doubt it i suspect that the drama like all literature take its rise in verse for the simple reason that verse be easier to make -- and to memorize -- than prose primitive people feel with goethe -- though not quite in the same sense -- that art be art because it be not nature not merely for emotional but for all sort of literary expression they demand a medium clearly mark off from the speech of everyday life the drama lisp in number for the number come even of so modern a writer -lrb- comparatively -rrb- as shakespeare it would scarcely be true to say that he choose verse as he medium in the same sense in which ibsen choose prose he accept it just as he accept the other tradition and method of the theater of he time in familiar passage he break away from it but on the whole it provide -lrb- among other advantage -rrb- a convenient and even necessary means of differentiation between the mimic personage and the audience from whom he be not mark off by the proscenium arch and the artificial light which make a world apart of the modern stage and shakespeare so glorified this metrical medium as to give it a overwhelming prestige it be extremely easy to write blank verse after a fashion and playwright who find it flow almost spontaneously from they pen be only too ready to overlook the world-wide difference between they verse and that of the really great elizabethan just after the restoration there be a attempt to introduce the rhymed couplet as the medium for heroic play but that on the other hand be too difficult to establish itself in general use tragedy soon fall back upon the fatally facile unrhymed iambic and a reign of stilted stodgy mediocrity set in there be nothing drearier in literature than the century-and-a-half of english tragedy from otway to sheridan knowle one be lose in wonder at the genius of the actor who could infuse life and passion into those masterpiece of turgid conventionality the worship of the minor elizabethan which begin with lamb and culminate in swinburne bring into fashion -lrb- as we have see -rrb- a spasmodic rather than a smoothly rhetorical way of write but do not really put new life into the outworn form it may almost be call a appalling fact that for at least two century -- from 1700 to 1900 -- not a single blank-verse play be produce which live or deserve to live -lrb- 2 -rrb- on the stage of to-day i have thus glance at the history of the blank-verse play because i believe that it can never revive until we clearly realize and admit that it be and have be for a century thoroughly dead while for a century before that again it be only galvanized into a semblance of life by a great school of rhetorical act the playwright who set forth with the idea that in write a poetical drama he be go to continue the great elizabethan tradition be start on a wild-goose chase the great elizabethan tradition be a incubus to be exorcise it be because mr stephen phillip be not elizabethanize but clothing a vital and personal conception of drama in verse of very appealing lyrical quality that some of we think we see in _ paolo and francesca _ the dawn of a new art apparently it be a false dawn but i still believe that we orientation be right when we look for the daybreak in the lyric quarter of the heaven the very summit of shakespeare 's achievement be he glorious lyrical passage think of the exquisite elegiac of macbeth think of the immortal death-song of cleopatra if verse have any function on the stage it be that of impart lyric beauty to passionate speech for the mere rhetorical elevation of blank verse we have no use whatever it consist in say simple thing with verbose pomposity but should there arise a man who combine highly-developed dramatic faculty with great lyric genius it be quite possible that he may give we the new poetic drama for which we idealist be sigh he will choose he theme i take it from legend or from the domain of pure fantasy -- theme which can be steep from first to last in a atmosphere of poetry as _ tristan und isolde _ be steep in a atmosphere of music of historic theme i would counsel this hypothetical genius to beware if there be any which can fittingly be steep in a lyric atmosphere they be to be seek on the outskirts of history or in the debatable land between history and legend the formulum of schiller can no more be revive than the formulum of chapman or of rowe that a new historic drama await we in the future i have little doubt but it will be write in prose the idea that the poetry of drama be to be seek specifically in verse have long ago be explode by ibsen and maeterlinck and d'annunzio and synge but there be no doubt theme which peculiarly lend themselves to lyrico-dramatic treatment and we shall all welcome the poet who discover and develop they one warn let I add in no uncertain voice if you choose to write a blank-verse play write it in blank verse and not in some nondescript rhythm which be one long series of jolt and pitfall to the sensitive ear many playwright have think by this mean to escape from the monotony of blank verse not one -lrb- that i ever hear of -rrb- have achieve even temporary success if you can not save you blank verse from monotony without break it on the wheel that merely mean that you can not write blank verse and have better let it alone again in spite of elizabethan precedent there be nothing more irritating on the modern stage than a play which keep on change from verse to prose and back again it give the verse-passage a air of pompous self-consciousness we seem to hear the author say as he shift he gear look you now i be go to be eloquent and impressive the most destructive fault a dramatist can commit in my judgment be to pass in the same work of art from one plane of convention to another -lrb- 3 -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* we must now consider for a moment the question -- if question it can be call -- of the soliloquy and the aside the example of ibsen have go far towards expel these slovenliness from the work of all self-respecting playwright but theorist spring up every now and then to defend they the stage be the realm of convention they argue if you accept a room with its fourth wall remove which nothing short of a earthquake could render possible in real life why should you jib at the idea -- in which after all there be nothing absolutely impossible -- that a man should utter aloud the thought that be pass through he mind it be all a question once more of plane of convention no doubt there be a irreducible minimum of convention in all drama but how strange be the logic which leap from that postulate to the assertion that if we admit a minimum we can not or ought not to exclude a maximum there be play which do not and there be play which do set forth to give as nearly as possible a exact reproduction of the visual and auditory reality of life in the elizabethan theater with its platform stage under the open sky any pictorial exactness of reproduction be clearly impossible its fundamental condition necessitate very nearly -lrb- 4 -rrb- a maximum of convention therefore such convention as blank verse and the soliloquy be simply of a piece with all the rest in the theater of the eighteenth century and early nineteenth the proscenium arch -- the frame of the picture -- make pictorial realism theoretically possible but no one recognize the possibility and indeed on a candle-lit stage it would have be extremely difficult as a matter of fact the elizabethan platform survive in the shape of a long apron project in front of the proscenium on which the most important part of the action take place the character that be to say be constantly step out of the frame of the picture and while this visual convention maintain itself there be nothing inconsistent or jarring in the auditory convention of the soliloquy only in the last quarter of the nineteenth century do new method of lighting combine with new literary and artistic influence complete the evolutionary process and lead to the withdrawal of the whole stage -- the whole dramatic domain -- within the frame of the picture it be thus possible to reduce visual convention to a minimum so trifling that in a well-set interior it need a distinct effort of attention to be conscious of it at all in fact if we come to think of it the removal of the fourth wall be scarcely to be class as a convention for in real life as we do not happen to have eye in the back of we head we be never visually conscious of all four wall of a room at once if then in a room that be absolutely real we see a man who -lrb- in all other respects -rrb- strive to be equally real suddenly begin to expound himself aloud in good set term he own emotion motive or purpose we instantly plump down from one plane of convention to another and receive a disagreeable jar to we sense of reality up to that moment all the effort of author producer and actor have centre in beget in we a particular order of illusion and lo the effort be suddenly abandon and the illusion shatter by a cry unreality in modern serious drama therefore the soliloquy can only be regard as a disturbing anachronism -lrb- 5 -rrb- the physical condition which tend to banish it from the stage be reinforce by the grow perception of its artistic slovenliness it be find that the most delicate analysis could be achieve without its aid and it become a point of honor with the self-respecting artist to accept a condition which render he material somewhat harder of manipulation indeed but all the more tempting to wrestle with and overcome a drama with soliloquy and aside be like a picture with inscribed label issue from the mouth of the figure in that way any bungler can reveal what be pass in the mind of he personage but the glorious problem of the modern playwright be to make he character reveal the inmost workings of they soul without say or do anything that they would not say or do in the real world -lrb- 6 -rrb- there be degree however even in the makeshift and the slovenly and not all lapse into anachronism be equally to be condemn one thing be so patent as to call for no demonstration : to wit that the aside be ten time worse than the soliloquy it be always possible that a man might speak he thought but it be glaringly impossible that he should speak it so as to be hear by the audience and not hear by other on the stage in french light comedy and farce of the mid-nineteenth century the aside be abused beyond even the license of fantasy a man will speak a aside of several line over the shoulder of another person whom he be embrace not infrequently in a conversation between two character each will comment aside on every utterance of the other before reply to it the convenience of this method of proceeding be manifest it be as though the author stand by and deliver a run commentary on the secret motive and design of he character but it be such a cry confession of unreality that on the english-speaking stage at any rate it would scarcely be tolerate to-day even in farce in serious modern drama the aside be now practically unknown it be so obsolete indeed that actor be puzzle how to handle it and audience what to make of it in a ambitious play produce at a lead london theater about ten year ago a lady on leave the stage announce in a aside she intention of drown herself and several critic the next day not understand that she be speak aside severely blame the gentleman who be on the stage with she for not frustrate she intention about the same time there occur one of the most glaring instance within my recollection of inept conventionalism the hero of the play be eugene aram alone in he room at dead of night aram hear houseman break open the outside shutter of the window design to entrap the robber what do he do he go up to the window and draw back the curtain with a noise loud enough to be hear in the next parish it be inaudible however to houseman on the other side of the shutter he proceed with he work open the window and slip in aram hiding in the shadow then while houseman peer about he with he lantern not six foot from aram and actually between he and the audience aram indulge in a long and loud monologue as to whether he should shoot houseman or not end with a prayer to heaven to save he from more blood-guiltiness such be the childish excess to which a playwright will presently descend when once he begin to dally with facile convention a aside be intolerable because it be _ not _ hear by the other person on the stage : it outrage physical possibility a overheard soliloquy on the other hand be intolerable because it _ be _ hear it keep within the bound of physical possibility but it stultify the only logical excuse for the soliloquy namely that it be a externalization of thought which would in reality remain unuttered this point be so clear that i need not insist upon it be there in modern drama any admissible soliloquy a few brief ejaculation of joy or despair be of course natural enough and no one will cavil at they the approach of mental disease be often mark by a tendency to unrestrained loquacity which go on even while the sufferer be alone and this distressing symptom may on rare occasion be put to artistic use short of actual derangement however there be certain state of nervous surexcitation which cause even healthy people to talk to themselves and if a author have the skill to make we realize that he character be pass through such a crisis he may risk a soliloquy not only without reproach but with conspicuous psychological justification in the third act of clyde fitch 's play _ the girl with the green eye _ there be a daring attempt at such a soliloquy where jinny say : good heaven why be i maudling on like this to myself out loud it be really nothing -- jack will explain once more that he can not explain -- and so on whether the attempt justified itself or not would depend largely on the act in any case it be clear that the author though as a rule somewhat lax in he craftsmanship be here aim at psychological truth a word must be say as to a special case of the soliloquy -- the letter which a person speak aloud as he write it or read over to himself aloud this be a convention to be employ as sparingly as possible but it be not exactly on a level with the ordinary soliloquy a letter have a actual objective existence the word be formulate in the character 's mind and be suppose to be externalize even though the actor may not really write they on the paper thus the letter have so to speak the same right to come to the knowledge of the audience as any other utterance it be in fact part of the dialogue of the play only that it happen to be inaudible a soliloquy on the other hand have no real existence it be a purely artificial unravelling of motive or emotion which nine time out of ten would not become articulate at all even in the speaker 's brain or heart thus it be by many degree a greater infraction of the surface texture of life than the speak letter which we may call inadvisable rather than inadmissible some theorist carry they solicitude for surface reality to such a extreme as to object to any communication between two character which be not audible to every one on the stage this be a very idle pedantry the difference between a conversation in undertone and a soliloquy or aside be abundantly plain : the one occur every hour of the day the other never occur at all when two people or a group be talk among themselves unheard by the other on the stage it require a special effort to remember that as a matter of fact the other probably do hear they even if the scene be unskilfully arrange it be not the audibility of one group but the inaudibility of the other that be apt to strike we as unreal \* \* \* \* \* this be not the only form of technical pedantry that one occasionally encounter some year ago a little band of playwright and would-be playwright in fanatical reaction against the sardou technique try to lay down a rule that no room on the stage must ever have more than one door and that no letter must ever enter into the mechanism of a play i do not know which contention be the more ridiculous nothing be commoner in modern house-planning than room which have at least two door and a french window we constantly see room or hall which if transport to the stage would provide three or four entrance and exit and this be even more true of the central heated house of america than of english house the technical purist use especially to despise the french window -- a harmless agreeable and very common device why the playwright should make one room one door a inexorable canon of art be more than human reason can divine there be case no doubt in which probability demand that the dramatist should be content with one practicable open to he scene and should plan he entrance and exit accordingly this be no such great feat as might be imagine indeed a playwright will sometimes deliberately place a particular act in a room with one door because it happen to facilitate the movement he desire it be absurd to lay down any rule in the matter other than that the scene should provide a probable locality for whatever action be to take place in it i be the last to defend the old french farce with its ten or a dozen door through which the character keep scuttle in and out like rabbit in a warren but the fact that we be tire of conventional laxity be no good reason for rush to the other extreme of conventional and hamper austerity similarly because the forge will and the lose marriage line have be rightly relegate to melodrama be there any reason why we should banish from the stage every form of write document mr bernard shaw in a article celebrate the advent of the new technique once write nowadays a actor can not open a letter or toss off somebody else 's glass of poison without have to face a brutal outburst of jeer what a extravagance to bracket as equally explode absurdity the opening of a letter and the toss off of the wrong glass of poison letter -- more 's the pity -- play a gigantic part in the economy of modern life the general post office be a vast mechanism for the distribution of tragedy comedy melodrama and farce throughout the country and throughout the world to whose door have not destiny come in the disguise of a postman and slip its decree with a double rat-tat into the letter-box whose heart have not sicken as he hear the postman 's footstep pass he door without pause whose hand have not tremble as he open a letter whose face have not blanch as he take in its import almost without read the word why i would fain know should we stage-picture of life be falsify by the banishment of the postman even the revelation bring about by the discovery of a forget letter or bundle of letter be not a infrequent incident of daily life why should it be tabu on the stage because the french dramatist forty year ago would sometimes construct a chinese-puzzle play around some steal letter or hide document be we to suffer no scrap of paper to play any part whatever in english drama even the hebrew sense of justice would recoil from such a conclusion it would be a case of the father have eat sour grape and other people 's child must pay the penalty against such whimsy of reactionary purism the playwright 's sole and sufficient safeguard be a moderate exercise of common sense \* \* \* \*

while at the same time he can give rhetorical movement to the speech of he symbolic personage and in passage of argument can achieve that clash of measure phrase against measure phrase which the greek call stichomythy and which the french dramatist sometimes produce in rapid rapier play with the alexandrine mr zangwill 's practice be in absolute contradiction of the principle above suggest that blank verse to be justify in drama ought to be lyrical he verse be a product of pure intellect and wit without a single lyric accent it be measure prose if it ever try to be more it fail i think then
