no i be sorry to tell you that hundred of thousand of american child be _ slave _ though bear beneath the same sun and on the same soil with the same natural right to freedom as yourselve they be nevertheless slave alas for they they parent can not train they as they will for they too have master these master say to they : you child be ours -- we property they shall not be teach to read or write they shall never go to school they shall not be teach to read the bible they must submit to we and not to you we shall whip they sell they and do what else we please with they they shall never own themselves never have the right to dispose of themselves but shall obey we in all thing as long as they live why do they father let these master have they child my father would not let anybody have I i hear one of my little free-spirited reader ask simply my noble boy because they can not help it the master have band themselves together and have make a set of wicked law by which nearly four million of man woman and child be declare to be they personal chattel or property so that if one of these slave father should refuse to let he child be use as the property of he master those wicked law would help the master by inflict cruel punishment on the parent hence the poor slave father and mother be force to silently witness the cruel wrong which they helpless child be make to suffer violence have be frame into a law and the poor slave be trodden beneath the foot of the powerful but why do those slave let they master bring they into this state why do not they fight as we forefather do when they throw off the yoke of england 's law inquire a bright-eyed lad who have just rise from the reading of a history of we revolution the slave be not reduce to they present servile condition in large body when we ancestor settle this country they feel the need of more laborer than they could hire then wicked man sail from england and other part of europe to the coast of africa send they boat ashore fill with armed man they fall upon the village of the poor african set fire to they hut and while they be fill with fright seize handcuffed and drag they to they boat and then carry they aboard ship this piracy be repeat until the ship be crowd with negro man woman and child the poor thing be pack like spoon below the deck then the ship set sail for the coast of america i can not tell you how horribly the poor negro suffer bad air poor food close confinement and cruel treatment kill they off by score when they die they body be pitch into the sea without pity or remorse after a wearisome voyage the survivor on be carry into some port be sell to the highest bidder no regard be pay to they relationship one man buy a husband another a wife the child be take to one place the mother to another thus they be scatter abroad over the colony fresh load arrive continually and thus they number increase other be bear on the soil until now after the lapse of some two century there be nearly four million of negro slave in the country besides large number of color people who in various way have be make free you can now see how easy it be for the master to make the wicked law by which the slave be now hold in bondage they begin when the slave be few in number when they speak a foreign language and when they be too few and feeble to offer any resistance to they oppressor as they master do to old england when she try to oppress they i want you to remember one great truth regard slavery namely that a slave be a human be hold and use as property by another human being and that _ it be always _ a sin against god _ to thus hold and I a human be as property _ you know it be not a sin to use a ox a horse a dog a squirrel a house or a acre of land as property if it be honestly obtain because god make these and similar object to be possess as property by man but god do not make _ man to be the property of man _ he never give any man the right to own he neighbor or he neighbor 's child on the contrary he make all man to be free and equal as saith we declaration of independence hence every negro child that be bear be as free before god as the white child have precisely the same right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as the white child the law which deny he that right do not destroy it it may enable the man who claim he as a slave to deprive he of its exercise but the right itself remain for the wicked law under which he act do not and can not set aside the divine law by which he be as free as any child that be ever bear but if god make every man woman and child to be free and not property then he who use a human be as property act contrary to the will of god and sin be it not so my child yet that be what every slaveholder do _ he use he slave as property _ he reckon they as worth so many dollar just as you father set a certain money value on he horse farm or merchandise he sell he give he away use he labor without pay he wages claim he child as so many more dollar add to he estate and when he die will he to he heir forever and this be sin my child -- a very great sin against god a high crime against human nature mark what i say the sin of slavery do not lie merely in whipping starve or otherwise ill-treat a human being but in use he as property in say of he as you do of you dog : he be my property he be worth so much money to I i will do what i please with he i will keep he use he sell he give he away and keep all he earn just as i choose to say that of a man be sin you might clothe the man in purple feed he on manna from heaven and keep he in a palace of ivory still if you use he as you property you would commit sin child i want you to shrink from this sin as the jew do from the fiery serpent hate it loathe it as you would the leprosy make a solemn vow before the savior who love the slave and slave child as truly as he do you that you will never hold slave never apologize for those who do as little hannibal vow eternal hatred to rome at the altar of a false god so do you vow eternal enmity to slavery at the altar of the true and live jehovah let you purpose be i will rather beg my bread than live by the unpaid toil of a slave to assist you in carry out that purpose and to excite you sympathy for poor slave child the following story be write the character in they be all real though they true name be not always give the story be therefore picture of actual life and be worthy of you belief dw \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- illustration : little lewi sell -rrb- little lewi

or two as he rise stuff the book into he own pocket and walk off poor lewi he very well know the meaning of that taunt and he do not open he mouth no threat of a dark closet ever frighten a free child so much as the threat of be sell to a southern plantation terrify the slave-child of kentucky lewi walk slowly toward the kitchen to see aunt sally it be to she he use to go with all he trouble and sometimes she scold and sometimes she listen she be very busy dress the vegetable for dinner and she look cross so the little fellow creep into the chimney corner and say nothing but he think all the more and as he think the sad tear roll down he tawny cheek what be the matter now little baby be aunt sally 's tender inquiry lewi commence he pitiful tale but as soon as aunt sally hear that it be about learn to read she shut he up with good enough for you what do you want of a book readin ' be not for the likes of you and the less you know of it the better this be poor sympathy and the little fellow with a half-spiteful feeling scramble upon a bench near by and tumble out of the window he alight on a ash-heap not a very nice place to be sure but it be a retired corner and he often hide away there when he feel sad and want to be alone here he sit down and lean he head against the side of the house he groan out my mother o my mother if you be not dead why do not you come to I by degree he calm down and half asleep there in the sunshine he dream of the home that he once have he mother be a noble woman so he think nobody else ever look so kindly into he face he be sure nobody else ever love he as she do and he remember when she be gay and cheerful and would go all day singing about she work and he father he could just remember he as a very pleasant man that he use to run to meet sometimes when he see he come home away down the road but that be long ago he have not see he now for year and he have hear he mother say that he father 's master have move away out of the state and take he with he and maybe he would never return then lewi 's mother grow sad and stop she singing though she work as hard as ever and keep she child all neat and clean and those dear brother and sister what have become of they there be tom the eldest the very best fellow in the world so lewis thought he would sit by the half hour make top and whistle and all sort of pretty plaything and sam too he be always so full of fun and singing song what a singer he be and it be right cheerful when sam would borrow some neighbor 's banjo and play to they but they be all go and he sad sweet-faced lady-like sister nelly too they be all take off in one day by one of the ugliest negro-driver that ever scare a little slave-boy 's dream and it be while he mother be away from home too how she do cry and take on when she come back and find they all go and she have not even the chance to bid they good-by she say she know she master send she off that morning because he be go to sell she child lewi shudder as he think of that dreadful night it be hardly two year ago and the fearful thing he hear then burn into he soul with terrible distinctness it seem as if they little cabin be desert after that for tom and sam and nelly be almost grow up and the rest be all little one the next winter he other sister fanny die but that be not half so sad she be about twelve year old and a blithesome cheerful creature just as she mother have be he remember how he master come to they cabin to comfort they as he say but he mother tell he plainly that she do not want any such comfort she wish nelly be dead too she wish she have never have any child to grow up and suffer what she have it be in vain she master try to soothe she he talk like a minister as he be but she have grow almost rave and she talk to he as she never dare to do before she want to know why he do not come to console she when she lose she other child three all at once she say and they be ten time worse than dead you never console I then at all religion pooh i do not want none of _ you _ religion and now she too be go she have be go more than a year it be say that she be hire out to work in another family but it be not so they only tell she that story to get she away from the child peaceably she be sell quite a distance away to a very bad man who use she cruelly ned who be some two year younger than lewi and the only brother he have leave be a wild careless boy who race about among the other child and do not seem to think much about anything lewi often wish he could have somebody to talk with and he wonder if he mother would ever come back again have he be a poet he might have put he wish into verse like the follow in which mr follen have give beautiful expression to the wish of such a slave boy as lewi : the slave boy 's wish i wish i be that little bird up in the bright blue sky that sing and fly just where he will and no one ask he why i wish i be that little brook that run so swift along through pretty flower and shine stone sing a merry song i wish i be that butterfly without a thought or care sport my pretty brilliant wing like a flower in the air i wish i be that wild wild deer i see the other day who swifter than a arrow fly through the forest far away i wish i be that little cloud by the gentle south wind drive float along so free and bright far far up into heaven i would rather be a cunning fox and hide I in a cave i would rather be a savage wolf than what i be -- a slave my mother call I she good boy my father call I brave what wicked action have i do that i should be a slave i see my little sister sell so will they do to I my heavenly father let I die for then i shall be free so talk to himself he fall into a doze and dream about he mother he think she large serious eye be look into he and she long black hair fall over he face he mother be part indian and part white with only just enough of the black to make she hair a little curly it do not make much difference what color people be in the slave state if the mother be slave the child be slave too even if they be nine-tenth white from this pleasant dream lewi be rouse by a splash of cold water and aunt sally with she head out of the window be call here you lazy nigger come here and grind this coffee for I and the little boy awake to find himself a friendless orphan in a cold world with a cruel master the next morning lewi be play about the yard with as good a will as any of the young negro child 's trouble do not last long and to see he turn somerset singing jim crow and kick up a row generally you would suppose he have forget all about the lose primer and he mother too he be in the greatest possible glee in the afternoon at be send with another boy jim to carry a package to mr pond 's then he be trust so he put himself on he dignity and do not turn more than twenty somerset on the way in come back as they have no package to carry they take it into they head to cut across lot though it be no nearer than the road still it make they plenty of exercise in climb fence and walk log bridge across the brook while do this they come in sight of some white pond-lilies and all at once it occur to lewi that it would be right nice to get some of they for miss katy to buy up she good-will for he be afraid she would be very angry when she find that he have lose the primer so he wade and paddle about till he have collect quite a handful of they in spite of jim 's hurry up and tell he that he would get he head break for missus have tell they to be quick when he have gather a large handful he start on the run for home stop only once or twice to admire the fragrant lovely flower and he feel they beauty quite as much i dare say as miss katy would when they be pass the quarter as the place be call where the hut of the slave be build aunt sally put she head out of the cabin door and see he she call out here lew here 's you mother the boy forget he lily drop they and run to the door he see within a strange woman sit on a bench be _ that _ he mother she turn she large dark eye for a moment upon he and then she spring to meet he he little heart be ready to overflow with tear of joy and he expect to be overwhelm with caress just as you would if you should meet you mother after be separate from she more than a year imagine he terror then as she seize he rudely by the wrist and exclaim it be you be it a little slave boy i 'll fix you so they 'll never get you then she pick he up in she arm and start to run with he as if she would throw he into the well the little fellow scream with fright aunt sally run after she cry at the top of she voice nancy o nancy do not now and then a big negro dart out of the stable cry stop she there catch she all this hubbub rouse the people at the house and master stamford forthwith appear on the verandah with a crowd of servant of all size amid the order and cry and general confusion that follow nancy be catch lewi be take away and she be carry back to the cabin while the big negro be prepare to tie she as she enter the cabin she eye catch sight of a knife that lay there and snatch it up she give herself a bad wound with it poor woman she be tire of she miserable life i do not wonder that she want to die be it right you ask for she to take she own life certainly not but let we see what lead to this attempt for a long time she have be separate from lewi and ned the last of she child that remain to she to be sure the other three be probably live somewhere and so be she husband but she only know that they have go into hopeless servitude where she know not indeed she do not know but that they be already dead and she do not expect ever to hear for slave be seldom able to write and often not permit to when they can if there have only be hope of hearing from they at some time or other she could have endure it but between she and those love one there rest a thick cloud of utter darkness beyond that they might be toiling groan bleeding starve die beneath the oppressor 's lash in the deadly swamp or in the tooth of the cruel hound and she could not have the privilege of minister to the least of they want of soothing one of they sorrow or even drop a silent tear beside they if she could have hear only _ one _ fact about they it would have be some relief but she could not enjoy even this poor privilege and then come the dead heavy stillness of despair creep over she spirit do you wonder that she become perfectly wild and beside herself at time how would you feel if all you love best be carry off by a cruel slave-driver and you have _ no hope _ of hearing from they again in this world during these dreadful fit of insanity she would bewail the living as worse than dead and pray god to take they away then she would curse herself for be the mother of slave child declare that it would be far better to see they die in they childhood than to see they grow up to suffer as she have suffer she live only a few mile from she old home but she new master be a uncommonly hard man and would not permit she to go and see she child he say it would only make she worse and he slave should learn that they be not to put on air and have whim it be they business to live for he do not he pay enough for they and see that they be well feed and clothe and what more do they want this he call kind treatment very kind indeed not to allow a mother to go and see she own child but when she be take with those insane spell and would go on so about she child that she be not fit to work indeed could not be make to work it be finally suggest to he that a visit to she child would do she good this be the occasion of she present visit and it be because she be insane that she attempt to take she own life the wound however be not very deep and nancy do not die at this time after the doctor have be there and dress she wound and affair have become quiet lewi steal to the door of the cabin he be afraid to go in he hardly know any of the time whether that strange wild woman could be he mother only they tell he she be there be blood spatter here and there on the bare earth that serve as a floor to the cabin and on a straw mattress at one side lay the strange woman she eye be shut and now that she be more compose he see in the lineament of that pale face the feature of he mother but she once glossy black hair have turn almost white since she have be away and altogether there be such a wild expression that he be afraid and creep quietly away again he then go to find he brother who of course do not remember so much about she but it be touch to see the two little lone brother stand peep in wonderingly at they own mother who be so change that they hardly know she then they go off behind the kitchen to talk about it and cry over it the strange big negro be jerry who belong to the same master with nancy and he have come to bring she down he be afraid that he master would be very angry if he should go back without she but the doctor say the woman must not be move for a week and he write a letter for jerry to carry bear to he master while nancy remain the next day as they gain a little more courage the brother creep inside of the cabin they mother see they and beckon they to she bed-side she could scarcely speak a word distinctly but take first one and then the other by the hand she say inquiringly : lewi lewi ned they sit there at the bed-side by the hour that day sometimes she would hold they hand lovingly in hers then again she would lay she hand gently on the head of one and the other and she eye would wander lovingly over they face and then fill with tear after a day or two little restless fun-loving ned grow tired of this and run out to play but lewi stay by he mother and she be soon able to talk with he she show he she wrist where they have be worn by the iron and she back scar by the whip and she tell he of cruelty that we may not repeat here she talk with he as if he be a man and not a child and as he listen he heart and mind seem to reach forward and he become almost a man in think he seem to live whole year in those few day that he talk with he mother it be here that the fearful fact dawn upon he as it never have before _ he be a slave _ he have no control over he own person or action but he belong soul and body to another man who have power to control he in everything and this would not have be so irksome have it be a person that he love but master stamford he hate he never meet he but to be call by some foul epithet or boot out of the way he have no choice whom he would serve and there would be no end to the thankless servitude but death mother say the boy what have we do that we should be treat so much worse than other people nothing my child nothing they say there be a god who have order all this but i do not know about that she stop she mother 's heart forbid she to teach she child infidel principle and she go on in a better strain of reasoning perhaps he allow all this to try if we will be good whether or no but i be sure he can not be please with the white folk 's cruelty toward we and they 'll all have to suffer for it some day then there be a long pause when both mother and son seem to be think sad sad thought finally the mother break the silence by say : well here we be and the great question be how to make the best of it if there be any best about it i know what i 'll do mother say lewi earnestly i 'll run away when i be old enough i hope you may get out of this terrible bondage my child say the mother but you have better keep that matter to yourself at present it will be a long time before you be old enough there be one thing about it if you be go to be a free man you 'll want to know how to read lewi 's heart be full again and he tell he mother the whole story of the primer and do missy katy never ask about it afterward inquire the mother no she never have say a word about it o well she do not care there be some young missy with tender heart that do take a good deal of pain to teach poor slave to read but she be not so nor any of massa 's family if he be a minister he do not care any more about we than he do about he horse you mus not wait for any of they but there be sam tyler down to massa pond 's he can read and if you can get he to show you some without let massa know it that 'll help you and then you must try by yourself as hard as you can thus do the poor slave mother talk with she child try to implant in he heart a early love for knowledge but the time soon come when nancy be well enough to go back to she cruel servitude this visit have prove a great good to little lewi the entire spirit of he thought be change he be still very often silent and thoughtful but he be seldom sad he have a fix purpose within which be help he to work out he destiny he first effort be to see sam tyler this old man be a very intelligent mulatto belong to mr pond for some great service formerly render to he master he be allow to have he cabin and quite a large patch of ground separate from the other negro and all he time to himself except ten hour a day for he master he master have also give he a pass with which he could go and come on business and the very feel that he be trust keep he from use it to run away with mr pond be very kind to all he servant as he call they and a more cheerful group could not be find in the state it would have be well if the rev robert stamford and many of he congregation have imitate mr pond in this respect for he servant work more faithfully and be more trustworthy than any other in the vicinity there be one thing more that he should have do he should have make out free papers for they and let they go when they please when lewi mention he wish to sam tyler the old man be quite delighted with the honor do to he own literary talent but you see say he i can tell ye what be a sight better come over to massa pond 's Sunday school i would ` vise ye to ask massa stamford and then ye can come every Sunday lewi have a notion that it would not be very easy to get he master 's permission so the next Sunday he go without permission it be a right nice place for little folk and big one too nearly all mr pond 's servant be there punctually it be hold a hour and mr pond himself or one of he son be always there he read the bible teach they verse from it sing hymn with they and of late at they urgent solicitation he have purchase some large card with the letter and easy reading and be teach they all to read the first day that lewi go he creep off very early before he master be up tell aunt sally where he be go so that if he should be inquire for she could send ned after he aunt sally remonstrate but it be of no avail he be off and she really love he too well to betray he that day young master pond be in the Sunday school and he speak very kindly to lewi commend he zeal and ask he to come again but when he tell he father that one of mr stamford 's boy be there mr pond 's reply be that this matter must be look into mr pond be there himself on the next Sunday and though he speak very kindly to the boy yet he tell he very decidedly that he must not come there without a write permission from he master well then i can not come at all sir say lewi sorrowfully ask he at any rate be the reply i would like to have you come very well but i be afraid he will think i want to steal one of he boy if i allow you to come here without he consent it be with much fear that lewi make know he wish to he master and he be receive as he expect to be with abuse you would like to be a smart nigger i suppose one of the kind that talk saucy to he master and run away i 'll make you smart i be smart enough myself for all my nigger and if they want any more of the stuff i 'll give they some of the right sort say he with vulgar wit as he lay he riding-whip about the shoulder of poor lewi but when mr stamford find that lewi have already be to mr pond 's Sunday school he make a more serious matter of it and the poor boy receive he first severe flogging twenty-five lash on he bare back i hope now say aunt sally while dress he welted and wound back with wet linen that you 'll give up that silly notion of you 'n that of learnin ' to read it be of no use and these ` ere learn nigger be always gettin ' into trouble i know massa would half kill one if he have ` im now if you belong to massa pond ` twould be different and so she go on but the more she talk the more firmly lewi make up he mind that he would learn to read if he could and the word of he mother come to he mind with authority : if you be go to be a free man you 'll want to know how to read about two month after this he pay another visit to sam tyler sam 's plot of ground and cabin be near the division line between the two farm and lewi take he time to go down there after dark he ask sam to teach he to read i should think you would get enough of that say sam i should not think it would pay what would you take for what you know about readin ' ask lewis well i can not say as i would like to sell it but it would only be a plague to you so long as you belong to massa stamford by dint of coax however lewi succeed in get he to teach he the letter take the opportunity to go to he rainy night or when mr stamford be away from home that be the end of sam 's help he have a idea in he head that it be not good policy for he to do this without massa stamford 's consent after what mr pond have say about lewi 's come to Sunday school sam be a cautious negro not so warm-hearted and impulsive as the most of he race he pride himself on be more like white folk lewi be soon in trouble of another sort he have find a old spelling-book and sam have show he that the letter he have learn be to be put together to make word then too he manage to get a little time to himself every morning by rise very early so far so good and he diligence be deserving of success but the progress he make be very discouraging c-a-n spell sane n-o-t spell note and g-o spell jo i sane note jo what nonsense and there be no one that could explain the matter intelligently he persevere bravely for a while find now and then a word that he could understand but at last he book be go from its hiding place he know not where to get another and in short he be pretty much discourage these difficulty have cool he ardor much more than the whip have do and by degree he settle down into a state of despondency and indifference that mr stamford would have consider a matter of the deepest regret have it befall one of he own child year pass on -- long dreary cheerless year lewi be now a boy of seventeen rather intelligent in appearance but melancholy and not very hearty in spite of repeat thinning out by sale at different time to the trader the number of mr stamford 's slave have greatly increase and now the time come when they must all be dispose of he have accept a call from a distant village and must necessarily break up he farm establishment it be a sad sight to see these poor people who have live together so long put up at auction and bid off to person that have come from many different place here go the father of a family in one direction the mother in another and the child all scatter hither and thither and then it be heartrend to witness they brief parting bad as have be they lot with mr stamford they would far sooner stay with he than be separate from those of they fellow-slave whom they love a lot at a time be put up in a row and one after another be call upon the block and after a few bid be hand over to a new master to be take wherever he might choose ned and jim and lewi stand side by side in one of those row ned have grow up to be a fine sprightly lad and the bidding for he be lively he be strike down to a southern trader lewi listen despondently while the bidding for jim be go on expect every moment to hear he own name call when suddenly a strong hand be lay upon he shoulder from behind and he be draw from the row after a thorough examination by a strange gentleman in company with he master he be bid to step aside from some word that he hear pass between they he understand that he have be sell at private sale barter off for a pair of carriage-horse the animal a pair of handsome bay be stand near by and he turn to look at they suppose they be black say he to himself would they be any meaner less powerful less valuable less spirited i do not see that color make much difference with animal why should it make so much difference among man who make the white man master over we he think long and deeply but there come no answer then too they be larger than i be and there be two of they what make the difference that i should be higher price ah i have a _ mind _ and it be my mind that they have sell he add with a sudden gleam of thought and what have i of my own nothing they buy and sell and control soul and mind and body lewi have yet to learn that even the poor slave may with all he soul believe on jesus and no master on earth could hinder he mr stamford have never give he slave any religious teaching and perhaps it be just as well that _ he _ do not attempt anything of that kind for he be say to have teach he white congregation that it be no more harm to separate a family of slave than a litter of pig he new master whose name be john live about thirty mile distant and nearly as much as that nearer the boundary line between ohio and kentucky a item which the boy notice with much satisfaction on they way home mr john take special pain to impress on the mind of he new property the fact that the condition of he be well treat in he new home would be he good behavior it be of no use he say for my boy to go to show off air and set themselves up i can not stand that but if they be quiet and industrious i give they as good allowance and as good quarter as anybody what mr john call good behavior in servant be they do promptly and precisely just as he tell they to without venture to think for themselves anything about it if any of they do venture a opinion before he he shut they up with a cut of the whip or a sharp word so that the utmost extent of they conversation in he presence be a strict answer to he question and yes massa in reply to he command lewi be destine to assist in the garden mr john be very fond of horticulture but to have have he head gardener a slave would have involve the necessity of talk with he and consult he too much to consist with he view of propriety the slave of family in the far south be not usually treat in this manner but mr john be by birth a englishman the gardener then be a free white man name spencer and lewi find he a very pleasant master it be not difficult for he to find he way into he good grace so that lewi do not suffer so much by the change as he expect he heart be already harden by the loss of so many friend that he take this with unexpected indifference but he do miss he brother ned more than once in he dream do he hear he cry for help but after a while he hear through a fellow-slave that ned be serve as waiter in a hotel at louisville this be the last he ever hear of he besides this lewi love he new work it be so delightful to see the shrub and tree and plant flourish and the flower put forth they gorgeous display and spencer 's kindness make the heaviest work seem light it be very easy to serve a man that govern by kindness but lewi think it would be much harder to serve spencer if he have feel that he be he _ owner _ one morning go earlier than usual to the garden he find miss ford there the governess of the child she be promenade one of the wide alley and pensively read a favorite author this occur morning after morning and lewi think he would be so glad if she would only spend a few minute teach he to read he know that she be from the free state where they do not keep slave and he think perhaps if she know he desire to read she would help he but morning after morning pass and she seem to take very little notice of he finally he one day observe she look at a beautiful magnolia blossom the first that have come out it be quite on the top of the tree she evidently want it and lewi draw near hope that she would ask he to get it for she and so she do lewis be delighted she thank he so kindly after this he find occasion to say : i think missus must be very happy she can read the lady look surprised and then pitiful and would you like to read indeed there be nothing in this world would make I more happy say lewi it be a pity so simple a wish can not be gratify say she to herself perhaps i could find time if i think so i might rise a little earlier could you come here by sunrise every morning o yes missus indeed i could come then to-morrow morning that be a happy day for lewi he first lesson be quite a success he have not forget all he letter after this he go on prosperously have a half hour lesson every fair morning lewi study very hard and make excellent progress the difficulty that formerly trouble he now disappear for he have a teacher whom he could consult upon every word miss ford give he a few penny to buy candle with and all he evening be spend in assiduous devotion to he new task the thought of he new acquisition make he so happy that he work more diligently and appear far more cheerful than formerly mr john observe it and remark that the boy have turn out a better bargain than he expect when it be know in the house that miss ford be teach lewi there be some consultation about it and mr john approach the lady with a long face to talk the matter over however she have altogether the advantage of he for she laugh most uncontrollably at he concern assure he that this be she intellectual play and that she enjoy the matter very much as she would teach trick to a parrot or monkey surely now you would not deprive I of such a innocent amusement say she with mock lamentation no but my dear miss ford say the gentleman try to appear serious it be not best for these people to know too much o that be too good she reply with a laugh do you expect he to rival a henry clay or a andrew jackson and then she go on tell some such funny mistake and ludicrous blunder of the boy that mr john could resist no longer and he join in the laugh there be evidently no such thing as pin she fast to serious reasoning on the subject and as she stand very high in mr john 's good grace he conclude he might about as well let she do as she like she have be a long time in the family and as they have see no ultra-abolition trait they think she sound at heart on that subject and so she be for have she know the true situation of the slave all the better feeling of she noble soul would have rise up in rebellion against the groundwork of the abominable institution but as the slave be keep very much apart from the family and by they master 's peculiar training have very little to say when they do make they appearance she have very little opportunity to study the workings of the system if she have be dispose to do so and very little to excite she curiosity about it as lewi by degree gain the good opinion of he teacher and flatter she by he rapid progress so she gradually become interested in he early history and especially in he early failure in learn to read she be quite indignant at the opposition he have experience and she expression of surprise at the treatment he receive lead he to tell of greater cruelty that he have see practice on other and so on to the story of he mother she take a deep interest in all he detail and he be never at a loss for something to tell could it be that slavery be so bad that she be surround by these suffer creature and be do nothing for they she make inquiry of other prudently and find that it be even so and more too that even she herself be not at liberty to speak out she sentiment about it but she could think and she do think the great law of human god-given _ right _ come up before she and she acknowledge it these poor creature have a right to they own personal freedom and she think it would be do god and humanity a service if she could help they to obtain that freedom she do not know that in do thus she would be sin against the law of she country -lrb- -rrb- and perhaps she would not have care much if she have for she be one of those independent soul that dare to acknowledge the law of right for month be these conviction gain strength but no opportunity occur to assist any of they meanwhile she grow pensive and silent oppress by the helpless misery which she see around she on every side one evening when lewi come for he lesson he bring she a anonymous note the writer profess to take a deep interest in the intelligent young slave lewi and ask the question if she would be willing to do anything to advance he freedom she unhesitatingly reply that she would be very glad to do so lewis know where to carry the note and she soon have a interview with the writer mr dean of whom she have hear as the worst abolitionist in the neighborhood arrangement be soon make for run off the boy miss ford be to get leave of mr john to send lewi to a neighbor of mr dean 's on a errand for herself in the evening as this would keep he quite late and he be to report to she on he return no one else would be likely to miss he until morning he be to proceed at once to mr dean 's house whence with face and hand dye and he clothes change he be to go with mr dean in the capacity of a servant to cincinnatus and he should then run he own chance of escape in its main feature the plan work well and lewi escape the next morning when lewi be miss at the house of he master suspicion immediately fall upon miss ford the plot be so simple that the truth could not well be conceal but nothing be say about it until they might find some tangible evidence and this be soon afford by the imprudence of dean two morning after this he come to the garden fence by the arbor where she usually spend the morning and throw over a note contain the word all right and no suspicion but he be mistaken about the no suspicion he himself would have be arrest at the moment of he return for one of he neighbor have see and recognize they in cincinnatus but they wait and watch to see if by some chance miss ford might not also be implicate and it be do there be more observer than he dream of and miss ford who from she window see the note fall see it pick up a moment after by mr john himself mr dean be arrest before he reach home again and both he and miss ford be send to jail complaint be prefer against they but many month pass before they be bring to trial when at last the trial come off mr dean be sentence to imprisonment for ten year and five thousand dollar fine miss ford 's sentence be five year ' imprisonment but the governor finally grant a reprieve of the last two year after many adventure lewi reach boston where he still live for aught i know with a nice little woman of he own color for a wife and three smart little boy he labor so diligently in the cultivation of he mind that he become qualify for a teacher and have be for a long time engage in that pleasant and profitable occupation but best of all he have become a sincere christian rejoicing in the privilege of worship god accord to the dictate of he own conscience with none to molest nor make he afraid he have hear once more from he parent he father 's master have return to the

comforting mr ford busy herself in prepare a basket of provision and have commence wrap the napkin over it when she pause and lean toward the closet into which she look but do not seem to find what she want for call one of the boy she whisper something to he he run out into the yard and down the path to the barn presently he return and say there be none there mother i be very sorry judy that i

prefigure and hope they would end as that do in the victory of the noble and generous impulse of the heart when the basket be ready and aunt judy regale with a nice cup of tea one of the boy volunteer to carry it home for she a proposal which be readily assent to by mr ford whose heart be gladden by every act of kindness to the poor and needy perform by she child and who have early teach they that in such deed they obey the injunction of we savior : bear ye one another 's burden chapter ii several week have pass away since judy 's visit when one day as cornelium stand lean she little curly head against she mother 's knee she say : mother who be judy have she a husband or child i do not know of any my daughter she may have some living but you know judy be a slave and they have probably be sell away from she and be still in slavery in slavery mother and _ sell _ why do they sell little child away from they mother yes cornelia there be person guilty of such a wicked thing mother and child and whole family be often separate from each other never perhaps to meet again so judy be a slave mother yes cornelia she be : and from all i have learn of she history i be sure she have lead a very unhappy and sorrowful life o now i understand what you mean when you say that she have a thorny path through life have you ever hear she history mother if you have will not you tell it to we yes do mother do exclaim the child together i should like very much to gratify you my dear child but it be not in my power to do so as i be not very well acquaint with she history but i will tell you how we can arrange it judy will he here to-night as i promise to give she some indian cake of which she be very fond and i have no doubt that she will tell you the story of she sad life the idea of hearing judy 's story occupy the mind of the child all the afternoon and the evening be look forward to with great impatience by they it be twilight and mr ford and the child have gather around the warm comfortable grate to await the return of papa the wind whistle without and the snow-flake fall silently and steadily to the frozen ground mother can not i bring in the light ask cornelium who be get a little impatient only a little for cornelium be remarkable for she sweet and placid disposition yes dear i think you may hark yes that be he footstep in the hall go alfred and tell bessie to bring up the tea and you cornelia bring you father 's dressing-gown and slipper to the fire yes wife let we have some of bessie 's nice hot tea for i be chill through and through and such a cut wind i think my nose would have be blow off and what would my little girl have say if she have see she papa come home without a nose would you have run ask mr ford no indeed papa if you nose be blow off and you tooth all pull out and you be like ` uncle ned ' who have ` no eye to see and have no hair on the top of he head ' i would just get on you lap as i do now so you see you could not frighten I away if you try ever so hard say cornelium laughingly supper be hastily dispatch by the child who be eager and impatient for the come of aunt judy o mother _ do _ you think she will come ask alfr as he mother arise from the table to look at the weather well indeed alfr i be sorry to disappoint you but i think there be little probability of see judy to-night why no mother i think that as soon as i see what a stormy night it be and although it will disappoint we very much i hope she will not come say little cornelium why how you talk si _ not come _ indeed humph i hope she _ will _ then this little snow would not hurt I so it would not hurt she say the impetuous alfr you must remember my son that judy be old and infirm and subject as she say to a ` touch of the rheumatiz ' but i be sorry that she have not come to-night she may be sick i think i will call down and see she to-morrow say mr ford draw out the table and arrange the shade on the lamp so that the light fall on the table and the face of those around it they be cheerful happy face and everything around they wear the same look and from the aspect of thing it seem as if they be go to spend a pleasant and profitable evening dear papa tell we a story with a poor slave in it will not you and i will give you as many kiss as you please say cornelium twine she arm around she father 's neck no no papa not about the slave but the poor indian who have be far worse treated than the slave be or ever will be only to think of the white people come here plunder they village and building on they hunting grounds just as if it belong to they when all the while it be the indian ' now if they have buy it and pay for it honorably as william penn do it would have be a different thing but they get it meanly and i be ashamed of they for it say alfr he eye flash and he cheek glowing with indignation all that you have say be true my son but the indian be also guilty of great cruelty toward the white people say mr ford but papa do not you think the indian have good cause for they hatred to the whites ask harry why harry they have no reason sufficient to justify they in they cruel and vindictive course but they do no more than be to be expect from a entirely barbarous nation and i be sure they have no good example in the conduct of the white people from whom much better behavior might have be expect well papa what be some of the wrong that the indian endure the indian regard the whites as intruder and madden by some act of injustice and oppression commit by the early settler they conceive a deadly hatred which the whites return with equal intensity and for each crime commit by either of they the opposite party inflict a retribution more terrible than the act which provoke it and the indian be less powerful but equally wicked be the victim well although i think the indian be very wicked i pity they but i feel a great deal more for the poor slave say little cornelium i think they be very cruel si but i still think that they be very badly treat say alfr there be no doubt of that answer he father but my son when you begin the argument you say that you think the indian be more deserving of compassion than the african now this be the difference the indian be always a warlike and treacherous race they most solemn compact be break as soon as they own purpose have be serve and they be continually harass the settler indeed they have not cease yet for at the present time they be attack and murder the trader who cross the plain if they be not well armed and in sufficiently large company to keep they in check now the american have never this cause of complaint against the african for although like all heathen they be debase and be cruel and warlike among each other they never annoy we in america and the american have not therefore even this insufficient excuse for enslave they the indian be rob of they land and drive from they home but the african not only lose they country but be compel to work in slavery for man to whom they owe no allegiance in a different climate and with the ever-galling thought that they be once free it argue well for they peaceable disposition that they have not long ago revolt and by a terrible massacre shake off they yoke as they do in st domingo now which be the worst use in this case o the slave papa i willingly surrender say alfr laugh well if you have finish i move we go to bed and thence to the land of dream say mr ford rise and put away she sew it be unanimously agree that this be the best plan and after give thanks to god for he many mercy they retire chapter iii good morning father say alfred i have be think that i surrender too soon last night i do not bring out all my force because i forget something i hear that old baptist minister say when he be lecture here a few day ago he say that the creek indian would not send the poor fugitive back to they master it be true they make a treaty with we government to do so but they have too much humanity to keep it and for not do so the government withhold two hundred and fifty thousand dollar which be due to the indian for some land and use it to pay the master but that make little difference to they for they still persist in disobey the ` fugitive slave law ' now do not you think _ that _ be a good trait in they character yes alfr i do they manifest a very generous and humane disposition well but i think it be very dishonorable for they to break any treaty say harry you see harry there be where you and i differ i think it a great deal better to break a bad promise than to keep it answer alfred come into breakfast papa say cornelium peep she little curly head in at the door mamma want you to come right away because she have to go to judy 's very well we will go now and not keep mother wait just look at the snow how it sparkle jack frost have be here for the window be all cover and the water in the pitcher be frozen yes papa and see what funny shape the icicle be in and the tree and bush look as if they have they white dress on say little cornelium it will be a splendid morning for a sleigh-ride would you like to take one mother ask harry after they breakfast be

early as i have several place to go to after come from judy 's very well mother you shall have it immediately now bundle si up warm for there be a cut wind and i think it look like snow again and o

i will say he mother and harry run off but soon return call come mother the sleigh be wait and the horse look as if he be in a hurry to be off yes harry i be come i only go back to get a little milk for judy she be so weak that i think she need it o mother say alfr as they drive along what be more enliven than the merry jingle of the sleigh bell on a clear frosty day it be indeed very pleasant alfred but while we be enjoy we pleasant winter evening and we many sleigh ride the thought come to we mind that however much we may like the winter time there be hundred in we city who think of its approach with fear and tremble and who suffer much from cold and hunger until the pleasant spring time come again but you be tell I henry about those poor people and i be too much occupy to attend to you do you know where they live asked mr ford yes just along the bank mother it be a wretched-looking house and very much expose poor thing i pity they very much they appear so destitute and even the child have a care-worn look on they thin face what in that old house harry exclaimed alfred why the window have hardly any pane in they and there be great hole in the wall yes ally that be the place and it be as you say a rickety old house but i suppose it be the best they can get but here we be at school ally you get out first and i will hand sissy out to you take hold of she hand for the path be slippery the child alight and then harry and he mother after a pleasant ride round the city drive up to aunt judy 's cottage o miss ford be dat you now who have a think o not i ` se sure you 's de

trudge back in the snow and then wave they hand to she as she disappear in the turn of the road harry touch the horse and in a few minute they seem as if they be actually fly over the frozen surface when they arrive at home bessie have a smoking dinner on the table for they which they partake of with great relish after they have finish they dinner they mother say that as they have but one session

and lesson learn after the tea-thing have be remove now say mr ford ` stir the fire and close the shutter fast let fall the curtain and wheel the sofa round ' and be ready for aunt judy 's story add alfred come mother come we be all wait have a little patience my son i will be there in a few minute she soon reappear and be greet with three cheer from the child and seat herself in the large comfortable rocking-chair she begin : on the eastern side of the beautiful roanoke be the residence of mr madison and here the first few year of judy 's life be pass she have a kind master and while in he service have a very happy time she have like most of she race a strong native talent for music and be frequently call upon to exercise it by singing song and dancing for the amusement of general washington and the other officer of the revolution who visit at she master 's house judy be then quite young and greatly enjoy a sight of the soldier 's gay uniform she master die when she be a child she mistress be then in very ill health and little judy spend most of the time in she room in attendance upon she one day she mistress be seize with a violent fit of cough judy run to she assistance and finding that the cough do not yield to the usual remedy call for help but before aid be obtain mrs madison be dead she die with she arm around the neck of she faithful attendant mr madison have make provision for the emancipation of judy and after she death she receive she free papers which she carefully guard after she mother 's death the daughter of mr madison determine to remove to kentucky and judy be much attach to she and the family accompany they soon after she arrival there judy marry a slave on the plantation of mr jackson which be several mile distant from that of judy 's mistress john 's master be very cruel to he he would not allow he to leave the estate nor be judy permit to come to see he and thus they live apart for several month but the brutal treatment of he master at last render john desperate and he determine to run away it be a fearful risk but if he succeed the prize he think would be sufficient compensation one morning he have a pass from he master to go to a neighboring town on business and he think this a good opportunity to execute the project he have so long entertain he start and travel all night and lay conceal in the wood all day and on the third day after he have leave home he venture on to the estate of judy 's mistress he go into one of the hen-house and it be not long before he see judy come out to feed the poultry she be very much frighten when she see he and thought of the consequence that might arise from he master 's rage if he find he however she hide he in the barn supply he with food at night he stay there more than a week intend to leave kentucky after he master 's pursuit should have cease but one morning he master come to the house and tell judy 's mistress that one of he slave be conceal on the place and ask permission to hunt he which be grant he soon find he by the aid of one of the slave who have notice judy carry food to the barn and watch she till he have discover she husband and then inform against he o how mean to betray he exclaim alfred yes ally it be but i suppose it be the hope of reward that induce he to be guilty of such a base act and _ be _ he reward ask cornelium for i be sure if he be he do not deserve it i do not know that he be my daughter answer mr ford john be take to jail and lock up until he master should return home judy obtain a permit to enter the jail and stay with he in the cold damp cell cheer he with she presence she could not bear the thought of be again separate and determine to accompany he let the consequence be what they might she husband be take to a blacksmith 's shop on the next day after he recapture and a heavy pair of handcuffs place upon he and a chain -lrb- have at the end a large iron ball -rrb- be then fasten to he leg to prevent he from run and in this condition they start for home they walk for six day she with she infant in she arm and he heavily load with iron and she tell I that often she dress be one cake of ice up to she knee the snow and rain be freeze on she skirt she husband 's shoe soon give way and he foot bleed profusely at every step judy tear off she skirt piece by piece to wrap they in for she love he tenderly but the anguish of they body be nothing in comparison with that of they mind fear for the consequence of the attempt and regret that it have not be successful fill they heart with grief and they journey on with no earthly hope to cheer they just think my child what they must have suffer through those long dreary day john go back to slavery and misery and judy not know what she own fate might be but she have comfort herself with the thought that when john 's master see what a condition he be in he would relent toward he but she be sadly mistake for he take he weary sick and suffering as he be and whip he cruelly and then leave he in a old shed -lrb- illustration : handcuff judy 's husband -rrb- o mamma say little cornelium bury she face in she mother 's lap and sob aloud do they do such wicked thing i wish i have hold of he say alfr would not i give it to he i should feel very much grieve if i saw you harm he in any way ally do you forget what we bless savior say about return good for evil ask he mother well but mother i be sure it would have be no more than fair just to give he a good cowhiding so as it do not kill he no more than he deserve perhaps but my son you should remember that jesus teach we that we should forgive the greatest injury after this cruel treatment of john judy with the aid of one of the other slave who sympathize with she and john carry he to a little hut that be not so much expose as the one in which he have previously lie he have a razor with which he have attempt to kill himself but judy come in at that moment and as he be very weak she easily take it from he but he say : ' o let I die i would rather be in my grave than endure this over again ' he be sick and helpless a long time but he would have suffer much more if judy have not be free and have it in she power to nurse he there be many a poor slave that have fall a victim to this kind of barbarity with no eye to witness he distress but he heavenly father 's to add to john 's misery be the brutal treatment of a little brother a smart active child of eight year of age who be own by the same man mr jackson be a great drunkard and when under the influence of liquor no crime be too great for he one day for some slight offense he take the child mark he throat from ear to ear and then cut the rim of he ear partly off and leave they hang down a little while after this a gentleman who have be in the habit of visit at the house ride up and notice the child 's throat ask he how it happen he say massa do it the gentleman be so enraged that he immediately mount he horse ride away and have he arrest when john be able to leave he bed he mistress a kind and humane woman whose slave he have be before she marriage take he and hide he in a cave that be on the plantation and supply he with food intend to send he away as soon as she could do so safely he be there several week and he master suppose he have again escape and be hide somewhere in the wood but he have become so much dissipate that he take no interest in he business affair and never explore the hiding-place on he own plantation one day a gentleman by the name of mr lawrence of vincenne come to mr jackson 's to purchase a servant to take with he to indiana why mother i think that they would not allow any one to hold slave here say ally no they do not my son but this gentleman be to take he as a bind servant for a term of year and he probably suppose that poor john 's legal rights would not be very carefully examine john be sell in the wood for a small sum after the bargain be conclude mr lawrence ask if the slave have a wife on the plantation and be tell that he have judy be point out to he he ask she if she know where she husband be and she tell he that she do for she think it be better for he to leave he cave as it be damp and comfortless so that night with new hope in she heart judy go to he lone and dreary hiding-place and tell he of the bargain any change be a relief to he and he come willingly out and make preparation for go with mr lawrence he wait until he master be in bed and too deeply stupefied with liquor to heed what be pass and then come to the place appoint mr jackson give he some clothes and make what provision she could for he comfort on the way john have a horse give he to ride upon but judy be take no notice of yet she determine to walk the three day ' journey rather than be separate from john mr lawrence when he perceive judy be follow they try to persuade she to return for she have a young child with she and he be afraid she would be troublesome he tell she that after she husband be settle in vincenne he would send for she but she have learn to place no confidence in promise make to a slave so she resolve she would go believe if she lose sight of she husband she would never see he again they have to cross the ohio in a ferry boat and judy strain every nerve to reach it before they she do so and hurry up the stair with she baby she clasp the railing resolve to stay there unless compel by violence to leave the boat but no one notice she and she arrive safely on the other side after walk some mile poor judy become tired and weary and she strength fail she and she be afraid that after all she have go through for the sake of she husband she would be leave at last but she think she would make another effort so she tell mr lawrence that if he would buy she a horse to ride upon she would bind herself to he for six month after they arrive in indiana he agree to do so and buy she a horse after they reach vincenne and judy have work out she six month she again bind herself to he to serve out she husband 's time for he be very weak and feeble and be suffer with a severe cough and judy long to see he own he own body but god free he

little charley here speak of be a smart child of five or six year of age judy and charley accompany mr lawrence to the room when they arrive there judy observe a number of strange-looking man who
