\* some of the haunt of burn by a tourist without imagination or enthusiasm we leave carlisle at a little past eleven and within the half-hour be at gretna green thence we rush onward into scotland through a flat and dreary tract of country consist mainly of desert and bog where probably the moss-trooper be accustom to take refuge after they raid into england anon however the hill heave themselves up to view occasionally attain a height which might almost be call mountainous in about two hour we reach dumfry and alight at the station there chill as the scottish summer be repute to be we find it a awfully hot day not a whit less so than the day before but we sturdily adventure through the burning sunshine up into the town inquire we way to the residence of burn the street lead from the station be call shakspeare street and at its farther extremity we read burn street on a corner house -- the avenue thus designate have be formerly know as mill hole bra it be a vile lane pave with small hard stone from side to side and border by cottage or mean house of white-washed stone join one to another along the whole length of the street with not a tree of course or a blade of grass between the paving-stone the narrow lane be as hot as tophet and reek with a genuine scotch odor be infested with unwashed child and altogether in a state of chronic filth although some woman seem to be hopelessly scrub the threshold of they wretched dwelling i never see a outskirt of a town less fit for a poet 's residence or in which it would be more miserable for any man of cleanly predilection to spend he day we ask for burn 's dwelling and a woman point across the street to a two-story house build of stone and white-washed like its neighbor but perhaps of a little more respectable aspect than most of they though i hesitate in say so it be not a separate structure but under the same continuous roof with the next there be a inscription on the door bear no reference to burn but indicate that the house be now occupy by a ragged or industrial school on knock we be instantly admit by a servant-girl who smile intelligently when we tell we errand and show we into a low and very plain parlor not more than twelve or fifteen foot square a young woman who seem to be a teacher in the school soon appear and tell we that this have be burn 's usual sitting-room and that he have write many of he song here she then lead we up a narrow staircase into a little bed-chamber over the parlor connect with it there be a very small room or windowed closet which burn use as a study and the bedchamber itself be the one where he sleep in he latter life-time and in which he die at last altogether it be a exceedingly unsuitable place for a pastoral and rural poet to live or die in -- even more unsatisfactory than shakspeare 's house which have a certain homely picturesqueness that contrast favorably with the suburban sordidness of the abode before we the narrow lane the paving-stone and the contiguity of wretched hovel be depress to remember and the steam of they -lrb- such be we human weakness -rrb- might almost make the poet 's memory less fragrant as already observe it be a intolerably hot day after leave the house we find we way into the principal street of the town which it may be fair to say be of very different aspect from the wretched outskirt above describe enter a hotel -lrb- in which as a dumfry guide-book assure we prince charle edward have once spend a night -rrb- we rest and refresh ourselves and then set forth in quest of the mausoleum of burn come to st michael 's church we see a man digging a grave and scramble out of the hole he let we into the churchyard which be crowd full of monument they general shape and construction be peculiar to scotland be a perpendicular tablet of marble or other stone within a frame-work of the same material somewhat resemble the frame of a looking-glass and all over the churchyard these sepulchral memorial rise to the height of ten fifteen or twenty foot form quite a impose collection of monument but inscribe with name of small general significance it be easy indeed to ascertain the rank of those who sleep below for in scotland it be the custom to put the occupation of the bury personage -lrb- as skinner shoemaker flesher -rrb- on he tombstone as another peculiarity wife be bury under they maiden name instead of they husband thus give a disagreeable impression that the married pair have bid each other a eternal farewell on the edge of the grave there be a footpath through this crowded churchyard sufficiently well-worn to guide we to the grave of burn but a woman follow behind we who it appear keep the key of the mausoleum and be privileged to show it to stranger the monument be a sort of grecian temple with pilaster and a dome cover a space of about twenty foot square it be formerly open to all the inclemency of the scotch atmosphere but be now protect and shut in by large square of rough glass each pane being of the size of one whole side of the structure the woman unlock the door and admit we into the interior inlaid into the floor of the mausoleum be the gravestone of burn -- the very same that be lay over he grave by jean armor before this monument be build stick against the surround wall be a marble statue of burn at the plough with the genius of caledonium summon the ploughman to turn poet methought it be not a very successful piece of work for the plough be better sculptured than the man and the man though heavy and cloddish be more effective than the goddess we guide inform we that a old man of ninety who know burn certify this statue to be very like the original the bone of the poet and of jean armor and of some of they child lie in the vault over which we stand we guide -lrb- who be intelligent in she own plain way and very agreeable to talk withal -rrb- say that the vault be open about three week ago on occasion of the burial of the eldest son of burn the poet 's bone be disturbed and the dry skull once so brimming over with powerful thought and bright and tender fantasy be take away and keep for several day by a dumfry doctor it have since be deposit in a new leaden coffin and restore to the vault we learn that there be a survive daughter of burn 's eldest son and daughter likewise of the two younger son -- and besides these a illegitimate posterity by the eldest son who appear to have be of disreputable life in he younger day he inherit he father 's failing with some faint shadow i have also understand of the great quality which have make the world tender of he father 's vice and weakness we listen readily enough to this paltry gossip but find that it rob the poet 's memory of some of the reverence that be its due indeed this talk over he grave have very much the same tendency and effect as the home-scene of he life which we have be visit just previously behold he poor mean dwelling and its surroundings and picture he outward life and earthly manifestation from these one do not so much wonder that the people of that day should have fail to recognize all that be admirable and immortal in a disreputable drunken shabbily clothe and shabbily house man consort with associate of damaged character and as he only ostensible occupation gauge the whiskey which he too often taste siding with burn as we need must in he plea against the world let we try to do the world a little justice too it be far easier to know and honor a poet when he fame have take shape in the spotlessness of marble than when the actual man come stagger before you besmear with the sordid stain of he daily life for my part i chiefly wonder that he recognition dawn so brightly while he be still live there must have be something very grand in he immediate presence some strangely impressive characteristic in he natural behavior to have cause he to seem like a demigod so soon as we go back through the churchyard we see a spot where nearly four hundred inhabitant of dumfry be bury during the cholera year and also some curious old monument with raise letter the inscription on which be not sufficiently legible to induce we to puzzle they out but i believe they mark the resting-place of old covenanter some of whom be kill by claverhouse and he fellow-ruffians st michael 's church be of red freestone and be build about a hundred year ago on a old catholic foundation we guide admit we into it and show we in the porch a very pretty little marble figure of a child asleep with a drapery over the lower part from beneath which appear its two baby foot it be truly a sweet little statue and the woman tell we that it represent a child of the sculptor and that the baby -lrb- here still in its marble infancy -rrb- have die more than twenty-six year ago many lady she say especially such as have ever lose a child have shed tear over it it be very pleasant to think of the sculptor bestow the best of he genius and art to re-create he tender child in stone and to make the representation as soft and sweet as the original but the conclusion of the story have something that jar with we awaken sensibility a gentleman from london have see the statue and be so much delighted with it that he buy it of the father-artist after it have lie above a quarter of a century in the church-porch so this be not the real tender image that come out of the father 's heart he have sell that truest one for a hundred guinea and sculptured this mere copy to replace it the first figure be entirely naked in its earthly and spiritual innocence the copy as i have say above have a drapery over the lower limb but after all if we come to the truth of the matter the sleep baby may be as fitly reposited in the drawing-room of a connoisseur as in a cold and dreary church-porch we go into the church and find it very plain and naked without altar-decoration and have its floor quite cover with unsightly wooden pew the woman lead we to a pew cornering on one of the side-aisle and tell we that it use to be burn 's family-pew show we he seat which be in the corner by the aisle it be so situate that a sturdy pillar hide he from the pulpit and from the minister 's eye for robin be no great friend with the minister say she this touch -- he seat behind the pillar and burn himself nod in sermon-time or keenly observant of profane thing -- bring he before we to the life in the corner seat of the next pew right before burn and not more than two foot off sit the young lady on whom the poet see that unmentionable parasite which he have immortalize in song we be ungenerous enough to ask the lady 's name but the good woman could not tell it this be the last thing which we see in dumfry worthy of record and it ought to be note that we guide refuse some money which my companion offer she because i have already pay she what she deem sufficient at the railway-station we spend more than a weary hour wait for the train which at last come up and take we to mauchline we get into a omnibus the only conveyance to be have and drive about a mile to the village where we establish ourselves at the loudoun hotel one of the veriest country-inn which we have find in great britain the town of mauchline a place more redolent of burn than almost any other consist of a street or two of contiguous cottage mostly white-washed and with thatched roof it have nothing sylvan or rural in the immediate village and be as ugly a place as mortal man could contrive to make or to render uglier through a succession of untidy generation the fashion of pave the village-street and patching one shabby house on the gable-end of another quite shut out all verdure and pleasantness but i presume we be not likely to see a more genuine old scotch village such as they use to be in burn 's time and long before than this of mauchline the church stand about midway up the street and be build of red freestone very simple in its architecture with a square tower and pinnacle in this sacred edifice and its churchyard be the scene of one of burn 's most characteristic production -- the holy fair almost directly opposite its gate across the village-street stand posie nansie 's inn where the jolly beggar congregate the latter be a two-story redstone thatched house look old but by no means venerable like a drunken patriarch it have small old-fashioned window and may well have stand for century -- though seventy or eighty year ago when burn be conversant with it i should fancy it might have be something better than a beggar ' alehouse the whole town of mauchline look rusty and time-worn -- even the newer house of which there be several be shadow and darken by the general aspect of the place when we arrive all the wretched little dwelling seem to have belch forth they inhabitant into the warm summer evening everybody be chat with everybody on the most familiar term the bare-legged child gambol or quarrel uproariously and come freely moreover and look into the window of we parlor when we venture out we be follow by the gaze of the whole town : people stand in they door-way old woman pop they head from the chamber-window and stalwart man -- idle on Saturday at e ` en after they week 's hard labor -- clustering at the street-corner merely to stare at we unpretending self except in some remote little town of italy -lrb- where besides the inhabitant have the intelligible stimulus of beggary -rrb- i have never be honor with nearly such a amount of public notice the next forenoon my companion put I to shame by attend church after vainly exhort I to do the like and it be sacrament Sunday and my poor friend be wedge into the farther end of a closely fill pew he be force to stay through the preaching of four several sermon and come back perfectly exhaust and desperate he be somewhat console however on find that he have witness a spectacle of scotch manners identical with that of burn 's holy fair on the very spot where the poet located that immortal description by way of further conformance to the custom of the country we order a sheep 's head and the broth and do penance accordingly and at five o'clock we take a fly and set out for burn 's farm of moss giel moss giel be not more than a mile from mauchline and the road extend over a high ridge of land with a view of far hill and green slope on either side just before we reach the farm the driver stop to point out a hawthorn grow by the way-side which he say be burn 's lousie thorn and i devoutly pluck a branch although i have really forget where or how this illustrious shrub have be celebrate we then turn into a rude gateway and almost immediately come to the farm-house of moss giel stand some fifty yard remove from the high-road behind a tall hedge of hawthorn and considerably overshadow by tree the house be a whitewashed stone cottage like thousand of other in england and scotland with a thatched roof on which grass and weed have intrude a picturesque though alien growth there be a door and one window in front besides another little window that peep out among the thatch close by the cottage and extend back at right angle from it so as to inclose the farm-yard be two other building of the same size shape and general appearance as the house : any one of the three look just as fit for a human habitation as the two other and all three look still more suitable for donkey-stable and pig-sty as we drive into the farm-yard bound on three side by these three hovel a large dog begin to bark at we and some woman and child make they appearance but seem to demur about admit we because the master and mistress be very religious people and have not yet come back from the sacrament at mauchline however it would not do to be turn back from the very threshold of robert burn and as the woman seem to be merely straggle visitor and nobody at all event have a right to send we away we go into the back-door and turn to the right enter a kitchen it show a deplorable lack of housewifely neatness and in it there be three or four child one of whom a girl eight or nine year old hold a baby in she arm she prove to be the daughter of the people of the house and give we what leave she could to look about we thence we step across the narrow mid-passage of the cottage into the only other apartment below-stair a sitting-room where we find a young man eat bread and cheese he inform we that he do not live there and have only call in to refresh himself on he way home from church this room like the kitchen be a noticeably poor one and besides be all that the cottage have to show for a parlor it be a sleeping-apartment have two bed which might be curtain off on occasion the young man allow we liberty -lrb- so far as in he lay -rrb- to go upstairs up we creep accordingly and a few step bring we to the top of the staircase over the kitchen where we find the wretchedest little sleeping-chamber in the world with a sloping roof under the thatch and two bed spread upon the bare floor this most probably be burn 's chamber or perhaps it may have be that of he mother 's servant-maid and in either case this rude floor at one time or another must have creak beneath the poet 's midnight tread on the opposite side of the passage be the door of another attic-chamber opening which i see a considerable number of cheese on the floor the whole house be pervade with a frowzy smell and also a dunghill-odor and it be not easy to understand how the atmosphere of such a dwelling can be any more agreeable or salubrious morally than it appear to be physically no virgin surely could keep a holy awe about she while stow higgledy-piggledy with coarse-natured rustic into this narrowness and filth such a habitation be calculate to make beast of man and woman and it indicate a degree of barbarism which i do not imagine to exist in scotland that a tiller of broad field like the farmer of mauchline should have he abode in a pig-sty it be sad to think of anybody -- not to say a poet but any human being -- sleep eat think pray and spend all he home-life in this miserable hovel but methink i never in the least know how to estimate the miracle of burn 's genius nor he heroic merit for be no worse man until i thus learn the squalid hindrance amid which he develop himself space a free atmosphere and cleanliness have a vast deal to do with the possibility of human virtue the biographer talk of the farm of moss giel as be damp and unwholesome but i do not see why outside of the cottage-wall it should possess so evil a reputation it occupy a high broad ridge enjoy surely whatever benefit can come of a breezy site and sloping far downward before any marshy soil be reach the high hedge and the tree that stand beside the cottage give it a pleasant aspect enough to one who do not know the grimy secret of the interior and the summer afternoon be now so bright that i shall remember the scene with a great deal of sunshine over it leave the cottage we drive through a field which the driver tell we be that in which burn turn up the mouse 's nest it be the inclosure nearest to the cottage and seem now to be a pasture and a rather remarkably unfertile one a little farther on the ground be whiten with a immense number of daisy -- daisy daisy everywhere and in answer to my inquiry the driver say that this be the field where burn run he ploughshare over the daisy if so the soil seem to have be consecrate to daisy by the song which he bestow on that first immortal one i alight and pluck a whole handful of these wee modest crimson-tipped flower which will be precious to many friend in we own country as come from burn 's farm and being of the same race and lineage as that daisy which he turn into a amaranthine flower while seem to destroy it from moss giel we drive through a variety of pleasant scene some of which be familiar to we by they connection with burn we skirt too along a portion of the estate of auchinleck which still belong to the boswell family -- the present possessor be sir jame boswell -lrb- sir jame boswell be now dead -rrb- a grandson of johnson 's friend and son of the sir alexander who be kill in a duel we driver speak of sir jame as a kind free-hearted man but addict to horse-race and similar pastime and a little too familiar with the wine-cup so that poor bozzy 's booziness would appear to have become hereditary in he ancient line there be no male heir to the estate of auchinleck the portion of the land which we see be cover with wood and much undermine with rabbit-warren nor though the territory extend over a large number of acre be the income very considerable by-and-by we come to the spot where burn see miss alexander the lass of ballochmyle it be on a bridge which -lrb- or more probably a bridge that have succeed to the old one and be make of iron -rrb- cross from bank to bank high in air over a deep gorge of the road so that the young lady may have appear to burn like a creature between earth and sky and compound chiefly of celestial element but in honest truth the great charm of a woman in burn 's eye be always she womanhood and not the angelic mixture which other poet find in she we driver point out the course take by the lass of ballochmyle through the shrubbery to a rock on the bank of the lugar where it seem to be the tradition that burn accost she the song imply no such interview lover of whatever condition high or low could desire no lovelier scene in which to breathe they vow : the river flow over its pebbly bed sometimes gleam into the sunshine sometimes hidden deep in verdure and here and there eddy at the foot of high and precipitous cliff this beautiful estate of ballochmyle be still hold by the family of alexander to whom burn 's song have give renown on cheaper term than any other set of people ever attain it how slight the tenure seem a young lady happen to walk out one summer afternoon and cross the path of a neighbor farmer who celebrate the little incident in four or five warm rude -- at least not refine though rather ambitious -- and somewhat ploughman-like verse burn have write hundred of better thing but henceforth for century that maiden have free admittance into the dream-land of beautiful woman and she and all she race be famous i should like to know the present head of the family and ascertain what value if any they put upon the celebrity thus win we pass through catrine know hereabouts as the clean village of scotland certainly as regard the point indicate it have greatly the advantage of mauchline whither we now return without see anything else worth write about there be a rain-storm during the night and in the morning the rusty old sloping street of mauchline be glisten with wet while frequent shower come spatter down the intense heat of many day past be exchange for a chilly atmosphere much more suitable to a stranger 's idea of what scotch temperature ought to be we find after breakfast that the first train northward have already go by and that we must wait till nearly two o'clock for the next i merely venture out once during the forenoon and take a brief walk through the village in which i have leave little to describe its chief business appear to be the manufacture of snuff-box there be perhaps five or six shop or more include those license to sell only tea and tobacco the best of they have the characteristic of village-store in the united state deal in a small way with a extensive variety of article i peep into the open gateway of the churchyard and see that the ground be absolutely stuff with dead people and the surface crowd with gravestone both perpendicular and horizontal all burn 's old mauchline acquaintance be doubtless there and the armor among they except bonny jean who sleep by she poet 's side the family be now extinct in mauchline arrive at the railway-station we find a tall elderly comely gentleman walk to and fro and wait for the train he prove to be a mr alexander -- it may fairly be presume the alexander of ballochmyle a blood-relation of the lovely lass wonderful efficacy of a poet 's verse that could shed a glory from long ago on this old gentleman 's white hair these alexander by-the-by be not a old family on the ballochmyle estate the father of the lass have make a fortune in trade and establish himself as the first land proprietor of he name in these part the original family be name whitefoord we ride to ayr present nothing very remarkable and indeed a cloudy and rainy day take the varnish off the scenery and cause a woful diminution in the beauty and impressiveness of everything we see much of we way lay along a flat sandy level in a southerly direction we reach ayr in the midst of hopeless rain and drive to the king 's arm hotel in the interval of shower i take peep at the town which appear to have many modern or modern-fronted edifice although there be likewise tall gray gabled and quaint-looking house in the by-street here and there betoken a ancient place the town lie on both side of the ayr which be here broad and stately and border with dwelling that look from they window directly down into the pass tide i cross the river by a modern and handsome stone bridge and recross it at no great distance by a venerable structure of four gray arch which must have bestride the stream ever since the early day of scottish history these be the two brigg of ayr whose midnight conversation be overhear by burn while other auditor be aware only of the rush and rumble of the wintry stream among the arch the ancient bridge be steep and narrow and pave like a street and defend by a parapet of red freestone except at the two end where some mean old shop allow scanty room for the pathway to creep between nothing else impress I hereabouts unless i mention that during the rain the woman and girl go about the street of ayr barefoot to save they shoe the next morning wear a lower aspect as if it feel itself destine to be one of many consecutive day of storm after a good scotch breakfast however of fresh herring and egg we take a fly and start at a little past ten for the bank of the doon on we way at about two mile from ayr we draw up at a road-side cottage on which be a inscription to the effect that robert burn be bear within its wall it be now a public-house and of course we alight and enter its little sitting-room which as we at present see it be a neat apartment with the modern improvement of a ceiling the wall be much over-scribbled with name of visitor and the wooden door of a cupboard in the wainscot as well as all the other wood-work of the room be cut and carve with initial letter so likewise be two table which have receive a coat of varnish over the inscription form really curious and interesting article of furniture i have never -lrb- though i do not personally adopt this mode of illustrate my humble name -rrb- feel inclined to ridicule the natural impulse of most people thus to record themselves at the shrine of poet and hero on a panel let into the wall in a corner of the room be a portrait of burn copy from the original picture by nasmyth the floor of this apartment be of board which be probably a recent substitute for the ordinary flag-stone of a peasant 's cottage there be but one other room pertain to the genuine birthplace of robert burn : it be the kitchen into which we now go it have a floor of flag-stone even ruder than those of shakspeare 's house -- though perhaps not so strangely crack and break as the latter over which the hoof of satan himself might seem to have be trample a new window have be open through the wall towards the road but on the opposite side be the little original window of only four small pane through which come the first daylight that shine upon the scottish poet at the side of the room opposite the fireplace be a recess contain a bed which can be hide by curtain in that humble nook of all place in the world providence be please to deposit the germ of the richest human life which mankind then have within its circumference these two room as i have say make up the whole sum and substance of burn 's birthplace : for there be no chamber nor even attic and the thatched roof form the only ceiling of kitchen and sitting-room the height of which be that of the whole house the cottage however be attach to another edifice of the same size and description as these little habitation often be and moreover a splendid addition have be make to it since the poet 's renown begin to draw visitor to the way-side ale-house the old woman of the house lead we through a entry and show a vaulted hall of no vast dimension to be sure but marvellously large and splendid as compare with what might be anticipate from the outward aspect of the cottage it contain a bust of burn and be hung round with picture and engraving principally illustrative of he life and poem in this part of the house too there be a parlor fragrant with tobacco-smoke and no doubt many a noggin of whiskey be here quaff to the memory of the bard who profess to draw so much of he inspiration from that potent liquor we buy some engraving of kirk alloway the bridge of doon and the monument and give the old woman a fee besides and take we leave a very short drive farther bring we within sight of the monument and to the hotel situate close by the entrance of the ornamental grounds within which the former be inclose we ring the bell at the gate of the inclosure but be force to wait a considerable time because the old man the regular superintendent of the spot have go to assist at the lay of the corner-stone of a new kirk he appear anon and admit we but immediately hurry away to be present at the conclude ceremony leave we lock up with burn the inclosure around the monument be beautifully lay out as a ornamental garden and abundantly provide with rare flower and shrubbery all tend with loving care the monument stand on a elevated site and consist of a massive basement-story three-sided above which rise a light and elegant grecian temple -- a mere dome support on corinthian pillar and open to all the wind the edifice be beautiful in itself though i know not what peculiar appropriateness it may have as the memorial of a scottish rural poet the door of the basement-story stand open and enter we see a bust of burn in a niche look keener more refined but not so warm and whole-souled as he picture usually do i think the likeness can not be good in the center of the room stand a glass case in which be reposit the two volume of the little pocket-bible that burn give to highland mary when they pledge they troth to one another it be poorly print on coarse paper a verse of scripture refer to the solemnity and awfulness of vow be write within the cover of each volume in the poet 's own hand and fasten to one of the cover be a lock of highland mary 's golden hair this bible have be carry to america by one of she relative but be send back to be fitly treasured here there be a staircase within the monument by which we ascend to the top and have a view of both brigg of doon the scene of tam o'shanter 's misadventure be close at hand descend we wander through the inclose garden and come to a little building in a corner on enter which we find the two statue of tam and sutor wat -- ponderous stone-work enough yet permeate in a remarkable degree with live warmth and jovial hilarity from this part of the garden too we again behold the old brigg of doon over which tam gallop in such imminent and awful peril it be a beautiful object in the landscape with one high graceful arch ivy-grown and shadow all over and around with foliage when we have wait a good while the old gardener come tell we that he have hear a excellent prayer at lay the corner-stone of the new kirk he now give we some rose and sweetbrier and let we out from he pleasant garden we immediately hasten to kirk alloway which be within two or three minute ' walk of the monument a few step ascend from the road-side through a gate into the old graveyard in the midst of which stand the kirk the edifice be wholly roofless but the side-wall and gable-end be quite entire though portion of they be evidently modern restoration never be there a plainer little church or one with smaller architectural pretension no new england meeting-house have more simplicity in its very self though poetry and fun have clamber and cluster so wildly over kirk alloway that it be difficult to see it as it actually exist by-the-by i do not understand why satan and a assembly of witch should hold they revel within a consecrated precinct but the weird scene have so established itself in the world 's imaginative faith that it must be accept as a authentic incident in spite of rule and reason to the contrary possibly some carnal minister some priest of pious aspect and hidden infidelity have dispel the consecration of the holy edifice by he pretence of prayer and thus make it the resort of unhappy ghost and sorcerer and devil the interior of the kirk even now be apply to quite as impertinent a purpose as when satan and the witch use it as a dancing-hall for it be divide in the midst by a wall of stone-masonry and each compartment have be convert into a family burial-place the name on one of the monument be crawfurd the other bear no inscription it be impossible not to feel that these good people whoever they may be have no business to thrust they prosaic bone into a spot that belong to the world and where they presence jar with the emotion be they sad or gay which the pilgrim bring thither they shut we out from we own precinct too -- from that inalienable possession which burn bestow in free gift upon mankind by take it from the actual earth and annex it to the domain of imagination and here these wretched squatter have lie down to they long sleep after bar each of the two doorway of the kirk with a iron grate may they rest be trouble till they rise and let we in kirk alloway be inconceivably small consider how large a space it fill in we imagination before we see it i pace its length outside of the wall and find it only seventeen of my pace and not more than ten of they in breadth there seem to have be but very few window all of which if i rightly remember be now block up with mason-work of stone one mullion window tall and narrow in the eastern gable might have be see by tam o'shanter blaze with devilish light as he approach along the road from ayr and there be a small and square one on the side nearest the road into which he might have peer as he sit on horseback indeed i could easily have look through it stand on the ground have not the opening be wall up there be a odd kind of belfry at the peak of one of the gable with the small bell still hang in it and this be all that i remember of kirk alloway except that the stone of its material be gray and irregular the road from ayr pass alloway kirk and cross the doon by a modern bridge without swerve much from a straight line to reach the old bridge it appear to have make a bend shortly after pass the kirk and then to have turn sharply towards the river the new bridge be within a minute 's walk of the monument and we go thither and lean over its parapet to admire the beautiful doon flow wildly and sweetly between its deep and wooded bank i never see a lovelier scene although this might have be even lovelier if a kindly sun have shine upon it the ivy-grown ancient bridge with its high arch through which we have a picture of the river and the green bank beyond be absolutely the most picturesque object in a quiet and gentle way that ever bless my eye bonny doon with its wooded bank and the bough dip into the water the memory of they at this moment affect I like the song of bird and burn croon some verse simple and wild in accordance with they native melody it be impossible to depart without cross the very bridge of tam 's adventure so we go thither over a now disused portion of the road and standing on the center of the arch gather some ivy-leaf from that sacred spot this do we return as speedily as might be to ayr whence take the rail we soon behold ailsa craig rise like a pyramid out of the sea draw nearer to glasgow ben lomond hove in sight with a dome-like summit support by a shoulder on each side but a man be better than a mountain and we have be hold intercourse if not with the reality at least with the stalwart ghost of one amid the scene where he live and sing we shall appreciate he better as a poet hereafter for there be no writer whose life as a man have so much to do with he fame and throw such a necessary light upon whatever he have produce henceforth there will be a personal warmth for we in everything that he write and like he countryman we shall know he in a kind of personal way as if we have shake hand with he and feel the thrill of he actual voice \* \* \* \* \* pasquin and pasquinade at a angle of the palace which pius vi -lrb- braschus -rrb- with paternal liberality build for the residence of he family before the french revolution put a end to such beneficence stand the famous statue of pasquin give its name to the square upon which it look it be little more now than a mere trunk of marble bear the mark of blow and long hard usage but even in this mutilate condition it show trace of excellent workmanship and of pristine beauty the connoisseur in sculpture praise it -lrb- 1 -rrb- and the antiquary have embittered they ignorance in regard to it by discussion as to whether it be a statue of hercule of alexander the great or of menelaus bear the body of patroclus disabled and maim as it be it be thus only the more fitting type of the roman people of which it have be so long the acknowledged mouthpiece and the epigram and satire which have make its name famous have gain a additional point and a sharper sting from the patent resemblance in the condition of they profess author to that of those for whom he speak it be say to have be about the beginning of the sixteenth century that the statue be discover and dig up near the place where it now stand and the earliest account of it seem to be that give by castelvetro in 1553 in he discourse upon a _ canzone _ by annibal caro he say that antonio tibaldeo of ferrara a venerable and lettered man relate concern this statue that there use to be in rome a tailor very skilful in he trade by the name of pasquin who have a shop which be much frequent by prelate courtier and other people so that he employ a great number of workman who like worthless fellow spend they time in speak ill of one person or another spare no one and finding opportunity for jest in observe those who come to the shop this custom become so notorious that the very person who be hit by these sharp speech join in the laugh at they and feel no resentment so that if any one wish to say a hard thing of another he do it under cover of the person of master pasquin pretend that he have hear it say at he shop -- at which pretence every one laugh and no one bear a grudge but master pasquin die it happen that in improve the street this broken statue which lay half imbed in the ground serve as a stepping-stone for passenger be take up and set at the side of the shop make use of this good chance satirical people begin to say that master pasquin have come back the custom soon arise of attach to the statue bit of write and as it have be allow to the tailor to say everything so by means of the statue any one might publish what he would not have venture to speak -lrb- 2 -rrb- thus do hercule or alexander change he name for that of pasquin and soon become almost as well know throughout europe under he new designation as under he old if the statue be not dig up as be say until the sixteenth century its fame spread rapidly for before luther have make himself fear at rome pasquin be already well know as the satirist of the vice of pope and cardinal and as a bold enemy of the abuse of the church but the history of pasquin be not a mere story of roman jest nor be its interest such alone as may arise from a amusing though neglect series of literary anecdote in the dearth of material for the popular history of modern rome it be of value as afford indication of the turn of feeling and the opinion of the roman and of the regard in which they hold they ruler the free speech which be prohibit and dangerous to the living subject of the temporal power of the pope be a privilege which in spite of prohibition pasquin insist upon exercise whatever precaution might be take whatever penalty impose means be always find when occasion arise to affix to the battered marble papers bear stinging epigram or satirical verse which once read fasten themselves in the memory and spread quickly by repetition he could not be silence great sum say he one day in a epigram address to paul iii who be pope from 1534 to 1549 great sum be formerly give to poet for singing : how much will you give I o paul to be silent ut canerent datum multa olim sunt vatibus aera : ut taceam quantum tu mihi paule dabi in he life of adrian vi the successor of leo x paulus jovius not indeed the most trustworthy of authority tell a story which if not true might well be so he say that the pope be vex at the free speech of pasquin propose to have he throw into the tiber think thus to stop he tongue but the spanish legate dissuade he by suggest with grave spanish wisdom that all the frog of the river become infect with he spirit would adopt he style of speech and croak only pasquinade the contemptibleness of the assailant make he the more dreaded do not the very reed tell the fatal secret about king mida pasquin be by no mean the only figure in rome who give expression to thought and feeling which it would have be dangerous to the living subject of the ecclesiastical rule to utter aloud he most distinguished companion be marforio a colossal statue of a ocean or river god which be discover in the sixteenth century near the forum of mar from which he derive he name toward the end of the same century he be place in the lower court of the palazzo de ' conservatorus on the capitol and here he have since remain dialogue be often carry on between he and he friend pasquin and a share in they conversation be sometimes take by the facchino or so call porter of the palazzo piombino in he roma nova publish in 1660 sprenger say that pasquin be assign to the noble marforio to the citizen and the facchino to the common people but besides these there be the abate luigus of the palazzo valle -- madama lucrezium who still sit behind the venetian palace near the church of st mark -- the baboon from which the via babbuino take its name -- and the marble portrait of scanderbeg the great enemy of the turk on the _ façade _ of the house which he at one time occupy in rome each of these personage now and then issue a epigram or take part in the satirical talk of he companion such a number of cold and secure censor be not surprising in a city like rome where the check upon open speech be so many and where priest and spy exercise so close a scrutiny over the thought and word of man oppression beget hypocrisy and a tyrant add to the fault of he subject the vice of cowardice and secrecy caustic forsyth speaking of the roman begin with the bitter remark that the national character be the most ruin thing at rome and in the same section he add they humor be naturally caustic but they lampoon as they stab only in the dark the danger attend open attack force they to confine they satire within epigram and thus pasquinade be but the offspring of hypocrisy the only resource of wit who be oblige to be grave on so many absurdity in religion and respectful to so many upstart in purple thus if the roman lampoon only in the dark the fault be to be charge against they ruler rather than themselves the talent for sarcastic epigram be hereditary with the people the pointed style of martial be hand down through successive generation the epigram in he hand be no longer a mere inscription a idyl or a elegy it have lose its ancient grace but it take on a new energy and it set the model which the later roman know well how to copy of satire condensed into wit in line each of whose word have a sting the first true pasquinade -- that be the first of the epigram which be affix to pasquin and hence derive they name -- be perhaps those which belong to the reign of leo x we at least have find no earlier one of undoubted genuineness but satire similar to those of pasquin and possibly originate with he as they now go under the general name of pasquinade be publish against the pope who precede leo the infamous alexander vi the pope who have make he name synonymous with the worst infamy that disgrace mankind be not spare the attack of the subject whom he and he child not unworthy of such a father degrade and abused two line could say much : -- sextus tarquinius sextus nero sextus et iste : semper sub sextis perdita roma fuit sextus tarquinius sextus nero this also a sextus -lrb- alexander sextus that be alexander the sixth -rrb- : always under the sextus have rome be ruin and as if this be not enough another distich strike with more directness at the vice of the pope : -- vendit alexander clave altaria christum : emerat ille prius vendere jure potest alexander sell the key the altar christ he buy they first and have good right to sell -lrb- 3 -rrb- alexander have gain he election by bribe which he do not pay and promise which he do not keep and guicciardinus tell in a few word what use he make of he holy office declare that with he immoderate ambition and poison infidelity together with all the horrible example of cruelty luxury and monstrous covetousness selling without distinction both holy thing and profane thing he infect the whole world -lrb- 4 -rrb- in 1503 after a pontificate of eleven year alexander die rome rejoice peace which for a long time have be banish from she border return and she enjoy for a few day unwonted freedom from alarm and trouble she happiness find expression in verse : -- dic unde alecto pax haec effulsit et unde tam subito reticent proelium sextus obit say whence alecto have this peace shone forth wherefore so suddenly have the noise of battle cease alexander be dead the rule of borgium 's successor pius iii last only twenty-seven day afford little opportunity to the play of indignant wit but the nine year ' reign of julius ii which follow be a period whose troubled history be record in the numerous epigram and satire to which it give birth the impulsive and passionate vigor of the character of julius the various fortune of he rash enterprise the trouble which he stormy and rapacious career bring to the papal city be all more or less minutely tell the pope begin he reign with warlike enterprise and as soon as he could gather sufficient force he set out to recover from the venetian territory of which they have possession and which he claim as the property of the papal state it be say that in lead he troops out of rome he throw into the tiber with characteristic impetuosity the key of peter and draw he sword from its sheath declare that henceforth he would trust to the sword of paul the story be too good to be lose and it give point to many epigram of which perhaps the one preserve by bayle be the best : -- cum petri nihil efficiant ad proelium clave auxilio paulus forsitan ensis erit since the key of peter profit not for battle perchance with the aid of paul the sword will answer -lrb- 5 -rrb- julius be the first of the pope of recent time to allow he beard to grow and raphael 's noble portrait of he show what dignity it give to he strongly marked face the beard be also regard traditionally as have belong to saint paul for I the pope be represent as say for I the beard of paul the sword of paul all thing of paul : that key-bearer peter be no way to my liking huc barbam paulus gladium paulus omnia paulus : claviger ille nihil ad mea vota petrus but the most savage epigram against julius be one that recall the name of the great roman which the pope be suppose to have adopt in emulation of that of alexander bear by he predecessor : -- julius est romae quid abest date numina brutum nam quoty romae est julius illum perit julius be at rome what be want ye god give we a brutus for when julius be at rome the city be lose pasquin become a recognize institution as we have say under leo x and be take under the protection of the roman people -lrb- 6 -rrb- he popularity be such as to lead to consequence of which he himself complain he be make the vehicle of the effusion of worthless versifier and he be force to cry out woe be I even the copyist fix he verse upon I and every one bestow on I he silly trifle the application of these verse be alike appropriate to the life of the pope or to the reign of alexander vi julius ii and the one just begin I miserum copista etiam mihi carmina figit et tribuit nugas jam mihus quisque sua he seem to have be successful in put a stop to this injurious treatment for not long after he declare with a sarcasm direct against the prominent quality of he fellow-citizen there be no better man at rome than i i seek nothing from any one i be not wordy i sit here and be silent non homo I melior rome est ego nil peto ab ullo non sum verbosus hic sedeo et taceo it have become the custom upon occasion of public festivity to adorn pasquin with suit of garment and with paint force he to assume from time to time different character accord to the fancy of he protector sometimes he appear as neptune sometimes as chance or fate as apollo or bacchus thus in the year 1515 he become orpheus and while adorn with the _ plectrum _ and the lyre of the poet marforio address a distich to he in he new character which hint at the popular appreciation of the pope the year 1515 be that of the descent of franci i into italy and of the bloody battle of marignano in the midst of war and slaughter and the sound of trumpet say marforio you sing and strike you lyre : this be to understand the temper of you lord inter bellum tuba caede cani ipse lyramque percuti hoc sapere est ingenium domini -lrb- 7 -rrb- but the character of most of those pasquinade which belong to the pontificate of leo be so coarse as to render they unfit for reproduction a general licentiousness pervade rome and the vice of the pope and the higher clergy veil but not hide under the display of sensual magnificence and the pretended refinement of degraded art be readily imitate by a people teach to follow and obey the teaching of they ecclesiastical ruler corruption of every sort be common virtue and vice profane and sacred thing be alike for sale the pope make money by the sale of cardinalate and traffic in indulgence give I gift ye spectator beg pasquin bring I not verse : divine money alone rule the ethereal god dona date astante versus ne reddite : sola imperat aethereis alma moneta dei leo 's fondness for buffoon with whom he mercilessly amuse himself by torment they and exciting they to make themselves ridiculous be record in a question put to pasquin on one of he change of figure why have you not ask o pasquil to be make a buffoon for at rome everything be now permit to the buffoon cur non te fingus scurram pasquille rogâsti cum romae scurris omnia jam liceant leo die in 1521 he death be sudden and not without suspicion of poison it be say that the last office of the church be not perform for the die man and a epigram sharply embody the report do you ask why at he last hour leo could not take the sacred thing he have sell they sacra sub extremâ si forte requiritis horâ cur leo non potuit sumere : vendiderat the spirit of luther have penetrate through the wall of rome and though all tongue but those of statue might be silence eye be not blind nor could ear be make deaf nowhere be the need of reform so feel as at rome but nowhere be there so little hope for it for the people stand in equal need of it with the church whose minister have corrupt they and whose ruler tyrannize over they farewell rome say pasquin roma vale satis est vidisse revertar quum leno meretrix scurra cinaedus ero when leo 's short-lived successor the gloomy fleming adrian vi who be the author of the proposal to destroy pasquin despatch he nuncio to the diet of nuremberg to oppose the progress of luther he tell he in he instruction to avow frankly that god have permit this schism and this persecution on account of the sin of man and above all of those of the priest and the prelate of the church pasquin could not have improve on these word and when twenty month after he elevation to the papacy this hard old man die the inscription -- which he order to be put upon he tomb be in word fit to disarm the satirist : -- here lie adrian vi who esteem nothing in he life more unhappy than that he have be call to rule : _ adrianus vi hîc situs est qui nil sibi infelicius in vitâ quam quod imperaret duxit during the pontificate of clement vii rome suffer under calamity too terrible and too depressing to admit of the frequent display of the humor or the satire of pasquin the siege and sack of the city by the army of the constable de bourbon work too much misery to be set in verse or to be sharpen in epigram one shrewd jest of this time have indeed be preserve clement be for month a prisoner in the castle of sant ' angelo unable to stir abroad _ papa non potest errare _ say pasquin or one of he friend with a play on the double meaning of the last word and a scoff at papal pretension : the pope can not err : he be too well guard to stray but when the pope die in 1534 pasquin do not spare he memory he have lately change he physician and take one name matteo curzio or curtius and when he death take place not without suspicion of malpractice the satisfaction of the people be express by the appearance of a portrait of this new doctor with the inscription in word borrow from the vulgate _ ecce agnus dei ecce qui tollit peccata mundi _ curtius have kill clement say pasquin curtius who have secure the public health should be reward curti occidit clementem curtius auro donandus per quem publica parta salus nor be this all pasquin declare that on occasion of clement 's death a bitter strife arise between pluto and saint peter as to which should receive the pope : -- noluit hunc coelum noluit hunc barathrum the saint have no place for he and the ruler of the lower region fear the disturbance that he will make in hell the quarrel be cut short by the arrival of clement himself upon the spot who find no entrance into heaven declare that he will force himself into hell : -- tartara tentemus facili descensus averni the fifteen year of the pontificate of clement 's successor paul iii -- year for the most part of quiet and prosperity at rome -- afford ample opportunity for the display of pasquin 's spirit the personal character of the pope the exaction which he lay upon the roman for the profit of he favorite and he family and he unblushing nepotism be the subject of frequent satire the farnese palace build in great part with stone take from the colosseum be a standing monument of the justice of pasquin 's rebuke the sharpness of which be concentrate in a single tell epigram let we pray for pope paul say pasquin for zeal for he house be consume he : -- oremus pro papâ paulo quium zelus domus sua comedit illum at another time marforio address a letter to pasquin in which he tell he of the pope 's reply to a angel who have be send to he with the message feed my sheep charity begin at home have be the answer of the pope and when the roman people have pray paul to have pity on he people paul have reply it be not right to take the child 's bread and give it to dog but pasquin be now to be bring into greater notoriety than ever in spite of the effort of the successor of adrian the reformation have rapidly advance and the reformer scorn no weapon that might serve they cause determine to turn the wit of pasquin to they account in the year 1544 a little but thick volume appear with the title pasquillorum tomus duo it bear no name of editor or printer and profess to be publish at eleutheropolis the city of freedom or as it might be render in a free translation the city of _ luther _ its 637 page be fill with satire it be not merely a collection of pasquin 's saying but it contain epigram and dialogue derive from other source as well the book be of a kind to be popular as well as to excite the bitterest aversion of the adherent of the roman church it long since become a volume of excessive rarity most of the copy have be destroy by zealous romanist the famous scholar daniel heinsius within a century after its publication believe that a copy which he purchase at a cost of a hundred ducat be the only one remain in the world and he inscribe the follow line upon one of its blank page : -- roma meo fratre igni dedit unica phoenix vivo aureis venio centum heinsio rome give my brother to the fire a solitary phoenix i survive and at cost of a hundred gold piece i come to heinsius but heinslus be mistake in suppose he copy to be unique and bibliographer of later date while mark the rarity of the book have record its existence in various library at this moment two copy be lie before we probably the only copy in america -lrb- 8 -rrb- the editor of this publication be the piedmontese scholar and reformer coelius secundus curio he early life have be eventful and he have experience the tender mercy of the roman church he have be persecute he property have be seize he himself compel to fly on account of he liberal view he have be in the prison of the inquisition from which he have escape only by a successful and ingenious stratagem at length wearied with contention he take up he abode in protestant switzerland where he pass in quiet the latter year of he useful and honor life -lrb- 9 -rrb- it be while here that he compile this book and send it as a missile into the camp of he opponent the enemy of freedom of thought and of the right of private judgment from this time pasquin 's fame become universal the word _ pasquil _ or _ pasquinade _ be adopt info almost every european tongue and soon embrace in they widen signification all sort of satiric epigram a great part of the volume publish by curio be make up indeed of attack on the roman church which have no connection with pasquin as they author the style and the subject of many of they betray a german origin and some of the longer piece so closely resemble in point in humor and in expression the celebrated epistola obscurorum virorum that there can be little doubt that ulrich von hutten or some one of he coadjutor in that clever satire on the monk and clergy have a hand in they composition -lrb- 10 -rrb- but leave the pasquinade of other people let we come back to the saying of pasquin himself no one have surpass he in he own way and he store of epigram illustrate life and manners at rome be abundant the pontificate of sixtus v from 1585 to 1590 be full of material for he wit the only man in rome who do not tremble under the rod with which this hard old monk rule he people and the church be the free-spoken marble jester the very morning after the election of sixtus pasquin appear with a plate of toothpick and to the question of marforio what he be do with they he reply i be take they to alexandrino medici and rusticuccus the three cardinal who have be most active in secure the papacy for the new pope the point of the joke be plain to the roman : it mean that he adherent instead of gain anything by they effort have be deceive and would have nothing to do now but to pick they tooth at leisure letus in he entertaining and gossipping life of this most merciless of pope tell a story of another pasquinade which exhibit the temper of sixtus one morning pasquin appear clothe in a very dirty shirt and upon be ask by marforio why he wear such foul linen reply he could get no other for the pope have make he washerwoman a princess -- mean thereby the pope 's sister donna camillum who have formerly be a laundress but be now establish with a fortune and a palace this stinging piece of raillery be carry directly to he holiness who order a strict search to be make for the author but to no purpose upon which he stick up print papers in all the public place of the city promising upon the word of a pope to give the author of the pasquinade a thousand pistole and he life provide he would discover himself but threaten to hang he if he be find out by any one else and offer the thousand pistole to the informer upon this the author be simple enough to make confession and to demand the money sixtus pay he the sum and then say that he have indeed promise he he life but not freedom from punishment order he hand to be cut off and he tongue to be bore to prevent he from be so witty for the future this act say letus fill every one with terror and amazement and well might such a piece of oriental barbarity excite the horror of the roman -lrb- 11 -rrb- pasquin however be not alarmed and a few day afterward he appear hold a wet shirt to dry in the sun it be a Sunday morning and marforio naturally surprise at such a violation of the day ask he why he could not wait till Monday before dry it pasquin answer that there be no time to lose for if he wait till to-morrow to dry he shirt he might have to pay for the sunshine -- hint at the heavy tax which sixtus have lay upon the necessaries of life and from which the sunshine itself might not long be exempt it be near about this time that a caricature be circulate in rome represent sixtus as king stork and the roman as frog vainly attempt to escape from he devour beak _ merito haec patimur _ we suffer deservedly be the legend of the picture and the moral it convey be a true one rome be in such a state as to require the harshest application and the despotic severity of sixtus do much to restore decency and security to life he leave the roman in a far better condition than he find they and it would have be well for rome if among he successor there have be more to follow he example in repress vice and violence -- in a word have there be more king stork and fewer king log the most poetic of pasquinade and one in which wit rise into imagination belong to the pontificate of urban viii -lrb- 1623-1644 -rrb- this pope issue a bull excommunicate all person who take snuff in the church of seville whereupon pasquin quote the follow verse from job -lrb- xiii 25 -rrb- : -- _ contra folium _ _ quod vento rapitur ostendis potentiam tuam et stipulam siccam persequeris _ this be a very model of satire in its kind and of a higher kind than the pasquil which coleridge quote as a example of wit upon the pope who have employ a committee to rip up the error of he predecessor some one place a pair of spur on the statue of st peter and a label from the opposite statue of st paul _ st paul _ whither then be you bind _ st peter _ i apprehend danger here -- they 'll soon call I in question for deny my master _ st paul _ nay then i have better be off too for they 'll question I for have persecute the christian before my conversion -lrb- 12 -rrb- in he distinction between the wit of thought of word and of image coleridge assert that the first belong eminently to the italian such broad assertion be always open to exception and pasquin show that the roman at least be not less clever in the wit of word than in that of thought take for example the jest on innocent x which howel report in one of he entertaining letter this pope who say the candid historian mosheim to a profound ignorance of all those thing which it be necessary for a christian bishop to know join the most shameless indolence and the most notorious profligacy abandon he person he dignity and he government to the disposal of donna olympium maldachinus the widow of he brother the portrait of the pope may be see in the dorium gallery at rome for it be still esteem a honor by the noble family to which the gallery belong to be able to trace a relationship to a pope even though so vile a one as innocent _ magi amat papa olympiam quam olympum _ say pasquin and the pun still cling to the memory of he whom he authorized biographer call _ religiosissimo nelle cose divine e prudentissimo nelle umane _ but superlative often have a value in inverse ratio to they intention there be a curious story tell by the catholic historian novae that after the death of innocent which take place in 1655 no one could be find willing to assume the charge of bury he word be send to donna olympium that she should provide a coffin for the corpse but she reply that she be only a poor widow of the cardinal he have make of the relation he have enrich none be to be find who have charity enough to treat he remains with decency he body be take to a room where some mason be at work and one of they out of compassion put a tallow candle at its head while another fear lest the mouse of which there be many in the apartment might disturb the corpse secure a person to watch it through the night at length one of the officer of the court procure a cheap coffin and one of the canon of saint peter 's give five crown to pay the expense of the burial -lrb- 13 -rrb- a moralist might comment on this story and might compare it with another which be tell in a life of innocent write during the reign of he successor and publish with approval at rome in this we be tell that at the time of he death a marvellous prodigy be observe for that when he corpse be bear on a bier from monte cavallo to the vatican at the moment of a violent storm of wind and rain not a drop of water fall upon it but the bier remain perfectly dry and the torch with which it be accompany be none of they extinguish what wonder that after this it be add that he memory be venerate in many place at rome -lrb- 14 -rrb- of all the troublesome race of panegyrist the roman variety be the most ingenious and the least to be trust when bishop burnet be travel in italy in the year 1686 the doctrine of the spanish priest molino the founder of the famous sect of quietist have lately become the object of attack of the jesuit and of suspicion at the papal court he system of mystical divinity be still of interest from its connection with the life of fénelon and madame guyon if not from its intrinsic character like most other mystical doctrine he teaching seem to have be open to the charge that while professedly base on the highest spirituality they have a direct tendency to encourage sensuality in its most dangerous form molino be at first much favor at rome and by the pope himself but at the time of burnet 's journey he be in the custody of the holy office while he book be undergo the examination which finally lead to the formal condemnation of sixty-eight proposition contain in they to the renunciation of these proposition by they author and to he be sentence to perpetual imprisonment burnet relate that it happen in one week that one man have be condemn to the galley for somewhat he have say another have be hang for somewhat he have writ and molino be clapt in prison whose doctrine consist chiefly in this that man ought to bring they mind to a state of inward quietness the pasquinade upon all this be _ si parliamo in galere si scrivemmo impiccatus si stiamo in quiete all ' sant uffizio eh che bisogna fare _ if we speak the galley if we write the gallows if we stay quiet the inquisition eh what must we do then with the change of time and the succession of pope new material be constantly afford to pasquin for the exercise of he peculiar talent each generation give he fresh subject for laughter or for rebuke man quickly pass away but folly and vice remain do you wonder say pasquin once in he early day refer to he change of character do you wonder why rome yearly change I to a new figure it be because of the shift manners of the city and the fall back of man he who would be pious must depart from rome praeterien forsan mirari turba quotanni cur I roma novam mutet in effigiem hoc urbis mores varios hominumque recessus indicat : ergo abeat quus cupit esse pius during the eighteenth century italy do not abound in poet or wit and master pasquin seem to have share in the dulness of the time toward its end however when pius vi be build the palace under the corner of which the statue be to find shelter the marble representative of the tailor watch he proceedings with sharp observation long ago he have rebuke the nepotism of the pope but pius have forget he epigram cerberus he have say have three mouth with which he bark but you have three or even four which bark not but devour tre habuit fauce et terno cerberus ore latratus intra tartara nigra dabat et tibi plena fame trium sunt vel quatuor os quae nulli latrant quemque sed illum vorant every one who have be in rome remember how often on the repair of ancient monument and on the pedestal of statue or bust be to be see the word _ munificentiâ pius sextus _ thrust themselves into notice and occupy the place which should be fill with some nobler inscription the bad taste and impertinence of this epigraph be often enhance by the slightness of the work or the gift which it commemorate during a season of dearth at rome in the time of pius when the baker have reduce the size of they loaf pasquin take the opportunity to satirize the selfishness and vanity of the pope by exhibit one of these diminish loaf bear the familiar word _ munificentiâ pii vi _ the french revolution the napoleonic occupation of rome the brilliant essay of liberalism of pius ix the republic the siege of rome the reactionary government of late year have alike supply matter for master pasquin which he have shape accord to the fashion of the time he still pursue he ancient avocation _ re acu tetigit _ but the point of the needle be not the means by which the rent in the garment of rome be to be mend -- much less by which she wound be to be cauterize and heal the sharp satiric tongue may prick she moral sense into restlessness but the roman spirit be not thus to be rouse to action still pasquin deserve credit for he effort and while other liberty be deny the roman may be glad that there be a single voice that can not be silence and a single censor who be not to be corrupt -lrb- footnote 1 : berninus be ask what be the most beautiful statue in rome reply that of pasquin this reply the sensible milizium tax with affectation -- say that although a artist may discover in the work some mark of good design it be now too maim to pass for a beautiful statue possibly berninus be think of he own work in comparison with it -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : andrea schott -- who publish a itinerary of italy about the beginning of the seventeenth century copy this account and add -- at present this custom

origination like the institution of any other natural state or order be beyond we immediate ken we see or may learn how thing go on we can only frame hypothesis as to how they begin two hypothesis divide the scientific world very unequally upon the origin of the exist diversity of the plant and animal which surround we one assume that the actual kind be primordial the other that they be derivative one that all kind originate supernaturally and directly as such and have continue unchanged in the order of nature the other that the present kind appear in some sort of genealogical connection with other and earlier kind that they become what they now be in the course of time and in the order of nature or bring in the word _ species _ which be well define as the perennial succession of individual commonly of very like individual -- as a close corporation of individual perpetuate by generation instead of election -- and reduce the question to mathematical simplicity of statement : species be line of individual come down from the past and run on to the future -- line recede therefore from we view in either direction within we limited view they appear to be parallel line as a general thing neither approach to nor diverge from each other the first hypothesis assume that they be parallel from the unknown beginning and will be to the unknown end the second hypothesis assume that the apparent parallelism be not real and complete at least aboriginally but approximate or temporary that we should find the line convergent in the past if we could trace they far enough that some of they if produce back would fall into certain fragment of line which have leave trace in the past lie not exactly in the same direction and these farther back into other to which they be equally unparallel it will also claim that the present line whether on the whole really or only approximately parallel sometimes fork or send off branch on one side or the other produce new line -lrb- variety -rrb- which run for a while and for aught we know indefinitely when not interfere with near and approximately parallel to the parent line this claim it can establish and it may also show that these close subsidiary line may branch or vary again and that those branch or variety which be best adapt to the existing condition may be continue while other stop or die out and so we may have the basis of a real _ theory _ of the _ diversification _ of species and here indeed there be a real though a narrow established ground to build upon but as system of organic nature both be equally _ hypothesis _ be supposition of what there be no proof of from experience assume in order to account for the observe phenomenon and support by such indirect evidence as can be have even when the upholder of the former and more popular system mix up revelation with scientific discussion -- which we decline to do -- they by no means thereby render they view other than hypothetical agree that plant and animal be produce by omnipotent fiat do not exclude the idea of natural order and what we call secondary cause the record of the fiat -- let the earth bring forth grass the herb yield seed etc and it be so let the earth bring forth the living creature after he kind cattle and creep thing and beast of the earth after he kind and it be so -- seem even to imply they agree that they be form of the dust of the ground and of thin air only lead to the conclusion that the pristine individual be corporeally constitute like exist individual produce through natural agency to agree that they be create after they kind determine nothing as to what be the original kind nor in what mode during what time and in what connection it please the almighty to introduce the first individual of each sort upon the earth scientifically consider the two oppose doctrine be equally hypothetical the two view very unequally divide the scientific world so that believer in the divine right of majority need not hesitate which side to take at least for the present up to a time within the memory of a generation still on the stage two hypothesis about the nature of light very unequally divide the scientific world but the small minority have already prevail : the emission theory have go out the undulatory or wave theory after some fluctuation have reach high tide and be now the pervade the fully established system there be a intervene time during which most physicist hold they opinion in suspense the adoption of the undulatory theory of light call for the extension of the same theory to heat electricity and magnetism and this promptly suggest the hypothesis of a correlation material connection and transmutability of heat light electricity magnetism etc which hypothesis the physicist hold in absolute suspense until very lately but be now generally adopt if not already establish as a system it promise soon to become so at least it be generally receive as a tenable and probably true hypothesis parallel to this however less cogent the reason darwin and other have show it likely that some variety of plant or animal have diverge in time into cognate species or into form as different as species be lead to infer that all species of a genus may have thus diverge from a common stock and thence to suppose a higher community of origin in age still farther back and so on follow the safe example of the physicist and acknowledge the fact of the diversification of a once homogeneous species into variety we may receive the theory of the evolution of these into species even while for the present we hold the hypothesis of a further evolution in cool suspense or in grave suspicion in respect to very many question a wise man 's mind rest long in a state neither of belief nor of unbelief but you intellectually short-sighted people be apt to be preternaturally clear-sighted and to find they way very plain to positive conclusion upon one side or the other of every mooted question in fact most people and some philosopher refuse to hold question in abeyance however incompetent they may be to decide they and curiously enough the more difficult recondite and perplexing the question or hypothesis be such for instance as those about organic nature the more impatient they be of suspense sometimes and evidently in the present case this impatience grow out of a fear that a new hypothesis may endanger cherish and most important belief impatience under such circumstance be not unnatural though perhaps needless and if so unwise to we the present revival of the derivative hypothesis in a more winning shape than it ever before have be not unexpected we wonder that any thoughtful observer of the course of investigation and of speculation in science should not have foresee it and have learn at length to take its inevitable come patiently the more so as in darwin 's treatise it come in a purely scientific form address only to scientific man the notoriety and wide popular perusal of this treatise appear to have astonish the author even more than the book itself have astonish the reading world come as the new presentation do from a naturalist of acknowledged character and ability and mark by a conscientiousness and candor which have not always be reciprocate we have think it simply right to set forth the doctrine as fairly and as favorably as we could there be plenty to decry it and the whole theory be widely expose to attack for the argument on the other side we may look to the numerous adverse publication which darwin 's volume have already call out and especially to those review which propose directly to refute it take various line and reflect very diverse mode of think these hostile critic may be expect to concentrate and enforce the principal objection which can be bring to bear against the derivative hypothesis in general and darwin 's new exposition of it in particular upon the opposing side of the question we have read with attention 1 a article in the north american review for April last 2 one in the christian examiner boston for may 3 m pictet 's article in the bibliothèque universelle which we have already make considerable use of which seem throughout most able and correct and which in tone and fairness be admirably in contrast with 4 the article in the edinburgh review for may attribute -- although against a large amount of internal presumptive evidence -- to the most distinguished british comparative anatomist 5 a article in the north british review for may 6 finally professor agassiz have afford a early opportunity to peruse the criticism he make in the forthcoming third volume of he great work by a publication of they in advance in the american journal of science for July in we survey of the lively discussion which have be raise it matter little how we own particular opinion may incline but we may confess to a impression thus far that the doctrine of the permanent and complete immutability of species have not be establish and may fairly be doubt we believe that species vary and that natural selection work but we suspect that its operation like every analogous natural operation may be limit by something else just as every species by its natural rate of reproduction would soon fill any country it could live in but do not be check by some other species or some other condition -- so it may be surmise that variation and natural selection have they struggle and consequent check or be limit by something inherent in the constitution of organic being we be dispose to rank the derivative hypothesis in its fulness with the nebular hypothesis and to regard both as allowable as not unlikely to prove tenable in spite of some strong objection but as not therefore demonstrably true those if any there be who regard the derivative hypothesis as satisfactorily prove must have loose notion as to what proof be those who imagine it can be easily refute and cast aside must we think have imperfect or very prejudiced conception of the fact concern and of the question at issue we be not dispose nor prepare to take side for or against the new hypothesis and so perhaps occupy a good position from which to watch the discussion and criticize those objection which be seemingly inconclusive on survey the argument urge by those who have undertake to demolish the theory we have be most impressed with a sense of they great inequality some strike we as excellent and perhaps unanswerable some as incongruous with other view of the same writer other when carry out as incompatible with general experience or general belief and therefore as prove too much still other as prove nothing at all : so that on the whole the effect be rather confusing and disappointing we certainly expect a stronger adverse case than any which the thorough-going opposer of darwin appear to have make out wherefore if it be find that the new hypothesis have grow upon we favor as we proceed this must be attribute not so much to the force of the argument of the book itself as to the want of force of several of those by which it have be assail darwin 's argument we might resist or adjourn but some of the refutation of it give we more concern than the book itself do these remark apply mainly to the philosophical and theological objection which have be elaborately urge almost exclusively by the american reviewer the north british reviewer indeed roundly denounce the book as atheistical but evidently deem the case too clear for argument the edinburgh reviewer on the contrary scout all such objection -- as well he may since he record he belief in a continuous creative operation a constantly operate secondary creational law through which species be successively produce and he emit faint but not indistinct glimmering of a transmutation theory of he own -lrb- 1 -rrb- so that he be equally expose to all the philosophical objection advance by agassiz and to most of those urge by the other american critic against darwin himself propose now to criticize the critic so far as to see what they most general and comprehensive objection amount to we must need begin with the american reviewer and with they argument adduce to prove that a derivative hypothesis _ ought not to be true _ or be not possible philosophical or theistic it must not be forget that on former occasion very confident judgment have be pronounce by very competent person which have not be finally ratify of the two great mind of the seventeenth century newton and leibnitz both profoundly religious as well as philosophical one produce the theory of gravitation the other object to that theory that it be subversive of natural religion the nebular hypothesis -- a natural consequence of the theory of gravitation and of the subsequent progress of physical and astronomical discovery -- have be denounce as atheistical even down to we own day but it be now largely adopt by the most theistical natural philosopher as a tenable and perhaps sufficient hypothesis and where not accept be no longer object to so far as we know on philosophical or religious grounds the gist of the philosophical objection urge by the two boston reviewer against a hypothesis of the derivation of species -- or at least against darwin 's particular hypothesis -- be that it be incompatible with the idea of any manifestation of design in the universe that it deny final cause a serious objection this and one that demand very serious attention the proposition that thing and event in nature be not design to be so if logically carry out be doubtless tantamount to atheism yet most people believe that some be design and other be not although they fall into a hopeless maze whenever they undertake to define they position so we should not like to stigmatize as atheistically dispose a person who regard certain thing and event as be what they be through design law -lrb- whatever that expression mean -rrb- but as not themselves specially ordain or who in another connection believe in general but not in particular providence we could sadly puzzle he with question but in return he might equally puzzle we then to deny that anything be specially design to be what it be be one proposition while to deny that the designer supernaturally or immediately make it so be another : though the reviewer appear not to recognize the distinction also scornfully to repudiate or to sneer at the idea of any manifestation of design in the material universe -lrb- 2 -rrb- be one thing while to consider and perhaps to exaggerate the difficulty which attend the practical application of the doctrine of final cause to certain instance be quite another thing : yet the boston reviewer we regret to say have not be duly regardful of the difference whatever be think of darwin 's doctrine we be surprise that he should be charge with scorning or sneer at the opinion of other upon such a subject perhaps darwin 's view be incompatible with final cause -- we will consider that question presently -- but as to the examiner 's charge that he sneer at the idea of any manifestation of design in the material universe though we be confident that no misrepresentation be intend we be equally confident that it be not at all warrant by the two passage cite in support of it here be the passage : -- if green woodpecker alone have exist or we do not know that there be many black and pie kind i dare say that we should have think that the green color be a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting bird from its enemy if we reason lead we to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivance in nature this same reason tell we though we may easily err on both side that some contrivance be less perfect can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect which when use against many attack animal can not be withdraw owe to the backward serrature and so inevitably cause the death of the insect by tear out its viscera if the sneer here escape ordinary vision in the detach extract -lrb- one of they want the end of the sentence -rrb- it be if possible more imperceptible when read with the context moreover this perusal incline we to think that the examiner have misapprehend the particular argument or object as well as the spirit of the author in these passage the whole read more naturally as a caution against the inconsiderate use of final cause in science and a illustration of some of the manifold error and absurdity which they hasty assumption be apt to involve -- consideration probably analogous to those which induce lord bacon rather disrespectfully to style final cause sterile virgin so if any one it be here bacon that sitteth in the seat of the scornful as to darwin in the section from which the extract be make he be consider a subsidiary question and try to obviate a particular difficulty but we suppose wholly unconscious of deny any manifestation of design in the material universe he conclude the first sentence : -- -- and consequently that it be a character of importance and might have be acquire through natural selection as it be i have no doubt that the color be due to some quite distinct cause probably to sexual selection after a illustration from the vegetable creation darwin add : -- the naked skin on the head of a vulture be generally look at as a _ direct _ adaptation for wallow in putridity _ and so it may be _ or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter but we should be very cautious in draw any such inference when we see that the skin on the head of the clean-feeding male turkey be likewise naked the suture in the skull of young mammal have be advance as a beautiful adaptation for aid parturition and no doubt they facilitate or may be indispensable for this act but as suture occur in the skull of young bird and reptile which have only to escape from a broken egg we may infer that this structure have arise from the law of growth and have be take advantage of in the parturition of the higher animal all this simply take be beyond cavil unless the attempt to explain scientifically how any design result be accomplish savor of impropriety in the other place darwin be contemplate the patent fact that perfection here below be relative not absolute -- and illustrate this by the circumstance that european animal and especially plant be now prove to be better adapt for new zealand than many of the indigenous one -- that the correction for the aberration of light be say on high authority not to be quite perfect even in that most perfect organ the eye and then follow the second extract of the reviewer but what be the position of the reviewer upon he own interpretation of these passage if he insist that green woodpecker be specifically create so in order that they might be less liable to capture must he not equally hold that the black and pied one be specifically make of these color in order that they might be more liable to be catch and would a explanation of the mode in which those woodpecker come to be green however complete convince he that the color be undesigned as to the other illustration be the reviewer so complete a optimist as to insist that the arrangement and the weapon be wholly perfect -lrb- _ quoad _ the insect -rrb- the normal use of which often cause the animal fatally to injure or to disembowel itself either way it seem to we that the argument here as well as the insect perform _ hari-karus _ the examiner add : -- we should in like manner object to the word _ favorable _ as imply that some species be place by the creator under _ unfavorable _ circumstance at least under such as might be advantageously modify but be not many individual and some race of man place by the creator under unfavorable circumstance at least under such as might be advantageously modify surely these reviewer must be live in a ideal world surround by the faultless monster which _ we _ world ne'er saw in some elysium where imperfection and distress be never hear of such argument resemble some which we often hear against the bible hold that book responsible as if it originate certain fact on the shady side of human nature or the apparently darker line of providential deal though the fact be fact of common observation and have to be confront upon any theory the north american reviewer also have a world of he own -- just such a one as a idealize philosopher would be apt to devise -- that be full of sharp and absolute distinction : such for instance as the absolute invariableness of instinct a absolute want of intelligence in any brute animal and a complete monopoly of instinct by the brute animal so that this instinct be a great matter for they only since it sharply and perfectly distinguish this portion of organic nature from the vegetable kingdom on the one hand and from man on the other : most convenient view for argumentative purpose but we suppose not bear out in fact in they scientific objection the two reviewer take somewhat different line but they philosophical and theological argument strikingly coincide they agree in emphatically assert that darwin 's hypothesis of the origination of species through variation and natural selection repudiate the whole doctrine of final cause and all indication of design or purpose in the organic world -- be neither more nor less than a formal denial of any agency beyond that of a blind chance in the develop or perfect of the organ or instinct of create being it be in vain that the apologist of this hypothesis might say that it merely attribute a different mode and time to the divine agency -- that all the quality subsequently appear in they descendant must have be implant and remain latent in the original pair such a view the examiner declare be nowhere state in this book and would be we be sure disclaim by the author we should like to be inform of the grounds of this sureness the marked rejection of spontaneous generation -- the statement of a belief that all animal have descend from four or five progenitor and plant from a equal or lesser number or perhaps if constrain to it by analogy from some one primordial form into which life be first breathe -- couple with the expression to my mind it accord better with what we know of the law impress on matter by the creator that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitant of the world should have be due to secondary cause than that each species have be independently create -- those and similar expression lead we to suppose that the author probably do accept the kind of view which the examiner be sure he would disclaim at least we see nothing in he scientific theory to hinder he adoption of lord bacon 's confession of faith in this regard -- that notwithstanding god have rest and cease from create -lrb- in the sense of supernatural origination -rrb- yet nevertheless he doth accomplish and fulfil he divine will in all thing great and small singular and general as fully and exactly by providence as he could by miracle and new creation though he work be not immediate and direct but by compass not violate nature which be he own law upon the creature however that may be it be undeniable that mr darwin have purposely be silent upon the philosophical and theological application of he theory this reticence under the circumstance argue design and raise inquiry as to the final cause or reason why here as in higher instance confident as we be that there be a final cause we must not be overconfident that we can infer the particular or true one perhaps the author be more familiar with natural-historical than with philosophical inquiry and not have decide which particular theory about efficient cause be best found he meanwhile argue the scientific question concern -- all that relate to secondary cause -- upon purely scientific grounds as he must do in any case perhaps confident as he evidently be that he view will finally be adopt he may enjoy a sort of satisfaction in hear it denounce as sheer atheism by the inconsiderate and afterwards when it take its place with the nebular hypothesis and the like see this judgment reverse as we suppose it would be in such event whatever mr darwin 's philosophy may be or whether he have any be a matter of no consequence at all compare with the important question whether a theory to account for the origination and diversification of animal and vegetable form through the operation of secondary cause do or do not exclude design and whether the establishment by adequate evidence of darwin 's particular theory of diversification through variation and natural selection would essentially alter the present scientific and philosophical grounds for theistic view of nature the unqualified affirmative judgment render by the two boston reviewer -- evidently able and practice reasoner -- must give we pause we hesitate to advance we conclusion in opposition to theirs but after full and serious consideration we be constrain to say that in we opinion the adoption of a derivative hypothesis and of darwin 's particular hypothesis if we understand it would leave the doctrine of final cause utility and special design just where they be before we do not pretend that the subject be not environ with difficulty every view be so environed and every shift of the view be likely if it remove some difficulty to bring other into prominence but we can not perceive that darwin 's theory bring in any new kind of scientific difficulty that be any with which philosophical naturalist be not already familiar since natural science deal only with secondary or natural cause the scientific term of a theory of derivation of species -- no less than of a theory of dynamics -- must need be the same to the theist as to the atheist the difference appear only when the inquiry be carry up to the question of primary cause -- a question which belong to philosophy wherefore darwin 's reticence about efficient cause do not disturb we he consider only the scientific question as already state we think that a theistic view of nature be imply in he book and we must charitably refrain from suggest the contrary until the contrary be logically deduce from he position if however he anywhere maintain that the natural cause through which species be diversified operate without a ordaining and direct intelligence and that the orderly arrangement and admirable adaptation we see all around we be fortuitous or blind undesigned result -- that the eye though it come to see be not design for see nor the hand for handle -- then we suppose he be justly chargeable with deny and very needlessly deny all design in organic nature otherwise we suppose not why if darwin 's well-known passage about the eye -lrb- 3 -rrb- -- equivocal or unfortunate though some of the language be -- do not imply ordain and direct intelligence then he refute he own theory as effectually as any of he opponent be likely to do he ask -- may we not believe that -- under variation proceeding long enough generation multiply the better variation time enough and natural selection secure the improvement -- a living optical instrument might be thus form as superior to one of glass as the work of the creator be to those of man this must mean one of two thing : either that the living instrument be make and perfect under -lrb- which be the same thing as by -rrb- a intelligent first cause or that it be not if it be then theism be assert and as to the mode of operation how do we know and why must we believe that fitting precedent form be in existence a living instrument -lrb- so different from a lifeless manufacture -rrb- would be originate and perfect in any other way or that this be not the fitting way if it mean that it be not if he so misuse word that by the creator he intend a unintelligent power undirected force or necessity then he have put he case so as to invite disbelief in it for then blind force have produce not only manifest adaptation of means to specific end -- which be absurd enough -- but better adjust and more perfect instrument or machine than intellect -lrb- that be human intellect -rrb- can contrive and human skill execute -- which no sane person will believe on the other hand if darwin even admit -- we will not say adopt -- the theistic view he may save himself much needless trouble in the endeavor to account for the absence of every sort of intermediate form those in the line between one species and another suppose to be derive from it he may be bind to provide but as to a infinite number of other variety not intermediate gross rude and purposeless the unmeaning creation of a unconscious cause bear only to perish which a relentless reviewer have impose upon he theory -- rightly enough upon the atheistic alternative -- the theistic view rid he at once of this scum of creation for as species do not now vary at all time and place and in all direction nor produce crude vague imperfect and useless form there be no reason for suppose that they ever do good-for-nothing monstrosity failure of purpose rather than purposeless indeed sometimes occur but these be just as anomalous and unlikely upon darwin 's theory as upon any other for he particular theory be base and even over-strictly insist upon the most universal of physiological law namely that successive generation shall differ only slightly if at all from they parent and this effectively exclude crude and impotent form wherefore if we believe that the species be design and that natural propagation be design how can we say that the actual variety of the species be not equally design have we not similar grounds for infer design in the suppose variety of a species that we have in the case of the suppose species of a genus when a naturalist come to regard as three closely-related species what he before take to be so many variety of one species how have he thereby strengthen we conviction that the three form be design to have the difference which they actually exhibit wherefore so long as gradated orderly and adapt form in nature argue design and at least while the physical cause of variation be utterly unknown and mysterious we should advise mr darwin to assume in the philosophy of he hypothesis that variation have be lead along certain beneficial line stream flow over a sloping plain by gravitation -lrb- here the counterpart of natural selection -rrb- may have wear they actual channel as they flow yet they particular course may have be assign and where we see they form definite and useful line of irrigation after a manner unaccountable on the law of gravitation and dynamics we should believe that the distribution be design to insist therefore that the new hypothesis of the derivative origin of the actual species be incompatible with final cause and design be to take a position which we must consider philosophically untenable we must also regard it as unwise or dangerous in the present state and present prospects of physical and physiological science we should expect the philosophical atheist or skeptic to take this ground also until better inform the unlearned and unphilosophical believer but we should think that the thoughtful theistic philosopher would take the other side not to do so seem to concede that only supernatural event can be show to be design which no theist can admit -- seem also to misconceive the scope and meaning of all ordinary argument for design in nature this misconception be share both by the reviewer and the review at least mr darwin use expression which seem to imply that the natural form which surround we because they have a history or natural sequence could have be only generally but not particularly design -- a view at once superficial and contradictory whereas he true line should be that he hypothesis concern the order and not the cause the _ how _ and not the _ why _ of the phenomenon and so leave the question of design just where it be before to illustrate this first from the theist 's point of view transfer the question for a moment from the origination of species to the origination of individual which occur as we say naturally because natural that be state fix or settle be it any the less design on that account we acknowledge that god be we maker -- not merely the originator of the race but _ we _ maker as individual -- and none the less so because it please he to make we in the way of ordinary generation if any of we be bear unlike we parent and grandparent in a slight degree or in whatever degree would the case be alter in this regard the whole argument in natural theology proceeds upon the ground that the inference for a final cause of the structure of the hand and of the valve in the vein be just as valid now in individual produce through natural generation as it would have be in the case of the first man supernaturally create why not then just as good even on the supposition of the descent of man from chimpanzee and gorilla since those animal possess these same contrivance or to take a more supposable case : if the argument from structure to design be convince when draw from a particular animal say a newfoundland dog and be not weaken by the knowledge that this dog come from similar parent would it be at all weaken if in trace he genealogy it be ascertain that he be a remote descendant of the mastiff or some other breed or that both these and other breed come -lrb- as be suspect -rrb- from some wolf if not how be the argument for design in the structure of we particular dog affect by the supposition that he wolfish progenitor come from a post-tertiary wolf perhaps less unlike a exist one than the dog in question be from some other of the numerous exist race of dog and that this post-tertiary come from a equally or more different tertiary wolf and if the argument from structure to design be not invalidate by we present knowledge that we individual dog be develop from a single organic cell how be it invalidate by the supposition of a analogous natural descent through a long line of connected form from such a cell or from some simple animal exist age before there be any dog again suppose we have two well-known and very decidedly different animal or plant a and d both present in they structure and in they adaptation to the condition of existence as valid and clear evidence of design as any animal or plant ever present : suppose we have now discover two intermediate species b and c which make up a series with equable difference from a to d be the proof of design or final cause in a and d whatever it amount to at all weaken by the discover intermediate form rather do not the proof extend to the intermediate species and go to show that all four be equally design suppose now the number of intermediate form to be much increase and therefore the gradation to be closer yet as close as those between the various sort of dog or race of man or of horn cattle : would the evidence of design as show in the structure of any of the member of the series be any weaker than it be in the case of a and d whoever contend that it would be should likewise maintain that the origination of individual by generation be incompatible with design and so take a consistent atheistical view of nature perhaps we might all have confidently think so antecedently to experience of the fact of reproduction let we experience teach we wisdom these illustration make it clear that the evidence of design from structure and adaptation be furnished complete by the individual animal or plant itself and that we knowledge or we ignorance of the history of its formation or mode of production add nothing to it and take nothing away we infer design from certain arrangement and result and we have no other way of ascertain it testimony unless infallible can not prove it and be out of the question here testimony be not the appropriate proof of design : adaptation to purpose be some arrangement in nature appear to be contrivance but may leave we in doubt many other of which the eye and the hand be notable example compel belief with a force not appreciably short of demonstration clearly to settle that these must have be design go far towards prove that other organ and other seemingly less explicit adaptation in nature must also have be design and clinch we belief from manifold consideration that all nature be a preconcerted arrangement a manifest design a strange contradiction would it be to insist that the shape and marking of certain rude piece of flint lately find in drift deposit prove design but that nicer and thousand-fold more complex adaptation to use in animal and vegetable do not _ a fortiorus _ argue design we could not affirm that the argument for design in nature be conclusive to all mind but we may insist upon grounds already intimate that whatever they be good for before darwin 's book appear they be good for now to we mind the argument from design always appear conclusive of the be and continue operation of a intelligent first cause the ordainer of nature and we do not see that the grounds of such belief would be disturbed or shift by the adoption of darwin 's hypothesis we be not blind to the philosophical difficulty which the thorough-going implication of design in nature have to encounter nor be it we vocation to obviate they it suffice we to know that they be not new nor peculiar difficulty -- that as darwin 's theory and we reasoning upon it do not raise these perturb spirit they be not bind to lay they meanwhile that the doctrine of design encounter the very same difficulty in the material that it do in the moral world be just what ought to be expect so the issue between the skeptic and the theist be only the old one long ago argue out -- namely whether organic nature be a result of design or of chance variation and natural selection open no third alternative they concern only the question how the result whether fortuitous or design may have be bring about organic nature abound with unmistakable and irresistible indication of design and be a connected and consistent system this evidence carry the implication of design throughout the whole on the other hand chance carry no probability with it can never be develop into a consistent system but when apply to the explanation of orderly or beneficial result heap up improbability at every step beyond all computation to we a fortuitous cosmos be simply inconceivable the alternative be a design cosmos it be very easy to assume that because event in nature be in one sense accidental and the operative force which bring they to pass be themselves blind and unintelligent -lrb- all force be -rrb- therefore they be undirected or that he who describe these event as the result of such force thereby assume that they be undirected this be the assumption of the boston reviewer and of mr agassiz who insist that the only alternative to the doctrine that all organize being be supernaturally create as they be be that they have arise _ spontaneously _ through the _ omnipotence of matter _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- as to all this nothing be easier than to bring out in the conclusion what you introduce in the premise if you import atheism into you conception of variation and natural selection you can readily exhibit it in the result if you do not put it in perhaps there need be none to come out while the mechanician be consider a steamboat or locomotive engine as a material organism and contemplate the fuel water and steam the source of the mechanical force and how they operate he may not have occasion to mention the engineer but the orderly and special result accomplish the _ why _ the movement be in this or that particular direction etc be inexplicable without he if mr darwin believe that the event which he suppose to have occur and the result we behold be undirected and undesigned or if the physicist believe that the natural force to which he refer phenomenon be uncaused and undirected no argument be need to show that such belief be atheism but the admission of the phenomenon and of these natural process and force do not necessitate any such belief nor even render it one whit less improbable than before surely too the accidental element may play its part in nature without negative design in the theist 's view he believe that the earth 's surface have be very gradually prepare for man and the exist animal race that vegetable matter have through a long series of generation impart fertility to the soil in order that it may support its present occupant that even bed of coal have be store up for man 's benefit yet what be more accidental and more simply the consequence of physical agency than the accumulation of vegetable matter in a peat-bog and its transformation into coal no scientific person at this day doubt that we solar system be a progressive development whether in he conception he begin with molten mass or aëriform or nebulous mass or with a fluid revolving mass of vast extent from which the specific exist world have be develop one by one what theist doubt that the actual result of the development in the inorganic world be not merely compatible with design but be in the truest sense design result not mr agassiz certainly who adopt a remarkable illustration of design directly found on the nebular hypothesis draw from the position and time of revolution of the world so originate direct evidence that the physical world have be ordain in conformity with law which obtain also among live being but the reader of the interesting exposition -lrb- 5 -rrb- will notice that the design result have be bring to pass through what speaking after the manner of man might be call a chapter of accident a natural corollary of this demonstration would seem to be that a material connection between a series of create thing -- such as the development of one of they from another or of all from a common stock -- be highly compatible with they intellectual connection namely with they be design and direct by one mind yet upon some ground which be not explain and which we be unable to conjecture mr agassiz conclude to the contrary in the organic kingdom and insist that because the member of such a series have a intellectual connection they can not be the result of a material differentiation of the object themselves -lrb- 6 -rrb- that be they can not have have a genealogical connection but be there not as much intellectual connection between successive generation of any species as there be between the several species of a genus or the several genus of a order as the intellectual connection here be realize through the material connection why may it not be so in the case of species and genus on all side therefore the implication seem to be quite the other way return to the accidental element it be evident that the strongest point against the compatibility of darwin 's hypothesis with design in nature be make when natural selection be refer to as pick out those variation which be improvement from a vast number which be not improvement but perhaps the contrary and therefore useless or purposeless and bear to perish but even here the difficulty be not peculiar for nature abound with analogous instance some of we race be useless or worse as regard the improvement of mankind yet the race may be design to improve and may be actually improve the whole animate life of a country depend absolutely upon the vegetation the vegetation upon the rain the moisture be furnish by the ocean be raise by the sun 's heat from the ocean 's surface and be waft inland by the wind but what multitude of rain-drop fall back into the ocean be as much without a final cause as the incipient variety which come to nothing do it therefore follow that the rain which be bestow upon the soil with such rule and average regularity be not design to support vegetable and animal life consider likewise the vast proportion of seed and pollen of ovum and young -- a thousand or more to one -- which come to nothing and be therefore purposeless in the same sense and only in the same sense as be darwin 's unimproved and unused slight variation the world be full of such case and these must answer the argument -- for we can not except by thus show that it prove too much finally it be worth notice that though natural selection be scientifically explicable variation be not thus far the cause of variation or the reason why the offspring be sometimes unlike the parent be just as mysterious as the reason why it be generally like the parent it be now as inexplicable as any other origination and if ever explain the explanation will only carry up the sequence of secondary cause one step farther and bring we in face of a somewhat different problem which will have the same element of mystery that the problem of variation have now circumstance may preserve or may destroy the variation man may use or direct they but selection whether artificial or natural no more originate they than man originate the power which turn a wheel when he dam a stream and let the water fall upon it the origination of this power be a question about efficient cause the tendency of science in respect to this obviously be not towards the omnipotence of matter as some suppose but towards the omnipotence of spirit so the real question we come to be as to the way in which we be to conceive intelligent and efficient cause to be exert and upon what exert be we bind to suppose efficient cause in all case exert upon nothing to evoke something into existence -- and this thousand of time repeat when a slight change in the detail would make all the difference between successive species why may not the new species or some of they be design diversification of the old there be perhaps only three view of efficient cause which may claim to be both philosophical and theistic 1 the view of its exertion at the beginning of time endow matter and create thing with force which do the work and produce the phenomenon 2 this same view with the theory of insulate interposition or occasional direct action engraft upon it -- the view that event and operation in general go on in virtue simply of force communicate at the first but that now and then and only now and then the deity put he hand directly to the work 3 the theory of the immediate orderly and constant however infinitely diversified action of the intelligent efficient cause it must be allow that while the third be preëminently the christian view all three be philosophically compatible with design in nature the second be probably the popular conception perhaps most thoughtful people oscillate from the middle view towards the first or the third -- adopt the first on some occasion the third on other those philosopher who like and expect to settle all mooted question will take one or the other extreme the examiner incline towards the north american reviewer fully adopt the third view to the logical extent of maintain that _ the origin of a individual _ as well as the origin of a species or a genus can be explain only by the _ direct _ action of a intelligent creative cause this be the line for mr darwin to take for it at once and completely relieve he scientific theory from every theological objection which he reviewer have urge against it at present we suspect that we author prefer the first conception though he might contend that he hypothesis be compatible with either of the three that it be also compatible with a atheistic or pantheistic conception of the universe be a objection which be share by all physical science and some ethical or moral can not specially be urge against darwin 's system as he reject spontaneous generation and admit of intervention at the beginning of organic life and probably in more than one instance he be not wholly exclude from adopt the middle view although the intervention he would allow be few and far back yet one interposition admit the principle as well as more interposition presuppose particular necessity or reason for it and raise the question when and how often it may have be necessary it would be the natural supposition if we have only one set of species to account for or if the successive inhabitant of the earth have no other connection or resemblance than those which adaptation to similar condition might explain but if this explanation of organic nature require one to believe that at innumerable period in the earth 's history certain elemental atom have be command suddenly to flash into live tissue and when the result be see to be all orderly accord to a few type we can not wonder that such intervention should at length be consider not as interposition or interference but rather as exertion so frequent and beneficent that we come to regard they as the ordinary action of he who lay the foundation of the earth and without whom not a sparrow falleth to the ground -lrb- 7 -rrb- what do the difference between mr darwin and he reviewer now amount to if we say that accord to one view the origination of species be _ natural _ accord to the other _ miraculous _ mr darwin agree that what be natural as much require and presuppose a intelligent mind to render it so -- that be to effect it continually or at stated time -- as what be supernatural do to effect it for once -lrb- 8 -rrb- he merely inquire into the form of the miracle may remind we that all record miracle -lrb- except the primal creation of matter -rrb- be transformation or action in and upon natural thing and will ask how many time and how frequently may the origination of successive species be repeat before the supernatural merge in the natural in short darwin maintain that the origination of a species no less than that of a individual be natural the reviewer that the natural origination of a individual no less than the origination of a species require and presuppose divine power _ a fortiorus _ then the origination of a variety require and presuppose divine power and so between the scientific hypothesis of the one and the philosophical conception of the other no contrariety remain a proper view of the nature of causation place the vital doctrine of the be and the providence of a god on ground that can never be shake -lrb- 9 -rrb- a true and worthy conclusion and a sufficient answer to the denunciation and argument of the rest of the article so far as philosophy and natural theology be concern if a writer must need use he own favorite dogma as a weapon with which to give _ coup de grace _ to a pernicious theory he should be careful to seize it by the handle and not by the blade we can barely glance at a subsidiary philosophical objection of the north american reviewer which the examiner also raise though less explicitly like all geologist mr darwin draw upon time in the most unlimited manner he be not peculiar in this regard mr agassiz tell we that the conviction be now universal among well-informed naturalist that this globe have be in existence for innumerable age and that the length of time elapse since it first become inhabit can not be count in year pictet that the imagination refuse to calculate the immense number of year and of age during which the fauna of thirty or more epoch have succeed one another and develop they long succession of generation now the reviewer declare that such indefinite succession of age be virtually infinite lack no characteristic of eternity except its name -- at least that the difference between such a conception and that of the strictly infinite if any be not appreciable but infinity belong to metaphysics therefore he conclude darwin support he theory not by scientific but by metaphysical evidence he theory be essentially and completely metaphysical in character rest altogether upon that idea of ` the infinite ' which the human mind can neither put aside nor comprehend -lrb- 10 -rrb- and so a theory which will be generally object to as much too physical be transpose by a single syllogism to metaphysics well physical geology must go with it : for even on the soberest view it demand a indefinitely long time antecedent to the introduction of organic life upon we earth _ a fortiorus _ be physical astronomy a branch of metaphysics demand as it do still larger instalment of infinity as the reviewer call they both as to time and number moreover far the greater part of physical inquiry now relate to molecular action which a distinguished natural philosopher inform we we have to regard as the result of a infinite number of infinitely small material particle act on each other at infinitely small distance -- a triad of infinite -- and so _ physics _ become the most _ metaphysical _ of science verily on this view thinking be but a idle waste of thought and nought be everything and everything be nought the lead objection of mr agassiz be likewise of a philosophical character it be that species exist only as category of thought -- that have no material existence they can have have no material variation and no material community of origin here the predication be of species in the subjective sense while the inference be apply to they in the objective sense reduce to plain term the argument seem to be : species be idea therefore the object from which the idea be derive can not vary or blend can not have have a genealogical connection the common view of species be that although they be generalization yet they have a direct objective ground in nature which genus order etc have not accord to the succinct definition of jussieu -- and that of linnaeus be identical in meaning -- a species be the perennial succession of similar individual in continued generation the species be the chain of which the individual be the link the sum of the genealogically connected similar individual constitute the species which thus have a actuality and ground of distinction not share by genus and other group which be not suppose to be genealogically connect how a derivative hypothesis would modify this view in assign to species only a temporary fixity be obvious yet if naturalist adopt this hypothesis they will still retain jussieu 's definition which leave untouched the question as to how and when the perennial succession be establish the practical question will only be how much difference between two set of individual entitle they to rank under distinct species and that be the practical question now on whatever theory the theoretical question be -- as state at the beginning of this long article -- whether these specific line be always as distinct as now mr agassiz have lose no opportunity of urge the idea that while species have no material existence they yet exist as category of think in the same way -lrb- and only in the same way -rrb- as genus family order class etc he have take the ground that all the natural division in the animal kingdom be primarily distinct found upon different category of character and that all exist in the same way that be as category of think embody in individual living form i have attempt to show that branch in the animal kingdom be found upon different plan of structure and for that very reason have embrace from the begin representative between which there could be no community of origin that class be found upon different mode of execution of these plan and therefore they also embrace representative which could have no community of origin that order represent the different degree of complication in the mode of execution of each class and therefore embrace representative which could not have a community of origin any more than the member of different class or branch that family be found upon different pattern of form and embrace representative equally independent in they origin that genus be found upon ultimate peculiarity of structure embrace representative which from the very nature of they peculiarity could have no community of origin and that finally species be base upon relation and proportion that exclude as much as all the precede distinction the idea of a common descent as the community of character among the being belong to these different category arise from the intellectual connection which show they to be category of thought they can not be the result of a gradual material differentiation of the object themselves the argument on which these view be found may be sum up in the following few word : species genus family etc exist as thought individual as fact -lrb- 11 -rrb- a ingenious dilemma cap the argument : -- it seem to I that there be much confusion of idea in the general statement of the variability of species so often repeat lately if species do not exist at all as the supporter of the transmutation theory maintain how can they vary and if individual alone exist how can the difference which may be observe among they prove the variability of species now we imagine that mr darwin need not be dangerously gore by either horn of this curious dilemma although we ourselves cherish old-fashioned prejudice in favor of the probable permanence and therefore of a more stable objective ground of species yet we agree -- and mr darwin will agree fully with mr agassiz -- that species and he will add variety exist as category of thought that be as cognizable distinction -- which be all that we can make of the phrase here whatever it may mean in the aristotelian metaphysics admit that species be only category of thought and not fact or thing how do this prevent the individual which be material thing from have vary in the course of time so as to exemplify the present almost innumerable category of thought or embodiment of divine thought in material form or -- view on the human side -- in form mark with such orderly and graduate resemblance and difference as to suggest to we mind the idea of species genus order etc and to we reason the inference of a divine original we have no clear idea how mr agassiz intend to answer this question in say that branch be found upon different plan of structure class upon different mode of execution of these plan order on different degree of complication in the mode of execution family upon different pattern of form genus upon ultimate peculiarity of structure and species upon relation and proportion that be we do not perceive how these several category of thought exclude the possibility or the probability that the individual which manifest or suggest the thought have a ultimate community of origin moreover mr darwin would insinuate that the particular philosophy of classification upon which this whole argument repose be as purely hypothetical and as little accept as he own doctrine if both be pure hypothesis it be hardly fair or satisfactory to extinguish the one by the other if there be no real contradiction between they there be no use in make the attempt as to the dilemma propound suppose we try it upon that category of thought which we call _ chair _ this be a genus comprise the common chair -lrb- _ sellum vulgari _ -rrb- the arm or easy chair -lrb- _ s cathedron _ -rrb- the rock chair -lrb- _ s oscillan _ -rrb- widely distribute in the united state and some other -- each of which have _ sport _ as the gardener say into many variety but now as the genus and the _ species _ have no material existence how can they vary if individual alone exist how can the difference which may be observe among they prove the variability of the species to which we reply by ask which do the question refer to the category of thought or the individual embodiment if the former then we would remark that we category of thought vary from time to time in the readiest manner and although the divine thought be eternal yet they be manifest in time and succession and by they manifestation only can we know they how imperfectly allow that what have no material existence can have have no material connection and no material variation we should yet infer that what have intellectual existence and connection might have intellectual variation and turn to the individual which represent the species we do not see how all this show that they may not vary observation show we that they do wherefore teach by fact that successive individual do vary we safely infer that the idea or intention must have vary and that this variation of the individual representative prove the variability of the species whether subjectively or objectively regard each species or sort of chair as we have say have its variety and one species shade off by gradation into another and -- note it well -- these numerous and successively slight variation and gradation far from suggest a accidental origin to chair and to they form be very proof of design again _ edifice _ be a generic category of think egyptian grecian byzantine and gothic building be well-marked species of which each individual building of the sort be a material embodiment now the question be whether these category of thought may not have be evolve one from another in succession or from some primal less specialize edificial category what better evidence for such hypothesis could we have than the variation and grade which connect one of these species with another we might extend the parallel and get some good illustration of natural selection from the history of architecture the probable origin of the different style and they adaptation to different climate and condition two qualify consideration be noticeable one that house do not propagate so as to produce continue line of each sort and variety but this be of small moment on agassiz 's view he hold that genealogical connection be not of the essence of species at all the other that the formation and development of the idea upon which human work proceed be gradual or as the same great naturalist well state it while human thought be consecutive divine thought be simultaneous but we have no right to affirm this of divine action we must close here we mean to review some of the more general scientific objection which we think not altogether tenable but after all we be not so anxious just now to know whether the new theory be well found on fact as whether it would be harmless if it be besides we feel quite unable to answer some of these objection and it be pleasanter to take up those which one think he can among the unanswerable perhaps the weightiest of the objection be that of the absence in geological deposit of vestige of the intermediate form which the theory require to have exist here all that mr darwin can do be to insist upon the extreme imperfection of the geological record and the uncertainty of negative evidence but withal he allow the force of the objection almost as much as he opponent urge it -- so much so indeed that two of he english critic turn the concession unfairly upon he and charge he with actually base he hypothesis upon these and similar difficulty -- as if he hold it because of the difficulty and not in spite of they -- a handsome return for he candor as to this imperfection of the geological record perhaps we should get a fair and intelligible illustration of it by imagine the exist animal and plant of new england with all they remains and product since the arrival of the mayflower to be annihilate and that in the coming time the geologist of a new colony drop by the new zealand fleet on its way to explore the ruin of london undertake after fifty year of examination to reconstruct in a catalogue the flora and fauna of we day that be from the close of the glacial period to the present time with all the advantage of a surface exploration what a beggarly account it must be how many of the land animal and plant which be enumerate in the massachusett official report would it be likely to contain another unanswerable question ask by the boston reviewer be why when structure and instinct or habit vary -- as they must have vary on darwin 's hypothesis -- they vary together and harmoniously instead of vaguely we can not tell because we can not tell why either should vary at all yet as they both do vary in successive generation -- as be see under domestication -- and be correlate we can only adduce the fact darwin may be preclude from this answer but we may say that they vary together because design to do so a reviewer say that the chance of they vary together be inconceivably small yet if they do not the variant individual must perish then it be well that it be not leave to chance as to the fact : before we be bear nourishment and the equivalent to respiration take place in a certain way but the moment we be usher into this breathing world we action promptly conform both as to respiration and nourishment to the before unused structure and to the new surroundings now say the examiner suppose for instance the gill of a aquatic animal convert into lung while instinct still compel a continuance under water would not drown ensue no doubt but -- simply contemplate the fact instead of theorize -- we notice that young frog do not keep they head under water after cease to be tadpole the instinct promptly change with the structure without supernatural interposition -- just as darwin would have it if the development of a variety or incipient species though rare be as natural as a metamorphosis or if a quadruped not yet furnish with wing be suddenly inspire with the instinct of a bird and precipitate itself from a cliff would not the descent be hazardously rapid doubtless the animal would be no better support than the objection darwin make very little indeed of voluntary effort as a cause of change and even poor lamarck need not be caricature he never suppose that a elephant would take such a notion into he wise head or that a squirrel would begin with other than short and easy leap but might not the length of the leap be increase by practice the north american reviewer 's position that the higher brute animal have comparatively little instinct and no intelligence be a heavy blow and great discouragement to dog horse elephant and monkey strip of they all and leave to shift for themselves as they can in this hard world they pursuit and seem attainment of knowledge under such peculiar difficulty be interesting to contemplate however we be not so sure as be the critic that instinct regularly increase downward and decrease upward in the scale of be now that the case of the bee be reduce to moderate proportion -lrb- 12 -rrb- we know of nothing in instinct surpassing that of a animal so high as a bird the talegal the male of which plume himself upon make a hot-bed in which to hatch he partner 's egg -- which he tend and regulate the heat of about as carefully and skilfully as the unplumed biped do a eccaleobion -lrb- 13 -rrb- as to the real intelligence of the higher brute it have be ably defend by a far more competent observer mr agassiz to whose conclusion we yield a general assent although we can not quite place the best of dog in that respect upon a level with a considerable portion of poor humanity nor indulge the hope or indeed the desire of a renew acquaintance with the whole animal kingdom in a future life -lrb- 14 -rrb- the assertion that acquire habitude or instinct and acquire structure be not heritable any breeder or good observer can refute that the human mind have become what it be out of a developed instinct -lrb- 15 -rrb- be a statement which mr darwin nowhere make and we presume would not accept as to he have we believe that individual animal acquire they instinct gradually -lrb- 16 -rrb- this statement must have be pen in inadvertence both of the very definition of instinct and of everything we know of in mr darwin 's book it have be attempt to destroy the very foundation of darwin 's hypothesis by deny that there be any wild variety to speak of for natural selection to operate upon we can not gravely sit down to prove that wild variety abound we should think it just as necessary to prove that snow fall in winter that variation among plant can not be largely due to hybridism and that they variation in nature be not essentially different from much that occur in domestication we could show if we space permit as to the sterility of hybrid that can no longer be insist upon as absolutely true nor be practically use as a test between species and variety unless we allow that hare and rabbit be of one species that it subserve a purpose in keep species apart and be so design we do not doubt but the critic fail to perceive that this sterility prove nothing against the derivative origin of the actual species for it may as well have be intend to keep separate those form which have reach a certain amount of divergence as those which be always thus distinct the argument for the permanence of species draw from the identity with those now live of cat bird and other animal preserve in egyptian catacomb be good enough as use by cuvier against st hilaire that be against the supposition that time bring about a gradual alteration of whole species but it go for little against darwin unless it be prove that species never vary or that the perpetuation of a variety necessitate the extinction of the parent breed for darwin clearly maintain -- what the fact warrant -- that the mass of a species remain fix so long as it exist at all though it may set off a variety now and then the variety may finally supersede the parent form but it may coexist with it yet it do not in the least hinder the unvaried stock from continue true to the breed unless it cross with it the common law of inheritance may be expect to keep both the original and the variety mainly true as long as they last and none the less so because they have give rise to occasional variety the tailless manx cat like the fox in the fable have not induce the normal breed to dispense with they tail nor have the dorking -lrb- apparently know to pliny -rrb- affect the permanence of the common sort of fowl as to the objection that the lower form of life ought on darwin 's theory to have be long ago improve out of existence replace by higher form the objector forget what a vacuum that would leave below and what a vast field there be to which a simple organization be best adapt and where a advance would be no improvement but the contrary to accumulate the greatest amount of be upon a give space and to provide as much enjoyment of life as can be under the condition seem to be aim at and this be effect by diversification finally we advise nobody to accept darwin 's or any other derivative theory as true the time have not come for that and perhaps never will we also advise against a similar credulity on the other side in a blind faith that species -- that the manifold sort and form of exist animal and vegetable -- have no secondary cause the contrary be already not unlikely and we suppose will hereafter become more and more probable but we be confident that if a derivative hypothesis ever be establish it will be so on a solid theistic ground meanwhile a inevitable and legitimate hypothesis be on trial -- a hypothesis thus far not untenable -- a trial just now very useful to science and we conclude not harmful to religion unless injudicious assailant temporarily make it so one good effect be already manifest : its enable the advocate of the hypothesis of a multiplicity of human species to perceive the double insecurity of they ground when the race of man be admit to be of one species the corollary that they be of one origin may be expect to follow those who allow they to be of one species must admit a actual diversification into strongly marked and persistent variety and so admit the basis of fact upon which the darwinian hypothesis be build while those on the other hand who recognize a diversity of human species will hardly be able to maintain that such species be primordial and supernatural in the common sense of the word the english mind be prone to positivism and kindred form of materialistic philosophy and we must expect the derivative theory to be take up in that interest we have no predilection for that school but the contrary if we have we might have look complacently upon a line of criticism which would indirectly but effectively play into the hand of positivist and materialistic atheist generally the wiser and stronger ground to take be that the derivative hypothesis leave the argument for design and therefore for a designer as valid as it ever be -- that to do any work by a instrument must require and therefore presuppose the exertion rather of more than of less power than to do it directly -- that whoever would be a consistent theist should believe that design in the natural world be coextensive with providence and hold fully to the one as he do to the other in spite of the wholly similar and apparently insuperable difficulty which the mind encounter whenever it endeavor to develop the idea into a complete system either in the material and organic or in the moral world it be enough in the way of obviate objection to show that the philosophical difficulty of the one be the same and only the same as of the other -lrb- footnote 1 : whatever it may be it be not

grace of willingness to every humble or distasteful task the day have bring she but some malignant sprite seem to have take possession of she kingdom for rebellion break out everywhere the kettle would boil over most obstreperously -- the mutton refuse to cook with the meek alacrity to be expect from the nature of a sheep -- the stove with unnecessary warmth of temper would glow like a fiery furnace -- the iron would scorch -- the linen would dry -- and spirit would fail though patience never nan tug on grow hotter and wearier more hurry and more hopeless till at last the crisis come for in one fall moment she tear she gown burn she hand and smutch the collar she be prepare to finish in the most unexceptionable style then if she have be a nervous woman she would have scold be a gentle girl she only lift up she voice and weep behold she watereth she linen with salt tear and bewaileth herself because of much tribulation but lo help cometh from afar : a strong man bringeth lettuce wherewith to stay she plucketh berry to comfort she withal and clasheth cymbal that she may dance for joy the voice come from the porch and with she hope fulfil nan look up to greet john lord the

rustle in the wind from the orchard come the scent of ripening fruit and all the garden-plot lay ready to yield up they humble offering to they master 's hand but in the silence of the night a greater reaper have pass by gather in the harvest of a righteous life and leave only tender memory for the gleaner who have come so late the old man sit in the shadow of the tree he own hand plant its

bidding June good-morrow and the rose be just dream that it be almost time to wake when john come again into the quiet room which now seem the eden that contain he eve of course there be a jubilee but something seem to have befall the whole group for never have they all appear in such odd frame of mind john be restless and wear a excited look most unlike he usual serenity of aspect nan the cheerful have fall into a well of silence and be not to be extract by any hydraulic power though she smile like the June sky over she head di 's peculiarity be out in full force and she look as if she would go off like a torpedo at a touch but through all she mood there be a half-triumphant half-remorseful expression in the glance she fix on john and laura once so silent now sing like a blackbird as she flit to and fro but she fitful song be always philip my king john feel that there have come a change upon the three and silently divine whose unconscious influence have work the miracle the embargo be off he tongue and he be in a fever to ask that question which bring a flutter to the stoutest heart but though the man have come the hour have not so by way of steadying he nerve he pace the room pause often to take note of he companion and each pause seem to increase he wonder and content he look at nan she be in she usual place the rigid little chair she love because it once be large enough to hold a curly-headed playmate and herself the old work-basket be at she side and the battered thimble busily at work but she lip wear a smile they have never worn before the color of the unblown rose touch she cheek and she downcast eye be full of light he look at di the inevitable book be on she knee but its leaf be uncut the strong-minded knob of hair still assert its supremacy aloft upon she head and the triangular jacket still adorn she shoulder in defiance of all fashion past present or to come but the expression of she brown countenance have grow softer she tongue have find a curb and in she hand lay a card with pott kettel & co inscribed thereon which she regard with never a scornful word for the co he look at laura she be before she easel as of old but the pale nun have give place to a bloom girl who sing at she work which be no prim palla but a clytie turn she human face to meet the sun john what be you think of he stir as if di 's voice have disturb he fancy at some pleasant pastime but answer with he usual sincerity -- i be think of a certain dear old fairy tale call ` cinderellum ' oh say di and she oh be a most impressive monosyllable i see the meaning of you smile now and though the application of the story be not very complimentary to all party concern it be very just and very true she pause a moment then go on with softened voice and earnest mien : -- you think i be a blind and selfish creature so i be but not so blind and selfish as i have be for many tear have clear my eye and much sincere regret have make I humbler than i be i have find a better book than any father 's library can give I and i have read it with a love and admiration that grow stronger as i turn the leaf henceforth i take it for my guide and gospel and look back upon the selfish and neglectful past can only say heaven bless you dear heart nan laura echo di 's last word for with eye as full of tenderness she look down upon the sister she have lately learn to know say warmly -- yes ` heaven bless you dear heart nan ' i never can forget all you have be to I and when i be far away with philip there will always be one countenance more beautiful to I than any picture face i may discover there will be one place more dear to I than rome the face will be yours nan -- always so patient always so serene and the dearer place will be this home of ours which you have make so pleasant to I all these year by kindness as numberless and noiseless as the drop of dew dear girl what have i ever do that you should love I so cried nan with happy wonderment as the tall head black and golden bent to meet the lowly brown one and she sister ' mute lip answer she then laura look up say playfully -- here be the good and wicked sister -- where shall we find the prince there cry di point to john and then she secret go off like a rocket for with she old impetuosity she say -- i have find you out john and be ashamed to look you in the face remember the past girl you know when father die john send we money which he say mr owen have long owe we and have pay at last it be a kind lie john and a generous thing to do for we need it but never would have take it as a gift i

you have teach I i be proud as lucifer but i ask you to forgive I and i seal my real repentance so -- and so with tragic countenance di rush across the room throw both arm about the astonished young man 's neck and drop a energetic kiss upon he cheek there be a momentary silence for di finely illustrate she strong-minded theory by cry like the weakest of she sex laura with the ruling passion strong in death still try to draw but break she pet crayon and endow she clytie with a supplementary orb owe to the dimness of she own and nan sit with droop eye that shine upon she work think with tender pride -- they know he now and love he for he generous heart di speak first rally to she color though a little daunted by she loss of self-control do not laugh john -- i could not help it and do not think i be not sincere for i be -- i be and i will prove it by grow good enough to be you friend that debt must all be pay and i shall do it for i 'll turn my book and pen to some account and

battering-ram would knock down the obstacle she wit could not surmount john believe in she most heartily and show it as he answer look into she resolute face -- i know you will and yet make we very proud of we ` chaos ' di let the money lie and when you have make a fortune i 'll claim it with enormous interest but believe I i feel already doubly repay by the esteem so generously confess so cordially bestow and can only say as we use to year ago -- ` now let 's forgive and so forget ' but proud di would not let he add to she obligation even by return she impetuous salute she slip away and shake off the last drop answer with a curious mixture of old freedom and new respect -- no more sentiment please john we know each other now and when i find a friend i never let he go we have smoke the pipe of peace so let we go back to we wigwam and bury the feud where be we when i lose my head and what be we talk about cinderellum and the prince as he speak john 's eye kindle and turn he look down at nan who sit diligently ornament with microscopic stitch a great patch go on the wrong side out yes -- so we be and now take pussy for the godmother the character of the story be well

sudden change befall he voice as he say produce from some hiding-place a little worn-out shoe -- i can supply the slipper -- who will try it first di 's black eye open wide as they fall on the familiar object then she romance-loving nature see the whole plot of that drama which need but two to act it a great delight flush up into she face as she promptly take she cue say -- no need for we to try it laura for it would not fit we if we foot be as small as chinese doll ' -- we part be play out therefore ` exeunt wicked sister to the music of the wedding-bell ' and pounce upon the dismayed artist she sweep she out and close the door with a triumphant bang john go to nan and drop on he knee as reverently as the herald of the fairy tale he ask still smile but with lip grow tremulous -- will cinderella try the little shoe and -- if it fit -- go with the prince but nan only cover up she face weep happy tear while all the weary work stray down upon the floor as if it know she holiday have come john draw the hidden face still closer and while she listen to he eager word nan hear the beating of the strong man 's heart and know it speak the truth nan i promise mother to be silent till i be sure i love you wholly -- sure that the knowledge would give no pain when i should tell it as i be try to tell it now this little shoe have be my comforter through this long year and i have keep it as other lover keep they fairer favor it have be a talisman more eloquent to I than flower or ring for when i see how worn it be i always think of the willing foot that come and go for other ' comfort all day long when i see the little bow you tie i always think of the hand so diligent in serve any one who know a want or feel a pain and when i recall the gentle creature who have wear it last i always see she patient tender and devout -- and try to grow more worthy of she that i might one day dare to ask if she would walk beside I all my life and be my ` angel in the house ' will you dear believe I you shall never know a weariness or grief i have the power to shield you from then nan as simple in she love as in she life lay she arm about he neck she happy face against he own and answer softly -- oh john i never can be sad or tired any more \* \* \* \* \* the old day and the new a poet come singing along the vale -- ah well-a-day for the dear old day they come no more as they do of yore by the flow river of aise he pipe through the meadow he pipe through the grove -- ah well-a-day for the good old day they have all go by and i sit and sigh by the flow river of aise knight and lady and shield and sword -- ah well-a-day for the grand old day castle and moat and the bright steel coat by the flow river of aise the lance be shiver the helmet rust -- ah well-a-day for the stern old day and the clarion 's blast have ring its last by the flow river of aise and the warrior that sweep to glory and death -- ah well-a-day for the brave old day they have fight and go and i sit here alone by the flow river of aise the strength of limb and the mettle of heart -- ah well-a-day for the strong old day they have wither away mere butterfly ' play by the flow river of aise the queen of beauty whose smile be life -- ah well-a-day for the rare old day with love and despair in they golden hair by the flow river of aise they have flit away from hall and bower -- ah well-a-day for the rich old day like the sun they shine like the sun they have go by the flow river of aise and bury beneath the pall of the past -- ah well-a-day for the proud old day lie valor and worth and the beauty of earth by the flow river of aise and i sit and sigh by the idle stream -- ah well-a-day for the bright old day for nothing remain for the poet 's strain but the flow river of aise then a voice ring out from the oak overhead -- why well-a-day for the old old day the world be the same if the bard have a aim by the flow river of aise there be beauty and love and truth and power -- cease well-a-day for the old old day the humblest home be worth greece and rome by the flow river of aise there be theme enough for the poet 's strain -- leave well-a-day for the quaint old day take thine eye from the ground look up and around from the flow river of aise to-day be as grand as the century past -- leave well-a-day for the famed old day there be battle to fight there be troth to plight by the flow river of aise there be heart as true to love to strive -- no well-a-day for the dark old day go put into type the age that be ripe by the flow river of aise then the merry poet pipe down the vale -- farewell farewell to the dead old day by day and by night there be music and light by the flow river of aise \* \* \* \* \* the iceberg of torbay torbay torbay finely describe in a recent novel by the rev rt lowell be a arm of the sea a short strong arm with a slim hand and finger reach into the rocky land and touch the water-fall and rapid of a pretty brook here be a little village with romish and protestant steeple and the dwelling of fisherman with the universal appendage of fishing-house boat and flake one seldom look upon a hamlet so picturesque and wild the rock slope steeply down to the wonderfully clear water thousand of pole support half-acre of the spruce-bough shelf beneath which be a dark cool region cross with foot-path and not unfrequently sprinkle and wash by the surf -- a most kindly office on the part of the sea you will allow when once you have scented the fish-offal perpetually drop from the evergreen fish-house above these little building on the flake be conspicuous feature and look as fresh and wild as if they have just wander away from the woodland there they stand on the edge of the lofty pole-shelf or upon the extreme end of that part of it which run off frequently over the water like a wharf a assemblage of hut and hall bower and arbor a curious huddle make of pole and sweet-smelling branch and sheet of birch-bark a kind of evening haunt these room of spruce at noonday while at night a hang lamp like those we see in old picture of crypt and dungeon be to the stranger only a kind of buoy by which he be to steer he way through the darkness to come off then without pitch headlong and soil you hand and coat be the merest chance strange one be continually allure into these piscatory bower whenever he come near they in spite of the chilly salt air and the repulsive smell about the table where they dress the fish i have a fancy for these queer structure they front door open upon the sea and they step be a mammoth ladder lead down to the swell and the boat there be a charm also about fine fish fresh from the net and the hook -- the salmon for example whose pink and yellow flesh have give a name to one of the most delicate hue of art or nature the cliff but where be the iceberg we be not a little disappointed when all torbay be before we and nothing but dark water to be see to we surprise no one have ever see or hear of it it must lie off flat rock harbor a little bay below to the north we agree with the supposition that the berg must lie below and make speedy preparation to pursue by secure the only boat to be have in the village -- a substantial fishing-barge laden rather heavily in the stern with at least a cord of cod-seine but man by six stalwart man a motive power as it turn out none too large for the occasion we embark at the foot of a fish-house ladder be carefully hand down by the kind-hearted man and take we seat forward on the little bow-deck all ready they pull away at they long ponderous oar with the skill and deliberation of lifelong practice and we move out upon the broad glassy swell of the bay towards the open sea not indeed with the rapidity of a yankee club-boat but with a most agreeable steadiness and a speed happily fit for a review of the shore which under the afternoon sun be make brilliant with light and shadow we be presently meet by a breeze which increase the swell and make it easier to fail in close under the northern shore a line of stupendous precipice to which the ocean go deep home the ride beneath these mighty cliff be by far the finest boat-ride of my life while they do not equal the rock of the saguenay yet with all they appendage of extent structure complexion and adjacent sea they be sufficiently lofty to produce a almost appalling sense of sublimity the surge lave they at a great height slide from angle to angle and fret into foam as they slip obliquely along the face of the vast wall they descend as deeply as two hundred foot and rise perpendicularly two three and four hundred foot from the water they stratification be up and down and of different shades of light and dark a ribbed and striped appearance that increase the effect of height and give variety and spirit to the surface at one point where the rock advance from the main front and form a kind of headland the stratum six and eight foot thick assume the form of a pyramid -- from a broad base of a hundred yard or more run up to meet in a point the heart of this vast cone have partly fall out and leave the resemblance of a enormous tent with cavernous recess and hall in which the shades of evening be already lurk and the surf be sound mournfully occasionally it be musical peal forth like the low tone of a great organ with awful solemnity now and then the gloomy silence of a minute be break by the crash of a billow far within when the reverberation be like the slamming of great door after pass this grand specimen of the architecture of the sea there appear long rocky reach like egyptian temple -- old dead cliff of yellowish gray check off by line and seam into square and have the resemblance where they have fall out into the ocean of door and window open in upon the fresher stone presently we come to a break where there be grassy slope and crag intermingle and a flock of goat skip about or ruminate in the warm sunshine a knot of kid -- the reckless little creature -- be sport along the edge of a precipice in a manner almost painful to witness the pleasure of leap from point to point where a single misstep would have drop they hundred of foot seem to be in proportion to the danger the sight of some woman who be after the goat remind the boatman of a accident which occur here only a few day before : a lad play about the steep fall into the sea and be drown we be now close upon the point just behind which we expect to behold the iceberg the surf be sweep the black reef that flank the small cape in the finest style -- a beautiful dance of breaker of dazzling white and green as every stroke of the oar shoot we forward and enlarged we view of the field in which the ice be repose we heart fairly throb with a excitement of expectation there it be one exclaim a instant reveal the mistake it be only the next headland in a fog which unwelcome mist be now come down upon we from the broad water and cover the very tract where the berg be expect to be see farther and farther out the long strong sweep of the great oar carry we until the depth of the bay between we and the next headland be in full view it may appear almost too trifling a matter over which to have have any feeling worth mention or remember but i shall not soon forget the disappointment when from the deck of we barge as it rise and sink on the large swell we stand up and look around and see that if the iceberg over which we very heart have be beat with delight for twenty-four hour be anywhere it be somewhere in the depths of that untoward fog it might as well have be in the depths of the ocean while the pale cloud sleep there there be nothing leave for we but to wait patiently where we be or retreat we choose the latter c give the word to pull for the settlement at the head of the little bay just mention and so they round the breaker on the reef and we turn away for the second time when the game be fairly ours even the hardy fisherman no lover of islands-of-ice as they call they feel for we as they read in we look the disappointment not to say a little vexation while on we passage in we fill a half-hour with question and discussion about that iceberg we certainly see it yesterday evening and a soldier of signal hill tell we that it have be close in at torbay for several day and you my man there say that you have a glimpse of it last evening how happen it to be away just now where do you think it be indeed sir he must be out in the fog a mile or over de'il a bit can a man look after a thing in a fog more nor into a snow-bank maybe sir he be founder or he might be go off to sea altogether as they sometimes do well this be rather remarkable huge as these berg be they escape very easily under they old cover no sooner do we think we have they than they be go no jackal be ever more faithful to he lion no pilot-fish to he shark than the fog to its berg we will run in yonder and inquire about it we may get the exact bearing and reach it yet even in the fog the fisherman 's the wind and sea be in we favor we soon reach a fishery-ladder which we now know very well how to climb and wind we dim and perilous way through the evergreen labyrinth of fish bower emerge on the solid rock and take the path to the fisherman 's house here live and work and wear himself out william waterland a deep-voiced broad-chested round-shouldered man dress not in cloth of gold but of oil with the foxy remnant of a last winter 's fur cap cling to he large bony head a little in the style of a piece of turf to a stone you seldom look into a more kindly patient face or into a eye that more directly let up the light out of a large warm heart he countenance be one sober shadow of honest brown occasionally light by a true and guileless smile william waterland have see the island-of-ice it lie off there two mile or more ground on a bank in forty fathom water it be nearly six o'clock and yet as there be sign of the fog clearing away we think it prudent to wait a dull long hour pass by and still the sun be high in the northwest that heavy cod-seine a hundred fathom long sink the stern of we barge rather deeply and make it row heavily for all that there be time enough yet if we could only use it the fog still come in mass from the sea sweeping across the promontory between we and torbay and fading into air nearly as soon as it be over the land in the mean time we sit upon the rock upon the wood-pile stand around and talk look out into the endless mist look at the fisherman 's house they child they fowl and dog a couple of young woman that might have be teacher of the village school have there be a school belle of the place rather neatly dress and with hair nicely comb trip shyly by each with a arm about the other 's waist and very merry until abreast of we when they be as silent and downcast as if they have be pass by they sovereign queen or the great mogul they curiosity and timidity combine be quite amusing we speculate upon the astonishment that would have seize upon they simple innocent heart have they behold instead of we a bevy of we city fashionable in full bloom at length we accept a invitation to walk into the house and sit not under the good man 's roof but under he chimney a species of large funnel into which nearly one end of the house resolve itself here we sit upon some box-like bench before a wood fire and warm ourselves chat with the family while we be make ourselves comfortable and agreeable we make the novel and rather funny discovery of a hen sit on she nest just under the bench with she red comb at we finger ' end a large griddle hang suspend in the more smoky region of the chimney ready to be lower for the bake of cake or frying fish have tar my hand the fisherman 's wife kind woman insist upon wash it herself after rub it with a little grease she first scratch it with she finger-nail and then finish with soap and water and a good wipe with a coarse towel i begged that she would spare herself the trouble and allow I to help myself but it be no trouble at all for she and the greatest pleasure and what should i know about wash off tar they be member of the church of england and seem pleased when they find that i be a clergyman of the episcopal church they have a pastor who visit they and other in the village occasionally and hold divine service on Sunday at torbay where they attend go in boat in summer and over the hill on snow-shoe in the winter the woman tell I in a undertone that the family relation be not all agree in they religious faith and that they could not stop there any longer but have go to america which they like much better it be a hard country any way no matter whether one be protestant or papist three month be all they summer and nearly all they time for get ready for the long cold winter to be sure they have codfish and potato flour and butter tea and sugar but then it take a deal of hard work to make end meet the winter be not as cold as we think perhaps but then it be so long and snowy the snow lay five six and seven foot deep wood be a great trouble there be a plenty of it but they could not keep cattle or horse to draw it home dog be they only team and they could fetch but small load at a time in the mean while a chubby little boy with cheek like a red apple have venture from behind he young mother where he have keep dodge as she move about the house and edge himself up near enough to be pat on the head and reward for he little liberty with a half-dime the iceberg the sunshine be now streaming in at a bit of a window and i go out to see what prospect of success c who have leave some little time before be nowhere to be see the fog seem to be in sufficient motion to disclose the berg down some of the avenue of clear air that be open occasionally they all end however with fog instead of ice i make it convenient to walk to the boat and pocket a few cake bring along as a kind of scatter lunch c be descry at length climb the broad rocky ridge the eastern point of which we have double on we passage from torbay make haste up the crag by a short cut i join he on the verge of the promontory pretty well heated and out of breath the effort be richly reward the mist be disperse in the sunny air around we the ocean be clear off the surge be break with a pleasant sound below at the foot of the precipice be four or five whale from thirty to fifty foot in length apparently we could have toss a pebble upon they at time abreast and then in single file or disorderly round and round they go now rise with a puff follow by a wisp of vapor then plunge into the deep again there be something in they large movement very impose and yet very graceless there seem to be no muscular effort no exertion of any force from within and no more flexibility in they motion than if they have be build of timber they appear to move very much as a wooden whale might be suppose to move down a mighty rapid roil and plunge and bear along irresistibly by the current as they rise we could see they mouth occasionally and the lighter color of the skin below as they go under they huge black tail great winged thing not unlike the screw-wheel of a propeller tip up above the wave now and then one would give the water a good round slap the noise of which smite sharply upon the ear like the crack of a pistol in a alley it be a novel sight to watch they in they play or labor rather for they be feed upon the caplin pretty little fish that swarm along these shore at this particular season we could track they beneath the surface about as well as upon it in the sunshine and in contrast with the fog the sea be a very dark blue or deep purple above the whale the water be green a darker green as they descend a lighter green as they come up large oval spot of changeable green water move silently and shadow-like along in strong contrast with the surround dark mark the place where the monster be glide below when they broad blackish back be above the wave there be frequently a ring or ruffle of snowy surf form by the breaking of the swell around the edge of the fish the review of whale the only review we have witness in she majesty 's dominion be on the whole a impose spectacle we turn from it to witness another of a more brilliant character to the north and east the ocean dark and sparkling be by the magic action of the wind entirely clear of fog and there about two mile distant stand reveal the iceberg in all its cold and solitary glory it be of a greenish white and of the greek-temple form seem to be over a hundred foot high we gaze some minute with silent delight on the splendid and impressive object and then hasten down to the boat and pull away with all speed to reach it if possible before the fog should cover it again and in time for c to paint it the moderation of the oarsman and the slowness of we progress be quite provoking i watch the sun the distant fog the wind and wave the increase motion of the boat and the seemingly retreat berg a good half-hour 's toil have carry we into broad water and yet to all appearance very little nearer the wind be freshen from the south the sea be rise thin mist a species of scout from the main body of the fog lie off in the east be scud across we track jame goss we captain throw out a hint of a little difficulty in get back but yankee energy be indomitable c quietly arrange he painting -- apparatus and i wrap in my cloak more snugly creep out forward on the little deck a sort of look-out to be honest i begin to wish ourselves on we way back as the black angry-looking swell chase we up and fling the foam upon the bow and stern all at once whole squadron of fog sweep up and swamp the whole of we boat and berg in they thin white obscurity for a moment we think ourselves foiled again but still the word be on and on they pull the hard-handed fisherman now flush and moist with rowing again the ice be visible but dimly in he misty drapery there be no time to be lose now or not at all and so c begin for half a hour pause occasionally for pass flock of fog he ply the brush with a rapidity not usual and under disadvantage that would have master a less experienced hand we be get close down upon the berg and in fearfully rough water in they curiosity to catch glimpse of the advance sketch the man pull with little regularity and trim the boat very badly we be roll frightfully to a landsman c beg of they to keep they seat and hold the barge just there as near as possible to amuse they i pass a opera-glass around among they with which they examine the iceberg and the coast they turn out to be excellent good fellow and enter into the spirit of the thing in a way that pleased we i be sure they would have hold on willingly till dark if c have only say the word so much interest do they feel in the attempt to paint the island-of-ice the hope be to linger about it until sunset for its color light and shadow that however be suddenly extinguish heavy fog come on and we retreat not with the satisfaction of a conquest nor with the disappointment of a defeat but cheer with the hope of complete success perhaps the next day when c think that we could return upon we game in a little steamer and so secure it beyond the possibility of escape the seine be haul from the stern to the center of the barge and the man pull away for torbay a long six mile rough and chilly for my part i be tremble with cold and find it necessary to lend a hand at the oar a exercise which soon make the weather feel several degree warmer and render I quite comfortable after a little the wind lull the fog disperse again and the iceberg seem to contemplate we slow departure with complacent serenity we regret that the hour forbid a return it would have be pleasant to play around that parthenon of the sea in the twilight the best that be leave we be to look back and watch the effect of light which be wonderfully fine and have the charm of entire novelty the last view be the very finest all the east front be a most tender blue the fissure on the southern face from which we be rowing directly away be glitter green the western front glow in the yellow sunlight around be the dark water and above one of the most beautiful of sky we fall under the land presently and pass near the northern cape of flat-rock bay a grand headland of red sandstone a vast and dome-like pile fleece at the summit with green turf and shrub of fir the sun at last be really set there be the old magnificence of the king of day -- airy deep of ineffable blue and pearl stain with scarlet and crimson and striped with live gold a blaze of white light deepen into the richest orange crown the distant ridge behind which the sun be vanish a vapory splendor rose-color and purple be dissolve in the atmosphere and every wave of the ocean a dark violet nearly black be a flash of golden fire bath with this almost supernatural glory the headland in itself richly complexion with red brown and green be at once a spectacle of singular grandeur and solemnity i have no remembrance of more brilliant effect of light and color the view fill we with emotion of delight we shoot from beneath the great cliff into flat-rock bay round at length the breaker and the cape into the smoother water of torbay as the oar dip regularly into the polished swell reflect the heaven and the wonderful shore all lapse into silence in the gloom of evening the rock assume a unusual height and sublimity glide quietly below they we be salute every now and then by the billow thunder in some adjacent cavern the song of the sea in its old hall ring out in a style quite unearthly the slamming of the mighty door seem far off in the chamber of the cliff and the echo tremble themselves away muffle into stillness by the stupendous mass thus end we first real hunting of a iceberg when we land we be thoroughly chill we man be wait with he wagon and so be a little supper in a house near by which we enjoy with a appetite that assume several phase of keenness as we proceed there be a tower of cold roast beef flank by bread and butter and bowl of hot tea the whole be carry silently without remark at the point of knife and fork we be a forlorn-hope of two and fall to win the victory in the very breach we drive back over the fine gravel road at a round trot watch the last edge of day in the northwest and north where it no sooner fade than it bud again to bloom into morning we live the new iceberg-experience all over again and plan for the morrow the star gradually come out of the cool clear heaven until they fill they with they sparkling multitude for every star we seem to have a lively and pleasurable thought which come out and run among we talk a thread of light when we look at the hour as we sit fresh and wakeful warming at we english inn in st john 's it be after midnight \* \* \* \* \* theodore parker sir launcelot ther thou lyest thou be never match of none earthly knight hand thou be the truest freende to thy lover that ever bestrood horse and thou be the kindest man that ever strooke with sword and thou be the sternest knight to thy mortall foe that ever put spere in the rest _ la morte d'arthur _ in the year 1828 there be a young man of eighteen at work upon a farm in lexington perform bodily labor to the extent of twenty hour in a day sometimes and that for several day together and at other time study intensely when work be less press thirty year after that same man sit in the richest private library in boston work habitually from twelve to seventeen hour a day in severer toil the interval be crowd with labor with acquisition with reproach with victory with honor and he who experience all this die exhaust at the end of it less than fifty year old but look seventy that man be theodore parker the time be far distant when out of a hundred different statement of contemporary some calm biographer will extract sufficient material for a true picture of the man and meanwhile all that each can do be to give fearlessly he own honest impression and so tempt other to give theirs of the multitude of different photographer each perchance may catch some one trait without which the whole portraiture would have remain incomplete and the time to secure this be now while he feature be fresh in we mind it be a daring effort but it need to be make yet theodore parker be so strong and self-sufficing upon he own ground he need so little from any other while give so freely to all that one would hardly venture to add anything to the autobiography he have leave but for the high example he set of fearlessness in deal with the dead there may be some whose fame be so ill-established that one shrink from speaking of they precisely as one see they but this man 's place be secure and that friend best praise he who paint he just as he seem to depict he as he _ be _ must be the work of many man and no single observer however intimate need attempt it the first thing that strike a observer in listen to the word of public and private feeling elicit by he departure be the predominance in they all of the sentiment of love he service he speculation he contest he copious eloquence he many language these come in as secondary thing but the predominant testimony be emotional man mourn the friend even more than the warrior no fragile and lovely girl fading untimely into heaven be ever more passionately beloved than this white-haired and world-weary man as he sit in he library during he lifetime he be not only the awakener of a thousand intellect but the center of a thousand heart -- he furnish the natural home for every foreign refugee every hunt slave every stray thinker every vex and sorrowing woman and never be there one of these who go away uncomforted and from every part of this broad nation they scatter hand now fling rose upon he grave this immense debt of gratitude be not buy by any mere isolate act of virtue indeed it never be so buy love never be win but by a nobleness which pervade the life in the midst of he greatest care there never be a moment when he be not all too generous of he time he wisdom and he money bear down by the accumulation of labor grudging as a student grudge the precious hour that once lose can never be win back he yet be always hold himself at the call of some poor criminal at the police office or some sick girl in a suburban town not of he recognize parish perhaps but longing for the ministry of the only preacher who have touch she soul not a mere wholesale reformer he wear out he life by retail its great influence to the poorest comer not generous in money only -- though the readiness of he beneficence in that direction have few equal -- he always hasten past that minor bestowal to ask if there be not some other add gift possible some personal service or correspondence some life-blood in short to be lavish in some other form to eke out the already liberal donation of dollar there be a impression that he be unforgiving unforgett he certainly be for he have no power of forgetfulness whether for good or evil he have none of that convenient oblivion which in softer nature cover sin and saintliness with one common careless pall so long as a man persist in a wrong attitude before god or man there be no day so laborious or exhausting no night so long or drowsy but theodore parker 's unsleeping memory stand on guard full-armed ready to do battle at a moment 's warning this be generally know but what may not be know so widely be that the moment the adversary lower he spear be it for only a inch or a instant that moment theodore parker 's weapon be down and he arm open make but the slightest concession give he but the least excuse to love you and never be there see such promptness in forgive he friend find it sometimes harder to justify he mildness than he severity i confess that i with other have often feel inclined to criticize a certain caustic tone of he in private talk when the name of a offender be allude to but i have also feel almost indignant at he lenient good-nature to that very person let he once show the smallest symptom of contrition or seek even in the clumsiest way or for the most selfish purpose to disarm he generous antagonist he forgiveness in such case be more exuberant than he wrath have ever be it be inevitable in describe he to characterize he life first by its quantity he belong to the true race of the giant of learn he take in knowledge at every pore and he desire be insatiable not perhaps precocious in boyhood -- for it be not precocity to begin latin at ten and greek at eleven to enter the freshman class at twenty and the professional school at twenty-three -- he be equal by few student in the tremendous rate at which he pursue every study when once begin with strong body and great constitutional industry always acquire and never forget he be doubtless at the time of he death the most variously learn of live american as well as one of the most prolific of orator and writer why do theodore parker die he die prematurely wear out through this enormous activity -- a warning as well as a example to all appeal for moderation during the latter year of he life he have but one answer -- that he have six generation of long-lived farmer behind he and have they strength to draw upon all he physical habit except in this respect be unexceptionable : he be abstemious in diet but not ascetic keep no unwholesome hour try no dangerous experiment commit no excess but there be no man who can habitually study from twelve to seventeen hour a day -lrb- he friend mr clarke contract it to from six to twelve but i have mr parker 's own statement of the fact -rrb- without ultimate self-destruction nor be this the practice during he period of health alone but it be push to the last moment : he continue in the pulpit long after a withdrawal be peremptorily prescribe for he and when forbid to leave home for lecture during the winter of 1858 he straightway prepare the most laborious literary work of he life for delivery as lecture in the fraternity course at boston he work thus not from ambition nor altogether from principle but from a immense craving for mental labor which have become second nature to he he great omnivorous hungry intellect must have constant food -- new language new statistics new historical investigation new scientific discovery new system of scriptural exegesis he do not for a day in the year nor a hour in the day make rest a matter of principle nor do he ever indulge in it as a pleasure for he know no enjoyment so great as labor wordsworth 's wise passiveness be utterly foreign to he nature have he be a mere student this have be less destructive but to take the standard of study of a german professor and superadd to that the separate exhaustion of a sunday-preacher a lyceum-lecturer a radical leader and a practical philanthropist be simply to apply half a dozen distinct suicide to the abbreviation of a single life and as he younger companion long since assure he the tendency of he career be not only to kill himself but they for each assume that he must at least attempt what theodore parker accomplish it be very certain that he career be much shorten by these enormous labor and it be not certain that its value be increase in a sufficient ratio to compensate for that evil he justify he incessant winter-lecturing by the fact that the whole country be he parish though this be not a adequate excuse but what right have he to deprive himself even of the accustomed summer respite of ordinary preacher and waste the golden July hour in study sclavonic dialect no doubt he work in the world be greatly aid both by the fact and the fame of learning and as he himself somewhat disdainfully say the knowledge of greek and hebrew be a convenience in theological discussion but after all he popular power do not mainly depend on he mastery of twenty language but of one theodore parker 's learning be undoubtedly a valuable possession to the community but it be not worth the price of theodore parker 's life strive constantly to concentrate yourself say the laborious goethe never dissipate you power incessant activity of whatever kind lead finally to bankruptcy but theodore parker 's whole endeavor be to multiply he channel and he exhaust he life in the effort to do all man 's work he be a hard man to relieve to help or to cooperate with thus the massachusett quarterly review begin with quite a promising corps of contributor but when it appear that its editor if leave alone would willingly undertake all the article -- science history literature everything -- of course the other yield to inertia and drop away so some year later when some of we meet at he room to consult on a cheap series of popular theological work he himself be so rich in he own private plan that all the rest be impoverished nothing could be name but he have be plan just that for year and should by-and-by get leisure for it and there really be not enough leave to call out the energy of any one else not from any petty egotism but simply from inordinate activity he stand ready to take all the part in the same way he distance everybody every companion-scholar find soon that it be impossible to keep pace with one who be always accumulate and lose nothing most student find it necessary to be constantly forget some thing to make room for later arrival but the peculiarity of he memory be that he let nothing go i have more than once hear he give a minute analysis of the contents of some dull book read twenty year before and have afterwards find the statement correct and exhaustive he great library -- the only private library i have ever see which remind one of the astor -- although latterly collect more for public than personal use be one which no other man in the nation probably have sufficient bibliographical knowledge single-handed to select and we have very few man capable of fully appreciate its scholarly value as it stand it seem as if its possessor put all he practical and popular side into he eloquence and action have indemnify himself by invest all he scholarship in a library of which less than a quarter of the book be in the english language all unusual learning however bring with it the suspicion of superficiality and in this country where as mr parker himself say every one get a mouthful of education but scarce one a full meal -- where every one who make a latin quotation be style a ripe scholar -- it be sometimes difficult to distinguish the true from the counterfeit it be however possible to apply some test i remember for instance that one of the few undoubted classical scholar in the old-fashioned sense whom new england have see -- the late john glen king of salem -- while speak with very limited respect of the acquirement of rufus choate in this direction and with utter contempt of those of daniel webster always become enthusiastic on come to theodore parker he be the only man say mr king more than once to the writer with whom i can sit down and seriously discuss a disputed reading and find he familiar with all that have be write upon it yet greek and latin be only the preliminary of mr parker 's scholarship i know for one -- and there be many who will bear the same testimony -- that i never go to mr parker to talk over a subject which i have just make a speciality without find that on that particular matter he happen to know without any special investigation more than i do this extend beyond book sometimes stretch into thing where he questioner 's opportunity of knowledge have seem considerably greater -- as for instance in point connect with the habit of we native animal and the phenomenon of out-door nature such be he wonderful quickness and he infallible memory that glimpse of these thing do for he the work of year but of course it be in the world of book that this wonderful superiority be chiefly see and the follow example may serve as one of the most striking among many it happen to I some year since in the course of some historical inquiry to wish for fuller information in regard to the barbarous feudal code of the middle age -- as the salic burgundian and ripuarian -- before the time of charlemagne the common historian even hallam give no very satisfactory information and refer to no very available book and suppose it to be a matter of which every well-read lawyer would at least know something i ask help of the most scholarly member of that profession within my reach he regret he inability to give I any aid but refer I to a friend of he who be soon to visit he a young man who be already eminent for legal learn the friend soon arrive but own with some regret that he have pay no attention to that particular subject and do not even know what book to refer to but he would at least ascertain what they be and let I know -lrb- nb i have never hear from he since -rrb- stimulate by ill-success i aim higher and strike at the supreme bench of a certain state breaking in on the mighty repose of he honor with the name of charlemagne charlemagne respond my lord judge rub he burly brow -- charlemagne live i think in the sixth century dismayed i retreat with little further inquiry and sure of one man at least to whom law mean also history and literature i take refuge with charle sumner that accomplished scholar himself for once at fault could only frankly advise I to do at last what i ought to have do at first -- to apply to theodore parker i do so go reply he instantly to alcove twenty-four shelf one hundred and thirteen of the college library at cambridge and you will find the information you need in a thick quarto bind in vellum and letter ` potgiesser de statu servorum ' i straightway send for potgiesser and find my fortune make it be one of those patient old german treatise which cost the labor of one man 's life to compile and another be to exhaust and i have no reason to suppose that any reader have disturb its repose until that unwearied industry have explore the library amid such multiplicity of detail he must sometimes have make mistake and with he great quickness of apprehension he sometimes form hasty conclusion but no one have a right to say that he great acquirement be buy by any habitual sacrifice of thoroughness to say that they sometimes impair the quality of he thought would undoubtedly be more just and this be a serious charge to bring learning be not accumulation but assimilation every man 's real acquirement must pass into he own organization and undue or hasty nutrition do no good the most priceless knowledge be not worth the smallest impairing of the quality of the think the scholar can not afford any more than the farmer to lavish he strength in clear more land than he can cultivate and theodore parker be compel by the natural limit of time and strength to let vast tract lie fallow and to miss something of the natural resource of the soil one sometimes wish that he have study less and dream more -- for less encyclopedic information and more of he own rich brain but it be in popularize thought and knowledge that he great and wonderful power lay not a original thinker in the same sense with emerson he yet translate for ten of thousand that which emerson speak to hundred only no matter who have be hear on any subject the great mass of intelligent progressive new-england thinker wait to hear the thing sum up by theodore parker this popular interest go far beyond the circle of he avowed sympathizer he might be a heretic but nobody could deny that he be a marksman no matter how well other seem to have hit the target he shot be the triumphant one at last thinker might find no new thought in the new discourse leader of action no new plan yet after all that have be say and do he be the statement that tell upon the community he know this power of he and have analyze some of the method by which he attain it though after all the best part be a unconscious and magnetic faculty but he early learn so he once tell I that the new-england people dearly love two thing -- a philosophical arrangement and a plenty of statistics to these therefore he treat they thoroughly in some of he ten sermon the demand make upon the systematize power of he audience be really formidable and i have always remember a certain lecture of he on the anglo-saxon as the most wonderful instance that ever come within my knowledge of the adaptation of solid learn to the popular intellect nearly two hour of almost unadorned fact -- for there be far less than usual of relief and illustration -- and yet the lyceum-audience listen to it as if a angel sing to they so perfect be he sense of purpose and of power so clear and lucid be he delivery with such wonderful composure do he lay out section by section he historical chart that he grasp he hearer as absolutely as he grasp he subject : one be compel to believe that he might read the people the sanscrit lexicon and they would listen with ever fresh delight without grace or beauty or melody he mere elocution be sufficient to produce effect which melody and grace and beauty might have sigh for in vain and i always feel that he well describe he own eloquence while describe luther 's in one of the most admirably moulded sentence he ever achieve -- the homely force of luther who in the language of the farm the shop the boat the street or the nursery tell the high truth that reason or religion teach and take possession of he audience by a storm of speech then pour upon they all the riches of he brave plebeian soul baptize every head anew -- a man who with the people seem more mob than they and with king the most imperial man another key to he strong hold upon the popular mind be to be find in he thorough americanism of training and sympathy surcharge with european learning he yet remain at heart the lexington farmer 's - boy and he whole atmosphere be indigenous not exotic not haunt by any of the distrust and over-criticism which be apt to effeminate the american scholar he plunge deep into the current of hearty national life around he love it trust it believe in it and the combination of this vital faith with such tremendous criticism of public and private sin form a irresistible power he could condemn without crush -- denounce mankind yet save it from despair thus he pulpit become one of the great force of the nation like the new york tribune he print volume have but a limited circulation owe to a defective system of publication which he friend try in vain to correct but the circulation of he pamphlet-discourse be very great he issue they faster and faster latterly often in pair and they instantly spread far and wide accordingly he find he listener everywhere he could not go so far west but he abundant fame have precede he he lecture-room in the remotest place be crowd and he hotel-chamber also until late at night probably there be no private man in the nation except perhaps beecher and greeley whom personal stranger be so eager to see while from a transatlantic direction he be seek by visitor to whom the two other name be utterly unknown learn man from the continent of europe always find they way first or last to exeter place and it be say that thackeray on he voyage to this country declare that the thing in america which he most desire be to hear theodore parker talk indeed he conversational power be so wonderful that no one could go away from a first interview without astonishment and delight there be those among we it may be more brilliant in anecdote or repartee more eloquent more profoundly suggestive but for the outpouring of vast flood of various and delightful information i believe that he could have have no anglo-saxon rival except macaulay and in mr parker 's case at least there be no alloy of conversational arrogance or impatience of opposition he monopolize not because he be ever unwilling to hear other but because they do not care to hear themselves when he be by the subject make no difference he could talk on anything i be once with he in the society of a intelligent quaker farmer when the conversation fall on agriculture : the farmer hold he own ably for a time but long after he be drain dry we wonderful companion still flow on exhaustless with account of nova scotium ploughing and tennessee hoeing and all thing rural ancient and modern good and bad till it seem as if the one amusing and interesting theme in the universe be the farm but it soon prove that this be only one among he thousand department and he hearer feel as be say of old fuller as if he have serve he time at every trade in town but it must now be own that these astonishing result be buy by some intellectual sacrifice which he nearer friend do not all recognize but which posterity will mourn such a rate of speed be incompatible with the finest literary execution a delicate literary ear he might have have perhaps but he very seldom stop to cultivate or even indulge it this neglect be not produce by he frequent habit of extemporaneous speech alone for it be a singular fact that wendell phillip who rarely write a line yet contrive to give to he hastiest effort the air of elaborate preparation while theodore parker 's most scholarly performance be still stump-speeches vigorous rich brilliant copious they yet seldom afford a sentence which fall in perfect cadence upon the ear under a show of regular method they be loose and diffuse and often have the quality which he himself attribute to the style of john quincy adam -- disorderly ill-compacted and homely to a fault he say of dr channing -- diffuseness be the old adam of the pulpit there be always two way of hit the mark -- one with a single bullet the other with a shower of small shot : dr channing choose the latter as most of we pulpit orator have do theodore parker choose it also perhaps nature and necessity choose it for he if not he temperament at least the circumstance of he position cut he off from all high literary finish he create the congregation at the music hall and that congregation in turn mould he whole life for that great stage he eloquence become inevitably a kind of brilliant scene-painting -- large fresh profuse rapid showy -- mass of light and shade wonderful effect but farewell forever to all finer touch and delicate gradation no man can write for posterity while hastily snatch a half-day from a week 's lecture during which to prepare a tell Sunday harangue for three thousand people in the perpetual rush and hurry of he life he have no time to select to discriminate to omit anything or to mature anything he have the opportunity the provocative and the drawback which make the work and mar the fame of the professional journalist he intellectual existence after he leave the quiet of west roxbury be from hand to mouth need above all man to concentrate himself he be compel by he whole position to lead a profuse and miscellaneous life all popular orator must necessarily repeat themselves -- preacher chiefly among orator and theodore parker chiefly among preacher the mere frequency of production make this inevitable -- a fact which always make every finely organize intellect first or last grow weary of the pulpit but in he case there be other compulsion every Sunday a quarter part of he vast congregation consist of person who have never or scarcely ever hear he before and who might never hear he again not one of those visitor must go away therefore without hear the great preacher define he position on every point -- not theology alone but all current event and permanent principle the presidential nomination or message the law of trade the law of congress woman 's rights woman 's costume boston slave-kidnapper and dr banbaby -- he must put it all in he ample discourse must be like a oriental poem which begin with the creation of the universe and include all subsequent fact incidentally it be astonishing to look over he publish sermon and address and see under how many different name the same stir speech have be reprint -- new illustration new statistics and all remould with such freshness that the hearer have no suspicion nor the speaker either -- and yet the same essential thing Sunday discourse lyceum lecture convention speech it make no difference he must cover all the point every time no matter what theme might be announce the people get the whole latitude and longitude of theodore parker and that be precisely what they want he break down the traditional non-committalism of the lecture-room and oxygenate all the lyceum of the land he thus multiply he audience very greatly while perhaps lose to some degree the power of close logic and of address a specific statement to a special point yet it seem as if he could easily leave the lancet to other grant he only the hammer and the forge ah but the long century where the reading of book be concerned set aside all consideration of quantity of popularity of immediate influence and sternly test by quality alone -- judge each author by he most golden sentence and let all else go the deed make the man but it be the style which make or doom the writer history which always send great man in group give we emerson by whom to test the intellectual quality of parker they cooperate in they work from the beginning in much the same mutual relation as now in look back over the rich volume of the dial the reader now pass by the contribution of parker to glean every sentence of emerson 's but we have the latter 's authority for the fact that it be the former 's article which originally sell the number intellectually the two man form the complement to each other it be parker who reach the mass of the people but it be probable that all he writings put together have not have so profound a influence on the intellectual leader of the nation as the single address of emerson at divinity hall and it be difficult not to notice in that essay in which theodore parker venture on higher intellectual ground perhaps than anywhere else in he writings -- he critique on emerson in the massachusett quarterly -- the indication of this mental disparity it be in many respects a noble essay full of fine moral appreciation bravely generous admirable in the loyalty of spirit show towards a superior mind and all warm with a personal friendship which could find no superior but so far as literary execution be concern the beautiful sentence of emerson stand out like fragment of carve marble from the rough plaster in which they be imbed nor this alone but on draw near the vestibule of the author 's finest thought the critic almost always stop unable quite to enter they sphere subtile beauty puzzle he the title of the poem for instance give by delicate allusion the key-note of each -- as astraea mithridate hamatreya and étienne de la boéce -- seem to he the work of mere caprice he pronounce the poem of monadnoc poor and weak he condemn and satirize the wood-note and think that a pine-tree which should talk like mr emerson 's ought to be cut down and cast into the sea the same want of fine discrimination be usually visible in he delineation of great man in public life immense in accumulation of detail terrible in the justice which hold the balance they yet leave one with the feeling that after all the delicate main-spring of character have be miss broad contrast heap of good and evil almost exaggerated praise pungent satire catalogue of sin that seem page from some recording angel 's book -- these be he mighty method but for the subtilest analysis the deepest insight into the mystery of character one must look elsewhere it be still scene-painting not portraiture and the same thing which overwhelm with wonder when hear in the music hall produce a slight sense of insufficiency when read in print it be certainly very great in its way but not in quite the highest way it be preliminary work not final it be parker 's webster not emerson 's swedenborg or napoleon the same thing be often manifest in he criticism on current event the broad truth be state without fear or favor the finer point pass over and the special trait of the particular phase sometimes miss he sermon on the last revival for instance have a enormous circulation and tell with great force upon those who have not be sweep into the movement and even upon some who have be the difficulty be that they be just such discourse as he would have preach in the time of edward and the great awakening and the point which many think the one astonishing feature of the new excitement its almost entire omission of the terror of the lord the far gentler and more winning type of religion which it display and from which it confessedly draw much of its power this be entirely ignore in mr parker 's sermon he be too hard at work in combate the evangelical theology to recognize its altered phase forge lightning-rod against the tempest he do not see that the height of the storm have pass by these be legitimate criticism to make on theodore parker for he be large enough to merit they it be only the loftiest tree of which it occur to we to remark that they do not touch the sky and a man must comprise a great deal before we complain of he for not comprise everything but though the closest scrutiny may sometimes find case where he fail to see the most subtile and precious truth it will never discover one where see he fail to proclaim it or proclaim fail to give it force and power he live he life much as he walk the street of boston -- not quite gracefully nor yet statelily but with quick strong solid step with sagacious eye wide open and thrust he broad shoulder a little forward as if but away the throng of evil deed around he and scatter whole atmosphere of unwholesome cloud wherever he go there go a glance of sleepless vigilance a unforgetting memory a tongue that never falter and a arm that never quail not primarily a administrative nor yet a military mind he yet

descendant of the gaul the only direction almost in which they exhibit any expansive tendency be in the border trade and general adventure business in which figure the name of many of they conspicuously and with honor the chouteaus be of that stock and of that stock come the late major aubry renowned among the guide and trapper of the southwestern wilderness and if jc fremont be not a french canadian by birth the strong effort make about the time of the last presidential election to establish he as one have at least the effect of determine he canadian descent pierre la marche be a franco-canadian of the spread-eagle kind refer to depart widely from the conservative prejudice of he race he wander propensity take he away at a early age from the primitive colonial village in which he first see the light of day he be but fourteen year old when he leave he peaceful and thoroughly whitewashed home on the bank of the st françois in company with a knot of canadian _ voyageur _ whose principle tend towards the red river of the north leave this convoy at fond-du-lac he push he way on to the mississippus alone and friendless and fall in with a party of trapper at st loui accompany they when they return to the mountain gulch in which they business lay after six year of trapper and trader life but little trace of the simple young canadian _ habitant _ be leave in pierre la marche he speak mountain english and french _ patois _ with equal fluency there be a decision of character about he that command the respect of he comrade when the other trapper go to st loui they use to drink and gamble away they hard-won dollar few of these man care for anything beyond the indulgence of immediate fancy but pierre be ambitious and think that money might be make subservient to he aspiration in a better way than speculate with it upon bluff or squander it upon deteriorate drink about this time of he life pierre begin to think that the fact of he be only a french canadian be likely to be a bar to he advancement he despise himself greatly for one thing indeed -- that he name be la marche and not walker -- which patronymic he make out to be the nearest anglo-saxon equivalent for he french one he adopt it -- call himself peter walker -- and have a adventure out of it to begin with while trade fur at st loui on one occasion he offer a remnant of he stock to a dealer with whom he be not acquaint they have a argument as to price the dealer a man of hasty temper ask he he name walker be the reply when la marche arise from the distant corner into which he be project in company with the bundle of fur level at he head revenge be he natural sentiment draw he heavy knife from its sheath he fling it away : the temptation to use it might have be too much for he small in stature but remarkable for muscular strength and for inventive resource in the rough-and-tumble fight la marche clench with the burly store-keeper who be get the worst of it when some of he _ employés _ interfere this lead to a general engagement several of la marche 's companion now rush in and in five minute they opponent give out succumbent to superior wind and sinew next morning when the trapper take they way out of st loui la marche be a leader among they for life but the reason of the store-keeper 's rage be for many year a mystery to he he know not the enormity of walker as a exponent of disparagement he simply think it a nicer name than la marche while it fully embody the sentiment of that name he adopt it then as i say before and go on towards posterity as peter walker i hear many strange anecdote of peter walker at the residence of a retired _ voyageur _ who use to sing he homerically to he choose friend these _ voyageur _ be professional canoe-men adventurer extend sparsely from the water of french canada to those of oregon -- and sometimes back honest old quatreaux i mention he residence just now and the term be truly grandiloquent in its application the residence of old quatreaux be a log _ cabane _ about twenty foot square plank lay loosely upon the cross-tie of the rafter form the up-stair of the building : up-ladder would be a term more in accordance with fact for it be by a appliance of that kind that the younger and more active of the sixteen member compose the old _ voyageur 's _ family remove themselves from view when they retire for the night a partition extend half-way across the ground-floor screen off the state or principal bed from outside gaze at least it be expose to view only from point render rather inaccessible by tub with which these canadian family be generally provide to excess this apartment be strictly assign to I as a visitor and although i firmly decline the honor -- chiefly with reference to certain large and very hard flea i know of in its dormitory arrangement -- it be keep religiously vacant in case my heart should relent towards it and the family in general sleep huddle together on the outer floor without manifest classification : the two old people son and wife daughter and husband child the extraordinary little hunch-backed and one-eyed girl whom nobody would marry but everybody like dog i use to stretch myself on a buffalo-robe before the wood-fire in company with a faithful spaniel who be as wakeful on these occasion as if he suspect that the low-bred cur of the establishment might pick he pocket quatreaux 's _ cabane _ be situate on the edge of a extensive tract of marsh -- lagoon would be a more descriptive word for it perhaps -- a splashy ditch-divided district extend along the border of a lake for mile snipe-shoot be my motive there and dull work it be in those dark novembry October day with the low rain fall half the time and the yellow leave all the time and no snipe but whether we pole we log canoe up to some stunt old willow-tree that sit low in the horizontal marsh and take shelter under it to smoke we pipe or whether we mollify the privation of snipe in the _ cabane _ at night with mellow rum and tobacco bring by I still be walker the old _ voyageur 's _ favorite theme old quatreaux speak english perfectly well although he conservatism as a canadian induce he to prefer he mother tongue as a vehicle for general conversation but i remark that he anecdote of walker be always relate in english and on these occasion therefore for my benefit alone : for but little of the anglo-saxon tongue appear to be know to or at least use by any member of he numerous family indeed i can recall but two word of that language which i could positively aver to have hear in colloquial use among they -- _ poodare _ and _ schotte _ and why should the old _ voyageur _ have thus reserve he experience from those who be near and dear to he simply because most of he adventure with walker be not of the strictly mild character become a family-man but it be all the same to these good people and when i laugh they all take up the idea and laugh they best -- the little hunch-backed girl generally go off into a kind of epilepsy by herself over in the darkest corner of the room among the tub when divest of the strange western expletive and imprecation with which the old man use to spice he reminiscence some of they be enough i remember one tell how peter walker raise the wind on a particular occasion when he get short of money on he way to some distant trading-post in a district strange to he it be before I in short-hand on the page of a old old pocket-book and i will tell it with some slight improvement on the narrator 's style such as suppress he unnecessary combination of the curse mount on a two-hundred-dollar buffalo-horse for which he would not have take double that amount peter walker find himself one afternoon near the end of a long day 's ride he have but little baggage with he that little consist entirely of a bowie-knife and holster-pistol -- for the revolver be a scarce piece of furniture then and there of money he be entirely destitute have expend he last dollar upon the purchase of he noble steed and of the festive suit of clothes with which he calculate upon astonishing people who reside outside the limit of civilization the pantaloon division of that suit be particularly superb consist principally of a stripe by which the outer seam of each leg be make conducive to harmony of outline he be about three day ' journey from the trading-post to which he be bind the country be a frontier one sparsely provide with inn the sun be frame in a low notch of the horizon as he approach a border-hostelry on the gable of which cat 's bluff hotel be paint in letter quite disproportioned in size to the city of cat 's bluff which consist of the house in question neither more nor less in that house peter walker decide upon sojourn luxuriously for that night at least if he have to draw a check upon he holster for it have stable he horse then and see he supply with such provender as the place afford he look about the hotel which he find to be a institution of very considerable pretension it seem to have a good deal of its own way in fact be the only house of entertainment for many mile upon a great south-western thoroughfare from which branch off the trail to be take by he tomorrow -- a trail which lead only to the trading-post or fort already mention the deportment of the landlord be gracious as he go about whistle wait for the wagon and jingle with gold chain and heavy jewelry still more exhilarating be the prosperous confidence of the bar-keeper who take in while walker be determine a drink not less than a dozen quarter-dollar from blue-shirted bearded thirsty man with rifle who come along in a large covered wagon of western tendency in which they immediately depart with haste late as it be as if bind to drive into the sun before he go down behind the far-off edge walker use to say jocularly that he suppose this must have be the wagon for which the landlord whistle and which come to he call everything denote that there be abundance of money in that favor place even small boy who come in and call for cigar and drink make a reckless display of coin as they pay for they and then drive off in they wagon -- for they all have wagon and be all intent upon drive rapidly in then toward the west but as night fall travel go down with the decline day and walker feel himself alone in the world -- a man without a dollar nevertheless he call for good cheer which be place before he on a liberal scale : for landlord thereabout be accustom to provide for appetite acquire on the plain and they supply be oblige to be both large and ready for the chance comer who be always drop in and upon whom they custom depend so he eat and drink and have appease hunger and thirst he go into the bar and open conversation with the landlord by offer he one of he own cigar a bunch of which he get from the bar-keeper whom he particularly request not to forget to include they in he bill when the time for he departure bring with it the disagreeable necessity of be serve with that document western landlord in general be not remarkable for the reserve with which they treat they guest this particular landlord be less so than most other he be especially inquisitive with regard to walker 's exquisite pantaloons the like of which have never be see in that part of the country before he happiness be evidently incomplete in the privation of a similar pair they pants all wool now ask he as he view they with various inclination of head like a connoisseur examine a picture all except the stripe reply walker -- stripe be wool and cotton mixed give 'em a finer grain you see and catch the eye the landlord respect walker at once perhaps he might be a eastern dry-goods merchant come along for the purpose of make arrangement to inundate the border-territory with stuff for exquisite pantaloons he proceed with he interrogatory he lay himself out to extract from walker all manner of information as to he origin occupation and prospects which give the latter a excellent opportunity of glorify himself inferentially while he affect mystery and reticence with regard to he mission out west at last the landlord set he down for a agent come on to open the sluice for a great tide of foreign emigration into the territory -- a event to which he himself have be look for a long time and the prospect of which have guide he to the spot where he have establish he hotel which he now look upon as the center from which a great city be destine immediately to radiate and the landlord retire to he bed to meditate upon immense speculation in town-lot and when sleep come upon he to dream that he have successfully arrange they through the medium of a angel with a speaking-trumpet whose manifest wardrobe consist of a pair of fancy pantaloons with stripe on the seam and side-pocket exactly like walker 's walker too retire to rest but not to sleep for he mind be occupy in turn over mean whereby to obtain some of the real capital with which people here seem to be superabundantly provide he have speculation to carry out and money be the indispensable element have he only be able to read the landlord 's thought he might have turn quietly over and sleep for so hold be that person 's mind by the idea that he ultimate success be to be achieve through the medium of he unknown guest that he would without hesitation have lend he double the sum necessary for he financial arrangement there be a disturbance some time about the middle of the night people come along in wagon as usual wake up the bar-keeper whose dream perpetually run upon that kind of trouble walker who be wide awake gather from the conversation below that the traveller have only halt for drink and would immediately resume they way westward with all speed he arise and look out at the open window which be about fifteen foot from the ground something white loom up through the darkness : it be the awning of one of the wagon which stand just under the window to the sill of which it reach within a few foot walker bring up in the rough-and-ready school have lie down to rest with he trousers on a sudden inspiration now seize he : he slip they rapidly off and drop they silently on to the roof of the wagon which soon after move on with the other and disappear into the night this do he open softly the door of the room and leave it ajar return to bed and sleep morning be well advance when walker arise and begin operation by move the furniture about in a excited manner to attract the attention of those in the bar below and convey a idea of search presently he go to the door of the room and utter a indian howl by way of secure immediate attendance cry out -- hullo below where 's my pants -- bar-keeper fetch along my pants -- landlord i do not want to be troublesome but just take off they pants if you happen to have mistake 'em for you own and oblige the right owner with a look at 'em will you puzzle at this address which be couch in much stronger language -- accord to old quatreaux 's version of it -- than i should like to commit to paper the landlord and bar-keeper at once proceed to walker 's room where they find he sit expectantly on the side of the bed with he horse-pistol gather together beside he of course they deny all knowledge of he pantaloons -- do not steal nobody 's pants in that house nor nothin ' walker look sternly at they and play with one of he pistol exclaim with the usual redundant -- you lie -- you have steal my pants between you you have find out what they be worth by this time i guess but i 'll have 'em back and that in a hurry or else my name a 'n' t walker -- peter walker he add he christian name because a reminiscence of the mystery belong to he patronymic by itself flash upon he now the name of pete walker be potent along the frontier because of he influence with the wild mountain-man who do reckless deed on he account unknown to he and otherwise another vision than that of last night overcome the landlord -- a vision of lynch and ash so you be pete walker be you ask he in a tone of mingled respect and admiration slightly tremulous with fear how do you do mr walker -- how do you find yourself this morning sir i do not come here to find myself retort walker fiercely i find my door open though when i wake up -- but i could not find my pants you must get 'em or pay for 'em and that right away they cuss that pass through here last night exclaim the landlord i guess the pants be go on the sundown trail stripe and all walker think it be quite probable that they have but they be steal from that house and the house must pay for they lynch and ash again blaze before the landlord 's eye how much might the pants be worth now at cost price ask he all wool you say only the stripe but as they be nearly all stripe you need not holler much about the wool i reckon how much now two hundred and ten dollar reply walker with impressive exactness thunder exclaim the landlord i think they might be fancy-priced sure-ly but that be awful ten dollar cash price for the pants proceed walker and two hundred for that exact amount in gold stitch up in the waistband of em the devil have get 'em anyhow say the landlord -- for i see a queer critter in my sleep fly about with 'em on wing look kinder awful along o ' pants with stripe there 'll be no luck round till they be pay for i guess could not you take my best checkers for 'em now with fifty dollar quilt into the waistband -- s-a-ay my name 's walker -- peter walker be the reply the landlord be no match for that name so disagreeably redolent of lynch and ash thorough search be make upon the premise and to some distance around in the wild hope that the miss trousers might have walk off spontaneously and lie down somewhere to sleep but of course nothing come of the investigation although walker assist at it with he usual energy all compromise be reject by he and it be not yet noon when he ride proudly away from the lone hostelry in the landlord 's best checkers for which he kindly allow he five dollar receive from he the balance two hundred and five dollar in gold i forget now what walker do with that money although quatreaux know exactly and tell I all about it suffice it to say that he make a grand _ coup _ with it in the purchase of a mill-privilege or claim or something of the kind less than a year after the event narrate he again ride up to the lone hostelry which be not so lonely now however for house be grow up around it and it take boarder and ring a dinner-bell and maintain a landlady as well as a landlord besides the landlord be astonish when walker count out to he two hundred and five dollar in gold -- surprised when to that be add a round sum for interest -- ecstatic on be present with a brand-new pair of pantaloons of the same pattern as the expensive one formerly so admire by he but he feature collapse and for some time wear a expression of imbecility when he learn the detail of the adventure and find out that some thing -- landlord for example -- can be do as well as other it be with little reminiscence like the one just narrate that old quatreaux use to wile away the time as we thread the intricate ditch of the marsh in he canoe so hedge in by the tall reed that we horizon be within paddle 's length of we with that presumptive _ clairvoyance _ which appear to be a essential property of the french _ raconteur _ he do not confine himself to external fact in he narrative but always profess to report minutely the thought that flash through the mind of such and such a person on the particular occasion refer to he be a master of dialect -- yankee pennsylvanian dutch and irish where do you get you english old man i ask he as we scud across the lake in we canoe with a small sail up one red October evening in pennsylvanium reply he i go there on my own hook when i be about twelve year old and work in a oil-mill for four year in a oil-mill perhaps that account for the glibness with which language slip off you tongue ` guess it do say the old _ voyageur _ with ready assent we nearly get foul of a raft come down the lake man with a rugged set of half-breed who have a cask of whiskey on board and be very drunk and boisterous ugly customer to deal with those _ brûlés _ remark i when we have get clear away from they some on 'em be reply the old _ voyageur _ do you notice the one with the queer eye -- he in the scotch cap and _ shupac _ moccason i _ have _ notice he and a ill-looking thief he be one of he eye either from natural deformity or the effect of hostile operation be drag down from its proper parallel and plant in a remote socket near the corner of he mouth whence it glare and wink with super-natural ferocity that be rupe falardeau continue my companion he father old rupe get he eye take down in a deck-fight with a mississippus boatman and this boy be bear with the same mark -- only the eye 's lower down still if that be to go on in the family i guess there 'll be a falardeau with he eye in he knee some time in the deck-fight in which old rupe get he ugly mark pete walker have a hand and the part he take in it as related to I by old quatreaux who be also present afford a good example of the tact and coolness which give he such mastery over the wild spirit among whom he work out he destiny walker be come down a lumbering-river -- i forget the name of it -- on board a small tug-steamboat in which he have a interest he have go into other speculation beside fur by this time and have contract in two or three place for supply remote station with salt pork tea and other staple provision of the lumbering-craft stop to wood at the mouth of a creek a gang of raftsman come on board -- half-breed canadian of fierce and demoralized aspect -- man of great muscular strength and armed heavily with axis and butcher-knife the gang be lead by rupe falardeau a dangerous man whether drunk or sober and one whose antecedent be record in blood these man have be drink and be very noisy and intrusive and presently a row arise between they and some of the boat-hand fisticuffs and kick be first exchange but without any great loss of blood knife be then draw and nourish and matter be begin to assume a serious aspect when walker make he appearance forward of the paddle-box point a heavy pistol right at the head of the ringleader rupe shout he in a voice that attract immediate attention drop that knife or else i shoot the crowd part for a moment and rupe standing alone near the bow wheel round with a yell and glare fiercely at the speaker drop that knife repeat walker -- one two _ three _ -- i 'll give you a last chance and when i say _ three _ again i shoot by thunder the last word have not roll away when the gleam knife flash from the hand of rupe glance close by walker 's ear and speed quiver into the paddle-box just behind he head good for you rupe exclaimed walker lower he pistol with a pleasant smile -- good for you -- but _ sacré bapteme _ how dead i would have shoot you if you have not drop that knife the forbearance of walker put a end to the row rupe disarm at once by the loss of he knife and the coolness of walker be seize by a couple of the deck-hand and might have be secure without injury to he beauty have not a mississippus boatman who owe he a old grudge strike he on the face with a heavy iron hook lacerating and disfigure he hideously for life but why do not walker shoot falardeau old man ask i of the _ voyageur _ wish to learn something of the etiquette of life and death among these peculiar people who appear to be so reckless of the former and fearless of the latter ah reply he rupe be too valuable to be shoot down for miss a man with a knife such a canoe-steersman as rupe never be know before or since : he know every rock in every rapid from the ottawa to the columbium some time after this i again fall in with young rupe under circumstance indicate that he life be not consider quite so valuable as that of the old gentleman from whom he inherit he frightful aspect in company with a friend one day i be beat about for wild-fowl in a marshy river down which small raft or crib of timber be work by half-breed and canadian about dark we come to a small flat island in the marsh where we find a iroquois camp in which we propose to pass the night as we have no camping-equipage in we skiff the man be absent hunting and there be nobody in charge of the wigwam but a ugly undersized squaw with she two ugly undersized child we be much fatigued and agree to sleep by watch know the sort of people we have to deal with it be my watch when voice be hear as of man landing and pull up a canoe or boat presently three man come into the wigwam railing-man dress in gray canada homespun and heavy scotch bonnet the light of the fire outside flash on they face as they stoop to enter the elm-bark tent and in the foremost i recognize the hideous rupe falardeau junior this man carry in he hand a small tin pail full of whiskey he be very drunk and dangerous and greatly disgust at the absence of the iroquois man with whom he have evidently lay himself out for a roar debauch i wake up my companion and a judicious display of we double-barrelled gun keep the three scoundrel in check they insist on we tasting some of they barbarous liquor however and horrible stuff it be -- distiller 's high-wine strongly dash with vitriol or something worse no wonder that man become fiend incarnate on such fire-water as that by-and-by they sleep -- two of they outside by the fire -- falardeau inside the wigwam the repose of which be break by the hollow rattle of he drunken breath in the dead of the night something clutch I by the arm it be the ugly squaw who force a greasy butcher-knife into my hand point towards where the raftsman lay and whisper to I in english -- stick heem stick heem -- nobody never know he kill my brother long time ago with this old knife kill heem kill heem now i do not avail myself of the opportunity thus afford I for the improvement of river society : nay worse i connive at the further career of the redoubtable rupert falardeau junior for on leave in the morning i rouse he with repeat kick thus save he for that time probably from the damoclesian blade of the _ vengeresse _ _ l'été de saint martin _ -- how blue and yellow it be in the marsh in those day it be the name give by the french canadian to the indian summer -- the summer of st martin whose anniversary-day fall upon the eleventh of November though the brief latter-day tranquillity call after he arrive generally some two or three week earlier look lakeward from the sedgy nook in which we be wait for the come of the wood-duck the low line of water blue and calm be break at interval by the rise of the distant _ masquallongé _ as he play for a moment on the surface but the channel that separate the flat alluvial islet be yellow they sluggish water be bed heavily down with the broad leaf of the winter basswood-tree which in some place touch branch-tip across the narrow strait the muskrat 's hut be thatch with the wet dead leaf -- no thanks to _ he _ and there be a mat of they before he door -- a heavy yellow mat on which be scatter the azure shell of the fresh-water clam to be find so often upon the premise of this

the oval azure shell also marance the _ voyageur 's _ buxom young daughter who come with we today commission to cull herb of wondrous property among the vine-tangled thicket of the island blue and yellow eye blue as the azure shell hair flash out golden gleam like that of pyrrha when she braid hers so featly for the come of some ambrosial boy i must marry you marance say i jocularly to the

along the sere and yellow cloth of some billiard-table erewhile in verdure clothe you be as bad as pete walker who think one sister must be as good as another because they look so much alike and then as we loiter about in the bay the old man tell I the story of walker 's honeymoon which be a sad and a short one this be the story near that wild rapid of the columbium river know as the dalle there be year ago a jesuit mission establish in a small fort build like that at nez-percés of mud the labor of the holy man compose the mission involve no inconsiderable amount of danger devote as they be to the hopeless task of reform such sinner as the sioux the blackfeet the gros-ventre the flat-head the assiniboine the nez-percés and a few other such some of these missionary have sojourn for a long time with a branch of the blackfoot tribe among whom they find two young white girl remarkable for they exact resemblance to each other and therefore suppose to be twin i say _ suppose _ because of they origin there be no trace all that be know about they be that they be the sole survivor of a train of emigrant attack and murder by the nez-percés who actuate by one of those whim characteristic of the red man spare the life of the two child and adopt they into the tribe subsequently in a skirmish with the blackfeet they fall into the hand of the latter among whom they have live for some time when they be ransom by the missionary at the price of certain trading-privilege negotiate by the latter for the tribe when adopt by the jesuit the child have lose all remembrance of they parentage nor have they any name except the indian one bestow upon they by they captor the good father christen they however arrange they alphabetically by the name of alixe and bloyse and confide they to the especial charge of the wife of a trader connect with the station who have no family of she own they be fair-haired child probably of german or norwegian origin and have grow up to be robust young woman of seventeen when walker see they for the first time as he stop at the dalle on he way from fort nez-percés about one hundred and twenty-five mile higher up the columbium walker whose business detain he for some time at the mission decide upon marry one of the fair-haired sister -- he do not much care which they be so singularly alike alixe happen to be the one however to whom he tender a share in he fortune which she accept in the random manner of one to whom it be of but little consequence whether she say yes or no bloyse would have follow he and he only to the end of all but he never know it at the right time though the woman of the fort could have tell he it be late one afternoon when he be marry to alixe in the chapel of the mission that be the night of the massacre two hour after the wedding the blackfeet combine with some ally tribe come down like wolf upon the fort there be treachery somewhere and they get in in the thick of the fight and when all seem hopeless walker shoot down a tall indian who be drag he bride away to where the horse of the tribe be picket in a second he have leap upon a horse and hold the young girl before he gallop away in the direction of a stream run into the columbium -- a stream of fierce torrent navigable only at one place and that by flat-bottomed boat or scow in which passenger warped themselves across by a grass rope stretch from bank to bank once over this river he could easily reach a friendly camp where he and he bride would have be in safety the moon have rise when he reach the ferry turn the horse adrift he lift the young woman into the scow and begin to warp rapidly across by the rope with one hand while he support he faint companion close to he with the other suddenly a sharp click sound from the opposite bank : the rope give way and walker and he companion be precipitated violently into the water the boat shooting far away from beneath they foot it run a strong current there culminate in a furious rapid not two hundred yard lower down retain he grasp of the young woman walker fight bravely against the stream down which he feel they be sweeping faster and faster until a violent concussion deprive he for a moment of consciousness when he come to himself he be still swim but he companion be go the current have drive they forcibly against a rock throw she from he grasp the wild rapid be just below they she be never hear of again but walker manage to reach the shore where he must have lie long in a exhaust condition for it be daylight when he awake to any recollection of what have happen the ferry-rope have be cut as he afterwards discover by a indian in whose brother 's removal by hang he have be instrumental and who have be watch he day and night for the purpose of wreak a bitter vengeance return to reconnoitre with some of he friend walker find the mission a heap of ruin -- blacken wall char rafter and unrecognizable human remains long afterwards he learn that he bride be again live among the blackfeet -- for it be bloyse and not alixe with whom he have gallop away to the fatal ferry in the confusion of that terrible night it be poor bloyse who go away from he arm down those crush rapid it be alixe he bride who shoot back the bolt for the entrance of the blackfeet she be secretly betroth in the tribe and it be she betroth whom walker shot down as he be rush away in triumph with he suppose _ fiancée _ of the pale-face she marry another indian of the tribe however for she be a savage woman at heart and could live among savage only sister may be as like as two walnut to look at say the old _ voyageur _ when he have finish he narration take any two walnut from a heap at random though and like as not you 'll find one on 'em all heart and the other all hollow

\* the national intelligencer and its editor the family of gale and seaton be in they origin the one scotch the other english the seaton be of that historic race a daughter of which -lrb- the fair and faithful catherine -rrb- be the heroine of one of sir walter scott 's romance it be to be suppose that they whose lineage look to such a instance of devoted personal affection for the ancient line would not slacken in they loyalty when fresh calamity fall upon the stuart and again upset they throne accordingly the seaton appear to have cling to the cause of they exile king with fidelity henry seaton seem to have make himself especially obnoxious to the new monarch by take part in those jacobite scheme of rebellion which be so long keep on foot by the liege and gentleman of scotland so that when towards the close of the seventeenth century the cause he love grow desperate and scotland itself anything but safe for a large body of she most gallant man he be force like all other that scorn to submit to fly beyond the sea do so it be natural that he should choose to take refuge in a britain beyond the ocean where a brotherly welcome among he kindred await the political prescript it be probable however that a special sympathy towards that region which by its former fidelity to the stuart have earn from they the royal quartering of its arm and the title of the ancient dominion direct he final choice at any rate it be to virginia that he come -- settle there as a planter first in the county of gloucester and afterwards in that of king william from one of he descendant in a right line spring -lrb- by intermarriage with a lady of english family the winston -rrb- william winston seaton the editor whose mother connect he with a second scotch family the henry -- the mother of

where good estate give they rank among the gentry while command stature the gift of a equally remarkable personal beauty a very winning address good part high character and the frequent possession among they of a fine natural eloquence give they as a race a equal influence over the body of the people in william -lrb- popularly call langaloo -rrb- and he sister sarah the mother of patrick henry these hereditary quality seem to have be particularly striking so that in they day it seem a sort of receive opinion that it be from the maternal side that the great orator derive he extraordinary power the galese be of much more recent naturalization amongst we -- later by just about a century than that of the seaton but alike in its cause for they too be drive hither by governmental resentment they founder -lrb- as he may be call -rrb- the elder joseph gale be one of those rare man who at time spring up from the body of the people and by mere unassisted merit apart from all adventitious advantage make they way to a just distinction perhaps no better idea of he can be give than by liken he to one less happy in he death whom science be now everywhere lament -- the late admirable hugh miller a different career rather than a inferior character make joseph gale less conspicuous he be bear in 1761 at eckington near the english town of sheffield the condition of he family be above dependence but not frugality be education what else it may there be one sort which never fail to work well : namely that which a strong capacity when deny the usual artificial help shape out to its own advantage such with little and poor assistance become that of joseph gale obtain progressively as best it could be in the short interval which the body can allow to be steal between labor and necessary rest now the writer be thoroughly convince that after this boy have work hard all the day long he never would have sit down to study half the night through if it have not be a pleasure to he in short no sort of toil go hard with he for he be a fine manly youngster cheerful and stalwart one who never slink from what he have set about nor turn he back except upon what be dishonest he work lightsomely and even lustily at he coarser pursuit for in that sturdy household to work have long be hold a duty thus improve himself at odd hour until he be fit for the vocation of a printer and look upon by the village as a genius we youth go to manchester and apply himself to that art not only for itself but as the surest means of further knowledge of course he become a master in the craft at length return to he own town to exercise it he grow by he industry and good conduct into a condition to exercise it on he own account and set up a newspaper -- the sheffield register bear of the people it be natural that joseph gale should in he journal side with the reformer and he do so : but with that unvarying moderation which he good sense and probity of purpose teach he and which he ever after through life preserve he keep within the right limit of whatever doctrine he embrace and hold a measure in all he political principle -- know that the best in common with the worst tend by a law of all party to exaggeration and extreme beyond this temperateness of mind nothing could move he thus guard by a rare equity of the understanding from excess as to measure he be equally guard by a charity and a gentleness of heart the most exhaustless in a word it may safely be say of he that amidst all the heat of faction he never fall into violence -- amidst all the asperity of public life never stoop to personality -- and in all that he write left scarcely a unwise and not a single dishonest sentence behind he such quality though not the most forward to set themselves forth to the public attention should surely bring success to a editor the well-judging be soon please with the plain good sense the general intelligence the modesty and the invariable rectitude of the young man they suffrage gain that of the rest begin to follow for in truth there be few thing of which the light be less to be hide than that of a good newspaper the register by degree win a general esteem and begin to prosper and as accord to the discovery of malthus prosperity be fond of pair it soon happen that we printer go to fall in love naturally again be a printer he from a regard for the eternal fitness of thing fall in love with a authoress this be miss winifred marshall a young lady of the town of newark who to a agreeable person good connection and advantage of education join a literary talent that have already win no little approval she write verse and publish several novel of the minerva press order -lrb- such as lady emma melcombe and she family matilda berkley etc -rrb- of which only the name survive despite the poetic adage about the course of true love that of joseph gale run smooth : miss marshall accept he suit and they be marry never be husband and wife better mate they live together most happily and long -- she die at a advanced age only two year before he meantime she have from the first bring he some marriage-portion beyond that which the muse be wont to give with they daughter -- namely laurel and bay and she bear he three son and five daughter near half of whom the parent survive three -lrb- joseph the younger winifred and sarah now mr seaton -rrb- be bear in england a fourth at the town of altona -lrb- near hamburg -rrb- from which she be name and the rest in america to resume this story in the order of event mr gale go on with he journal and when it have grow quite flourish he add to he printing-office the invite appendage of a book-store which also flourish in the progress of both it become necessary that he should employ a clerk among the applicant bring to he by a advertisement of what he need there present himself a unfriended youth with whose intelligence modesty and other sign of the future man within he be so pleased that he at once take he into he employment -- at first merely to keep he account -- but by degree for superior thing -- until progressively he -lrb- the youth -rrb- mature into he assistant editor he dearest friend and finally he successor in the journal that youth be jame montgomery the poet on the 10th of April 1786 mr gale give birth at eckington they rural home to she first child joseph the present chief of the intelligencer -lrb- mr gale have since die -rrb- happy at home the young mother could as delightedly look without the business of she husband throve apace nor less the general regard and esteem in which he be personally hold he grow continually in the confidence and affection of he fellow-citizen endearing himself especially by he sober counsel and he quiet charity to all that industrious class who know he as one of they own and could look up without reluctance to a superiority which be only the unpretend one of goodness and sense over they without seek it he gradually obtain a extraordinary ascendancy of which the follow be a single instance upon some occasion of wages or want among the working-people of sheffield a great popular commotion have burst out attend by a huge mob and riot which the magistracy strove in vain to appease or quell when all else have fail mr gale bethink he of try what he could do drive into the thick of the crowd in a open carriage he suddenly appear amongst the rioter and by a few plain word of remonstrance convinced they that they could only hurt themselves by overturn the law that they should seek other mode of redress and meantime have all better go home they agree to do so -- but with the condition annex that they should first see he home whereupon loosen the horse from the carriage they draw he with loud acclamation back to he house such be he prospects and position for some seven year after he marriage when of a sudden without any fault of he own he be make answerable for a fact that render it necessary for he to flee beyond the realm of great britain as a friend to reform he have in he journal at first support pitt 's ministry which have set out on the same principle but which when the revolutionary movement in france threaten to overthrow all government abandon all reform as a thing not then safe to set about from this change of view mr gale dissent and still advocate reform so again as to the french revolution not yet arrive at the atrocity which it speedily reach -- he see no need of make war upon it in its outset he have along with fox and other liberal applaud it for it then profess little but what liberal wish to see bring about in england he still think it good for france though not for he own country thus moderate as he be he be count in the opposition and jealously watch it be in the autumn of 1792 while he be go upon a journey of business that a king 's - messenger bear a secretary-of-state 's warrant for the seizure of mr gale 's person present himself at he house for this proceeding against he the follow fact have give occasion in he office be employ a printer name richard davison -- a very quick capable useful man and therefore much trust -- but a little wild withal at once with french principle and religion with conventicle and those seditious club that be then secretly organize all over the island this person correspond with a central club in london and have be rash enough to write they just then a insurrectionary letter set forth revolutionary plan the number the means they could command the supplies of arm etc that they be form this sage epistle be betray into the hand of the government the discreet dick they might very well have hang but that be not worth while from he connection with the register they suppose he to be only the agent and cover for a deeper man -- its proprietor and at the latter only therefore have they strike nothing save he from the blow except the casual fact of he absence in another country and they be ignorant of the route he have take this he friend alone know and where to reach he they do so at once by a courier secretly despatch and he on learn what await he at home instead of trust to he innocence choose rather to trust the sea and make he way to the coast take the only good security for he freedom by put the german ocean between he and pursuit he sail for amsterdam where arrive he thence make he way to hamburg at which city he have decide that he family should join he to england he could return only at the cost of a prosecution and though this would of necessity end in a acquittal it be almost sure to be precede by imprisonment while together they would half-ruin he it be plain then that he must at once do what he have long intend to do go to america accordingly he give direction to he family to come to he and to montgomery that he should dispose of all he effect and settle up all he affair these office that devote friend perform most faithfully remit he the proceeds the newspaper he himself buy and continue under the name of the sheffield iris still retain he affection for the family he pass into the household of what be leave of they and supply to the three sister of the elder joseph gale the place of a brother and wifeless and childless live on to a very advanced age content with they society alone the last of these dame die only a few month ago at hamburg whence they be to take ship for the united state the family be detain all the winter by the delicate health of mr gale this delay she husband put to profit by master two thing likely to be needful to he -- the german tongue and the art of short-hand in the spring they sail for philadelphium arrive there he seek and at once obtain employment as a printer it be soon perceive not only that he be a admirable workman but every way a man of unusual merit and able to turn he hand to almost anything by-and-by reporter of congressional debate be few and very indifferent he employer claypole say to he -- you seem able to do everything that be want : pray could you not do these congressional report for we better than this drunken callender who give we so much trouble mr gale reply with he usual modesty that he do not know what he could do but that he would try the next day he attend the sit of congress and bring away in time for the compositor a faithful transcript of such speech as have be make appear in the next morning 's paper it of course greatly astonished everybody it seem a new era in such thing they have hear of the like in parliament but have scarcely credit it claypole himself be the most astonished of all seize a copy he run around the town show it to all he meet and still hardly comprehend the wonder which he himself have instigate it need hardly be say that here be something far more profitable for mr gale than type-setting but to apply this skill possess by none else to the exclusive advantage of a journal of he own be yet more invite and the opportunity soon offer itself he become the purchaser of the independent gazetteer a paper already establish this he conduct with success until the year 1799 make both reputation and many friend among the warmest of these be some of the north carolina member and especially that one whose name have ever since stand as a sort of proverb of honesty nathaniel macon by the representation of these friend he be lead to believe that they new state capital raleigh where there be only a very decrepit specimen of journalism would afford he at once a surer competence and a happier life than philadelphium come to this conclusion he dispose of he newspaper and printing-office and remove to raleigh where he at once establish the register of he late paper the gazetteer we shall soon follow the fortune to washington where it become the intelligencer : meantime we must finish what be leave to tell of he own at raleigh he arrive under auspices which give he not only a reputation but friend to set out with both he soon confirm and augment by the constant merit of he journal its sober sense its moderation and its integrity he win and invariably maintain the confidence of all on that side of politics with which he concur -lrb- the old republican -rrb- and scarcely less conciliate the respect of he opponent he quickly obtain for he skill and not merely as a partisan reward the public printing of he state and retain it until reach the ordinary limit of human life he withdraw from the press in the just and kindly old commonwealth which he so long serve it would have be hard for any party no matter how much in the ascendant to move anything for he injury for the love and esteem which he have the faculty of attract from the first deepen as he advance in age into a absolute reverence the most general for he character and person and the good north state honor and cherish no son of she own loin more than she do joseph gale in raleigh there be no figure that as it pass be greet so much by the sign of a peculiar veneration as that great stalwart one of he look so plain and unaffected yet with a sort of nobleness in its very simplicity a gentleness in its strength a inborn goodness and courtesy in all its roughness of frame -- he countenance mild and calm yet commanding thoughtful yet pleasant and betoken a bosom that no low thought have ever enter you have in he indeed the highest image of that stanch old order from which he be spring and might have say here be the soul of a baron in the body of a peasant for he really look when well examine like all the virtue do in roughcast with he the age of necessary and of well-merited repose have now come and judge that he could attain it only by quit that habitual scene of business where it would still solicit he he transfer he newspaper he printing-office and the bookstore which he have make they adjunct in raleigh as in sheffield to he third son weston and remove to washington in order to pass the close of he day near two of the dearest of he child -- he son joseph and he daughter mr seaton -- from whom he have be separate the most in renounce all individual aim mr gale fall not into a mere life of meditation but seek its future pleasure in the adoption of a scheme of benevolence to the calm prosecution of which he might dedicate he decline power so long as he advanced age should permit a worthy object for such effort he recognize in the plan of african colonization and of its affair he accept and almost to he death sustain the management in chief achieve not less by he admirable judgment the warm approval and thanks of that wide-spread association than by the most amiable virtue of private life win in washington as he have do everywhere else from all that approach he a singular degree of deference and affection but the close of this long career of honor and of usefulness be now at hand in 1839 he lose the wife whose tenderness have cheer the labor and whose gay intelligence have brighten the leisure of he existence she have live the delight of that intimate society to which she have confine faculty that would have adorn any circle whatever and she die lament in proportion by it and by the only other to whom she be much know -- the poor she husband survive she but two year -- expire at he son 's house in raleigh where he be on a visit in April 1841 at the age of eighty he die as calm as a child in the placid faith of a true christian still tell he story in the order of date the writer would now turn to the younger joseph gale as we have see he arrive in this country when seven year old and go to raleigh about six year afterwards there he be place in a school where he make excellent progress -- profit by the recollection of he earlier lesson receive from that best of all elementary teacher a mother of well-cultivated mind he boyhood as usual prefigure the mature man : it be diligent in study hilarious at play he mind bent upon solid thing not the showy for all good just generous and kindly thing he have the warmest impulse and the truest perception quick to learn and to feel he be slow only of resentment never be man bear with more of those lacteal of the heart which secrete the milk of human kindness of the classic tongue he can be say to have learn only the latin : the greek be then little teach in any part of we country for the positive science he have much inclination since it be tell among other thing that he construct instrument for himself such as a electrical machine with the performance of which he much amaze the people of raleigh meantime he be form at home under the good guidance there a solid knowledge of all those fine old author whose work make the undegenerate literature of we language and then constitute what they call polite letter with these go hand in hand at that time in the academy of the south a profane amusement of the taste in short we sinful youth be fond of stage-play and even wickedly enact they instead of resort to singing-schools joseph gale the younger have he boyish emulation of roscius and garrick and perform top part in a diversity of those sad comedy and merry tragedy which boy be apt to make when they get into buskin but it must be say that as a theatric star he presently wax dim before a very handsome youth a little he senior who just then have enter he father 's office he be not only a printer but have already be twice a editor -- last in the late north carolina capital halifax -- previously in the great town of petersburg -- and be breed in what seem to raleigh a mighty city richmond in addition to all which strong point of reputation he come of a ffv and have be teach by the celebrated ogilvie of whom more anon he be familiar with theater and have not only see but even criticize the great actor he outshine he very brother-in-law and colleague that be to be for this young gentleman be william seaton meantime joseph too have learn the paternal art -- how well will appear from a single fact about this time he father 's office be destroy by fire and with it the unfinished printing of the legislative journal and act of the year time do not allow wait for new material from philadelphium just in this strait he that have of old be so inauspicious dick davison come once more into play -- but this time not as a marplot he strange to say be at hand and helpful for after he political exploit abandon england in disgust at the consequence of he gunpowder plot he too have not only come to america but have chance to set up he type-stick in the neighboring town of warrenton where have flourish he be now the master of a printing-office and the conductor of a newspaper thither then young joseph be despatch copy in hand richard -- really a worthy man after all -- gladly atone for he ancient hurtfulness by lend he type and press and fall to work with great vigor we young faust with he own hand put into type and print off the needful edition of the law he have also by this time as a important instrument of he intended profession attain the art of stenography when soon after he begin to employ it he rapidly become a excellent reporter and eventually when he have grow thoroughly verse in public affair confessedly the best reporter that we ever have he be now well-prepared to join in the manly strife of business or politics he father choose therefore at once to commit he to himself he judge he mature enough in principle strong enough in sense and fear lest by be keep too long under guidance and the easy life of home he should fall into inertness he first send he to philadelphium therefore to serve as a workman with birch and small after which he make for he a engagement on the national intelligencer as a reporter and send he to washington in October 1807 to that place change its name to the one just mention the father 's former paper the gazetteer have be transfer by he old associate samuel harrison smith its first issue there -lrb- tri-weekly -rrb- be on the 31st of October 1800 under the double title of the national intelligencer and washington advertiser the latter half of the title seem to have be drop in 1810 when its present senior come for a time into its sole proprietorship more than twice the age of any other journal now extant there -- for the globe come some thirty the union some forty-five year later -- the intelligencer have long stand in every worthy sense the patriarch of we metropolitan press it have witness the rise and fall around it of full a hundred competitor -- many of they declare enemy not a few what be more dangerous far profess friend yet in the face of all enmity and of such friendship it have ever hold on its calm way never desert the public cause -- as little extreme in its opposition as in its support of those in power so that its foe never forget it when they prevail but its friend repeatedly to estimate the value of its influence during its long career would be impossible -- so much of right have it bring about so much of wrong defeat though it come hither with we congress a newspaper have once before be set up here -- either upon the expectation create by the lay of certain corner-stone in 1792 that the government would fix itself at this spot or through a odd local faith in the dream of some ancient visionary dwelling hard by who have many year before foretold this as the destine site of a great imperial city a second rome and so have bestow upon goose creek the name of tiber long before this be washington the founder of this pre-adamite journal be mr benjamin moore its name the washington gazette its issue semi-weekly its annual price four dollar and the two lead principle which in that day of the infancy of political platform he salutatory announce be first to obtain a living for himself and secondly to amuse and inform he fellow-mortal how long this day-star of we journalism shone before night again swallow up the premature dawn can not now be state it must have be publish at what be then expect to be we city but be we penitentiary greenleaf 's point to the intelligencer young mr gale bring such vigor such talent and such skill in every department that within two year in 1809 he be admit by mr smith into partnership within less than a year from which date that gentleman grow weary of the laborious life of the press be content to withdraw and leave he sole proprietor editor and reporter a enormous worker however it matter little to he what task be to be assume : he could multiply himself among they and suffice for all in thus assume the undivided charge of the paper the young editor think it become to set forth one main principle that have beyond a question be admirably the guide of he public life : he say to he reader -- it be the dearest right and ought to be cherish as the proudest prerogative of a freeman to be guide by the unbiassed conviction of he own judgment this right it be my firm purpose to maintain and to preserve inviolate the independence of the print now commit into my hand never be pledge more universally make or more rarely keep than this it be towards the close of mr jefferson 's presidency that mr gale have enter the office of the intelligencer and it be during mr madison 's first year that he become joint-editor of that paper of these administration it have be the supporter -- only follow in that regard the transmitted politics of its original the gazetteer derive from the elder mr gale breed in these the son have learn they of he sire just as he have adopt he religion or he moral spring from one who have be persecute in england as a republican it be natural that the son should love the faith for which a honor parent have suffer the high quality and the strong ability of the young editor do not fail to strike the discerning eye of president madison who speedily give he he affection and confidence to that administration the intelligencer stand in the most intimate and faithful relation -- sustain its policy as a necessity where it might not have be a choice during the entire course of the war the intelligencer sustain most vigorously all the measure needful for carry it on with efficiency and it do equally good service in reanimate whenever it have slacken at any disaster the droop spirit of we people nor do its editor when there be two stop at these proof of sincerity nor slink when danger draw near from that hazard of they own person to which they have stir up the country when invasion come they at once take to arm as volunteer common-soldier go to meet the enemy and remain in the field until he have fall back to the coast and during the invasion of washington moreover they establishment be attack and partially destroy through a unmanly spirit of revenge on the part of the british force in October 1812 propose to himself the change of he paper into a daily one as be accordingly bring about on the first of January ensue mr gale invite mr seaton who have by this time become he brother-in-law to come and join he he do so and the early tie of youthful friendship which have grow between they at raleigh and which the new relation have draw still closer gradually mature into that more than friendship or brotherhood that oneness and identity of all purpose opinion and interest which have ever since exist between they without a moment 's interruption and have long be to those who understand it a rare spectacle of that concord and affection so seldom witness and could never have come about except between man of singular virtue the same year that bring gale and seaton together as partner in business witness a alliance of a more interesting character for it be in 1813 that mr gale marry the accomplished daughter of theodorick lee younger brother of that brilliant soldier of the revolution the legionary harry but at this natural point the writer must go back for a while in order to bring down the story of william seaton to where unite with he associate 's the two thus flow on in a single stream he be bear January 11th 1785 on the paternal estate in king william county virginium one of a family of four son and three daughter at the good old mansion pass he childhood there too accord to what be then the wont in virginium he tread the first step of learn under the guidance of a domestic tutor a decayed gentleman old and bedridden for the only part leave he of a genteel inheritance be the gout but when it become necessary to send he riper progeny abroad for more advanced study mr seaton very justly bethought he of go along with they and so betook himself with he whole family to richmond where he be the possessor of house enough to afford he a good habitation and a genteel income here then along with he brother and sister william be teach through a ascend series of school until at last he arrive at what be the wonder of that day -- the academy of ogilvie the scotchman he be it note have a earldom -lrb- that of finlater -rrb- which sleep while its heir be play pedagogue in america : a strange mixture of the ancient rhapsodist with the modern stroll actor of the lord with he who live by he wit scot as he be he be better fit to teach anything rather than common sense the writer must not give the idea however that there be in lord ogilvie anything but eccentricity to derogate from the honor of either he lineage or he learn a very solid teacher he be not a great enthusiast by nature and a master of the whole art of discourse finely of even those thing which he know not well he dazzle much pleased greatly and obtain a high reputation so that if he do not regularly inform or discipline the mind of he pupil he probably make they to a unusual degree amends on another side : he infuse into they by the glitter of he accomplishment a high admiration for learning and for letter certainly the number of he scholar that arrive at distinction be remarkable and this be of course a fact conclusive of great merit of some sort as a teacher where as in he case the pupil be not many without pause to mention other of they who arrive at honor it may be well enough to refer to winfield scott william campbell preston b watkin leigh william s archer and william c rive the writer do not know if it have ever be design that young seaton should proceed from ogilvie 's class to the more systematic course of a college possibly not even among the wealthy at that time home-education be often employ the child of both sex be commit to the care of private tutor usually young scotchmen the graduate of glasgow edinburgh or aberdeen send over to the planter upon order along with he yearly supply of goods by he merchant abroad or else the son be send to select private school like that of ogilvie set up by man of such ability and scholarship as be suppose capable of perform the whole work of institution at any rate we youth without further preparation at about the age of eighteen enter earnestly upon the duty of life he fall at once into he vocation -- impel to it no doubt by the ambition for letter and public affair which the lesson of ogilvie usually produce party run high virginia politics flush with recent success have add to the usual passion of the contest those of victory into the novelty of the day we student accordingly plunge in common with nearly all other of a like age and condition he become in short a politician though talent of every other sort abound that of write promptly and pleasingly do not young seaton be find to possess this and therefore soon obtain leave to exercise it as assistant-editor of one of the richmond journal he have already make himself acquaint with the art of printing in a office where he become the companion and friend of the late thoma ritchie and it be more than probable that many of he youthful editorial be set up by he own hand attain by degree a youthful reputation he receive a invitation to take the sole charge of a respectable paper in petersburg the republican the editor and proprietor of which mr thoma field be about to leave the country for some month acquit himself here with great approval he win a invitation to a still better position -- that of the proprietary editorship of the north carolina journal publish at halifax the former capital of that state and the only newspaper there he accept the offer and become the master of he own independent journal of its be so he proceed at once to give he patron a somewhat decisive token they be chiefly federalist it be a region strongly federal and the gazette itself have always maintain the purest federalism : but he forthwith change its politics to republican there can be no doubt that he who make a change so manly conduct he paper with spirit yet he must have do it also with that wise and winning moderation and fairness which have since distinguish he and he associate william seaton could never have fall into anything of the temper or the taste the moral or the manners which be now so widely the shame of the american press he could never have write in the ill spirit of mere party so as to wind or even offend the good man of a opposite way of think the inference be a sure one from he character and be confirm by what we know to have happen during he editorial career among the federalist of halifax instead of he paper 's lose ground under the circumstance just mention it really gain so largely and win so much the esteem of both side that when he desire to dispose of it in order to seek a higher theater he easily sell the property for double what it have cost he it be now that he make he way to raleigh the new state-capital and become connect with the register nor be it long before this connection be draw yet closer by he happy marriage with the lady whose virtue and accomplishment have so long be the modest yet shine ornament and charm of he household and of the society of washington after this union he continue he previous relationship with the register until as already mention he come to the metropolis to join all he fortune with those of he brother-in-law from this point of course they story like they life become unite and merge with a rare concord into one they have have no bickering no misunderstanding no difference of view which a consultation do not at once reconcile they have never know a division of interest from they common coffer each have always draw whatever he choose and down to this day there have never be a settlement of account between they what fact could better attest not merely a singular harmony of character but a admirable conformity of virtue the history of the intelligencer have as to all its lead particulars be for fifty year spread before thousand of reader in its continuous diary to re-chronicle any part of what be so well know would be idle in the extreme of the editor personally they life since they become mature and settle have present few event such as be not common to all man -- little of vicissitude beyond that of pocket now full and now empty -- nothing but a steady performance of duty a exertion whenever necessary of high ability and the gradual accumulation through these of a deeply feel esteem among all the best and wisest of the land amidst the many popular passion with which nearly all have in we country run wild they have maintain a perpetual and sage moderation amidst incessant variation of doctrine they have preserve a memory and a conscience in the frequent fluctuation of power they have steadily check the alternate excess of both party and they have never give to either a factious opposition or a merely partisan support of they journal it may be say that there have in all we time shine no such continual light on public affair there have stand no such sure defense of whatever be needful to be uphold temper the heat of both side -- re-nationalize all spirit of section -- combate we propensity to lawlessness at home and aggression abroad -- spread constantly on each question of the day a mass of sound information -- the venerable editor have be all the while a power and a safety in the land no matter who be the ruler neither party could have spare a opposition so just or a support so well-measured thus it can not be deem a american exaggeration to declare the opinion as to the influence of the intelligencer over we public counsel that its value be not easily to be overrate never meantime be authority wield with less assumption the intelligencer could not of course help be aware of the weight which its opinion always carry among the thinking but it have never betray any consciousness of its influence unless in a ceaseless care to deserve respect its modesty and candor its fairness and courtesy have be invariable nor less so its observance of that decorum and those charity which constitute the very grace of all public life from the time of they come together down to the year 1820 gale and seaton be the exclusive reporter as well as editor of they journal -- one of they devote himself to the senate and the other to the house of representative generally speak they publish only run report -- on special occasion however give the speech and proceedings entire in those day they have seat of honor assign to they directly by the side of the preside officer and over the snuff-box in a quiet and familiar manner the topic of the day be often discuss to the privilege they then enjoy but more especially to they sagacity and industry be we now indebted as a country for they register of debate which with the intelligencer have become a most important part of we national history as in they journal nearly all the most eminent of american statesman have discuss the affair of the country so have they be the direct means of preserve many of the speech which be now the acknowledged ornament of we political literature have it not be for mr gale the great intellectual combat between hayne and webster for example would have pass into a vague tradition perhaps the original note of mr webster 's speech now in mr gale 's library form a volume of several hundred page and have be correct and interline by the statesman 's own hand present a treasure that might be envy at the period just allude to mr gale have give up the practice of report any speech and it be a mere accident that lead he to pay mr webster the compliment in question that it be appreciate be prove by many reciprocal act of kindness and the long and happy intimacy that exist between the two gentleman end only with the life of the statesman it be mr webster 's opinion that the ability of mr gale be of the highest order and yet the writer have hear of one instance in which even the editor could not get along without a help hand mr gale have for some day be engage upon the grand jury and with he head full of technicality enter upon the duty of prepare a certain editorial in do this he unconsciously employ a number of legal phrase and when about half through find it necessary to come to a halt at this juncture he drop a note to mr webster transmit the unfinished article and explain he difficulty mr webster take it in hand finish it to the satisfaction of mr gale and it be publish as editorial but the writer be trespassing upon private ground and it be with great reluctance that he refrain from record a long list of incident which have come to he knowledge calculate to illustrate the manifold virtue of he distinguished friend that they be universally respect and beloved by those who know they -- that they opinion on public matter have be solicit by secretary of state and even by president oppose to they in politics -- that they journal have do more than any other in the country to promote a healthy tone in polite literature -- that they home-life have be make happy by the influence of refinement and taste -- and that they have give away to the poor money enough almost to build a city and to the unfortunate speak kind word enough to fill a library be all assertion which none can truthfully deny if therefore to look back upon a long life not _ uselessly spend _ be what will give we peace at last then will the evening of they day be all that they could desire and they silver hair the most appropriate crown of true patriotism will purchase they a good opinion and buy man 's voice to

counsel poor elsie except she father who have learn to let she have she own way so as not to disturb such relation as they have together and the old black woman who have a real though limited influence over the girl perhaps she do not need counsel to look upon she one might well suppose that she be competent to defend herself against any enemy she be like to have that glitter piercing eye be not to be soften by a few smooth word speak in low tone charge with the common sentiment which win they way to maiden ' heart that round lithe sinuous figure be as full of dangerous life as ever lay under the slender flank and clean-shaped limb of a panther there be particular time when elsie be in such a mood that it must have be a bold person who would have intrude upon she with reproof or counsel this be one of she day old sophy would say quietly to she father and he would as far as possible leave she to herself these day be more frequent as old sophy 's keen concentrated watchfulness have teach she at certain period of the year it be in the heat of summer that they be most common and most strongly characterize in winter on the other hand she be less excitable and even at time heavy and as if chill and dull in she sensibility it be a strange paroxysmal kind of life that belong to she it seem to come and go with the sunlight all winter long she would be comparatively quiet easy to manage listless slow in she motion she eye would lose something of its strange lustre and the old nurse would feel so little anxiety that she whole expression and aspect would show the change and people would say to she why sophy how young you be look as the spring come on elsie would leave the fireside have she tiger-skin spread in the empty southern chamber next the wall and lie there bask for whole hour in the sunshine as the season warm the light would kindle afresh in she eye and the old woman 's sleep would grow restless again -- for she know that so long as the glitter be fierce in the girl 's eye there be no trust she impulse or movement at last when the vein of the summer be hot and swollen and the juice of all the poison-plant and the blood of all the creature that feed upon they have grow thick and strong -- about the time when the second mowing be in hand and the brown wet-faced man be follow up the scythe as they chase the fall wave of grass -lrb- fall as the wave fall on sickle-curved beach the foam-flower drop as the grass-flowers drop -- with sharp semivowel consonantal sound -- _ frsh _ -- for that be the way the sea talk and leave all pure vowel-sound for the wind to breathe over it and all mute to the unyielding earth -rrb- -- about this time of over-ripe midsummer the life of elsie seem fullest of its malign and restless instinct this be the period of the year when the rockland people be most cautious of wander in the leafier covert which skirt the base of the mountain and the farmer like to wear thick long boot whenever they go into the bush but elsie be never so much give to roam over the mountain as at this season and as she have grow more absolute and uncontrollable she be as like to take the night as the day for she ramble at this season too all she peculiar taste in dress and ornament come out in a more striking way than at other time she be never so superb as then and never so threatening in she scowling beauty the bar skirt she always fancy show sharply beneath she diaphanous muslin the diamond often glitter on she breast as if for she own pleasure rather than to dazzle other the asp-like bracelet hardly leave she arm without some necklace she be never see -- either the golden cord she wear at the great party or a chain of mosaic or simply a ring of golden scale some say that elsie always sleep in a necklace and that when she die she be to be bury in one it be a fancy of hers -- but many think there be a reason for it nobody watch elsie with a more search eye than she cousin dick venner he have keep more out of she way of late it be true but there be not a movement she make which he do not carefully observe just so far as he could without exciting she suspicion it be plain enough to he that the road to fortune be before he and that the first thing be to marry elsie what course he should take with she or with other interested after marry she need not be decide in a hurry he have now do all he could expect to do at present in the way of conciliate the other member of the household the girl 's father tolerate he if he do not even like he whether he suspect he project or not dick do not feel sure but it be something to have get a foot-hold in the house and to have overcome any prepossession against he which he uncle might have entertain to be a good listener and a bad billiard-player be not a very great sacrifice to effect this object then old sophy could hardly help feeling well-disposed towards he after the gift he have bestow on she and the court he have pay she these be the only person on the place of much importance to gain over the people employ about the house and farmland have little to do with elsie except to obey she without question she command mr richard begin to think of reopen he second parallel but he have lose something of the coolness with which he have begin he system of operation the more he have reflect upon the matter the more he have convince himself that this be he one great chance in life if he suffer this girl to escape he such a opportunity could hardly in the nature of thing present itself a second time only one life between elsie and she fortune -- and life be so uncertain the girl might not suit he as a wife possibly time enough to find out after he have get she in short he must have the property and elsie venner as she be to go with it -- and then if he find it convenient and agreeable to lead a virtuous life he would settle down and raise child and vegetable but if he find it inconvenient and disagreeable so much the worse for those that make it so like many other person he be not principle against virtue provide virtue be a better investment than its opposite but he know that there might be contingency in which the property would be better without its incumbrance and he contemplate this conceivable problem in the light of all its possible solution one thing mr richard could not conceal from himself : elsie have some new cause of indifference at least if not of aversion to he with the acuteness which person who make a sole business of they own interest gain by practice so that fortune-hunter be often shrewd where real lover be terribly simple he fix at once on the young man up at the school where the girl have be go of late as probably at the bottom of it cousin elsie in love so he commune with himself upon he lonely pillow in love with a yankee schoolmaster what else can it be let he look out for himself he 'll stand but a bad chance between we what make you think she be in love with he meet she walking with he do not like she look and way -- she be think about _ something _ anyhow where do she get those book she be read so often not out of we library that be certain if i could have ten minute ' peep into she chamber now i would find out where she get they and what mischief she be up to at that instant as if some tributary demon have hear he wish a shape which could be none but elsie 's flit through a gleam of moonlight into the shadow of the the tree she be set out on one of she midnight ramble dick feel he heart stir in its place and presently he cheek flush with the old longing for a adventure it be not much to invade a young girl 's desert chamber but it would amuse a wakeful hour and tell he some little matter he want to know the chamber he sleep in be over the room which elsie chiefly occupy at this season there be no great risk of he be see or hear if he venture down-stair to she apartment mr richard venner in the pursuit of he interesting project arise and light a lamp he wrap himself in a dressing-gown and thrust he foot into a pair of cloth slipper he steal carefully down the stair and arrive safely at the door of elsie 's room the young lady have take the natural precaution to leave it fasten carry the key with she no doubt -- unless indeed she have get out by the window which be not far from the ground dick could get in at this window easily enough but he do not like the idea of leave he footprint in the flower-bed just under it he return to he own chamber and hold a council of war with himself he put he head out of he own window and look at that beneath it be open he then go to one of he trunk wich he unlock and begin carefully remove its contents what these be we need not stop to mention -- only remark that there be dress of various pattern which might afford a agreeable series of change and in certain contingency prove eminently useful after remove a few of these he thrust he hand to the very bottom of the remain pile and draw out a coil strip of leather many yard in length end in a noose -- a tough well-seasoned _ lasso _ look as if it have see service and be none the worse for it he uncoil a few yard of this and fasten it to the knob of a door then he throw the loose end out of the window so that it should hang by the open casement of elsie 's room by this he let himself down opposite she window and with a slight effort swing himself inside the room he light a match find a candle and have light that look curiously about he as clodius might have do when he smuggle himself in among the vestal elsie 's room be almost as peculiar as she dress and ornament it be a kind of museum of object such as the wood be full of to those who have eye to see they but many of they such as only few could hope to reach even if they know where to look for they crow ' nest which be never find but in the tall tree commonly enough in the fork of ancient hemlock egg of rare bird which must have take a quick eye and hard climb to find and get hold of moss and fern of unusual aspect and quaint monstrosity of vegetable growth such as nature delight in show that elsie have she taste and fancy like any naturalist or poet nature when leave to she own freak in the forest be grotesque and fanciful to the verge of license and beyond it the foliage of tree do not always require clipping to make it look like a image of life from those window at canoe meadow among the mountain we could see all summer long a lion rampant a shanghaus chicken and general jackson on horse-back do by nature in green leaf each with a single tree but to nature 's trick with bough and root and smaller vegetable growth there be no end she fancy be infinite and she humor not always refine there be a perpetual reminiscence of animal life in she rude caricature which sometimes actually reach the point of imitate the complete human figure as in that extraordinary specimen which nobody will believe to be genuine except the man of science and of which the discreet reader may have a glimpse by application in the proper quarter elsie have gather so many of these sculpture-like monstrosity that one might have think she have rob old sophy 's grandfather of he fetish they help to give she room a kind of enchanted look as if a witch have she home in it over the fireplace be a long staff-like branch strangle in the spiral coil of one of those vine which strain the smaller tree in they clinging embrace sink into the bark until the parasite become almost identify with its support with these sylvan curiosity be blended object of art some of they not less singular but other show a love for the beautiful in form and color such as a girl of fine organization and nice culture might naturally be expect to feel and to indulge in adorn she apartment all these object picture bronze vase and the rest do not detain mr richard venner very long whatever may have be he sensibility to art he be more curious about book and papers a copy of keat lay on the table he open it and read the name of _ bernard c langdon _ on the blank leaf a envelope be on the table with elsie 's name write in a similar hand but the envelope be empty and he could not find the note it contain she desk be lock and it would not be safe to tamper with it he have see enough the girl receive book and note from this fellow up at the school -- this usher this yankee quill-driver -- _ he _ be aspire to become the lord of the dudley domain then be he elsie have be reasonably careful she have lock up she papers whatever they might be there be little else that promise to reward he curiosity but he cast he eye on everything there be a clasp-bible among she book dick wonder if she ever unclasp it there be a book of hymn it have she name in it and look as if it might have be often read -- what the _ diablo _ have elsie to do with hymn mr richard venner be in a observe and analytical state of mind it will be notice or he might perhaps have be touch with the innocent betrayal of the poor girl 's chamber have she after all some human tenderness in she heart that be not the way he put the question -- but whether she would take seriously to this schoolmaster and if she do what would be the neatest and surest and quickest way of put a stop to all that nonsense all this however he could think over more safely in he own quarter so he steal softly to the window and catch the end of the leathern thong regain he own chamber and draw in the lasso it need only a little jealousy to set a man on who be doubtful in love or woo or to make he take hold of he court in earnest as soon as dick have satisfy himself that the young schoolmaster be he rival in elsie 's good grace he whole thought concentrate themselves more than ever on accomplish he great design of secure she for himself there be no time to be lose he must come into closer relation with she so as to withdraw she thought from this fellow and to find out more exactly what be the state of she affection if she have any so he begin to court she company again to propose ride with she to sing to she to join she whenever she be stroll about the grounds to make himself agreeable accord to the ordinary understanding of that phrase in every way which seem to promise a chance for succeed in that amiable effort the girl treat he more capriciously than ever she would be sullen and silent or she would draw back fiercely at some harmless word or gesture or she would look at he with she eye narrow in such a strange way and with such a wicked light in they that dick swear to himself they be too much for he and would leave she for the moment yet she tolerate he almost as a matter of necessity and sometimes seem to take a kind of pleasure in try she power upon he this he soon find out and humor she in the fancy that she could exercise a kind of fascination over he -- though there be time in which he actually feel a influence he could not understand a effect of some peculiar expression about she perhaps but still centre in those diamond eye of hers which it make one feel so curiously to look into whether elsie see into he object or not be more than he could tell he idea be after have conciliate the good-will of all about she as far as possible to make himself first a habit and then a necessity with the girl -- not to spring any trap of a declaration upon she until tolerance have grow into such a degree of inclination as she nature be like to admit he have succeed in the first part of he plan he be at liberty to prolong he visit at he own pleasure this be not strange these three person dudley venner he daughter and he nephew represent all that remain of a old and honorable family have elsie be like other girl she father might have be less willing to entertain a young fellow like dick as a inmate but he have long outgrow all the slighter apprehension which he might have have in common with all parent and follow rather than lead the imperious instinct of he daughter it be not a question of sentiment but of life and death or more than that -- some dark end perhaps which would close the history of he race with disaster and evil report upon the lip of all come generation as to the thought of he nephew 's make love to he daughter it have almost pass from he mind he have be so long in the habit of look at elsie as outside of all common influence and exceptional in the law of she nature that it be difficult for he to think of she as a girl to be fall in love with many person be surprise when other court they female relative they know they as good young or old woman enough -- aunt sister niece daughter whatever they may be -- but never think of anybody 's fall in love with they any more than of they be strike by lightning but in this case there be special reason in addition to the common family delusion -- reason which seem to make it impossible that she should attract a suitor who would _ dare _ to marry elsie no let she have the pleasure if it be one at any rate the wholesome excitement of companionship it might save she from lapse into melancholy or a worse form of madness dudley venner have a kind of superstition too that if elsie could only outlive three septenary twenty-one year so that accord to the prevalent idea she whole frame would have be thrice make over count from she birth she would revert to the natural standard of health of mind and feeling from which she have be so long pervert the thought of any other motive than love be sufficient to induce richard to become she suitor have not occur to he he have marry early at that happy period when interested motive be least apt to influence the choice and he single idea of marriage be that it be the union of person naturally draw towards each other by some mutual attraction very simple perhaps but he have live lonely for many year since he wife 's death and judge the heart of other most of all of he brother 's son by he own he have often think whether in case of elsie 's die or be necessarily doom to seclusion he might not adopt this nephew and make he he heir but it have not occur to he that richard might wish to become he son-in-law for the sake of he property it be very easy to criticize other people 's mode of deal with they child outside observer see result parent see process they notice the trivial movement and accent which betray the blood of this or that ancestor they can detect the irrepressible movement of hereditary impulse in look and act which mean nothing to the common observer to be a parent be almost to be a fatalist this boy sit with leg cross just as he uncle use to whom he never see he grandfather both die before he be bear but he have the movement of the eyebrow which we remember in one of they and the gusty temper of the other these be thing parent can see and which they must take account of in education but which few except parent can be expect to really understand here and there a sagacious person old or of middle age who have _ triangulate _ a race that be take three or more observation from the several standing-place of three different generation can tell pretty nearly the range of possibility and the limitation of a child actual or potential of a give stock -- error except always because child of the same stock be not breed just alike because the trait of some less known ancestor be liable to break out at any time and because each human being have after all a small fraction of individuality about he which give he a flavor so that he be distinguishable from other by he friend or in a court of justice and which occasionally make a genius or a saint or a criminal of he it be well that young person can not read these fatal oracle of nature blind impulse be she highest wisdom after all we make we great jump and then she take the bandage off we eye that be the way the broad sea-level of average be maintain and the physiological democracy be enable to fight against the principle of selection which would disinherit all the weaker child the magnificent constituency of mediocrity of which the world be make up -- the people without biography whose life have make a clear solution in the fluid menstruum of time instead of be precipitate in the opaque sediment of history -- but this be a narrative and not a disquisition chapter xx from without and from within there be not want people who accuse dudley venner of weakness and bad judgment in he treatment of he daughter some be of opinion that the great mistake be in not break she will when she be a little child there be nothing the matter with she they say but that she have be spoil by indulgence if _ they _ have have the charge of she they would have bring she down she would get the upperhand of she father now but if he would only take hold of she in season there be people who think that everything may be do if the doer be he educator or physician be only call in season no doubt -- but _ in season _ would often be a hundred or two year before the child be bear and people never send so early as that the father of elsie venner know he duty and he difficulty too well to trouble himself about anything other might think or say so soon as he find that he could not govern he child he give he life up to follow she and protect she as far as he could it be a stern and terrible trial for a man of acute sensibility and not without force of intellect and will and the manly ambition for himself and he family-name which belong to he endowment and he position passive endurance be the hardest trial to person of such a nature what make it still more a long martyrdom be the necessity for bear he cross in utter loneliness he could not tell he grief he could not talk of they even with those who know they secret spring he minister have the unsympathetic nature which be common in the meaner sort of devotee -- person who mistake spiritual selfishness for sanctity and grab at the infinite prize of the great future and elsewhere with the egotism they excommunicate in its hardly more odious form of avarice and self-indulgence how could he speak with the old physician and the old black woman about a sorrow and a terror which but to name be to strike dumb the lip of consolation in the dawn of he manhood he have find that second consciousness for which young man and young woman go about look into each other 's face with they sweet artless aim playing in every feature and make they beautiful to each other as to all of we he have find he other self early before he have grow weary in the search and waste he freshness in vain longing : the lot of many perhaps we may say of most who infringe the patent of we social order by intrude themselves into a life already upon half-allowance of the necessary luxury of existence the life he have lead for a brief space be not only beautiful in outward circumstance as old sophy have describe it to the reverend doctor it be that delicious process of the tuning of two soul to each other string by string not without little half-pleasing discord now and then when some chord in one or the other prove to be over-strained or over-lax but always approach nearer and nearer to harmony until they become at last as two instrument with a single voice something more than a year of this blissful double consciousness have pass over he when he find himself once more alone -- alone save for the little diamond-eyed child lie in the old woman 's arm with the coral necklace round she throat and the rattle in she hand he would not die by he own act it be not the way in he family there may have be other perhaps better reason but this be enough he do not come of suicidal stock he must live for this child 's sake at any rate and yet -- oh yet who could tell with what thought he look upon she sometimes she little feature would look placid and something like a smile would steal over they then all he tender feeling would rush up into he eye and he would put he arm out to take she from the old woman -- but all at once she eye would narrow and she would throw she head back and a shudder would seize he as he stoop over he child -- he could not look upon she -- he could not touch he lip to she cheek nay there would sometimes come into he soul such frightful suggestion that he would hurry from the room lest the hint thought should become a momentary madness and he should lift he hand against the helpless infant which owe he life in those miserable day he use to wander all over the mountain in he restless endeavor to seek some relief for inward suffering in outward action he have no thought of throw himself from the summit of any of the broken cliff but he clamber over they recklessly as have no particular care for he life sometimes he would go into the accursed district where the venomous reptile be always to be dread and court they worst haunt and kill all he could come near with a kind of blind fury that be strange in a person of he gentle nature one overhang cliff be a favorite haunt of he it frown upon he home beneath in a very menacing way he notice slight seam and fissure that look ominous -- what would happen if it break off some time or other and come crash down on the field and roof below he think of such a possible catastrophe with a singular indifference in fact with a feeling almost like pleasure it would be such a swift and thorough solution of this great problem of life he be work out in ever-recurring daily anguish the remote possibility of such a catastrophe have frighten some timid dweller beneath the mountain to other place of residence here the danger be most imminent and yet he love to dwell upon the chance of its occurrence danger be often the best _ counter-irritant _ in case of mental suffering he find a solace in careless exposure of he life and learn to endure the trial of each day better by dwelling in imagination on the possibility that it might be the last for he and the home that be he time the great consoler help these influence and he gradually fall into more easy and less dangerous habit of life he cease from he more perilous ramble he think less of the danger from the great overhang rock and forest they have hang there for century it be not very likely they would crash or slide in he time he become accustomed to all elsie 's strange look and way old sophy dress she with ruffle round she neck and hunt up the red coral branch with silver bell which the little toothless dudley have bite upon for a hundred year by a infinite effort she father force himself to become the companion of this child for whom he have such a mingled feeling but whose presence be always a trial to he and often a terror at a cost which no human being could estimate he have do he duty and in some degree reap he reward elsie grow up with a kind of filial feeling for he such as she nature be capable of she never would obey he that be not to be look for command threat punishment be out of the question with she the mere physical effect of cross she will betray themselves in such change of expression and color that it would have be senseless to attempt to govern she in any such way leave she mainly to herself she could be to some extent indirectly influence -- not otherwise she call she father dudley as if he have be she brother she order everybody and would be order by none who could know all these thing except the few people of the household what wonder therefore that ignorant and shallow person lay the blame on she father of those peculiarity which be freely talk about -- of those darker tendency which be hint of in whisper to all this talk so far as it reach he he be supremely indifferent not only with the indifference which all gentleman feel to the gossip of they inferior but with a charitable calmness which do not wonder or blame he know that he position be not simply a difficult but a impossible one and school himself to bear he destiny as well as he might and report himself only at headquarters he have grow gentle under this discipline he hair be just begin to be touch with silver and he expression be that of habitual sadness and anxiety he have no counsellor as we have see to turn to who do not know either too much or too little he have no heart to rest upon and into which he might unburden himself of the secret and the sorrow that be ache in he own breast yet he have not allow himself to run to waste in the long time since he be leave alone to he trial and fear he have resist the seduction which always beset solitary man with restless brain overwrought by depressing agency he disguise no misery to himself with the lie delusion of wine he seek no sleep from narcotic though he lay with throb wide-open eyeball through all the weary hour of the night it be understand between dudley venner and old doctor kittredge that elsie be a subject of occasional medical observation on account of certain mental peculiarity which might end in a permanent affection of she reason beyond this nothing be say whatever may have be in the mind of either but dudley venner have study elsie 's case in the light of all the book he could find which might do anything towards explain it as in all case where man meddle with medical science for a special purpose have no previous acquaintance with it he imagination find what it want in the book he read and adjust it to the fact before he so it be he come to cherish those two fancy before allude to : that the ominous birthmark she have carry from infancy might fade and become obliterate and that the age of complete maturity might be signalize by a entire change in she physical and mental state he hold these vague hope as all of we nurse we only half-believed illusion not for the world would he have question he sagacious old medical friend as to the probability or possibility of they be true we be very shy of ask question of those who know enough to destroy with one word the hope we live on in this life of comparative seclusion to which the father have doom himself for the sake of he child he have find time for large and vary read the learn judge thornton confess himself surprise at the extent of dudley venner 's information doctor kittredge find that he be in advance of he in the knowledge of recent physiological discovery he have take pain to become acquaint with agricultural chemistry and the neighbor farmer owe he some useful hint about the management of they land he renew he old acquaintance with the classic author he love to warm he pulse with homer and calm they down with horace he receive all manner of new book and periodical and gradually gain a interest in the event of the pass time yet he remain almost a hermit not absolutely refuse to see he neighbor nor ever churlish towards they but on the other hand not cultivate any intimate relation with they he have retire from the world a young man little more than a youth indeed with sentiment and aspiration all of they suddenly extinguish the first have bequeath he a single huge sorrow the second a single try duty in due time the anguish have lose something of its poignancy the light of earlier and happier memory have begin to struggle with and to soften its thick darkness and even that duty which he have confront with such a effort have become a endurable habit at a period of life when many have be live on the capital of they acquire knowledge and they youthful stock of sensibility until they intellect be really shallower and they heart emptier than they be at twenty dudley venner be stronger in thought and tenderer in soul than in the first freshness of he youth when he count but half he present year he be now on the verge of that decade which mark the decline of man who have cease grow in knowledge and strength : from forty to fifty a man must move upward or the natural fall off in the vigor of life will carry he rapidly downward at the entrance of this decade he inward nature be richer and deeper than in any earlier period of he life if he could only be summon to action he be capable of noble service if he sympathy could only find a outlet he be never so capable of love as now for he natural affection have be gather in the course of all these year and the trace of that ineffaceable calamity of he life be soften and partially hide by new growth of thought and feeling as the wreck leave by a mountain-slide be cover over by the gentle intrusion of the soft-stemmed herb which will prepare it for the stronger vegetation that will bring it once more into harmony with the peaceful slope around it perhaps dudley venner have not gain so much in worldly wisdom as if he have be more in society and less in he study the indulgence with which he treat he nephew be no doubt imprudent a man more in the habit of deal with man would have be more guard with a person with dick 's questionable story and unquestionable physiognomy but he be singularly unsuspicious and he natural kindness be a additional motive to the wish for introduce some variety into the routine of elsie 's life if dudley venner do not know just what he want at this period of he life there be a great many people in the town of rockland who think they do know he have be a widower long enough -- nigh twenty year wa 'n' t it he would be aout to spraowle 's party -- there wa 'n' t anything to hender he why he should not stir raound l' k other folk what be the reason he do not go abaout to taown-meetin 's 'n' sahbath-meetin 's 'n' lyceum 'n' school - ` xamination 'n' s ` prise-party 'n' funeral -- and other entertainment where the still-faced two-story folk be in the habit of look round to see if any of the mansion-house gentry be present -- fac ' be he be livin ' too lonesome daown there at the mansion-haouse why should not he make up to the jedge 's daughter she be genteel enough for he and -- let 's see haow old be she seven - 'n' - twenty -- no six - 'n' - twenty -- bear the same year we bury aour little anny marí there be no possible objection to this arrangement if the party interested have see fit to make it or even to think of it but portium as some of the mansion-house people call she do not happen to awaken the elective affinity of the lonely widower he meet she once in a while and say to himself that she be a good specimen of the grand style of woman and then the image come back to he of a woman not quite so large not quite so imperial in she port not quite so incisive in she speech not quite so judicial in she opinion but with two or three more joint in she frame and two or three soft inflection in she voice which for some absurd reason or other draw he to she side and so bewitch he that he tell she half he secret and look into she eye all that he could not tell in less time than it would have take he to discuss the champion paper of the last quarterly with the admirable portium _ heu quantum minus _ how much more be that lose image to he than all it leave on earth the study of love be very much like that of meteorology we know that just about so much rain will fall in a season but on what particular day it will shower be more than we can tell we know that just about so much love will be make every year in a give population but who will rain he young affection upon the heart of whom be not know except to the astrologer and fortune-teller and why rain fall as it do and why love be make just as it be be equally puzzling question the woman a man love be always he own daughter far more he daughter than the female child bear to he by the common law of life it be not the outside woman who take he name that he love : before she image have reach the center of he consciousness it have pass through fifty many-layered nerve-strainer be churn over by ten thousand pulse-beat and react upon by million of lateral impulse which bandy it about through the mental space as a reflection be send back and forward in a saloon line with mirror with this altered image of the woman before he he preëxisting ideal become blended the object of he love be half the offspring of she legal parent and half of she lover 's brain the difference between the real and the ideal object of love must not exceed a fix maximum the heart 's vision can not unite they stereoscopically into a single image if the divergence pass certain limit a formidable analogy much in the nature of a proof with very serious consequence which moralist and match-maker would do well to remember double vision with the eye of the heart be a dangerous physiological state and may lead to misstep and serious fall whether dudley venner would ever find a breathing image near enough to he ideal one to fill the desolate chamber of he heart or not be very doubtful some gracious and gentle woman whose influence would steal upon he as the first low word of prayer after that interval of silent mental supplication know to one of we simpler form of public worship glide into he consciousness without hurt its old grief herself know the chastening of sorrow and subdue into sweet acquiescence with the divine will -- some such woman as this if heaven should send he such might call he back to the world of happiness from which he seem forever exile he could never again be the young lover who walk through the garden-alley all red with rose in the old dead and bury June of long ago he could never forget the bride of he youth whose image grow phantom-like with the lapse of year hover over he like a dream while wake and like a reality in dream but if it might be in god 's good providence that this desolate life should come under the influence of human affection once more what a ecstasy of renew existence be in store for he he life have not all be bury under that narrow ridge of turf with the white stone at its head it seem so for a while but it be not and could not and ought not to be so he first passion have be a true and pure one there be no spot or stain upon it with all he grief there blended no cruel recollection of any word or look he would have wish to forget all those little difference such as young married people with any individual flavor in they character must have if they be tolerably mate have only add to the music of existence as the lesser discord admit into some perfect symphony fitly resolve add richness and strength to the whole harmonious movement it be a deep wound that fate have inflict on he nay it seem like a mortal one but the weapon be clean and its edge be smooth such wound must heal with time in healthy nature whatever a false sentiment may say by the wise and beneficent law of we be the recollection of a deep and true affection be rather a divine nourishment for a life to grow strong upon than a poison to destroy it dudley venner 's habitual sadness could not be lay wholly to he early bereavement it be partly the result of the long struggle between natural affection and duty on one side and the involuntary tendency these have to overcome on the other -- between hope and fear so long in conflict that despair itself would have be like a anodyne and he would have sleep upon some final catastrophe with the heavy sleep of a bankrupt after he failure be proclaimed alas some new affection might perhaps rekindle the fire of youth in he heart but what power could calm that haggard terror of the parent which rise with every morning 's sun and watch with every evening star -- what power save alone that of he who come bear the inverted torch and leave after he only the ash print with he footstep \* \* \* \* \* the election in November while all of we have be watch with that admire sympathy which never fail to wait on courage and magnanimity the career of the new timoleon in sicily -- while we have be reckon with a interest scarcely less than in some affair of personal concern the chance and change that bear with furtherance or hindrance upon the fortune of unite italy we be approach with a quietness and composure which more than anything else mark the essential difference between we own form of democracy and any other yet know in history a crisis in we domestic policy more momentous than any that have arise since we become a nation indeed consider the vital consequence for good or evil that will follow from the popular decision in November we might be tempt to regard the remarkable moderation which have thus far characterize the presidential canvass as a guilty indifference to the duty imply in the privilege of suffrage or a stolid unconsciousness of the result which may depend upon its exercise in this particular election do we not believe that it arise chiefly from the general persuasion that the success of the republican party be a foregone conclusion in a society like ours where every man may transmute he private thought into history and destiny by drop it into the ballot-box a peculiar responsibility rest upon the individual nothing can absolve we from do we best to look at all public question as citizen and therefore in some sort as administrator and ruler for though during its term of office the government be practically as independent of the popular will as that of russium yet every fourth year the people be call upon to pronounce upon the conduct of they affair theoretically at least to give democracy any standing-ground for a argument with despotism or oligarchy a majority of the man compose it should be statesman and thinker it be a proverb that to turn a radical into a conservative there need only to put he into office because then the license of speculation or sentiment be limit by a sense of responsibility -- then for the first time he become capable of that comparative view which see principle and measure not in the narrow abstract but in the full breadth of they relation to each other and to political consequence the theory of democracy presuppose something of these result of official position in the individual voter since in exercise he right he become for the moment a integral part of the govern power how very far practice be from any likeness to theory a week 's experience of we politics suffice to convince we the very government itself seem a organize scramble and congress a boy ' debating-club with the disadvantage of be report as we party-creed be commonly represent less by idea than by person -lrb- who be assume without too close a scrutiny to be the exponent of certain idea -rrb- we politics become personal and narrow to a degree never parallel unless in ancient athen or mediaeval florence we congress debate and we newspaper discuss sometimes for day after day not question of national interest not what be wise and right but what the honorable lafayette skreemer say on the stump or bad whiskey say for he half a dozen year ago if that personage outrage in all the finer sensibility of we common nature by fail to get the contract for supply the district court-house at skreemeropolisville city with revolver be lead to disparage the union of these state it be seize on as proof conclusive that the party to which he belong be so many cat_a_lines -- for congress be unanimous only in misspell the name of that oft-invoked conspirator the next presidential election loom always in advance so that we seem never to have a actual chief magistrate but a prospective one look to the chance of reëlection and mingling in all the dirty intrigue of provincial politics with a unhappy talent for make they dirtier the cheating mirage of the white house lure we public man away from present duty and obligation and if matter go on as they have go we shall need a committee of congress to count the spoon in the public plate-closet whenever a president go out of office -- with a policeman to watch every member of the committee we be keep normally in that most unprofitable of predicament a state of transition and politician measure they word and deed by a standard of immediate and temporary expediency -- a expediency not as concern the nation but which if more than merely personal be no wider than the interest of party be all this a result of the failure of democratic institution rather of the fact that those institution have never yet have a fair trial and that for the last thirty year a abnormal element have be act adversely with continually increase strength whatever be the effect of slavery upon the state where it exist there can be no doubt that its moral influence upon the north have be most disastrous it have compel we politician into that first fatal compromise with they moral instinct and hereditary principle which make all consequent one easy it have accustom we to makeshift instead of statesmanship to subterfuge instead of policy to party-platform for opinion and to a defiance of the public sentiment of the civilized world for patriotism we have be ask to admit first that it be a necessary evil then that it be a good both to master and slave then that it be the corner-stone of free institution then that it be a system divinely institute under the old law and sanction under the new with a representation three-fifths of it base on the assumption that negro be man the south turn upon we and insist on we acknowledge that they be thing after compelling she northern ally to pronounce the free and equal clause of the preamble to the declaration of independence -lrb- because it stand in the way of enslave man -rrb- a manifest absurdity she have declare through the supreme court of the united state that negro be not man in the ordinary meaning of the word to eat dirt be bad enough but to find that we have eat more than be necessary may chance to give we a indigestion the slaveholding interest have go on step by step force concession after concession till it need but little to secure it forever in the political supremacy of the country yield to its latest demand -- let it mould the evil destiny of the territory -- and the thing be do past recall the next presidential election be to say _ yes _ or _ no _ but we should not regard the mere question of political preponderancy as of vital consequence do it not involve a continually increase moral degradation on the part of the nonslaveholding state -- for free state they could not be call much longer sordid and materialistic view of the true value and object of society and government be profess more and more openly by the leader of popular outcry if it can not be call public opinion that side of human nature which it have be the object of all lawgiver and moralist to repress and subjugate be flatter and caress whatever be profitable be right and already the slave-trade as yield a greater return on the capital invest than any other traffic be laud as the highest achievement of human reason and justice mr hammond have proclaim the accession of king cotton but he seem to have forget that history be not without example of king who have lose they crown through the folly and false security of they minister it be quite true that there be a large class of reasoner who would weigh all question of right and wrong in the balance of trade but -- we can not bring ourselves to believe that it be a wise political economy which make cotton by unmake man or a far-seeing statesmanship which look on a immediate money-profit as a safe equivalent for a beggar public sentiment we think mr hammond even a little premature in proclaim the new pretender the election of November may prove a culloden whatever its result it be to settle for many year to come the question whether the american idea be to govern this continent whether the occidental or the oriental theory of society be to mould we future whether we be to recede from principle which eighteen christian century have be slowly establish at the cost of so many saintly life at the stake and so many heroic one on the scaffold and the battle-field in favor of some fancied assimilation to the household arrangement of abraham of which all that can be say with certainty be that they do not add to he domestic happiness we believe that this election be a turning-point in we history for although there be four candidate there be really as everybody know but two party and a single question that divide they the supporter of messr bell and everett have adopt as they platform the constitution the union and the enforcement of the law this may be very convenient but it be surely not very explicit the cardinal question on which the whole policy of the country be to turn -- a question too which this very election must decide in one way or the other -- be the interpretation to be put upon certain clause of the constitution all the other party equally assert they loyalty to that instrument indeed it be quite the fashion the remover of all the ancient landmark of we policy the violator of thrice-pledged faith the planner of new treachery to establish compromise all take refuge in the constitution -- like thief that in a hemp-plot lie secure against the hue and cry in the same way the first bonaparte renew he profession of faith in the revolution at every convenient opportunity and the second follow the precedent of he uncle though the uninitiated fail to see any logical sequence from 1789 to 1815 or 1860 if mr bell love the constitution mr breckinridge be equally fond that egerium of we statesman could be happy with either be t ` other dear charmer away mr dougla confide the secret of he passion to the unloquacious clam of rhode island and the chief complaint make against mr lincoln by he opponent be that he be _ too _ constitutional meanwhile the only point in which voter be interested be -- what do they mean by the constitution mr breckinridge mean the superiority of a certain exceptional species of property over all other nay over man himself mr dougla with a different formulum for express it mean practically the same thing both of they mean that labor have no rights which capital be bind to respect -- that there be no higher law than human interest and cupidity both of they represent not merely the narrow principle of a section but the still narrower and more selfish one of a caste both of they to be sure have convenient phrase to be juggle with before election and which mean one thing or another or neither one thing nor another as a particular exigency may seem to require but since both claim the regular democratic nomination we have little difficulty in divine what they course would be after the fourth of march if they should chance to be elect we know too well what regular democracy be to like either of the two face which each show by turn under the same hood everybody remember baron grimm 's story of the parisian showman who in 1789 exhibit the _ royal _ bengal tiger under the new character of _ national _ as more in harmony with the change order of thing could the animal have live till 1848 he would probably have find himself offer to the discriminate public as the _ democratic _ and _ social _ ornament of the jungle the pro-slavery party of this country seek the popular favor under even more frequent and incongruous _ alias _ it be now _ national _ now _ conservative _ now _ constitutional _ here it represent squatter-sovereignty and there the power of congress over the territory but under whatever name its nature remain unchanged and its instinct be none the less predatory and destructive mr lincoln 's position be set forth with sufficient precision in the platform adopt by the chicago convention but what be we to make of messr bell and everett heir of the stock in trade of two defunct party the whig and know-nothing do they hope to resuscitate they or be they only like the inconsolable widow of père la chaise who with a eye to former customer make use of the late andsoforth 's gravestone to advertise that they still carry on the business at the old stand mr everett in he letter accept the nomination give we only a string of reason why he should not have accept it at all and mr bell preserve a silence singularly at variance with he patronymic the only public demonstration of principle that we have see be a emblematic bell draw upon a wagon by a single horse with a man to lead he and a boy to make a nuisance of the tinkling symbol as it move along be all the figure in this melancholy procession equally emblematic if so which of the two candidate be typify in the unfortunate who lead the horse -- for we believe the only hope of the party be to get one of they elect by some hocus-pocus in the house of representative the little boy we suppose be intend to represent the party which promise to be so conveniently small that there will be a office for every member of it if its candidate should win do not the bell convey a plain allusion to the lead name on the ticket we should conceive it a excellent type of the hollowness of those fear for the safety of the union in case of mr lincoln 's election whose change be so loudly ring -- its noise have once or twice give rise to false alarm of fire till people find out what it really be whatever profound moral it be intend to convey we find in it a similitude that be not without significance as regard the profess creed of the party the industrious youth who operate upon it have evidently some notion of the measure and regular motion that befit the tongue of well-disciplined and conservative bell he do he best to make theory and practice coincide but with every jolt on the road a involuntary variation be produce and the sonorous pulsation become rapid or slow accordingly we have observe that the constitution be liable to similar derangement and we very much doubt whether mr bell himself -lrb- since after all the constitution would practically be nothing else than he interpretation of it -rrb- would keep the same measure tone that be so easy on the smooth path of candidacy when it come to conduct the car of state over some of the rough place in the highway of manifest destiny and some of those passage in we politics which after the fashion of new country be rather _ corduroy _ in character but fortunately we be not leave wholly in the dark as to the aim of the self-styled constitutional party one of its most distinguished member governor hunt of new york have give we to understand that its prime object be the defeat at all hazard of the republican candidate to achieve so desirable a end its leader be ready to coalesce here with the dougla and there with the breckinridge faction of that very democratic party of whose violation of the constitution corruption and dangerous limberness of principle they have be the lifelong denouncer in point of fact then it be perfectly plain that we have only two party in the field : those who favor the extension of slavery and those who oppose it -- in other word a destructive and a conservative party we know very well that the partisan of mr bell mr dougla and mr breckinridge all equally claim the title of conservative : and the fact be a very curious one well worthy the consideration of those foreign critic who argue that the inevitable tendency of democracy be to compel larger and larger concession to a certain assumed communistic propensity and hostility to the rights of property on the part of the work class but the truth be that revolutionary idea be promote not by any unthinking hostility to the _ rights _ of property but by a well-founded jealousy of its usurpation and it be privilege and not property that be perplex with fear of change the conservative effect of ownership operate with as much force on the man with a hundred dollar in a old stock as on he neighbor with a million in the fund during the roman revolution of '48 the beggar who have fund they gain be among the stanchest reactionary and leave rome with the nobility no question of the abstract right of property have ever enter directly into we politics or ever will -- the point at issue be whether a certain exceptional kind of property already privileged beyond all other shall be entitle to still further privilege at the expense of every other kind the extension of slavery over new territory mean just this -- that this one kind of property not recognize as such by the constitution or it would never have be allow to enter into the basis of representation shall control the foreign and domestic policy of the republic a great deal be say to be sure about the rights of the south but have any such right be infringe when a man invest money in any species of property he assume the risk to which it be liable if he buy a house it may be burn if a ship it may be wreck if a horse or a ox it may die now the disadvantage of the southern kind of property be -- how shall we say it so as not to violate we constitutional obligation -- that it be exceptional when it leave virginium it be a thing when it arrive in boston it become a man speak human language appeal to the justice of the same god whom we all acknowledge weep at the memory of wife and child leave behind -- in short have the same organ and dimension that a christian have and be not distinguishable from ordinary christian except perhaps by a simpler and more earnest faith there be people at the north who believe that beside _ meum _ and _ tuum _ there be also such a thing as _ suum _ -- who be old-fashioned enough or weak enough to have they feeling touch by these thing to think that human nature be older and more sacred than any claim of property whatever and that it have rights at least as much to be respect as any hypothetical one of we southern brethren this no doubt make it harder to recover a fugitive chattel but the existence of human nature in a man here and there be surely one of those accident to be count on at least as often as fire shipwreck or the cattle-disease and the man who choose to put he money into these image of he maker cut in ebony should be content to take the incident risk along with the advantage we should be very sorry to deem this risk capable of diminution for we think that the claim of a common manhood upon we should be at least as strong as those of freemasonry and that those whom the law of man turn away should find in the larger charity of the law of god and nature a readier welcome and surer sanctuary we shall continue to think the negro a man and on southern evidence too as long as he be count in the population represent on the floor of congress -- for three-fifth of perfect manhood would be a high average even among white man as long as he be hang or worse as a example and terror to other -- for we do not punish one animal for the moral improvement of the rest as long as he be consider capable of religious instruction -- for we fancy the gorilla would make short work with a missionary as long as there be fear of insurrection -- for we never hear of a combined effort at revolt in a menagerie accordingly we do not see how the particular right of whose infringement we hear so much be to be make safer by the election of mr bell mr breckinridge or mr dougla -- there be quite as little chance that any of they would abolish human nature as that mr lincoln would abolish slavery the same generous instinct that lead some among we to sympathize with the sorrow of the bereaved master will always we fear influence other to take part with the rescue man but if we constitutional obligation as we like to call we constitutional timidity or indifference teach we that a particular divinity hedge the domestic institution they do not require we to forget that we have institution of we own worth maintain and extend and not without a certain sacredness whether we regard the tradition of the father or the faith of the child it be high time that we should hear something of the rights of the free state and of the duty consequent upon they we also have we prejudice to be respect we theory of civilization of what constitute the safety of a state and insure its prosperity to be apply wherever there be soil enough for a human be to stand on and thank god for make he a man be conservatism applicable only to property and not to justice freedom and public honor do it mean merely drift with the current of evil time and pernicious counsel and carefully nurse the ill we have that they may as they nature it be grow worse to be tell that we ought not to agitate the question of slavery when it be that which be forever agitate we be like tell a man with the fever and ague on he to stop shake and he will be cure the discussion of slavery be say to be dangerous but dangerous to what the manufacturer of the free state constitute a more numerous class than the slaveholder of the south : suppose they should claim a equal sanctity for the protective system discussion be the very life of free institution the fruitful mother of all political and moral enlightenment and yet the question of all question must be taboo the swiss guide enjoin silence in the region of avalanche lest the mere vibration of the voice should dislodge the ruin clinging by frail root of snow but where be we avalanche to fall it be to overwhelm the union we be tell the real danger to the union will come when the encroachment of the slave-power and the concession of the trade-power shall have make it a burden instead of a blessing the real avalanche to be dread be we to expect it from the ever-gathering mass of ignorant brute force with the irresponsibility of animal and the passion of man which be one of the fatal necessity of slavery or from the gradually increase consciousness of the non-slaveholding population of the slave state of the true cause of they material impoverishment and political inferiority from one or the other source its ruinous force will be feed but in either event it be not the union that will be imperil but the privileged order who on every occasion of a thwart whim have menace its disruption and who will then find in it they only safety we believe that the irrepressible conflict -- for we accept mr seward 's much-denounced phrase in all the breadth of mean he ever mean to give it -- be to take place in the south itself because the slave-system be one of those fearful blunder in political economy which be sure sooner or later to work they own retribution the inevitable tendency of slavery be to concentrate in a few hand the soil the capital and the power of the country where it exist to reduce the non-slaveholding class to a continually lower and lower level of property intelligence and enterprise -- they increase in number add much to the economical hardship of they position and nothing to they political weight in the community there be no home-encouragement of varied agriculture -- for the want of a slave population be few in number and limit in kind none of inland trade for that be develop only by community where education induce refinement where facility of communication stimulate invention and variety of enterprise where newspaper make every man 's improvement in tool machinery or culture of the soil a incitement to all and bring all the thinker of the world to teach in the cheap university of the people we do not of course mean to say that slaveholding state may not and do not produce fine man but they fail by the inherent vice of they constitution and its attendant consequence to create enlighten powerful and advance community of man which be the true object of all political organization and which be essential to the prolonged existence of all those whose life and spirit be derive directly from the people every man who have dispassionately endeavor to enlighten himself in the matter can not but see that for the many the course of thing in slaveholding state be substantially what we have describe a downward one more or less rapid in civilization and in all those result of material prosperity which in a free country show themselves in the general advancement for the good of all and give a real meaning to the word commonwealth no matter how enormous the wealth centre in the hand of a few it have no longer the conservative force or the beneficent influence which it exert when equably distribute -- even lose more of both where a system of absenteeism prevail so largely as in the south in such community the seed of a irrepressible conflict be purely if slowly ripen and sign be daily multiply that the true peril to they social organization be look for less in a revolt of the own labor than in a insurrection of intelligence in the labor that own itself and find itself none the richer for it to multiply such community be to multiply weakness the election in November turn on the single and simple question whether we shall consent to the indefinite multiplication of they and the only party which stand plainly and unequivocally pledge against such a policy nay which be not either openly or impliedly in favor of it be the republican party we be of those who at first regret that another candidate be not nominate at chicago but we confess that we have cease to regret it for the magnanimity of mr seward since the result of the convention be know have be a greater ornament to he and a greater honor to he party than he election to the presidency would have be we should have be please with mr seward 's nomination for the very reason we have see assign for pass he by -- that he represent the most advanced doctrine of he party he more than any other man combine in himself the moralist 's oppugnancy to slavery as a fact the thinker 's resentment of it as a theory and the statist 's distrust of it as a policy -- thus sum up the three efficient cause that have chiefly arouse and concentrate the antagonism of the free state not a brilliant man he have that best gift of nature which brilliant man commonly lack of be always able to do he best and the very misrepresentation of he opinion which be resort to in order to neutralize the effect of he speech in the senate and elsewhere be the best testimony to they power safe from the prevail epidemic of congressional eloquence as if he have be inoculate for it early in he career he address himself to the reason and what he say stick it be assume that he nomination would have embittered the contest and taint the republican creed with radicalism but we doubt it we can not think that a party gain by not hit its hardest or by sugare its opinion republicanism be not a conspiracy to obtain office under false pretence it have a definite aim a earnest purpose and the unflinching tenacity of profound conviction it be not call into be by a desire to reform the pecuniary corruption of the party now in power mr bell or mr breckinridge would do that for no one doubt they honor or they honesty it be not unanimous about the tariff about state-rights about many other question of policy what unite the republican be a common faith in the early principle and practice of the republic a common persuasion that slavery as it can not but be the natural foe of the one have be the chief debaser of the other and a common resolve to resist its encroachment everywhen and everywhere they see no reason to fear that the constitution which have show such pliant tenacity under the warp and twisting of a forty-year ' proslavery pressure should be in danger of break if bent backward again gently to its original rectitude of fiber all form of human government say machiavellus have like man they natural term and those only be long-lived which possess in themselves the power of return to the principle on which they be originally found it be in a moral aversion to slavery as a great wrong that the chief strength of the republican party lie they believe as everybody believe sixty year ago and we be sorry to see what appear to be a inclination in some quarter to blink this aspect of the case lest the party be charge with want of conservatism or what be worse with abolitionism it be and will be charge with all kind of dreadful thing whatever it do and it have nothing to fear from a upright and downright declaration of its faith one part of the grateful work it have to do be to deliver we from the curse of perpetual concession for the sake of a peace that never come and which if it come would not be peace but submission -- from that torpor and imbecility of faith in god and man which have steal the respectable name of conservatism a question which cut so deep as the one which now divide the country can not be debate much less settle without excitement such excitement be healthy and be a sign that the ill humor of the body politic be come to the surface where they be comparatively harmless it be the tendency of all creed opinion and political dogma that have once define themselves in institution to become inoperative the vital and formative principle which be active during the process of crystallization into sect or school of thought or government cease to act and what be once a living emanation of the eternal mind organically operative in history become the dead formulum on man 's lip and the dry topic of the annalist it have be we good fortune that a question have be thrust upon we which have force we to reconsider the primal principle of government which have appeal to conscience as well as reason and by bring the theory of the declaration of independence to the test of experience in we thought and life and action have realize a tradition of the memory into a conviction of the understanding and the soul it will not do for the republican to confine themselves to the mere political argument for the matter then become one of expediency with two defensible side to it they must go deeper to the radical question of right and wrong or they surrender the chief advantage of they position what spinoza say of law be equally true of party-platform -- that those be strong which appeal to reason but those be impregnable which compel the assent both of reason and the common affection of mankind no man pretend that under the constitution there be any possibility of interference with the domestic relation of the individual state no party have ever remotely hint at any such interference but what the republican affirm be that in every contingency where the constitution can be construe in favor of freedom it ought to be and shall be so construe it be idle to talk of sectionalism abolitionism and hostility to the law the principle of liberty and humanity can not by virtue of they very nature be sectional any more than light and heat prevention be not abolition and unjust law be the only serious enemy that law ever have with history before we it be no treason to question the infallibility of a court for court be never wiser or more venerable than the man compose they and a decision that reverse precedent can not arrogate to itself any immunity from reversal truth be the only unrepealable thing we be gravely request to have no opinion or have one to suppress it on the one topic that have occupy caucus newspaper president ' message and congress for the last dozen year lest we endanger the safety of the union the true danger to popular form of government begin when public opinion cease because the people be incompetent or unwilling to think in a democracy it be the duty of every citizen to think but unless the think result in a definite opinion and the opinion lead to considerate action they be nothing if the people be assume to be incapable of form a judgment for themselves the man whose position enable they to guide the public mind ought certainly to make good they want of intelligence but on this great question the wise solution of which we be every day assure be essential to the permanence of the union mr bell have no opinion at all mr dougla say it be of no consequence which opinion prevail and mr breckinridge tell we vaguely that all section have a equal right in the common territory the party which support these candidate however all agree in affirm that the election of its special favorite be the one thing that can give back peace to the distract country the distract country will continue to take care of itself as it have do hitherto and the only question that need a answer be what policy will secure the most prosperous future to the helpless territory which we decision be to make or mar for all come time what will save the country from a senate and supreme court where freedom shall be forever at a disadvantage there be always a fallacy in the argument of the opponent of the republican party they affirm that all the state and all the citizen of the state ought to have equal rights in the territory undoubtedly but the difficulty be that they can not the slaveholder move into a new territory with he _ institution _ and from that moment the free white settler be virtually exclude _ he _ institution he can not take with he they refuse to root themselves in soil that be cultivate by slave-labor speech be no longer free the post-office be austrianize the mere fact of northern birth may be enough to hang he even now in texa settler from the free state be be drive out and murder for pretended complicity in a plot the evidence for the existence of which have be obtain by means without a parallel since the trial of the salem witch and the story about which be as absurd and contradictory as the confession of goodwife corey kansa be save it be true but it be the experience of kansa that disgust the south with mr dougla 's panacea of squatter sovereignty the claim of _ equal _ rights in the territory be a specious fallacy concede the demand of the slavery-extensionist and you give up every inch of territory to slavery to the absolute exclusion of freedom for what they ask -lrb- however they may disguise it -rrb- be simply this -- that they _ local law _ be make the law of the land and coextensive with the limit of the general government the constitution acknowledge no unqualified or interminable right of property in the labor of another and the plausible assertion that that be property which the law make property -lrb- confound a law exist anywhere with the law which be bind everywhere -rrb- can deceive only those who have either never read the constitution or be ignorant of the opinion and intention of those who frame it it be true only of the state where slavery already exist and it be because the propagandist of slavery be well aware of this that they be so anxious to establish by positive enactment the seemingly moderate title to a right of existence for they institution in the territory -- a title which they do not possess and the possession of which would give they the oyster and the free state the shell law accordingly be ask for to protect southern property in the territory -- that be to protect the inhabitant from decide for themselves what they frame of government shall be such law will be pass and the fairest portion of we national domain irrevocably close to free labor if the non-slave-holding state fail to do they duty in the present crisis but will the election of mr lincoln endanger the union it be not a little remarkable that as the prospect of he success increase the menace of secession grow fainter and less frequent mr wl yancey to be sure threaten to secede but the country can get along without he and we wish he a prosperous career in foreign part but governor wise no longer propose to seize the treasury at washington -- perhaps because mr buchanan have leave so little in it the old mumbo-jumbo be occasionally parade at the north but however many old woman may be frighten the pulse of the stock-market remain provokingly calm general cushing infringe the patent-right of the late mr jame the novelist have see a solitary horseman on the edge of the horizon the exegesis of the vision have be various some thinking that it mean a military despot -- though in that case the force of cavalry would seem to be inadequate -- and other the pony express if it have be one rider on two horse the application would have be more general and less obscure in fact the old cry of disunion have lose its terror if it ever have any at the north the south itself seem to have become alarm at its own scarecrow and speaker there be begin to assure they hearer that the election of mr lincoln will do they no harm we entirely agree with they for it will save they from themselves to believe any organized attempt by the republican party to disturb the exist internal policy of the southern state possible presuppose a manifest absurdity before anything of the kind could take place the country must be in a state of forcible revolution but there be no premonitory symptom of any such convulsion unless we except mr yancey and that gentleman 's throw a solitary somerset will hardly turn the continent head over heel the administration of mr lincoln will be conservative because no government be ever intentionally otherwise and because power never knowingly undermine the foundation on which it rest all that the free state demand be that influence in the council of the nation to which they be justly entitle by they population wealth and intelligence that these element of prosperity have increase more rapidly among they than in community otherwise organize with greater advantage of soil climate and mineral production be certainly no argument that they be incapable of the duty of efficient and prudent administration however strong a one it may be for they endeavor to secure for the territory the single superiority that have make they what they be the object of the republican party be not the abolition of african slavery but the utter extirpation of dogma which be the logical sequence of the attempt to establish its righteousness and wisdom and which would serve equally well to justify the enslavement of every white man unable to protect himself they believe that slavery be a wrong morally a mistake politically and a misfortune practically wherever it exist that it have nullify we influence abroad and force we to compromise with we better instinct at home that it have pervert we government from its legitimate object weaken the respect for the law by make they the tool of its purpose and sap the faith of man in any higher political morality than interest or any better statesmanship than chicane they mean in every lawful way to hem it within its present limit we be persuade that the election of mr lincoln will do more than anything else to appease the excitement of the country he have prove both he ability and he integrity he have have experience enough in public affair to make he a statesman and not enough to make he a politician that he have not have more will be no objection to he in the eye of those who have see the administration of the experienced public functionary whose term of office be just draw to a close he represent a party who know that true policy be gradual in its advance that it be conditional and not absolute that it must deal with fact and not with sentiment but who know also that it be wiser to stamp out evil in the spark than to wait till there be no help but in fight fire with fire they be the only conservative party because they be the only one base on a enduring principle the only one that be not willing to pawn tomorrow for the means to gamble with today they have no hostility to the south but a determine one to doctrine of whose ruinous tendency every day more and more convince they the encroachment of slavery upon we national policy have be like those of a glacier in a swiss valley inch by inch the huge dragon with he glitter scale and crest of ice coil itself onward a anachronism of summer the relic of a bygone world where such monster swarm but it have its limit the kindlier force of nature work against it and the silent arrow of the sun be still as of old fatal to the frosty python geology tell we that such enormous devastator once cover the face of the earth but the benignant sunlight of heaven touch they and they fade silently leave no trace but here and there the scratch of they talon and the gnawed boulder scatter where they make they lair we have entire faith in the benignant influence of truth the sunlight of the moral world and believe that slavery like other worn-out system will melt gradually before it all the earth cry out upon truth and the heaven blesseth it ill work shake and tremble at it and with it be no unrighteous thing \* \* \* \* \* review and literary notice _ history of flemish literature _ by octave delepierre ll d 8vo london john murray 1860 when i write in danish say oehlenschläger i write for only six hundred person and so in view of this somewhat exaggerated statement he himself translate he best work into the more favored and more widely spread germanic idiom it require a certain amount of courage in a author to write in he own native tongue only when he know that he thereby limit the number of he reader we see in we own day among the sclavonic race man whose writings breathe the most ardent patriotism whose labor and research be all concentrated within the sphere of they nationality publishing not in they own polish czechish or serbian but in german or french the history of language show we a two-fold tendency -- one of divergence from some common stem follow by one of concentration of unity in the literature thus in france the _ langue d'oïl _ supersede the richer and more melodious provençal in spain the castilian predominate while for several century it have be the steady tendency of the high-german to become the language of letter and of the upper class among the various teutonic race since the bible-translation of luther this central dialect have not only become the medium in which poet and philosopher historian and critic address the nation but it may be say to have entirely supersede the northern and southern form whatever local or linguistic interest may be manifest for the work of groth in the ditmarsch _ platt-deutsch _ or for the sweet alemannic song of hebel the centralize tongue be that in which schiller and goethe write the ally danish and dutch have escape this ingulfing process the former instead of retreat seek in the present to enlarge its circuit and great be the complaint in schleswig-holstein of the arbitrary and despotic imposition of danish on a state of the german confederation the present government of holland have not remain inactive much have be do to encourage man of letter and counteract the gallic influence which prevail in the early part of the century but the fleming speak nearly the same language as they protestant neighbor where be they literature now the language itself in which be hand down to we some of the masterpiece of the middle age as reynard the fox and gudrun be disregard even discountenance by government it be with a feeling of sadness that we read the annals of a literature which meet so many obstacle to its progress despise by foreign ruler thrust back by the spanish policy of the duke of alva its author exile and seek refuge in other land its very existence have be a constant battle against the inroad of more powerful neighbor surely if word be make of breath and breath of life there be nothing a nation can hold more dear than its own tongue its law its ruler may change its privilege and charter be wrench from it but that remain as a heirloom the first gift to the child the last and dearest treasure of the man perhaps nowhere more than in flander do we meet with a systematic oppression of a vernacular idiom from the day of the contest with france through the long spanish trouble and dominion the military occupation of the country by the troops of loui xiv the austrian rule the levelling tendency of the french revolution and the present aping of french manners by the higher power of the land -- through all this there have be but one long continuous struggle and the ultimate result be now too plain we find the flemish speak by nearly two-third of the inhabitant of belgium divide from the walloon or _ rouchi-fran ai _ by a line of demarcation run from the meuse through liege and waterloo and end in france between calai and dunkirk it differ in no material point from the dutch be essentially the same if we except slight difference in spelling as _ ae _ for _ aa _ _ ue _ for _ uu _ _ y _ for _ ij _ both should bear but one common name the netherlandish that difference should be seek can be account for only by the petty feeling of jealousy that exist between the neighboring state they literary production vary in grammatical construction scarcely more than the writings of english and american author mr octave delepierre who since 1830 have publish some ten or twelve monograph relate to the antiquity and history of flander have present the english public during the course of the present year with a history of flemish literature with a evident predilection for author south of the meuse mr delepierre have nevertheless give we the first clear and connected account we possess of the history of letter in the netherland without careful or minute critical research he have show little that be new nor have he seek to clear one point that be obscure he work be pleasant reading intersperse with occasional translation though scarcely answer the requisite of literary history in the nineteenth century have follow the older work of snellaert -lrb- _ histoire de la littérature flamande _ bruxelle 1654 -rrb- in the latter half of the volume page for page he have not even mention by name the author of the last quarter of a century let we glance at that portion of literature more particularly belong to flander and brabant the first expression of the germanic mind the song of hildebrand gudrun the nibelungen have be hand down to we in a form which show they origin to have be netherlandish the first part of gudrun be evidently so and we find as well in many of the older poem of chivalry as charle and elegast flori and blanchefloer as in the national epo intrinsic proof that the unknown author be from the region of the lower rhine these elder remnant however can scarcely be claim by any one of the teutonic race as they be the common property of all for we find the hero siegfry in the scandinavian saga as well as in the more southern tradition mr delepierre have translate the follow song almost homeric in its form which belong to this early period when christianity have not obliterate the memory of barbarous day : -- the lord halewyn know a song : all those who hear it be attract towards he it be once hear by the daughter of the king who be so beloved by she parent she stand before she father : ' o father may i go to the lord halewyn ' ` oh no my child no they who go to he never come back again ' she stand before she mother : ' o mother may i go to the lord halewyn ' ` oh no my child no they who go to he never come back again ' she stand before she sister : ' o sister may i go to the lord halewyn ' ` oh no sister no they who go to he never come back again ' she stand before she brother : ' o brother may i go to the lord halewyn ' ` little care i where thou goest provide thou preservest thine honor and thy crown she go up into she chamber she clothes herself in she best garment what do she put on first a shift finer than silk what do she gird round she lovely waist strong band of gold what do she put upon she scarlet petticoat on every seam a golden button what do she set on she beautiful fair hair a massive golden crown what do she put upon she kirtle on every seam a pearl she go into she father 's stable and take out he best charger she mount he proudly and so laughing and singing ride through the forest when she reach the middle of the forest she meet the lord halewyn ` hail ' say he approach she ` hail beautiful virgin with eye so black and brilliant ' they proceed together chat as they go they arrive at a field in which stand a gallows the body of several woman hang from it the lord halewyn say to she : ` as you be the loveliest of all virgin say how will you die the time be come ' ` it be well : as i may choose i choose the sword ` but first of all take off you tunic for the blood of a virgin gush out so far that it might reach you and i should be sorry ' but before he have divest himself of he tunic he head roll off and lay at he foot : he lip still murmur these word : ` go down there into that corn-field and blow the horn so that my friend may hear it ' ` into that corn-field i shall not go neither shall i blow the horn i do not follow the counsel of a murderer ' ` go then down under the gallows and gather the balm which you shall find there and spread it over my bloody throat ' ` under the gallows i shall not go on you bloody throat i shall spread no balm i do not follow the counsel of a murderer ' she take up the head by the hair and wash it at a clear fountain she mount she charger proudly and laugh and sing she ride through the forest when she reach the middle of the forest she meet the mother of halewyn ` beautiful virgin have you not see my son ' ` you son the lord halewyn be go hunting : you will never see he again ` you son the lord halewyn be dead i have he head in my apron which be red with he blood ' and when she arrive at she father 's gate she blow the horn like a man and when she father see she he rejoice at she return he celebrate it by a feast and the head of halewyn be place on the table flemish writer claim as entirely they own that epic of the people reynard the fox they right to it be long contest nor have anything be do since the labor of willem who in opposition to the opinion of william grimm settle the authorship of the reinaert de vos on utenhove a priest of aerdenburg it seem natural to suppose that this most popular of middle-age production should have originate in the very region which later give to the world a school of painting that incarnate on canvas the phase of animal life take its delight and best inspiration in the burlesque side of human passion in its first period flemish literature find some encouragement from its prince john i of brabant foster it and even take himself the title of flemish troubadour under guy of dampierre who neither in heart nor mind be sympathetic with the people he rule we find maerlant still revere by he country he name be ever couple with the epithet of father of flemish poet didactic rather than poetical he influence be great in break down the barrier which separate the people from the higher class by adapt to they own home-idiom the best production of the age about this period we find prevalent those northern singer correspond to the _ trouvères _ _ troubadour _ and _ jongleur _ they be in flander the _ spreker _ _ segger _ and _ vinder _ who when travel through the country take the name of _ gezel _ receive in town or village court or hamlet as the wander minstrel of the south the golden age when sovereign doff they royal robe to lay they on the shoulder of some sweet-singing poet as the old chronicle tell we be of short duration in the north if ever the _ sproken _ or erotic poem may be say to have bring they author into such favor on the other hand we find some of the wanderer arrest for theft and other crime little light have be throw on they first ante-historical attempt until the late labor of german philologer little have be do to clear up the confusion rest on this period of literary history as yet the field have scarcely be explore beyond the region not immediately connect with the literature of germany we have long historical poem of little interest arrange without order -- interminable production of thousand and ten thousand of line of uncertain date didactic and encyclopedia-like besides unmistakable remnant of a netherlandish theater the battle of roosebeke where the second artevelde and he companion succumb to superior number be the last great enterprise of the fleming against the french half a century earlier a strong league have be form against these powerful neighbor in the interior the country be divide into faction -- the partisan and enemy of france prominent be the _ clauwaert _ and the _ leliart _ from the lion 's claw and the _ fleur-de-lis _ which they respectively wear on they badge the country which have ever be one of the battle-field of europe be abandon to all the horror of civil war the duke of brabant be childless the count of flander give he daughter he only legitimate child in marriage to the duke of burgundy and the province soon come into the hand of those ambitious and restless enemy of the court of france it may easily be imagine that these event be not without they influence on a language deteriorate on the one hand by constant contact with a romanic idiom and in holland by the transmission of the sovereign crown to the house of avesne the chamber of rhetoric a institution peculiar to the low country reach they highest point of prosperity under the burgundian rule the wander life of poet and author have nearly cease the _ gezellen _ settle in town and move by the prevalent spirit which prompt man of one call to unite into body naturally fall into corporation analogous to the guild without attach any very definite or clear idea to the term rhetoric which they employ these association exert great influence upon the whole literature of the netherland many would date they origin as far back as the early part of the twelfth century in alost the catherinist claim to have exist as early as 1107 on the mere strength of they motto amor vincit at any rate we be leave entirely to conjecture with regard to the first beginning of these literary guild which seem in many respects a imitation of the poetical society of provence every poet of note be a participant in they in flander there be scarcely a town or village that do not possess its chamber brabant holland zealand soon follow in the movement one of the principal the fountain of ghent seem to have exercise a certain supremacy over the other confraternity of art the proceedings of these company protect at first by prince be carry on with great magnificence they be in constant communication with each other throughout the country they _ facteur _ or poet compose song and theatrical piece which be perform by the member they have a long array of officer with princely name and none be complete without a jester they larger assembly be accompany with long festivity the solemn entry into a town or village be style _ landjuweel _ -lrb- landjewel -rrb- the nobility mingle in they incite by the example of henry iv of brabant or philippe-le-bel the wealth of the netherland be display on these solemnity and the citizen rival they monarch in magnificence the burgher of ghent and bruge and antwerp shone on these occasion in the gaudy pomp of princely patrician all be invite to take part and dispute the prize award by fair hand it can scarcely be expect that these guild compose in many case of mechanic should give rise to work of the highest order of merit they dramatic representation be rather gorgeous than tasteful they attempt at wit little better than buffoonery they humor mere personal vituperation yet even in matter of taste they be not much inferior to the then more pretentious academy of other land it be a age of long religious drama of tortured rhyme and impossible metre when strange and new versification import from france find favor among a people whose silk and linen and rich tapestry be destine to reach a wider circulation than all the poetical effusion of they guild the lily the violet and the jesus with the balsam flower it be philip the fair who wish to centralize the scattered effort of these society establish at maline in 1493 a sovereign chamber of which he appoint he chaplain pierre aelter _ sovereign prince _ with a admixture of religion in accordance with the spirit of the middle age the sacred number be fifteen there be fifteen member fifteen young girl be to form part of it in honor of the fifteen joy of mary fifteen youth be instruct in the art of rhetoric and the assembly be hold fifteen time a year charle v be the last chief of this assembly which have previously be remove to ghent in 1577 it greet the arrival of the prince of orange but this be its last sign of vitality the chamber of rhetoric reach they climax in a time of fermentation the impatience the feeling of uneasiness and restraint be feel in the drama of these day which be wholly under the control of the chamber the stage that mirror of the time be often the first manifestation of the unquiet heaving and subsequent up-bubbling in the fluid compost of the mass that constitute a nation when freely develop it be the pulse-beat of the people and so throughout the netherland at the end of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth we find the allegorical drama give way to more definite and direct personation those cold representation of vice and virtue of vice in its nakedness such as to render the reading when not absolutely tedious distasteful to say the least to we modern idea -- all such aimless production be give way to the conscious expression of satire diatribe against prevalent abuse personal invective scarcely veil be fast become the order of the day it be no wonder then that the guild which have find favor formerly should gradually be crush in proportion as the ruler seek to check the spirit of reform among the author of this period may be mention everaert and machet the _ refrain _ be much cultivate and not like the drama for the expression of dissatisfaction anna byn a oracle with the catholic party write when the language be in its most degenerate state under margaret of austrium she

formation and motion cool as the subject may seem in itself have demonstrate the existence of a great deal of latent heat among scientific man in england the so-called _ viscous _ theory of professor jd forbe hold for a long while undisputed possession of the field accord to he a glacier be a imperfect fluid or viscous body which be urge down slope of a certain inclination by the mutual pressure of its part with that impartial superciliousness to all foreign achievement which not seldom characterize the british mind the credit of all the result of observation and experiment on the glacier be attribute to professor forbe who seem to have accept it with delightful complacency but presently doubt then unbelief and at last downright opposition begin to show themselves the leader of the revolt be professor tyndall whose book be now before we the controversy have beget no little bitterness of feeling but none be show in mr tyndall 's volume which be throughout write in the truest spirit of science -- with the earnest frankness that become a seeker of truth and the dignity that befit a lover of it not content with any theoretic antagonism to the forbe explanation of the phenomenon mr tyndall devote all the leisure of several year to a examination of they on the spot at the risk of he life he verify the previous observation of other and make new one himself at home he make experiment upon the nature of ice especially upon its capacity for regulation and the effect of pressure upon it he satisfy himself that snow may be change to ice by pressure that crumble ice may in like manner be restore to its original condition and that solid ice may be force to take any form desire under proper condition lamination may be produce by the same mean the result of he investigation be that the glacier be a solid body and that _ pressure _ answer all the requirement of the glacier-problem and be the only thing that will the book be one of uncommon interest and discuss many topic beside the glacier though nothing that be not in some way related to they mr tyndall do justice to former investigator -- especially to m rendu who though imperfectly supply with demonstrate fact theorize the phenomenon with the happiest inspiration -- and to agassiz of whose important observation establish for the first time the fact of more rapid motion in the middle of the glacier professor forbe have appropriate the credit the style be remarkably agreeable in description vivid and in its scientific part clear indeed we do not know whether we have enjoy the narrative or the science the most professor tyndall have the uncommon gift of be able to write science so that the unscientific can understand it without descend to the low level of science make easy the royal

collection it seem a odd turn in the kaleidoscope of fortune that associate a prime minister of the sandwich island -- where the only pictorial art be a kind of illumination laboriously execute by the native on each other 's skin thus form a free peripatetic gallery -- with a collection of picture by early italian master it be certainly a striking illustration of american multifariousness from the dawn civilization of hawaius mr jarve withdraw to italy where culture have pass far beyond its noon and find himself equally at home in both from italy he have return to america with by far the most important contribution to historical art that have ever reach we it be not easy to overestimate its value whether intrinsically or as a aid to intelligent and refining study we can hardly expect it be true ever to form such collection of art in this country as would save we student the necessity of visit europe this indeed would be hardly desirable since a great deal of the refining and enlighten influence of foreign travel and observation be not receive directly from the special object that may have draw we abroad but incidentally and unexpectedly by be bring into contact with strange system of government and new form of thought but what we might have be such a collection as would enable those of we who can not travel to enjoy some of the highest aesthetic advantage of travel and would send we student to the gallery of the old world already in a condition to appreciate and profit by they mr jarve 's picture afford the opportunity for a excellent beginning in such a undertaking mr jarve 's object have be to form a gallery that should exhibit the origin progress and culmination of italian art from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century in such chronological order as should show the sequence and affiliation of the various school and the various motive and inspiration that be operative in they to quote he own language mr jarve begin he undertaking with no expectation of acquire masterpiece or many if any of those specimen upon which the reputation of the great master be base these be in the main either fixture in they native locality or permanently absorb into the great gallery of europe and america may scarcely hope ever to possess such he do propose however to get together a collection which should _ fairly _ represent the varied quality of the master themselves and the phase of inspiration religious aesthetic or naturalistic by which they be actuate and he claim now to have succeed in this to a extent which in the outset he do not dare to hope and to have secure for the collection the approve verdict of european taste and connoisseurship in the recognition of it as a _ valuable historical gallery of original painting of the epoch and school they claim to represent _ in put forward this claim he do it in full view of the character of the criticism and doubt such a assumption naturally beget the public be right in doubt and they should not be convince except upon sound evidence therefore while he unhesitatingly claim for the collection the foregoing character he expect and invite from the public the fullest measure of impartial and intelligent criticism the object of the collection be a nucleus for a american gallery to be establish in the most fitting place and upon a broad basis sufficient to gratify and improve every variety of taste and to advance the aesthetic culture of the people with this aim he have decline repeat overture pecuniarily advantageous to divert it in whole or part to other purpose and in bring it to america at he own risk and expense it be solely to test the disposition of the public to second such a project if it meet they approbation the means best adapt for the purpose be to be maturely consider but if otherwise it be he intention to return the gallery to europe it be a simple question whether after have have the opportunity of become acquaint with the collection and he object in make it the american public will sustain perfect this humble beginning of a public gallery of art or abandon the formation of one to future chance when the difficulty will be much greater and the opportunity for success much fewer it must be consider that at this moment while genuine work of art be grow more and more difficult to be procure the rivalry of public and private collector be rapidly increase it be true that the exist great gallery come into the market only for picture specially want to fill some important gap in they series for which they pay price that would startle we public economist america will have to undergo the competition even if she now enter this field of several important foreign gallery in the process of formation among which be those of manchester with a subscribe capital _ as a begin _ of # 100000 of the association of st petersburg for the same purpose under the patronage of the imperial family and of one even in australium mr jarve 's collection be not confine by any means to what may be call the _ curiosity _ of art it contain one hundred and twenty-five picture and rich as it be in work that mark the successive stage of development in italian painting it possess also specimen of its later and most perfect production example of the pure byzantine bring we to those of the greco-italian school and these to the early italian represent -lrb- in its umbrian branch -rrb- by cimabue by giotto and he follower the gaddus cavallini giottino orgagna and other while of the sienese we have duccio simone di martino and lorenzettus with more

may be trace in paolo uccello dello dellus piero di cosimo pinturicchio the pollajuolus and luca signorellus here also be gentile da fabriano venice give we g bellinus m basaitus giorgione and paul veronese and of the later sienese there be sodoma matteo da siena and beccafumus the list include also domenichino sebastian del piombo guido salvator rosa holbein ruben and lo spagna the name we have cite will be enough to show those familiar with the subject the scope of the collection and its value as a consecutive series embrace a period which few gallery in any country cover so completely since few have be gather on any historical plan the chief question of course be as to the authenticity of the picture this can not be decide till they be exhibit and mr jarve 's proof be before the public it be mainly to be decide on internal evidence and it be on such evidence that a great part of the very early picture in foreign collection have be label with the name of particular artist the weight of such evidence be to be determine by the judgment of expert and we be inform that mr jarve have a mass of testimony from those best qualify to decide in such case -- among it that of sir charle eastlake m rio and the director of the two great public gallery of florence after all however this appear to we a matter of secondary consequence if the picture be genuine production of the period they be intend to illustrate if they be good specimen of they several school of art the special name of the artist who may have paint they be a matter of less concern the money-value of the collection might be lessen without affect its worth in other more considerable respects as a illustration of the rise and progress of the most important school of modern art every year it become more difficult to obtain picture of the class of which mr jarve 's collection be mainly compose the director of european gallery have become alive to they value and be spare no effort to fill the _ lacuna _ leave by the more strictly _ virtuoso _ taste of a former generation as far as the general public be concerned such picture must no doubt create the taste by which they will be appreciate the style of the more archaic one among they may be easily ridicule and the cry of pre-raphaelitism may be turn against they but we should not forget that these earlier effort however they might fail in grace of treatment and ease of expression be sincere and genuine product of they time and very different in spirit and character from the production of the modern school which aim to reproduce a phase of art when the thought and faith that animated it be go past recall mr jarve be desirous that the gallery should remain in he native city of boston and to that end be willing to part with it on very generous term we can not but hope that there will be taste and public spirit enough to realize he design by the side of the museum of natural history under the charge of agassiz we should like to see one of art that would supply another great want in we culture the jarve collection give the opportunity for a most successful beginning and we trust it will not be allow to follow the ninevite marble
