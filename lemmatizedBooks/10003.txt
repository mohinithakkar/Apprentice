bersier one of the ablest and most eloquent pastor of the protestant church we have just establish ourselves in pari after have live seven year in rome we have a vague idea of go back to america and pari seem a first step in that direction -- be nearer new york than rome i know very little of france -- we have never live there -- merely stay a few week in the spring and autumn come and go from italy my husband be a deputy name to the national assembly in bordeaux in 1871 by he department -- the aisne he have some difficulty in get to bordeaux communication and transport be not easy as the german be still in the country and what be more important he have not any money -- could not correspond with he banker in paris -- -lrb- he be live in the country -rrb- however a sufficient amount be find in the country and he be able to make he journey when i marry the assembly be sit at versaille monsieur thier the first president of the republic have be overthrow in may 1873 -- marshal macmahon name in he place w -lrb- 1 -rrb- have have a short ministry -lrb- public instruction -rrb- under monsieur thier but he be so convinced that it would not last that he never even go to the ministry -- see he director in he own room i be plunge at once into absolutely new surroundings w 's personal friend be principally orleanist and the literary element of paris -- he colleague at the institute the first house i be take to in pari be the ségurs remusat lasteyry casimir périers galliera d'haussonville léon say and some of the protestant family -- pourtalès andré bartholdi mallet etc it be such a entirely different world from any i have be accustom to that it take I some time to feel at home in my new milieu political feeling be very strong -- all sort of fresh young element come to the front the franco-german war be just over -- the french very sore and bitter after they defeat there be a strong underlie feeling of violent animosity to the emperor who have lose they two of they fairest province and a passionate desire for the revanche the feeling be very bitter between the two branch of the royalist party legitimist and orleanist one night at a party in the faubourg st germain i see a well-known fashionable woman of the extreme legitimist party turn she back on the comtesse de paris the reception and visit be not always easy nor pleasant even though i be a stranger and have no tie with any former government i remember one of my first visit to a well-known legitimist countess in the faubourg st germain i go on she reception day a thing all young woman be most particular about in paris i find she with a circle of lady sit around she none of whom i know they be all very civil only i be astonish at the way the mistress of the house mention my name every time she speak to I : madame waddington êtes-vous allée à l'opéra hier soir madame waddington vous montez à cheval tous les matins je crois monsieur waddington va tous les vendredis à l'institut il I semble etc i be rather surprised and say to w when i get home how curious it be that way of say one 's name all the time i suppose it be a old-fashioned french custom madame de b must have say ` waddington ' twenty time during my rather short visit he be much amuse do not you know why so that all the people might know who you be and not say awful thing about the ` infecte gouvernement ' and the republic ` which no gentleman could serve ' -lrb- footnote 1 : w here and throughout this book refer to madame waddington 's husband m william waddington -rrb- -lrb- illustration : monsieur theirs -rrb- the position of the german embassy in pari be very difficult and unfortunately they first ambassador after the war count arnim do not understand -lrb- perhaps do not care to -rrb- how difficult it be for a high-spirited nation which until then have always rank as a great military power to accept she humiliation and be just to the victorious adversary arnim be a unfortunate appointment -- not at all the man for such a delicate situation we have know he in rome in the old day of pio nono 's reign where he have a great position as prussian minister to the vatican he and the countess arnim receive a great deal and they beautiful room in the palazzo caffarellus on the top of the capitol hill -lrb- the two great statue of castor and pollux standing by they horse look as if they be guard the entrance -rrb- be a brilliant center for all the roman and diplomatic world he be a thorough man of the world could make himself charming when he choose but he never have a pleasant manner be curt arrogant with a very strong sense of he own superiority from the first moment he come to pari as ambassador he put people 's back up they never like he never trust he whenever he have a unpleasant communication to make he exaggerate the unpleasantness never attenuate and there be so much in the way thing be say the french be very hard upon he when he get into trouble and certainly he own government be merciless to he one of my first small difficulty after become a frenchwoman be to eliminate some of my german friend from my salon i could not run the risk of they be treat rudely i remember so well one night at home before i be marry see two french officer not in uniform slip quietly out of the room when one of the german embassy come in yet ours be a neutral house when my engagement be announce one of my great friend at the german embassy -lrb- count arco -rrb- say to I : this be the end i suppose of we friendship i can never go to see you when you be the wife of a french deputy oh yes you can still come not quite so often perhaps but i can not give up my friend however we drift apart without know why exactly it be curious how long that hostile feeling toward germany have last in france every year there be a great review of the pari garrison -lrb- thirty thousand man -rrb- by the president of the republic at longchamp on the 14th of July the national fête -- the day of the storm of the bastile it be a great day in paris -- one of the sight of the year -- and fall in midsummer the day be generally beautiful and very warm from early dawn all the chair and bench along the avenue du bois de boulogne be crowd with people wait patiently for hour to see the show there be not a seat to be have at longchamp unless one arrive very early the tribune be packed and the president 's box very crowd as he invite the diplomatic corps and the minister and they wife on that day the troops be always receive with much enthusiasm particularly the artillery drag they light field-piece and pass at a gallop -- also the battalion of st cyr the great french military school the final charge of the cavalry be very fine mass of rider come thunder over the plain the general command in front stop suddenly as if move by machinery just opposite the president 's box i go very regularly as long as w be in office and always enjoy my day there be a excellent buffet in the salon behind the box and it be pleasant to have a cup of tea and rest one 's eye while the long column of infantry be pass -- the regular continuous movement be fatigue all the ambassador and foreigner be very keen about the review pay great attention to the size of the man and horse and they general equipment as long as marshal macmahon be president of the republic he always ride home after the review down the champs-elysées -- in full uniform with a brilliant staff of foreign officer and military attachés it be a pretty sight and attract great attention some of the foreign uniform be very striking and the french love a military show -lrb- illustration : marshal macmahon -rrb- for many year after the war the german military attaché return from the review unobserved in a _ shut _ carriage could not run the risk of a angry or insulting word from some one in the crowd and still later fifteen year after the war when w be ambassador in england i be godmother of the daughter of a german-english cousin living in london the godfather be count herbert bismarck son of the famous chancellor at the time of the christen i be in france staying with some friend in the country the son of the house have be through the war have distinguish himself very much and they be still very sore over they reverse and the necessity of submit to all the little pin-prick which come at interval from germany bismarck send I a telegram regret the absence of the godmother from the ceremony it be bring to I just after breakfast while we be have we coffee i open it and read it out explain that it be from bismarck to express he regret for my absence there be a dead silence and then the mistress of the house say to I : c'est très désagréable pour vous chère amie cette association avec bismarck i do not see much of w in the daytime we usually ride in the morning in the boi and immediately after breakfast he start for versaille in the parliamentary train dinner be always a doubtful meal sometimes he come home very late for nine-o'clock dinner sometimes he dine at versaille and only get home at ten or eleven if the sit be stormy the hotel des reservoir do a flourishing business as long as the chamber sit at versaille when we be dine out it be very disagreeable particularly the first winter when i do not know many people i remember one dinner at the countess duchatel 's where i go alone we be ten woman and five man all the rest be deputy who have telegraph at the last moment they would not come be keep at versaille by a important question one of the most interesting thing i saw in 1873 just before my marriage be the court-martial of marshal bazaine for treachery at metz -- give up he army and the city without any attempt to break through the enemy 's line or in fact any resistance of any kind the court be hold at the grand trianon versaille a place so associate with a pleasure-loving court and the fanciful device of a gay young queen that it be difficult to realize the drama that be be enact when the honor of a marshal of france -- almost a army of france be to be judge it be a impressive scene the hall pack and people at all the door and entrance clamour for seat the public be curious a little of everything -- member of the national assembly officer all in uniform pretty woman of all category -- the group of journalist with keen eager face watch every change of expression of the marshal 's face -- some well-known face wife of member or lead political and literary man a fair amount of the frailer sisterhood actress and demi-mondaine make a great effect of wave plume and diamond the court be preside over by the duc d'aumale who accept the office after much hesitation he be a fine soldierly figure as he come in in full uniform a group of officer behind he all with stern set face the impression of the public be generally hostile to the marshal one feel it all through the trial he be dress in full uniform with the grand cordon of the legion of honor it be melancholy to hear the report of he career when it be read by he counsel -- long year of active service many wound often mention for brave conduct under fire have the médaille militaire -- the grand cordon of the legion d'honneur the baton de maréchal de france -- all the honor he country could give he -- to end so miserably judge not only by the court but by the country as a traitor false to he trust when he country be in the death-throe of defeat and humiliation he attitude at the trial be curious he sit very still in he armchair look straight before he only raise he head and look at the duc d'aumale when some grave accusation be make against he he explanation bring the famous reply from the duc when he say it be impossible to act or to treat there be nothing leave in france -- no government no order -- nothing the due answer : il y avait toujors la france he do not look overwhelmed rather like some one who be detach from the whole proceedings i see he face quite well it be neither false nor weak -- ordinary it be difficult to believe that a french general with a brilliant record behind he should have be guilty of such treachery sacrifice he man and he honor he friend -lrb- they be not many -rrb- say he lose he head be nearly crazy with the utterly unforeseen defeat of the french but even a moment of insanity would hardly account for such extraordinary weakness w and some of he friend be discuss it in the train come home they be all convinced of he guilt have no doubt as to what the sentence of the court would be -- death and degradation -- but think that physical fatigue and great depression must have cause a general breakdown the end every one know he be condemn to be shoot and degrade the first part of the sentence be cancel on account of he former service but he be degrade imprison escape and finish he life in spain in poverty and obscurity desert by all he friend and he wife it be a melancholy rentrée for the duc d'aumale he thought must have go back to the far-off day when the gallant young officer fil de france win he first military glory in algier and think the world be at he foot he brilliant exploit capture the smalum of abd-el-kader have be immortalise by vernet in the great historical picture that one see at versaille there be always artist copy part of it particularly one group where a lovely fair-haired woman be fall out of a litter backward even now when one think of the king loui philippe with all he tall strong young son -lrb- there be a well-known picture of the king on horseback with all he son around he -- splendid specimen of young manhood -rrb- it seem incredible that they be not still rule and reign at the tuilery i wonder if thing would have be very different if loui philippe and he family have not walk out of the tuilery that day i often ask w in what way france have gain by be a republic i personally be quite impartial be bear a american and never have live in france until after the franco-prussian war i have no particular tie nor tradition have no grandfather kill on the scaffold nor frozen to death in the retreat of la grande armée from moscow they always tell I a republic be in the air -- young talent and energy must come to the front -- the people must have a voice in the government i think the average frenchman be intelligent but i do not think the vote of the man in the street can have as much value as that of a man who have have not only a good education but who have be accustom always to hear certain principle of law and order hold up as rule for the guidance of he own life as well as other people 's certainly universal suffrage be a most unfortunate measure to take from america and apply to france but it have be take and now must stay i have often hear political man who deplore and condemn the law say that no minister would dare to propose a change i go often to the chamber in the spring -- use to drive out and bring w home versaille be very animated and interesting during all that time so many people always about quite a number of woman follow the debate one meet plenty of people one know in the street at the patissier or at some of the bric-à-brac shop where there be still bargain to be find in very old furniture print and china there be a large garrison there be always officer ride squad of soldier move about bugle-call in all direction and continuous arrival at the station of deputy and journalist hurry to the palace they black portfolio under they arm the palace be cold there be a fine draught at the entrance and the big stone staircase be always cold even in June but the assembly-room be warm enough and always crowd it be rather difficult to get seat people be so interested in those first debate after the war when everything have to be reorganise and so much of the past be be sweep away ii impression of the assembly at versaille the sitting of the assembly be very interesting in that wonderful year when everything be be discuss all public interest of course be centre in versaille where the national assembly be try to establish some sort of stable government there be endless discussion and speech and very violent language in the chamber gambetta make some bitter attack on the royalist accuse they of mauvaise fous and want of patriotism the bonapartist leader try to persuade themselves and they friend that they still have a hold on the country and that a plébiscite would bring back in triumph they prince the legitimist hope against hope that the comte de chambord would still be the savior of the country make passionate appeal to the old feeling of loyalty in the nation and the center droit represent the orleanist nervous hesitate know the position perfectly ardently desire a constitutional monarchy but feeling that it be not possible at that moment yet unwilling to commit themselves to a final declaration of the republic which would make a royalist restoration impossible all the left confident determine the republic be vote on the 30th of January 1875 by a majority of one vote if majority it could be call but the great step have be take and the struggle begin instantly between the moderate conservative republican and the more advanced left w come home late that day some of he friend come in after dinner and the talk be most interesting i be so new to it all that most of the name of the rank and file be unknown to I and the appreciation of the vote and the anecdote and side-light on the voter say nothing to I look back after all these year it seem to I that the moderate royalist -lrb- center droit -rrb- throw away a splendid chance they could not stop the republican wave -lrb- nothing could -rrb- but they might have control it and direct it instead of stand aloof and throw the power into the hand of the leave we hear the well-known saying very often those day : la république serum conservatrice ou elle ne serum pas and la république sans républicains attribute to m thier and marshal macmahon the national assembly struggle on to the end of the year make a constitution a parliament with two house senate and chamber of deputy with many discussion and contradiction and hope and illusion -lrb- illustration : sit of the national assembly at the palace of versaille from _ l'illustration _ march 11 1876 -rrb- i go often to versaille drive out when the weather be fine i like the stormy sitting best some orator would say something that displeased the public and in a moment there would be the greatest uproar protestation and accusation from all side some of the extreme left get up gesticulate wildly and shake they fist at the speaker -- the right generally calm and sarcastic request the speaker to repeat he monstrous statement -- the huissier dress in black with silver chain walk up and down in front of the tribune call out at interval : silence messieur s ` il vous plaît -- the president ring he bell violently to call the house to order and nobody pay the slightest attention -- the orator sometimes stand quite still with fold arm wait until the storm should abate sometimes dominate the hall and hurl abuse at he adversary w be always perfectly quiet he voice be low not very strong and he could not speak if there be a uproar when he be interrupt in a speech he use to stand perfectly still with fold arm wait for a few minute ' silence the deputy would call out : allez allez intersperse with a few lively criticism on what he be say to they he be perfectly unmoved merely reply : i will go on with pleasure as soon as you will be quiet enough for I to be hear frenchman generally have such a wonderful facility of speech and such a pitiless logic in discuss a question that the debate be often very interesting the public be interesting too a great many woman of all class follow the sitting -- several egeria -lrb- not generally in they first youth -rrb- of well-known political man sit prominently in the president 's box or in the front row of the journalist ' box follow the discussion with great interest and send down little slip of paper to they friend below -- member ' wife and friend who enjoy spend a hour or two listen to the speech -- newspaper correspondent literary lady diplomatist it be very difficult to get place particularly when some well-known orator be announce to speak upon a important question we do not always know beforehand and i remember some dull afternoon with one or two member make long speech about purely local matter which do not interest any one we look down upon a almost empty hall on those occasion a great many of the member have go out and be talk in the lobby those who remain be talk in group write letter walk about the hall quite unconscious apparently of the speaker at the tribune i could not understand how the man could go on talk to empty bench but w tell I he be quite indifferent to the attention of he colleague -- he speech be for he elector and would appear the next day in the _ journal officiel _ i remember one man talk for hour about allumette chimique léon say be a delightful speaker so easy always find exactly the word he want it hardly seem a speech when he be at the tribune more like a causerie though he tell very plain truth sometimes to the peuple souverain he be essentially french or rather parisian know everybody and be au courant of all that go on politically and socially and have a certain blague that eminently french quality which be very difficult to explain he be a hard worker and tell I once that what rest he most after a long day be to go to a small boulevard theater or to read a rather lively yellowbacked novel i never hear gambetta speak which i always regret -- in fact know very little of he he be not a lady ' man though he have some devoted woman friend and be always surround by a circle of political man whenever he appear in public -lrb- in all french party immediately after dinner the man all congregate together to talk to each other -- never to the woman -- so unless you happen to find yourself seat next to some well-known man you never really have a chance of talk to he -rrb- gambetta do not go out much and as by some curious chance he be never next to I at dinner i never have any opportunity of talk to he he be not one of w 's friend nor a habitué of the house he appearance be against he -- dark heavy-look with a enormous head when i have have enough of the speech and the bad atmosphere i use to wander about the terrace and garden how many beautiful sunset i have see from the top of the terrace or else standing on the three famous pink marble step -lrb- so well know to all lover of poetry through alfred de musset 's beautiful verse trois march rose -rrb- see in imagination all the brilliant crowd of courtier and fair woman that use to people those wonderful garden in the old day of versaille i go sometimes to the reservoir for a cup of tea and very often find other woman who have also drive out to get they husband we occasionally bring back friend who prefer the quiet cool drive through the park of st cloud to the crowd and dust of the railway the count de st vallier -lrb- who be not yet senator but deeply interested in politics -rrb- be frequently at versaille and come back with we often he be a charming easy talker i never tire of hear about the brilliant day of the last empire and the fêtes at the tuilery compiègne and st cloud he have be a great deal at the court of napoleon iii have see many interesting people of all kind and have a wonderful memory he must have have a inner sense or presentiment of some kind about the future for i have hear he say often in speaking of the old day and the glory of the empire when everything seem so prosperous and brilliant that he use often to ask himself if it could be real -- be the foundation as solid as they seem he have be a diplomatist be in germany at the time of the franco-german war and like so many of he colleague scatter over germany be quite aware of the grow hostile feeling in germany to france and also of bismarck 's aim and ambition he -lrb- like so many other -rrb- write repeat letter and warning to the french foreign office which apparently have no effect one hear afterward that several letter of that description from french diplomatist in germany be find unopened in a drawer at the ministry it be rather sad as we drive through the stately alley of the park of st cloud with the setting sun shine through the fine old tree to hear of all the fêtes that use to take place there -- and one could quite well fancy the beautiful empress appear at the end of one of the long avenue follow by a brilliant suite of lady and écuyers -- and the echo of the cor de chasse in the distance the alley be always there and fairly well keep but very few people or carriage pass the park be desert i do not think the cor de chasse would awaken a echo or a regret even so entirely have the empire and its glory become a thing of the past a rendezvous de chasse be a very pretty sight we go once to compiègne before i be marry about three year before the war we go out and breakfast at compiègne with a great friend of ours m de st m a chamberlain or equerry of the emperor we breakfast in a funny old-fashioned little hotel -lrb- with a very good cuisine -rrb- and drive in a big open break to the forest there be a great many people ride drive and walk officer of the garrison in uniform member of the hunt in green and gold and a fair sprinkling of red coat the empress look charming dress always in the uniform of the hunt green with gold braid and a tricorne on she head -- all she lady with the same dress which be very become one of the most striking-looking of she lady be the princess anna murat the present duchesse de mouchy who look very handsome in the tricorne and beautifully fitting habit i do not see the empress on she horse as we lose sight of they very soon she and she lady arrive on the field in a open break i see the emperor quite distinctly as he ride up and give some order he be very well mount -lrb- there be some beautiful horse -rrb- but stoop slightly and have rather a sad face i never see he again and the empress only long year after at cowe when everything have go out of she life the president marshal macmahon be live at the préfecture at versaille and receive every Thursday evening we go there several time -- it be my first introduction to the official world the first two or three time we drive out but it be long -lrb- quite a hour and a quarter -rrb- over bad road -- a good deal of pavement one do not care to drive through the park of st cloud at night -- it be very lonely and dark we should have be quite helpless if we have fall upon any enterprising tramp who could easily have stop the carriage and help themselves to any money or jewel they could lay they hand on one evening the seine have overflow and we be oblige to walk a long distance -- all around sèvres -- and get to versaille very late and quite exhaust with the jolting and general discomfort after that we go out by train -- which put we at the préfecture at ten o'clock it be not very convenient as there be a great rush for carriage when we arrive at versaille still everybody do it we generally wear black or dark dress with a lace veil tie over we head and of course only go when it be fine the evening be pleasant enough -- one see all the political man the marshal 's personal friend of the droite go to he in the first day of he presidency -- -lrb- they rather fall off later -rrb- -- the government and republican naturally and all the diplomatic corps there be not many woman as it really be rather a effort to put one 's self into a low-necked dress and start off directly after dinner to the gare st lazare and have rather a rush for place we be always late and just have time to scramble into the last carriage i feel very strange -- a outsider -- all the first month but my husband 's friend be very nice to I and after a certain time i be astonish to find how much politics interested I i learn a great deal from merely listen while the man talk at dinner i suppose i should have understand much more if i have read the papers regularly but i do not begin to do that until w have be minister for some time and then work myself into a nervous fever at all the opposition papers say about he however all tell the attack be never very vicious he have never be in public life until after the war when he be name deputy and join the assemblée nationale at bordeaux -- which be a immense advantage to he he have never serve any other government and be therefore perfectly independent and be bind by no family tradition or old friendship -- do not mind the opposition papers at all -- not even the caricature some of they be very funny there be one very like he sit quite straight and correct on the box of a brougham john cocher anglai n ' a jamai versé nus accroché -lrb- english coachman who have never upset nor run into anything -rrb- there be a few political salon the countess de r receive every evening -- but only man -- no woman be ever ask the wife rather demur at first but the man go all the same -- as one saw every one there and hear all the latest political gossip another hostess be the princess lize troubetskous she be a great friend and admirer of thier -- be suppose to give he a great deal of information from foreign government she be very eclectic in she sympathy and every one go to she not only french but all foreigner of any distinction who pass through paris she give herself a great deal of trouble for she friend but also use they when she want anything one of the story which be always tell of the foreign office be she petit paquet which she want to send by the valise to berlin when the comte de st vallier be french ambassador there he agree willingly to receive the package address to he which prove to be a grand piano the privilege of send package abroad by the valise of the foreign affair be greatly abuse when w become minister of foreign affair he make various change one of which be that the valise should be absolutely restricted to official papers and document which really be perhaps well observe the countess de ségur receive every Saturday night it be really a orleanist salon as they be devoted friend of the orléans family but one see all the moderate republican there and the center gauche -lrb- which struggle so long to keep together and be a moderate influence but have long be swallow up in the ever-increasing flood of radicalism -rrb- and a great many literary man member of the institute academician etc they have a fine old house entre cour et jardin with all sort of interesting picture and souvenir countess de s also receive every day before three o'clock i often go and be delight when i could find she alone she be very clever very original have know all sort of people and it be most interesting to hear she talk about king loui philippe 's court the spanish marriage the death of the duc d'orléans the coup d'etat of loui napoléon etc when she first begin to receive during the reign of loui philippe the feeling be very bitter between the legitimist -lrb- extreme royalist party -rrb- and the orleanist the duc d'orléans often come to they on Saturday evening and always in a good deal of state with handsome carriage aide-de-camp etc she warn she legitimist friend when she know he be come -lrb- but she do not always know -rrb- and say she never have any trouble or disagreeable scene every one be perfectly respectful to the duke but the extreme legitimist go away at once we go quite often to monsieur and madame thiers who receive every evening in they big gloomy house in the place st george it be a political center -- all the republican party go there and many of he old friend orleanist who admire he great intelligence while disapprove he politics -- literary man journalist all the diplomatist and distinguish stranger he have people at dinner every night and a small reception afterward -- madame thiers and she sister mademoiselle dosne do the honor for he i believe both lady be very intelligent but i can not truthfully say they have any charm of manner they never look pleased to see any one and each take comfortable little nap in they armchair after dinner -- the first comer have sometimes rather embarrassing entrance -- but i be tell they hold very much to they reception thier be wonderful he be a very old man when i know he but he eye be very bright and keen he voice strong and he would talk all the evening without any appearance of fatigue he sleep every afternoon for two hour and be quite rest and alert by dinner time it be a interesting group of man that stand around the little figure in the drawing-room after dinner he himself stand almost always lean against the mantelpiece prince orloff russian ambassador be one of the habitués of the salon and i be always delight when he would slip away from the group of man and join the lady in madame thiers 's salon which be less interesting he know everybody french and foreign and give I most amusing and useful little sketch of all the celebrity it be he who tell I of old prince gortschakoff 's famous phrase when he hear of thier 's death -- -lrb- he die at st germain in 1877 -rrb- -- encore une lumière éteinte quand il y en a si peu qui voient clair -- -lrb- still another light extinguish when there be so few who see clearly -rrb- many have go of that group -- casimir périer léon say jule ferry st vallier comte paul de ségur barthélemy st hilaire -- but other remain younger man who be then begin they political career and be eager to drink in lesson and warning from the old statesman who fight gallantly to the last i find the first winter in pari as the wife of a french deputy rather try so different from the easy pleasant life in rome that have change too of course with unite italy and rome the capital but it be a small rome in we day most informal i do not ever remember have write a invitation all the year we live in rome everybody lead the same life and we see each other all day hunting ride drive in the villa in the afternoon generally finish at the pincio where there be music all the carriage draw up and the young man come and talk to the woman exactly as if they be at the opera or in a ballroom when we have music or dance at we house we use to tell some well-known man to say on danse chez madame king ce soir that be all paris society be much stiffer attach much more importance to visit and reception day there be very little informal receive no more evening with no amusement of any kind provide and a small table at one end of the room with orangeade and cake which i remember when i be first marry -lrb- and always in lend the quartet of the conservatoire play classical symphony which of course put a stop to all conversation as people listen to the artist of the conservatoire in a sort of sacred silence -rrb- now one be invite each time there be always music or a comédie sometimes a conference in lend and a buffet in the dining-room there be much more luxury and woman wear more jewel there be not many tiara when i first know pari society now every young woman have one in she corbeille -lrb- illustration : the foyer of the opéra -rrb- one of the first big thing i saw in pari be the opening of the grand opera it be a pretty sight the house crowd with woman beautifully dress and wear fine jewel which show very little the decoration of the house be very elaborate there be so much light and gilding that the diamond be quite lose the two great feature of the evening be the young king of spain -lrb- the father of the present king -rrb- a slight dark youthful figure and the lord mayor of london who really make much more effect than the king he be dress in he official robe have two sheriff and a macebearer and when he stand at the top of the grand staircase he be a impose figure and the public be delighted with he he be surround by a admiring crowd when he walk in the foyer everybody be there and w point out to I the celebrity of all the coterie we have a box at the opera and go very regularly the opera be never good never have be since i have know it but as it be open all the year round one can not expect to have the star one hear elsewhere still it be always a pleasant evening one see plenty of people to talk to and the music be a cheerful accompaniment to conversation it be astounding how they talk in the box and how the public submit the ballet be always good halanzier be director of the grand opera and we go sometimes to he box behind the scene which be most amusing he be most dictatorial occupied himself with every detail -- be consequently a excellent director i remember see he inspect the corps de ballet one night just before the curtain go up he pass down the line like a general review he troops tap lightly with a cane various arm and leg which be not in position he be perfectly smile and good-humoured : voyon voyon mes petites ce n'est pas cela -- but see everything what w like best be the théâtre français we have not a box there but as so many of we friend have we go very often Tuesday be the fashionable night and the salle be almost as interesting as the stage particularly if it happen to be a première and all the critic and journalist be there sarah bernhardt and croizette be both play those first year they be great rival and it be interesting to see they in the same play both such fine talent yet so totally different iii m waddington as minister of public instruction in march 1876 w be make for the second time ministre de l'instruction publique et des beaux art with m dufaure président du conseil duc décazes at the foreign office and léon say at the finances he nomination be a surprise to we we do not expect it at all there have be so many discussion so many name put forward it seem impossible to come to a understanding and form a cabinet which would be equally acceptable to the marshal and to the chamber i come in rather late one afternoon while the negotiation be go on and be tell by the servant that m léon say be wait in w 's library to see he w come a few minute afterward and the two gentleman remain a long time talk they stop in the drawing-room on they way to the door and say say to I : eh bien madame je vous apporte une portefeuille et des félicitations before i accept the felicitation i would like to know which portfolio of course when he say public instruction i be please as i know it be the only one w care for my brother-in-law richard waddington senator of the seine inférieure -lrb- 1 -rrb- and one or two friend come to see we in the evening and the gentleman talk late into the night discuss program possibility etc all the next day the conference go on and when the new cabinet be present to the marshal he receive they graciously if not warmly w say both dufaure and décazes be quite wonderful realize the state of affair exactly and know the temper of the house which be get more advanced every day and more difficult to manage -lrb- footnote 1 : my brother-in-law richard waddington senator die in June 1913 some time after these note be write -rrb- w at once convoke all the official and staff of the ministry he make very few change merely take the young count de lasteyrie now marquis de lasteyrie grandnephew of the marquis de lafayette son of m jule de lasteyrie a senator and devoted friend of the orléans family as he chef de cabinet two or three day after the new cabinet be announce w take I to the elysée to pay my official visit to the maréchale de macmahon she receive we up-stair in a pretty salon look out on the garden she be very civil not a particularly gracious manner -- give I the impression of a very energetic practical woman -- what most frenchwoman be i be very much strike with she writing-table which look most businesslike it be cover with quantity of letter papers card circular of all kind -- she attend to all household matter herself i always hear -lrb- though she do not tell I -rrb- that she read every letter that be address to she and she must have have hundred of beg letter she be very charitable much interested in all good work and very kind to all artist whenever a letter come ask for money she have the case investigate and if the story be true give practical help at once i be dismay at first with the number of letter receive from all over france ask my intercession with the minister on every possible subject from a monument historique to be restore to a pension give to a old schoolmaster no longer able to work with a large family to support it be perfectly impossible for I to answer they be a foreigner and never have live in france i do not really know anything about the various question w be too busy to attend to such small matter so i consult m de l chef de cabinet and we agree that i should send all the correspondence which be not strictly personal to he and he would have it examine in the bureau the first few week of w 's ministry be very try to I -- i go to see so many people -- so many people come to see I -- all stranger with whom i have nothing in common such dreary conversation never get beyond the most ordinary commonplace phrase -- such a absolutely different world from any i have ever live in it be very difficult at first for any woman who marry a foreigner to make she life in she new country there must be so many thing that be different -- better perhaps sometimes -- but not what one have be accustom to -- and i think more difficult in france than in any other country french people be set in they way and there be so little sympathy with anything that be not french i be strike with that absence of sympathy at some of the first dinner i go to the talk be exclusively french almost parisian very personal with story and allusion to people and thing i know nothing about no one dream of talk to I about my past life -- or america or any of my early association -- yet i be a stranger -- one would have think they might have take a little more trouble to find some topic of general interest even now after all these year the difference of nationality count sometimes when i be discuss with very intimate friend some question and i find that i can not understand they view and they can not understand mine they always come back to the real difficulty : ecoutez chère amie vous êtes d'une autre race i rather complain to w after the first three or four dinner -- it seem to I bad manners but he say no i be the wife of a french political man and every one take for grant i be interested in the conversation -- certainly no one intend any rudeness the first big dinner i go to that year be at the elysée -- the regular official dinner for the diplomatic corps and the government i have baron von zuylen the dutch minister one of we great friend on one side of I léon renault préfet de police on the other léon renault be very interesting very clever -- a excellent préfet de police some of he story be most amusing the dinner be very good -lrb- always be in the marshal 's time -rrb- not long and mercifully the room be not too hot sometimes the heat be terrible there be quite a number of people in the evening -- the music of the garde républicaine playing and a buffet in the dining-room which be always crowd we never stay very late as w always have papers to sign when we get home sometimes when there be a great press of work he signature keep he two hour i do not think the marshal enjoy the reception very much like most soldier he be a early riser and the late hour and constant talk tired he i like we dinner and reception at the ministry all the intelligence of france pass through we room people generally come early -- by ten o'clock the room be quite full every one be announce and it be most interesting to hear the name of all the celebrity in every branch of art and science it be only a fleeting impression as the guest merely speak to I at the door and pass on in those day hardly any one shake hand unless they be fairly intimate -- the man never they make I low bow some distance off and rarely stop to exchange a few word with I some of the woman not many shake hand it be a fatiguing evening as i stand so long and a procession of stranger pass before I the reception finish early -- every one have go by eleven o'clock except a few loiterer at the buffet there be always a certain number of people at the big official reception whose principal object in come seem to be to make a comfortable meal the servant always tell I there be nothing leave after a big party there be no invitation -- the reception be announce in the papers so any one who feel he have the slightest claim upon the minister appear at the party some of the dress be funny but there be nothing eccentric -- no woman in hat carry baby in they arm such as one use to see in the old day in america at the president 's reception at the white house washington -- some very simple black silk dress hardly low -- and of course a great many pretty woman very well dress some of my american friend often come with true american curiosity want to see a phase of french life which be quite novel to they w remain two year as minister of public instruction and my life become at once very interesting very full we do not live at the ministry -- it be not really necessary all the work be over before dinner except the signature which w could do just as well in he library at home we go over and inspect the hôtel du ministère in the rue de grenelle before we make we final decision but it be not really tempting there be fine reception-room and a pretty garden but the living-room be small not numerous and decidedly gloomy of course i see much less of w he never come home to breakfast except on Sunday as it be too far from the rue de grenelle to the etoile the arc de triomphe stand in the place de l'etoile at the top of the champs-elysées all the great avenue alma jéna kléber and the adjacent street be know as the quartier de l'etoile it be before the day of telephone so whenever a important communication be to be make to he when he be at home in the evening a dragoon gallop up with he little black bag from which he extract he papers it make quite a excitement in we quiet street the first time he arrive after ten o'clock we just manage we morning ride and then there be often people wait to speak to w before we start and always when he come back there be a great amount of patronage attach to he ministry nomination to all the university lycées school etc and what be most agreeable to I box at all the government theater -- the grand opera opéra comique français odéon and conservatoire every Monday morning we receive the list for the week and after make we own selection distribute they to the official world generally -- sometimes to we own personal friend the box of the français opéra and conservatoire be much appreciate i go very regularly to the Sunday afternoon concert at the conservatoire where all classical music be splendidly give they confine themselves generally to the strictly classic but be begin to play a little schumann that year some of the face of the regular habitués become most familiar to I there be three or four old man with gray hair sit in the first row of stall -lrb- most uncomfortable seat -rrb- who follow every note of the music turn around and frown at any unfortunate person in a box who drop a fan or a opera-glass it be funny to hear the hum of satisfaction when any well-known movement of beethoven or mozart be attack the orchestra be perfect at its best i think in the scherzo which they take in beautiful style -- so light and sure i like the instrumental part much better than the singing french voice the woman 's particularly be thin as a rule i think they sacrifice too much to the diction -- do not bring out the voice enough -- but the style and training be perfect of they kind the conservatoire be quite as much a social feature as a school of music it be the thing to do on Sunday afternoon no invitation be more appreciate as it be almost impossible to have place unless one be invite by a friend all the box and seat -lrb- the hall be small -rrb- belong to subscriber and have do so for one or two generation many marriage be make there there be very few theater in pari to which girl can be take but the opéra comique and the conservatoire be very favorite resort when a marriage be pend the young lady very well dress -lrb- always in the simplest tenue de jeune fille -rrb- be take to the conservatoire or the opéra comique by she father and mother and very often she grandmother she sit in front of the box and the young man in the stall where he can study he future wife without commit himself the difference of dress between the jeune fille and the jeune femme be very strongly mark in france the french girl never wear lace or jewel or feather or heavy material of any kind quite unlike she english or american contemporary who wear what they like the wedding-dress be classic a simple very long dress of white satin and generally a tulle veil over the face when there be a handsome lace veil in the family the bride sometimes wear it but no lace on she dress the first thing the young married woman do be to wear a very long velvet dress with feather in she hair i think on the whole the arrange marriage turn out as well as any other they be generally make by people of the same monde accustom to the same way of living and the fortune as nearly alike as possible everything be calculate the young couple usually spend the summer with parent or parents-in-law in the château and i know some case where there be curious detail about the number of lamp that can be light in they room and the use of the carriage on certain day i be speaking of course of purely french marriage to my american idea it seem very strange when i first come to europe but a long residence in a foreign country certainly modify one 's impression year ago when we be live in rome four sister before any of we be marry a charming frenchwoman duchesse de b who come often to the house be very worried about this family of girl all very happy at home and contented with they life it be quite true we dance and hunt and make a great deal of music without ever troubling ourselves about the future the duchesse could not understand it use often to talk to mother very seriously she come one day with a proposal of marriage -- a charming man a frenchman not too young with a good fortune a title and a château have see madam king 's daughter in the ballroom and hunting-field and would very much like to be present and make he cour which one we naturally ask but the answer be vague it sound so curiously impersonal that we could hardly take it seriously however we suggest that the young man should come and each one of the four would show off she particular talent one would play and one would sing -lrb- rather like the song in the child 's book one could dance and one could sing and one could play the violin -rrb- and the third the polyglot of the family could speak several language we be rather puzzle as to what my eldest sister could do as she be not very sociable and never speak to stranger if she could help it so we decide she must be very well dress and preside at the tea-table behind a old-fashioned silver urn that we always use -- look like a stately maîtresse de maison receive she guest we confide all these plan to the duchesse but she be quite put out with we would not bring the young man nor tell we he name we never know who he be since i have be a frenchwoman -lrb- devant la lous -rrb- -- i think all american remain american no matter where they marry -- i have interested myself three or four time in make marriage which have generally turn out well there be very few american marry in france all those year now there be legion of all kind i do not remember any in the official parliamentary world i live in the first year of my marriage -- nor english either it be absolutely french and rather borné french very few of the people the woman especially have any knowledge or experience of foreign country and do not care to have -- france be enough for they w be very happy at the ministry of public instruction -- all the educational question interested he so much and the tournées en province and visit to the big school and university -- some of they in the south of france particularly singularly want in the most elementary detail of hygiene and cleanliness and it be very difficult to make the necessary change give more light air and space routine be a powerful factor in this very conservative country where so many thing exist simply because they have always exist some of he letter from bordeaux toulouse and montpellier be most interesting as a rule he be very well receive and get on very well strangely enough with the clergy particularly the haut clergé bishop and cardinal he be a protestant be rather a help to he he could take a impartial view of thing at bordeaux he stay at the préfecture where he be very comfortable but the day be fatigue he say he have not work so hard for year he start at nine in the morning visit school and university come home to breakfast at twelve and immediately after have a small reception rector professor and people connect with the school he want to talk to at three start again see more school and go conscientiously over the building from basement to garret -- then visit to the cardinal archbishop general commanding etc -- a big dinner and reception in the evening the cardinal present in he red robe he coadjutor in purple the officer in uniform and all the people connect in any way with the university who be please to see they chief there be a total absence of bonapartist senator and deputy -lrb- which be not surprising as w have always be in violent opposition to the empire -rrb- who be rather numerous in these part w be really quite exhaust when he get back to paris -- say it be absolute luxury to sit quietly and read in he library and not talk it be not a luxury that he enjoy very much for whenever he be in the house there be always some one talk to he in he study and other wait in the drawing-room every minute of the day he be occupy people be always come to ask for something for themselves or some member of they family always candidate for the institute anxiously inquire what they chance be and if he have recommend they to he friend it be striking even in this country of functionary -lrb- i think there be more small public employee in france than in any other country -rrb- how many applicant there be always for the most insignificant place -- a frenchman love a cap with gold braid and gilt button on he coat all the winter of 1876 which see the end of the national assembly and the beginning of a new régime be a eventful one in parliamentary circle i do not know if the country generally be very much excite about a new constitution and a change of government i do not think the country in france -lrb- the small farmer and peasant -rrb- be ever much excite about the form of government as long as the crop be good and there be no war to take away they son and able-bodied man they do not care often do not know whether a king or a emperor be reign over they they say there be some far-off village half hide in the forest and mountain who still believe that a king and a bourbon be reign in france something have to be decide the provisoire could no longer continue the country could not go on without a settled government all the argument and negotiation of that period have be so often tell that i will not go into any detail the two centre center droit and center gauche have everything in they hand as the great moderate element of the assembly but the conflict claim of the various party legitimist orleanist bonapartist and advance left make the question a very difficult one w as a member of the comité des trente be very much occupy and preoccupy he come back generally very late from versaille and when he do dine at home either go out again after dinner to some of the numerous meeting at different house or have people at home i think the great majority of deputy be honestly try to do what they think best for the country and when one remember the name and personality on both side -- macmahon broglie d'audiffret-pasquier buffet dufaure and thier casimir périer léon say jule simon jule ferry freycinet and many other it be impossible to think that any of those man be animated by any spirit other than love of the country and a ardent desire to see some stable government restore which would enable france to take she place again among the great power unfortunately the difference of opinion as to the form of government make thing very difficult some of the young deputy just fresh from the war and smart under a sense of humiliation be very violent in they abuse of any royalist and particularly bonapartist restoration -lrb- illustration : meeting of officer of the national assembly and of delegate of the new chamber in the salon of hercule palace of versaille from _ l'illustration _ march 11 1876 -rrb- iv the social side of a minister 's wife my first big dinner at the ministry of public instruction rather intimidate I we be fifty people -- i the only lady i go over to the ministry in the afternoon to see the table which be very well arrange with quantity of flower beautiful sèvres china not much silver -- there be very little left in france it have all be melt at the time of the revolution the official dinner be always well do in paris i suppose the tradition of the empire have be hand down we arrive a few minute before eight all the staff and director already there and by ten minute after eight every one have arrive i sit between gérôme the painter and renan two very different man but each quite charming -- gérôme tall slight animated talk very easily about everything he tell I who a great many of the people be with a little commentary on they profession and career which be very useful to I as i know so few of they renan be short stout with a very large head almost unprepossessing-looking but with a great charm of manner and the most delightful smile and voice imaginable he often dine with we in we own house en petit comité and be always charming he be one of those happy mortal -lrb- there be not many -rrb- who make every subject they discuss interesting after that first experience i like the big man 's dinner very much there be no general conversation i talk exclusively to my two neighbor but as they be always distinguish in some branch of art science or literature the talk be brilliant and i find the hour we dinner last a very short one w be very particular about not have long dinner later at the ministry of foreign affair where we sometimes have eighty guest the dinner be never over a hour i do not remain the whole evening at the man 's dinner as soon as they disperse to talk and smoke i come away leave w to entertain he guest we often have big reception with music and comédie at one of we first big party we have several of the orléans family i be rather nervous as i have never receive royalty -- in fact i have never speak to a royal prince or princess i have live a great deal in rome as a girl during the last day of pius ix and i be never in pari during the empire when we go back to rome one winter after the accession of king victor emmanuel i find myself for the first time in a room with royalty the prince and princesse de piémont i remember quite well be so surprised by see two of the roman man we know very well come backward into the ballroom where we be sit i think they must be anticipate the mardi gras and be masquerade a little do not realize that every one be stand i remain sit for a moment -lrb- much to the horror of one of the english secretary who be with we and who think we be go to make a spread-eagle american demonstration and remain sit when royalty appear -rrb- however by some sort of instinct we rise too -lrb- perhaps to see what be go on -rrb- just as the prince pass princess marguerite look charming dress in white with she splendid pearl and beautiful fair hair when it be decide that we should ask the orléans prince to we party i think i would go to see the duc décazes the foreign minister a charming man and charming colleague to get some precise information about my part of the entertainment he could not think what i want when i invade he cabinet and be much amuse when i state my case there be nothing unusual in receive the prince at a ministry you must do as you have always do but that be just the question i have _ never do _ i have never in my life exchange a word with a royal personage it be not possible it be absolutely true i have never live anywhere where there be a court when he see that i be in earnest he be as nice as possible tell I _ exactly _ what i want to know -- that i need not say altesse royale every time i speak merely occasionally as they all like it -- that i must speak in the third person madame veut-elle monseigneur veut-il I permettre etc also that i must always be at the door when a princess arrive and conduct she myself to she seat but if i be at one end of the long enfilade of room take the comtesse de paris to she seat and another princess -lrb- joinville or chartre -rrb- should arrive what have to be do you husband must always be at the door with he chef de cabinet who will replace he while he take the princess to she place the marquise de l a charming old lady with white hair beautiful blue eye and pink cheek a great friend of the orléans family go with I when i make my round of visit to thank the royal lady for accept we invitation we find no one but the princesse marguerite daughter of the duc de nemor who be live at neuilly i have all my instruction from the marquise how many courtesy to make how to address she and above all not to speak until the princess speak to I we be show into a pretty drawing-room opening on a garden where the princess be wait standing at one end of the room madame de l name I i make my courtesy the princess shake hand and then we remain stand face each other she do not say anything i stand perfectly straight and quiet wait she change color move she hand nervously be evidently overcome with shyness but do not utter a sound it seem very long be really only a few seconds but i be get rather nervous when suddenly a child run across the garden that break the ice and she ask I the classic royal question avez-vous des enfants madame i have only one and he be rather small but still he nurse he tooth and he food carry I on for a little while and after that we have some general conversation but i can not say the visit be really interesting as long as i be in public life i regret that i have but the one child -- child and nursery and schoolroom be always a unfailing topic of conversation frenchwoman of all class take much more interest in the detail of they nursery and the education and bringing-up of they child than we anglo-saxon do i know several mamma who follow all the course of they son ' study when they be prepare they baccalauréat even to write the composition the head nurse -lrb- english -rrb- who take entire charge of she nursery who do not like any interference and bring the child to they mother at state hour do not exist in france we party be very brilliant all sort of notability of all kind and the lead pari artist from the grand opera opéra comique and the français as soon as the performance be over w tell I i must go and thank the artist he could not leave he prince i start off to the last of the long suite of salon where they be all assemble comte de l w 's chef de cabinet go with I and we be precede by a huissier with sword and chain who pilot we through the crowd i feel very shy when i arrive in the greenroom the artist be draw up in two row the woman on one side the man on the other all eye of course fix upon madame la ministresse madame carvalho sarah bernhardt and croizette be stand at the head of the long line of woman faure talazac delaunay coquelin on the other side i go first all along the line of woman then come back by the man i realize instantly after the first word of thanks and interest how easy it be for prince or any one in high place to give pleasure they all respond so smilingly and naturally to everything i say after the first two or three word i do not mind at all and find myself discuss acoustic the difficulty of play any well-known part without costume scenery etc the inconvenience of have the public so near quite easily we often have music and recitation at we party and that be always a great pleasure to I i remember so well one evening when we have the chorus of the conservatoire and they sing quite beautifully the old plaisir d'amour of we childhood it have a great success and they be oblige to repeat it w make one great innovation in the dress of the lady of the conservatoire chorus they be always dress in white which be very well for the young slight figure but be less happy for a stout middle-aged lady so after much discussion it be decide to adopt black as the official dress and i must say it be a enormous improvement the social side all sort of interesting people come to see we at the ministry of public instruction -- among other the late emperor of brazil don pedro de bragance who spend some month in pari that year with he daughter the young comtesse d'eu he be a tall good-looking man with a charming easy manner very cultivate and very keen about everything -- art literature politics he gentleman say he have the energy of a man of twenty-five and he be well over middle age when he be in pari they be quite exhaust sometimes after a long day of visit and sightseeing with he he be a early riser one of the first rendezvous he give w be at nine o'clock in the morning which greatly disturb that gentleman 's habit he be never a early riser work always very late -lrb- say he best despatch be write after midnight -rrb- and do not care about begin he day too early another interesting personality be mommsen the german historian and savant he be a picturesque-looking old man with keen blue eye and a quantity of white hair i do not think anything modern interested he very much he be a old man when i first see he and look even older than he age he and w use to plunge into very long learn discussion over antiquity and medal w say the hour with mommsen rest he such a change from the shop talk always mix with politics in france we often have political breakfast at home -lrb- more breakfast than dinner -rrb- we aisne deputy and senator be not very mondain do not care much to dine out they be pleasant enough when they talk about subject that interest they henrus martin senator of the aisne be a old-fashioned republican absolutely convinced that no other government would ever succeed in france but he be moderate st vallier also a senator from the aisne be nervous and easily discourage when thing do not go smoothly but he too think the republic be the only possible government now whatever he preference might have be formerly w 's ministry come to a end on the famous 16th of may 1877 when marshal macmahon suddenly take matter in he own hand and dismiss he cabinet preside over by m jule simon thing have not be go smoothly for some time could not between two man of such absolute difference of origin habit and idea still the famous letter write by the marshal to jule simon be a thunderclap i be walk about the champs-elysées and faubourg st honoré on the morning of the 16th of may and see all the carriage we own include wait at the ministry of the interior where the conseil be sit i go home to breakfast think w be later than usual but never dream of what be happen when he finally appear quite compose and smile with he news we be out of office the marshal have send we all about we business i could hardly believe it even when he tell I all the detail i have know for a long time that thing be not go well but there be always so much friction and such opposing element in the cabinet that i have not attach much importance to the account of stormy sitting and think thing would settle down -lrb- illustration : theodor mommsen from a painting by franz von lenbach -rrb- w say the marshal be very civil to he but it be evident that he could not stand jule simon any longer and the various measure that he feel be impend we have many visitor after breakfast all much excited wonder what the next step would be -- if the chamber would be dissolve the marshal try to impose a cabinet of the right or perhaps form another moderate liberal cabinet without jule simon but retain some of he minister it be my reception afternoon and while i be sit quietly in my drawing-room talk to some of my friend make plan for the summer quite pleased to have w to myself again the butler hurry into the room tell I that the maréchale de macmahon be on the stair come to make I a visit i be very much surprised as she never come to see I we meet very rarely except on official occasion and she make no secret of she dislike to the official republican lady -lrb- but she be always absolutely correct if not enthusiastic -rrb- i have just time to get to the head of the stair to receive she she be very amiable a little embarrassed take a cup of tea -- say the marshal be very sorry to part with w he have never have any trouble or disagreement with he of any kind but that it be impossible to go on with a cabinet when neither party have any confidence in the other i quite agree say it be the fortune of war i hope the marshal would find another premier who would be more sympathetic with he and then we talk of other thing my friend be quite amuse one of they marquise de t know the maréchale quite well and say she be go to ask she if she be oblige to make visite de condoléance to the wife of all the fall minister w be rather astonish when i tell he who have come to tea with I and think the conversation must have be difficult i tell he not at all once the necessary phrase about the depart minister be over the piano be open music litter about she be fond of music and she admire very much a portrait of father as a boy in the harrow dress ask who it be and what the dress be she be a perfect woman of the world and no one be uncomfortable it seem quite strange and very pleasant to take up my old life again after two year of public life w breakfast at home go to the senate every day and to the institute on friday and we dine with we friend and have small dinner in we own house instead of official banquet at all the ministry -lrb- usually from potel and chabot at so much a head -rrb- politics be very lively all summer the chamber be dissolve almost at once after the constitution of the new cabinet preside over by the duc de broglie it be evident from the first moment that the new ministry would not could not live -lrb- the duc de broglie be quite aware of the fact he first word on take office be : on nous a jetés à l'eau maintenant il faut nager -rrb- he make a very good fight but he have that worst of all fault for a leader he be unpopular he be a brilliant culture speaker but have a curt dictatorial manner with a air always of look down upon he public so different from he colleague the duc décazes whose charming courteous manners and nice blue eye make he friend even among he adversary there be a well-known story tell of the two duke which show exactly the personality of the man some one a deputy i think want something very much which either of the gentleman could give he go first to the duc décazes then minister of foreign affair who receive he charmingly be most kind and courteous but do not do what the man want he then go to the duc de broglie président du conseil who be busy receive he very curtly cut short he explanation and be in fact extremely disagreeable but do the thing and the man love décazes and hate de broglie all sort of rumor be afloat we use to hear the wildest story and plan one day w come in look rather preoccupy there be a idea that the right be go to take most stringent measure arrest all the minister member of jule simon 's cabinet many of the prominent liberal he say it be quite possible and then give I various instruction i be above all to make no fuss if they really come to arrest he he show I where all he key papers and money be tell I to go instantly to he uncle mr lutteroth who live next door he be a old diplomat know everybody and would give I very good advice i do not feel very happy but like so many thing that be foretell nothing ever happen another rumor from the extreme left this time be that a large armed force under the command of a well-known general very high up in he career be to assemble in the north at lille a strong contingent of republican be to join they to be ready to act i remember quite well two of w 's friend come in one morning full of enthusiasm for this plan i do not think they quite know what they be go to do with they army w certainly do not he listen to all the detail of the plan they give he the name of the general suppose to have very republican sympathy -lrb- not generally the case with officer -rrb- the number of regiment etc who would march at a give signal but when he say it be possible you might get a certain number of man together but what would you do with they they be rather nonplussed they have not get any further than a grand patriotic demonstration with the military drum beat flag fly and the marseillaise be howl by a excited crowd no such extreme measure however be ever carry out from the first moment it be evident that a large republican majority would be return almost all the former deputy be re-elected and a number of new one more advance in they opinion in the country it be the only topic of conversation parliament be dissolve in June 1877 but we remain in town until the end of July it be not very warm and many people remain until the end of the session the big school too only break up on the 15th of July and many parent remain in paris the republican campaign have already begin and there be numerous little dinner and meeting when plan and possibility be discuss w get back usually very late from versaille when he know the sit would be very late he send I word and i use to go and dine with mother but sometimes he be keep on there from hour to hour i have some long wait before we could dine and hubert the coachman use to spend hour in the courtyard of the gare st lazare wait for he master we have a big bay mare a very fast trotter which always do the train service and the two be station there sometimes from six-thirty to nine-thirty but they never seem the worse for it w though a very considerate man for he servant generally never worry at all about keep he coachman and horse wait he say the coachman be the most warmly dress man in pari always take care to be well cover and we never have fancy high-stepping horse but ordinary strong one which could wait patiently w say the talk in the chamber and in the lobby be quite wild -- every sort of extravagant proposition be make there be many conference with the duc d'audiffret-pasquier duc de broglie -- with casimir périer léon say gambetta jule ferry and freycinet -- where the best man on both side try hard to come to a agreement w go several time in August to see m thier who be settle at st germain the old statesman be as keen as ever receive every day all sort of deputation advise warn encouraging and quite confident as to the result of the election people be look to he as the next president despite he great age however he be not destine to see the triumph of he idea he die suddenly at st germain on the 3d of September w say he funeral be a remarkable sight -- thousand of people follow the cortège -- all pari show a last respect to the libérateur du territoire -lrb- though there be still club where he be speak of as le sinistre vieillard -rrb- in August w go to he conseil-général at laon and i go down to my brother-in-law 's place at st léger near rouen we be a very happy cosmopolitan family-party my mother-in-law be bear a scotch-woman -lrb- chisholm -rrb- she be a fine type of the old-fashioned cultivate lady with a charming polite manner keenly interested in all that be go on in the world she be a old lady when i marry and have outlive almost all she contemporary but she have a beautiful old age surround by child and grandchild she have live through many vicissitude from the time of she marriage when she arrive at the château of st remy in the department of eure-et-loire -lrb- where my husband she eldest son be bear -rrb- pass through triumphal arch erect in honor of the young bride to the last day when the fortune of the family be diminish by revolution and political and business crisis in france they move from st remy sell the château and build a house on the top of a green hill near rouen quite shut in by big tree and with a lovely view from the rond point -- the highest part of the garden over rouen -- with the spire of the cathedral in the distance i use to find she every morning when i go to she room sit at the window she book and knit on a table near -- look down on the lawn and the steep wind path that come up from the garden -- where she have see three generation of she dear one pass every day -- first she husband then she son -- now she grandson my sister-in-law r 's wife be also a englishwoman the daughter of the house have marry she cousin de bunsen who have be a german diplomatist and who have make nearly all he career in italy at the most interesting period of she history when she be struggle for emancipation from the austrian rule and independence i be a american quite a new element in the family circle we have many and most animated discussion over all sort of subject in two or three language at the tea-table under the big tree on the lawn french and english be always go and often german as de bunsen always speak to he daughter in german my mother-in-law who know three or four language do not at all approve of the careless habit we have all get into of mix we language and use french or italian word when we be speak english -- if they come more easily she make a rule that we should use only one language at meal -- she do not care which one but we must keep to it my brother-in-law be stand for the deputation we do not see much of he in the daytime -- he elector and he visit and speech and banquet de pompier take up all he time the beginning of he career have be very different he be educate in england -- rugby and woolwich -- and serve several year in the royal artillery in the british army he military training be very useful to he during the franco-prussian war when he equip and command a field battery make all the campaign he english brother officer always remember he many time when we be live in england at the embassy i be ask about he a curious thing happen in the house of lord one day show the wonderful memory of prince for face r be stay with we for a few day when the annual debate over the bill for marriage of a deceased wife 's sister come up the prince of wale -lrb- late king edward -rrb- and all the other prince be present in the house r be there too stand where all the stranger do at the entrance of the lobby when the debate be over the prince of wale leave as he pass along he shake hand with several gentleman also stand near the lobby include r he stop a moment in front of he say : i think this be mr waddington the last time i see you you wear she majesty 's uniform he have not see he for twenty-five or thirty year i ask the prince afterward how he recognize he he say he do not know it be perhaps notice a unfamiliar face in the group of man stand there -- and something recall he brother the ambassador in September we go down to bourneville and settle ourselves there for the autumn w be stand for the senate with the count de st vallier and henrus martin they all prefer be name in they department where everybody know they and they personal influence could make itself more easily feel w 's campaign be not very arduous all the people know he and like he -- know that he would do whatever he promise they program be absolutely republican but moderate and he only make a few speech and go about the country a little i often go with he when he ride and some of we visit to the farmer and local authority be amusing if not encourage we be always very well receive but it be not easy to find out what they really think -lrb- if they do think about it at all -rrb- of the state of affair the small landowner particularly the man who have one field and a garden be very reserve they listen attentively enough to all w have to say he be never long never personal and never abuse he adversary but they rarely express a opinion they almost always turn the conversation upon some local matter or petty grievance it do not seem to I that they take the slightest interest in the extraordinary change that be go on in france a great many people come to see w and there would be a curious collection sometimes in he library at the end of the day the doctor -lrb- who always have precise information -- country doctor always have -- they see a great many people and i fancy the woman talk to they and tell they what they man be do -rrb- one or two farmer some schoolmaster the mayor of the nearest village the captain of the fireman and of the archer -lrb- they still shoot with bow and arrow in we part of the country every Sunday the man practice shooting at a target -rrb- -- the gendarme very useful these too to bring news -- the notary and occasionally a sous-préfet but then he be a personage represent the government and be treat with more ceremony than the other visitor it be evident from all these source that the republican be come to the front en masse the republican -lrb- for once -rrb- be marvellously discipline and keep together it be really wonderful when one thought of all the different element that be represent in the party there be quite as much difference between the quiet moderate man of the left center and the extreme left as there be between the legitimist and any faction of the republican party there be a strong feeling among the liberal that they be be coerce that arbitrary measure perhaps a coup d'état would be spring upon they and they be quite determine to resist i do not think there be ever any danger of a coup d'état at least as long as marshal macmahon be the chief of state he be a fine honorable patriotic soldier utterly incapable of a illegality of any kind he do not like the republic honestly think it would never succeed with the republican -lrb- la république san républicains be for he its only chance -rrb- -- and he certainly have illusion and think he friend and adviser would succeed in make and keep a firm conservative government how far that illusion be share by he entourage it be difficult to say they fight they battle well -- government pressure exercise in all way préfets and sous-préfets change wonderful prospects of little work and high pay hold out to doubtful elector and the same bright illusive promise make to the mass which all party make in all election and which the people believe each time the republican be not idle either and many fiery patriotic speech be make or they side gambetta always hold he public with he passionate earnest declamation and he famous phrase that the marshal must se soumettre ou se démettre become a password all through the country v a republican victory and a new ministry the election take place in october-november 1877 and give at once a great republican majority w and he two colleague count de st vallier and henrus martin have a easy victory but a great many of they personal friend moderate be beat the centre be decidedly weaker in the new chamber there be not much hope left of unite the two centre droite et gauche in the famous fusion which have be a dream of the moderate man the new chamber assemble at versaille in November the broglie cabinet be out but a new ministry of the right face the new parliament they life be very short and stormy they be really dead before they begin to exist and in December the marshal send for m dufaure and charge he to form a ministère de gauche none of he personal friend except general borel at the war office be in the new combination w be name to the foreign office i be rather disappoint when he come home and tell I he have accept that portfolio i think he old ministry public instruction suit he so well the work interested he be entirely to he taste he know all the literary and educational world not only in france but everywhere else -- england of course where he have keep up with many of he cambridge comrade and germany where he also have literary connection however that wide acquaintance and he perfect knowledge of english and english people help he very much at once not only at the quaus d'orsay but in all the year he be in england as ambassador the new ministry with dufaure as president of the council léon say at the finances m de freycinet at public work and w at the foreign office be announce the 14th of December 1877 the preliminary have be long and difficult -- the marshal and he friend on one side -- the republican and gambetta on the other -- the moderate try to keep thing together personally i be rather sorry w have agree to be a member of the cabinet i be not very keen about official life and foresee a great deal that would be disagreeable politics play such a part in social life all the society the faubourg st germain -lrb- which represent the old name and title of france -rrb- be violently oppose to the republic i be astonish the first year of my married life in france to see people of certain position and standing give the cold shoulder to man they have know all they life because they be republican know they quite well to be honorable independent gentleman want nothing from the republic -- merely try to do they best for the country i only realize by degree that people hold off a little from I sometimes as the wife of a republican deputy i do not care particularly as i have never live in france and know very few people but it do not make social relation very pleasant and i should have be better pleased if w have take no active part however that feeling be only temporary i soon become keenly interested in politics -lrb- i suppose it be in the blood -- all the man in my family in america be politician -rrb- and in the discussion of the various question which be rapidly change france into something quite different whether the change have be for the better it would be hard to say even now after more than thirty-five year of the republic freycinet be a great strength he be absolutely republican but moderate -- very clever and energetic a great friend of gambetta 's -- and a beautiful speaker i have hear man say who do not care about he particularly and who be not at all of he way of think that they would rather not discuss with he he be sure to win they over to he cause with he wonderful clear persuasive argument -lrb- illustration : palace of the minister of foreign affair pari -rrb- the first day be very busy one w have to see all he staff -lrb- a very large one -rrb- of the foreign office and organise he own cabinet he be out all day until late in the evening at the quaus d'orsay use to go over there about ten or ten-thirty breakfast there and get back for a very late dinner and always have a director or secretary work with he at we own house after dinner i go over three or four time to inspect the ministry as i have a presentiment we should end by live there the house be large and handsome with a fine staircase and large high room the furniture of course be ministerial -- stiff and heavy -- gold-backed chair and sofa stand in row against the wall there be some good picture among other the congrès de paris which occupy a prominent place in one of the salon and splendid tapestry the most attractive thing be a fine large garden at the back but as the living-room be up-stair we do not use it very much the lower room which open on the garden be only use as reception-room the minister 's cabinet be also down-stairs communicate by a small staircase with he bedroom just overhead the front of the house look on the seine we have always a charming view from the window at night particularly when all the little steamer -lrb- mouch -rrb- be pass with they light i have of course to make acquaintance with all the diplomatic corps i know all the ambassador and most of the minister but there be some representative of the smaller power and south american republic with whom i have never come in contact again i pay a formal official visit to the maréchale de macmahon as soon as the ministry be announce she be perfectly polite and correct but one feel at once she have not the slightest sympathy for anything republican and we never get to know each other any better all the month we be throw together we remain for several week at we own house and then most reluctantly determine to install ourselves at the ministry w work always very late after dinner and he feel it be not possible to ask he director all important man of a certain age to come up to the quartier de l'etoile at ten o'clock and keep they busy until midnight w 's new chef de cabinet comte de pontécoulant be very anxious that we should move think everything would be simplify if w be live over there i have never know pontécoulant until w choose he as he chef de cabinet he be a diplomatist with some year of service behind he and be perfectly au courant of all the routine and habit of the foreign office he pay I a short formal visit soon after he have accept the post we exchange a few remark about the situation i hope we would faire bon ménage and have no particular impression of he except that he be very french and stiff i do not suppose i should see much of he it seem curious now to look back upon that first interview we all become so fond of he he be a loyal faithful friend be always ready to help I in any small difficulty and i go to he for everything -- visit servant horse etc w have no time for any detail or amenity of life we move over just before new year 's day as the gro mobilier be already there we only take over personal thing grand piano screen table easy chair and small ornament and bibelot these be all send off in a van early one morning and after luncheon i go over have give rendezvous to pontécoulant and m kruft chef du matériel a excellent intelligent man who be most useful and devoted to I the two year i live at the ministry i be very depress when we drive into the courtyard i have never live on that side of the river and feel cut off from all my belongings -- the bridge a terror so cold in winter so hot in summer -- i never get accustom to it never cross it on foot the sight of the great empty room do not reassure I the reception-room of course be very handsome there be a great many servant huissier and footman stand about and people wait in the big drawing-room to speak to w the living-rooms up-stair be ghastly -- look bare and uncomfortable in the highest degree they be large and high and look down upon the garden though that on a bleak December day be not very cheerful -- but there be possibility kruft be very sympathetic understand quite well how i feel and be ready to do anything in the way of stove bath wardrobe in the lingerie new carpet and curtain that i want pontécoulant too be eminently practical and i be quite amuse to find myself discuss lingerie and bathroom with a total stranger whom i have only see twice in my life it take I about a week to get really settle i go over every day return to my own house to eat and sleep kruft do wonder the place be quite transform when i finally move over the room look very bright and comfortable when we arrive in the afternoon of the 31st of December -lrb- new year 's eve -rrb- the little end salon which i make my boudoir be hang with blue satin my piano screen and little thing be very well place -- plenty of palm and flower bright fire everywhere -- the bedroom nursery and lingerie clean and bright my bedroom open on a large salon where i receive usually keep my boudoir for ourselves and we intimate friend my special huissier gérard who sit all day outside of the salon door be present to I and instantly become a most useful and important member of the household -- never forget a name or a face remember what card and note i have receive whether the note be answer or the bill pay know almost all my wardrobe would bring I down a coat or a wrap if i want one suddenly down-stairs i have frequent consultation with pontécoulant and kruft to regulate all the detail of the various service before we be quite settle we take over all we own servant and find many other who be on the permanent staff of the ministry footman huissier and odd man who attend to all the fire open and shut all the door window and shutter it be rather difficult to organise the regular work service there be such rivalry between we own personal servant and the man who belong to the house but after a little while thing go pretty smoothly w dine out the first night we sleep at the quaus d'orsay and about a hour after we have arrive while i be still walk about in my hat and coat feeling very strange in the big high room i be tell that the lampiste be wait my order -lrb- a few lamp have be light in some of the room -rrb- i do not quite know what order to give have not master yet the number that would be require but i send for he say i should be alone for dinner perhaps one or two lamp in the dining-room and small salon would be enough he evidently think that be not at all sufficient want something more precise so i say to light as he have be accustom to when the duc décazes and he family be dine alone -lrb- which i do not suppose they ever do nor we either when we once take up we life -rrb- such a blaze of light meet my eye when i go to dinner that i be quite bewildered -- boudoir billiard-room dining-room -lrb- very large the small round table for one person hardly perceptible -rrb- and corridor all light à giorno however it look very cheerful and keep I from feel too dreadfully homesick for my own house and familiar surroundings the room be so high up that we do not hear the noise of the street but the river look alive and friendly with the light on the bridge and a few boat still run we have much more receive and entertain to do at the quaus d'orsay than at any other ministry and be oblige to go out much more ourselves the season in the official world begin with a reception at the president 's on new year 's day the diplomatic corps and president of the senate and chamber go in state to the elysée to pay they respects to the chief of state -- the ambassador with all they staff in uniform in gala carriage it be a pretty sight and there be always a good many people wait in the faubourg st honoré to see the carriage the english carriage be always the best they understand all the detail of harness and livery so much better than any one else the marshal and he family be establish at the elysée it be not possible for he to remain at versaille -- he could not be so far from paris where all sort of question be come up every day and he be oblige to receive deputation and report and see people of all kind they be already agitate the question of the parliament come back to pari the deputy generally be complain of the loss of time and the discomfort of the daily journey even in the parliamentary train the right generally be very much oppose to have the chamber back in paris i never could understand why i suppose they be afraid that a stormy sit might lead to disturbance in the street of a big city there be always a float population ready to espouse violently any cause at versaille one be away from any such danger and except immediately around the palace there be nobody in the long desert avenue they often cite the united state how no statesman after the signing of the declaration of independence -lrb- in philadelphium -rrb- would have venture to propose that the parliament should sit in new york or philadelphium but the reason there be very different they be oblige to make a neutral zone something between the north and the south the district of columbium be a thing apart belong to neither side it have certainly work very well in america washington be a fine city with its splendid old tree and broad avenue it have a cachet of its own be unlike any other city i know in the world the marshal receive at the elysée every Thursday evening -- he and he staff in uniform also all the officer who come which make a brilliant gather they big dinner and reception be always extremely well do except a few of they personal friend not many people of society be present -- the diplomatic corps usually very well represent the government and they wife and a certain number of liberal deputy -- a great many officer we receive every fifteen day begin with a big dinner it be a open reception announce in the papers the diplomat always muster very strong also the parliament -- not many woman many of the deputy remain in the country take room merely while the chamber be sit and they wife never appear in pari society do not come to we much either except on certain occasion when we have a royal prince or some very distinguished foreigner besides the big official reception we often have small dinner up-stair during the week some of these i look back to with much pleasure i be generally the only lady with eight or ten man and the talk be often brilliant some of we habitués be the late lord houghton a delightful talker lord dufferin then ambassador in st petersburg sir henry layard british ambassador in spain a interesting man who have be everywhere and see and know everybody worth know in the world count schouvaloff russian ambassador in london a polished courtier extremely intelligent he and w be colleague afterward at the congrès de berlin and w have often tell I how brilliantly he defend he cause general ignatieff prince orloff the nunzio monsignor czasckus quite charming the type of the prélat mondain very large -lrb- though very catholic -rrb- in he idea but never aggressive or disagreeable about the republic as so many of the clergy be he be very fond of music and go with I sometimes to the conservatoire on Sunday he have a great admiration for the way they play classical music use to lean back in he chair in a corner -lrb- would never sit in front of the box -rrb- and drink in every sound we sometimes have informal music in my little blue salon baron de zuylen dutch minister be a excellent musician also comte de beust the austrian ambassador he be a composer i remember he play I one day a wedding march he have compose for the marriage of one of the archduke it be very descriptive with bell cannon hurrah and a nuptial hymn -- rather difficult to render on a piano -- but there be a certain amount of imagination in the composition the two come often with I to the conservatoire comte de beust bring liszt to I one day i want so much to see that complex character make up of enthusiasm of all kind patriotic religious musical he be dress in the ordinary black priestly garb look like a ascetic with pale thin face which light up very much when discuss any subject that interest he he do not say a word about music either then or on a subsequent occasion when i lunch with he at the house of a great friend and admirer who be a beautiful musician i hope he would play after luncheon he be a very old man and play rarely in those day but one would have like to hear he madame m think he would perhaps for she if the party be not too large and the guest sympathetic to he i have hear so many artist say it make all the difference to they when they feel the public be with they -- if there be one unsympathetic or criticising face in the mass of people it be the only face they could distinguish and it affect they very much the piano be engagingly open and music litter about but he apparently do not see it he talk politics and a good deal about picture with some artist who be present -lrb- illustration : franz liszt -rrb- i do hear he play many year later in london we be again lunch together at the house of a mutual friend who be not at all musical there be not even a piano in the house but she have one bring in for the occasion when i arrive rather early the day of the party i find the mistress of the house aid by count hatzfeldt then german ambassador to england busily engage in transform she drawing-room the grand piano which have be stand well out toward the middle of the room open with music on it -lrb- i dare say some of liszt 's own -- but i do not have time to examine -rrb- be be push back into a corner all the music hide away and the instrument cover with photograph vase of flower statuette heavy book all the thing one do not habitually put on piano i be quite puzzle but hatzfeldt who be a great friend of liszt 's and know all he peculiarity when consult by madame a as to what she could do to induce liszt to play have answer : begin by put the piano in the furthest darkest corner of the room and put all sort of heavy thing on it then he will not think you have ask he in the hope of hear he play and perhaps we can persuade he the arrangement be just finish as the rest of the company arrive we be not a large party and the talk be pleasant enough liszt look much older so colourless he skin like ivory but he seem just as animated and interested in everything after luncheon when they be smoking -lrb- all of we together no one go into the smoking-room -rrb- he and hatzfeldt begin talk about the empire and the beautiful fêtes at compiègne where anybody of any distinction in any branch of art or literature be invite hatzfeldt lead the conversation to some evening when strauss play he waltz with a entrain a sentiment that no one else have ever attain and to offenbach and he melody -- one evening particularly when he have improvise a song for the empress -- he could not quite remember it if there be a piano -- he look about there be none apparently oh yes in a corner but so many thing upon it it be evidently never mean to be open he move toward it liszt follow ask comtesse a if it could be open the thing be quickly remove hatzfeldt sit down and play a few bar in rather a halting fashion after a moment liszt say : no no it be not quite that hatzfeldt get up liszt seat himself at the piano play two or three bit of song or waltz then always talk to hatzfeldt let he finger wander over the key and by degree break into a nocturne and a wild hungarian march it be very curious he finger look as if they be make of yellow ivory so thin and long and of course there be not any strength or execution in he playing -- it be the touch of a old man but a master -- quite unlike anything i have ever hear when he get up he say : oh well i do not think the old finger have any music leave in they we try to thank he but he would not listen to we immediately talk about something else when he have go we compliment the ambassador on the way in which he have manage the thing hatzfeldt be a charming colleague very clever very musical a thorough man of the world i be always please when he be next to I at dinner -- i be sure of a pleasant hour he have be many year in pari during the brilliant day of the empire know everybody there worth know he have the reputation notwithstanding he long stay in pari of be very anti-french i could hardly judge of that as he never talk politics to I it may very likely have be true but not more marked with he than with the generality of anglo-saxon and northern race who rather look down upon the latin hardly give they credit for they splendid dash and pluck -- to say nothing of they brain i have live in a great many country and always think that as a people i mean the uneducated mass the french be the most intelligent nation in the world i have never be throw with the japanese -- be tell they be extraordinarily intelligent we have a dinner one night for mr gladstone he wife and a daughter mr gladstone make himself quite charming speak french fairly well and know more about every subject discuss than any one else in the room he be certainly a wonderful man such extraordinary versatility and such a memory it be rather pretty to see mr gladstone when she husband be talk she be quite absorb by he could not talk to she neighbor they want very much to go to the conciergerie to see the prison where the unfortunate marie antoinette pass the last day of she unhappy life and mr gladstone inspire by the subject make we a sort of conférence on the french revolution and the cause which lead up to it culminate in the terror and the execution of the king and queen he speak in english -lrb- we be a little group standing at the door -- they be just go -rrb- in beautiful academic language and it be most interesting graphic and exact even w who know he well and admire he immensely be strike by he brilliant improvisation -lrb- illustration : william e gladstone from a photograph by samuel a walker london -rrb- we be often ask for permit by we english and american friend to see all the place of historical interest in pari and the two place which all want to see be the conciergerie and napoleon 's tomb at the invalide when we first come to pari in 1866 just after the end of the long struggle between the north and south in america we first visit too be for the conciergerie invalide and notre dame where my father have not be since he have go as a very young man with all pari to see the flag that have be bring back from austerlitz they be interesting day those first one in paris so full of memory for father who have be there a great deal in he young day first as a élève in the ecole polytechnique later when the ally be in paris he take we one day to the luxembourg garden to see if he could find any trace of the spot where in 1815 during the restoration marshal ney have be shoot he be in pari at the time and be in the garden a few hour after the execution -- remembered quite well the wall against which the marshal stand -- and the comment of the crowd not very flattering for the government in execute one of france 's bravest and most brilliant soldier all the american who come to see we at the quaus d'orsay be much interested in everything relate to général marquis de lafayette who leave a undying memory in america and many pilgrimage be make to the château de la grange where the marquis de lafayette spend the last year of he life and extend a large and gracious hospitality to all he friend it be a interesting old place with a moat all around it and high solid stone wall where one still see the hole that be make in the wall by a cannon-ball send by maréchal de turenne as he be pass with he troops as a friendly souvenir to the owner with whom he be not on good term so many american and english too be imbue with the idea that there be no châteaux no country life in france that i be delighted when they can see that there be just as many as in any other country a very clever american writer whose book have be much read and admire say that when travel in france in the country he never see any sign of wealth or gentleman 's property i think he do not want to admire anything french but i wonder in what part of france he have travel besides the well-known historic châteaux of chaumont chenonceaux azay-le-rideau maintenon dampierre josselin valençay and score of other there be quantity of small loui xv châteaux and manoir half hide in a corner of a forest which the stranger never see they be quite charming build of red brick with white coping with stiff old-fashioned garden and tree cut into all sort of fantastic shape sometimes the parish church touch the castle on one side and there be a private entrance for the seigneur the interior arrangement in some of the old one leave much to be desire in the way of comfort and modern improvement -- light very bad neither gas nor electricity and i should think no bath anywhere hardly a tub on the bank of the seine and the loire near the great forest in all the department near pari there be quantity of châteaux -- some just on the border of the highroad separate from it by high iron gate through which one see long wind alley with stone bench and vase with red geranium plant in they a sun-dial and stiff formal row of tree -- some less pretentious with merely a ordinary wooden gate generally open and always flower of the simplest kind geranium sunflower pink dahlia and chrysanthemum -- what we call a jardin de curé -lrb- curate 's garden -rrb- -- but in great abundance with very rare exception the lawn be not well keep -- one never see in this country the smooth green turf that one do in england some of the old châteaux be very stately -- sometimes one enter by a large quadrangle quite surround by low arcade cover with ivy a fountain and good-sized basin in the middle of the courtyard and a big clock over the door -- sometimes they stand in a moat one go over a drawbridge with massive door stud with iron nail and strong iron bolt and chain which defend the entrance make one think of old feudal day when might be right and if a man want he neighbor property he simply take it even some of the smaller châteaux have moat i think they be more picturesque than comfortable -- a ivy-covered house with a moat around it be a nest for mosquito and insect of all kind and i fancy the damp from the water must finish by pervade the house french people of all class love the country and a garden with bright flower and if the poorer one can combine a rabbit hutch with the flower they be quite happy i have hear w speak sometimes of a fine old château in we department -- -lrb- aisne -rrb- belong to a deputy who invite he friend to shoot and breakfast the cuisine and shooting be excellent but the accommodation fantastic the neighbor say nothing have be renew or clean since the château be occupy by the cossack under the first napoleon we get very little country life during those year at the foreign office twice a year in April and August w go to laon for he conseil-général over which he preside but he be rarely able to stay all through the session he be always present on the opening day and at the préfet 's dinner and take that opportunity to make a short speech explain the foreign policy of the government i do not think it interested he colleague as much as all the local question -- road school etc it be astonishing how much time be waste and how much letter-writing be necessitate by the simplest change in a road or railway cross in france we have rather a short narrow turn to get into we gate at bourneville and w want to have the road enlarged just a little so as to avoid the sharp angle it do not interfere with any one as we be several yard from the highroad but it be month more than a year before the thing be do any one of the workman on the farm would have finish it in a day 's work at one of we small dinner i have such a characteristic answer from a english diplomatist who have be ambassador at st petersburg he be really a charming talker but would not speak french that be of no consequence as long as he only talk to I but naturally all the people at the table want to talk to he and when the general conversation languish at last i say to he : i wish you would speak french none of these gentleman speak any other language -lrb- it be quite true the man of my husband 's age speak very rarely any other language but they own now almost all the younger generation speak german or english or both almost all my son 's friend speak english perfectly -rrb- oh no i can not he say i have not enough the habit of speak french i do not say the thing i want to say only the thing i can say which be very different but what do you do in russium all the woman speak english but for affair diplomatic negotiation all the woman speak english i have often hear it say that the russian woman be much more clever than the man he evidently have find it true vi the exposition year the big political dinner be always interesting on one occasion we have a banquet on the 2d of December my left-hand neighbor a senator say to I casually : this room look very different from what it do the last time i be in it do it i should have think a big official dinner at the foreign office would have be precisely the same under any régime a dinner perhaps but on that occasion we be not precisely dine i and a number of my friend have just be arrest and we be wait here in this room strictly guard until it be decide what should be do with we then i remember that it be the 2d of December the anniversary of loui napoléon 's coup d'état he say they be quite unprepared for it in spite of warning he be send out of the country for a little while but i do not think he exile be a very terrible one i get my first lesson in diplomatic politeness from lord lyon then british ambassador in paris he be in pari during the franco-german war know everybody and have a great position he give very handsome dinner like he guest to be punctual be very punctual himself always arrive on the stroke of eight when he dine with we we have a annamite mission to dine one night and have invite almost all the ambassador and minister to meet they there have be a stormy sit at the chamber and w be late as soon as i be ready i go to he library and wait for he i could not go down and receive a foreign mission without he we be quite seven or eight minute late and find all the company assemble -lrb- except the annamite who be wait with they interpreter in another room to make they entry in proper style -rrb- as i shake hand with lord lyon -lrb- who be doyen of the diplomatic corps -rrb- he say to I : ah madame waddington i see the republic be become very royal you do not receive you guest any more merely come into the room when all the company be assemble he say it quite smilingly but i understand very well and of course we ought to have be there when the first guest arrive he be very amiable all the same and tell I a great many useful thing -- for instance that i must never invite a cardinal and a ambassador together as neither of they would yield the precedence and i would find myself in a very awkward position -lrb- illustration : lord lyon -rrb- the annamite be something awful to see in they country all the man of a certain standing blacken they tooth and i suppose the dye make they tooth fall out as they have not any apparently and when they open they mouth the black cavern one saw be terrifying i have be warn but notwithstanding it make a most disagreeable impression on I they be very richly attired particularly the first three who be très grand seigneur in annam -- heavily embroidered silk robe feather and jewel and when they do not open they mouth they be rather a decorative group -- be tall powerfully build man they know no french nor english -- speak through the interpreter my intercourse with they be very limited they be not near I at dinner but afterward i try to talk to they a little they all stand in a group at one end of the room flank by a interpreter -- the three principal chief well in front i do not know what the interpreter say to they from I probably embellish my very banal remark with flower of rhetoric but they be very smile open wide they black mouth and make I very low bow -- evidently appreciate my intention and effort to be amiable they bring we present carpet carve and inlay mother-of-pearl box cabinet and some curious saddle also gold-embroidered cushion and slipper some arab horse be announce with great pomp from the sultan 's stable i be rather interested in they think it would be amusing to drive a long-tailed arab pony in a little cart in the morning they be bring one morning to the quaus d'orsay and w give rendezvous to comte de pontécoulant and some of the sport man of the cabinet in the courtyard there be also several stableman all much interested in the idea of tame the fiery steed of the desert the first look be disappointing they be thin scraggy animal apparently all leg and mane long tail they have and small head but anything so tame and sluggish in they movement could hardly be imagine one could scarcely get they to canter around the courtyard we be all rather disgust as sometimes one see pretty little arab horse in paris i do not know what become of they i fancy they be send to the cavalry stable we first great function that winter be the service at the madeleine for the king of italy victor emmanuel who die suddenly in the beginning of January 1878 france send a special mission to the funeral -- the old marshal canrobert who take with he the marshal 's son fabrice de macmahon the church of the madeleine be fill with people of all kind -- the diplomatic corps in uniform a very large representation of senator and deputy there be a slight hesitation among some of the leave -- who be ardent sympathiser with young italy -- but who do not care to compromise themselves by take part in a religious ceremony however as a rule they go some of the lady of the right be rather put out at have to go in deep mourning to the service i say to one of they : but you be not correct you have a black dress certainly but i do not think pearl-grey glove be proper for such a occasion oh they express quite sufficiently the grief i feel on this occasion it be curious that the king should have go before the old pope who have be fail for some time every day we expect to hear of he death there be many speculation over the new king of italy the prince humbert of we day as we have live so many year in rome i be often ask what he be like but i really have no opinion one see he very little i remember one day in the hunting-field he get a nasty fall he horse put he foot in a hole and fall with he it look a bad accident as if the horse be go to roll over on he i with one of my friend be near and see a accident -lrb- i do not know who it be -rrb- naturally stop to see if we groom could do anything but a officer ride hurriedly up and beg we to go on that the prince would be very much annoyed if any one particularly a woman should notice he fall i see he later in the day look all right on another horse and no one make any allusion to the accident about a month after victor emmanuel 's death the old pope die the 8th of February 1878 quite suddenly at the end he be bury of course in rome and it be very difficult to arrange for he funeral in the rome of the king of italy however he do lie in state at st peter 's the noble garde in they splendid uniform stand close around the catafalque -- long line of italian soldier the bersaglierus with they wave plume on each side of the great aisle there be a magnificent service for he at notre dame the chamber raise they sit as a mark of respect to the head of the church and again there be a great attendance at the cathedral there be many discussion in the monde -lrb- society not official -rrb- as to whether one should wear mourning for the saint père i believe the correct thing be not to wear mourning but almost all the lady of the faubourg st germain go about in black garment for some time one of my friend put it rather graphically : si on a un ruban rise dans les cheveux on a tout de suite l'air d'être la maîtresse de rochefort all europe be engross with the question of the pope 's successor intrigue and undercurrent be go on hard in rome and the issue of the conclave be impatiently await no one could predict any result the election of cardinal peccus future leo xiii seem satisfactory at least in the begin my winter pass pleasantly enough i begin to feel more at home in my new quarter and see many interesting people of all kind every now and then there would be a very lively debate in the parliament w would come home very late say thing could not go on like that and we would surely be out of office in a few week we always keep we house in the rue dumont d'urville and i go over every week often think that in a few day we should be back there again one of my great trial be a reception day w think i ought to have one so every Friday i be at home from three until six and very long afternoon they be i insist upon have a tea-table which be a novelty in those day but it break the stiff semicircle of red and gold armchair carefully arrange at one end of the room very few man take tea it be rather amusing to see some of the deputy who do not exactly like to refuse a cup of tea offer to they by the minister 's wife hold the cup and saucer most carefully in they hand make a pretence of sip the tea and replace it hastily on the table as soon as it be possible i have of course a great many people of different nationality who generally do not know each other the ambassadress and minister ' wife sit on each side of my sofa -- the smaller people lower down they be all announce my huissier gérard do it very well open the big door and roar out the name sometimes at the end of the day some of my own friend or some of the young man from the chancery would come in and that would cheer I up a little there be no conversation merely a exchange of formal phrase but i have some funny experience one day i have several lady whom i do not know at all wife of deputy or small functionary at some of the ministry one of my friend comtesse de b be start for italy and rome for the first time she have come to ask I all sort of question about clothes hotel people to see etc when she go away in a whirl of preparation and address i turn to one of my neighbor say : je crois qu'on est très bien à l'hôtel de londres à rome quite a insignificant and inoffensive remark -- merely to say something she reply haughtily : je n'en sais rien madame je n'ai jamais quitté paris et je m ` en vante i be so astonished that i have nothing to say but be afterward sorry that i have not continue the conversation and ask she why she be so especially proud of never have leave paris travel be usually suppose to enlarge one 's idea she answer might have be interesting w would not believe it when i tell he but i say i could not really have invent it i use to go into he cabinet at the end of the day always when he be alone with pontécoulant and tell they all my experience which w forbid I to mention anywhere else i have a good many surprise but soon learn never to be astonished and to take everything as a matter of course the great interest of the summer be the exposition universelle which be to take place at the trocadéro the new building which have be build on the champ de mar the opening be announce for the 1st of may and be to be perform with great pomp by the marshal all europe be represent except germany and almost all the great power be send prince to represent they country we go often to see how the work be get on and i must say it do not look as if it could possibly be ready for the 1st of may there be army of workman in every direction and cart and camion load with case make they way with difficulty through the mud occasionally a light case or bale would fall off and quantity of small boy who seem always on the spot would precipitate themselves tumble over each other to pick up what fall and there would be protestation and explanation in every language under the sun it be a motley picturesque crowd -- the costume and uniform make so much color in the midst of the very ordinary dark clothes the civilised western world affect i feel sorry for the oriental and people from milder clime -- they look so miserably cold and wretched shiver under the very fresh April breeze that sweep over the great plain of the champ de mar the machine particularly the american one attract great attention there be always a crowd wait when some of the large piece be swing down into they place by enormous pulley the opening ceremony be very brilliant happily it be a beautiful warm day as all the guest invite by the marshal and the government be seat on a platform outside the trocadéro building all the diplomatic corps foreign royalty and commissioner of the different nation who be take part in the exposition be invite the view be lovely as we look down from we seat the great enclosure be pack with people all the pavilion look very gay with bright-coloured wall and turret and there be flag palm flower and fountain everywhere -- the seine run through the middle with fanciful bridge and boat there be a curious collection of people in the tribune the invitation have not be very easy to make there be three spanish sovereign queen isabellum she husband don françois d'assize and the duc d'aosta -lrb- king amadée -rrb- who have reign a few stormy month in spain he have come to represent italy at the exposition the marshal be rather preoccupy with he spanish royalty he have a reception in the evening to which all be invite and think it would be wise to take certain precaution so he send one of he aide-de-camp to queen isabellum to say that he hope to have the honor of see she in the evening at the elysée but he think it right to tell she that she might perhaps have some disagreeable meeting she reply : si c'est mon mari de qui vous parlez cela m ` est tout à fait égal si c'est le duc d'aosta je serai ravie de le voir she come to the reception but she husband be already go the due d'aosta be still there and she walk straight up to he and kiss he on both cheek not a easy thing to do for the duke be not at all the type of the gay lady 's man -- very much the reverse he look a soldier -lrb- like all the prince of the house of savoy -rrb- and at the same time a monk one could easily imagine he a crusader in plumed helmet and breastplate support any privation or fatigue without a murmur he be very shy -lrb- one see it be a effort for he every time that any one be bring up to he and he have to make polite phrase -rrb- not in the least mondain but simple charming when one talk to he i see he often afterward as he represent he brother king humbert on various official occasion when i too be present -- the coronation of the emperor alexander of russium the jubilee of queen victorium he be always a striking figure do not look as if he belong to we modern world at all the marshal have a series of dinner and reception which be most brilliant there be almost always music or theatricals with the best artist in paris the comédie française be much appreciate they style be so finished and sure they play just as well at one end of a drawing-room with a rampe of flower only separate they from the public as in they own theater with all the help of scenery acoustic and distance in a drawing-room naturally the audience be much nearer i remember one charming party at the elysée for the austrian crown prince the unfortunate archduke rudolph all the star of the théâtre français be play -- croizette reichemberg delaunay coquelin the prince seem to enjoy himself he be very good-looking with a slight elegant figure and charming smile -- do not look like a man whose life would end so tragically when i see he some year later in london he be change look older have lose he gaiety be evidently bore with the official entertaining and use to escape from all the dinner and reception as soon as he could the late king edward -lrb- then prince of wale -rrb- win golden opinion always there be certainly something in he personality which have a enormous attraction for parisian he always seem to enjoy life never look bore be unfailingly courteous and interested in the people he be talk to it be a joy to the french people to see he at some of the small theater amusing himself and understand all the sous-entendus and argot quite as well as they do it would almost seem as if what some one say be true that he remind they of they beloved henrus iv who still live in the heart of the nation he brother-in-law the prince of denmark be also most amiable we meet he often walk about the street with one or two of he gentleman and look in at the window like a ordinary provincial he be tall with a slight youthful figure and be always recognize it be a great satisfaction and pride to parisian to have so many royalty and distinguished people among they again those two month of may and June give back to pari the animation and gaiety of the last day of the empire there be many handsome carriage on the champs-elysées fill with pretty well-dressed woman and the opera and all the theater be pack paris be illuminate the night of the opening of the exposition the whole city not merely the champs-elysées and boulevard as we drive across the bridge on we way home from the reception at the elysée it be a beautiful sight -- the street full of people wait to see the foreign royalty pass and the view up and down the seine with the light from the high building reflect in the water -- like fairy-land -lrb- illustration : he royal highness edward prince of wale in 1876 from a photograph by lock & whitfield london -rrb- the dinner and reception at the elysée and at all the ministry those first week of the exposition be interesting but so fatiguing happily there be not many lunch nor day entertainment i use to get a good drive every afternoon in the open carriage with mother and baby and that keep I alive occasionally -lrb- not often -rrb- w have a man 's dinner and then i could go with some of my friend and dine at the exposition which be very amusing -- such a curious collection of people the rue des nation be like a gigantic fair we meet all we friend and hear every language under the sun among other distinguished foreign guest that year we have president and mr grant who be receive everywhere in europe -lrb- england give the example -rrb- like royalty when they dine with we at the quaus d'orsay w and i go to the top of the great staircase to meet they exactly as we do for the prince and princess of wale it seem funny to I when i think of the very unceremonious manner in which not only ex-president but actual president be treat in america when i be a child i remember quite well see a president -lrb- i have forget which one now -rrb- come into the big drawing-room at the old cozzen 's hotel at west point with two or three gentleman with he there be a certain number of people in the room and nobody move or dream of get up however the grant be very simple -- accept all the honor show to they without a pose of any kind the marshal give they a big dinner at the elysée we arrive a little late -lrb- we always do -rrb- and find a large party assemble the grant come in just after we the maréchale say to I : the chinese ambassador will take you to dinner madame waddington he be a interesting clever man know england and the english well -- speak english remarkably well just before dinner be announce the ambassador be bring up to I he be a striking-looking man tall broad-shouldered dignified very gorgeously attire in light-blue satin embroidered in bright-coloured flower and gold and silver design and a splendid yellow bird of paradise in he cap he do not come quite up to I make I a low bow from a certain distance and then fall back into a group of smaller satellite all very splendidly dress when dinner be announce the first couple file off -- the marshal with mr grant and the maréchale with president grant and w with he lady there be a pause i should have go next but my ambassador be not forthcoming i look and wonder all the aide-de-camp be make frantic signal to I to go on and the whole cortège be stop i really do not know what to do -- i feel rather foolish presently the ambassador appear -- do not offer I he arm but again make I a low bow which i return and move a few step forward he advance too and we make a stately progress to the dining-room side by side i hear afterward the explanation it seem that in those day -lrb- thing have change _ now _ i fancy -rrb- no chinese of rank would touch any woman who do not belong to he and the ambassador would have think himself dishonoured -lrb- as well as I -rrb- if he have offer I he arm the dinner be anything but banal when we finally get to the table i find myself on the marshal 's leave -- mr grant be on he right the marshal neither speak nor understand english mr grant speak no french so the conversation do not seem likely to be very animated after a few moment mr grant naturally wish to say something to she host and she address he in english mr president i be so happy to be in you beautiful country then the marshal to I : madame waddington je vous en prie dites à madame grant que je ne pui pa répondre je ne comprend pas l'anglais je ne puis pas parler avec elle mrs grant the marshal beg I to say to you that he regret not be able to talk with you but unfortunately he do not understand english then there be a pause and mr grant begin again : what a beautiful palace mr president it must be delightful with that charming garden again the marshal to I : mais je vous en prie madame dites à madame grant que je ne pui pas causer avec elle il ne faut pas qu'elle I parle je ne comprend pas mrs grant the marshal be distressed that he can not talk to you but he _ really _ do not understand any english it be very try for mr grant happily she other neighbor know a little english and she could talk to he but all through dinner at interval she begin again at the marshal after a few moment i turn my attention to my ambassador i have be look at he furtively while i be interpret for the marshal and mr grant i see that he _ take _ everything that be offer to he -- dish wine sauce -- but he never attack anything without wait to see what he neighbor do when and how they use they knife and fork -- then do exactly as they do -- never make a mistake i see he be look at the flower on the table which be very well arrange so i say to he speak very slowly and distinctly as one do to a child or a deaf person : have you pretty flower in you country he reply promptly : yes yes very hot very cold very hot very cold i be a little disconcerted but think i have perhaps speak indistinctly and after a little while i make another attempt : how much the uniform add to the brilliancy of the fête and the chinese dress be particularly striking and handsome but to that he make such a perfectly unintelligible answer that i refrain from any further conversation and merely smile at he from time to time which he always acknowledge with a little bow we go back to the salon in the same way side by side and when the man have go into one of the other room to talk and smoke i go to speak to the maréchale who say to I : i be sure you have a delightful dinner madame waddington the chinese ambassador be such a clever man have travel a great deal and speak such wonderful english wonderful indeed madame la maréchale and then i repeat we conversation which she could hardly believe and which amuse she very much she speak english as well as i do the grant be very much entertain during they stay in pari and we meet they nearly every night w like the general very much and find he quite talkative when he be alone with he at the big dinner he be of course at a disadvantage neither speaking nor understand a word of french w act as interpreter and find that very fatiguing there be so much repartee and sous-entendu in all french conversation that even foreigner who know the language well find it sometimes difficult to follow everything and to translate quickly enough to keep one au courant be almost impossible when they could they drift into english and w say he be most interesting -- speaking of the war and all the north have do without ever put himself forward we have both of we often to act as interpreter with french and anglo-saxons neither understand the other 's language and always find it difficult i remember a dinner at sandringham some year ago when w be at the embassy the prince of wale -lrb- late king edward -rrb- ask I to sit next to a foreign ambassador who understand not one word of english the dinner be exclusively english -- a great many clever man -- the master of trinity college cambridge -lrb- ask especially to meet my husband who graduate from trinity college -rrb- lord goschen jame knowle of the _ nineteenth century _ froude the historian sir henry jame lord wolseley etc the talk be very animated very witty there be peal of laughter all around the table my ambassador be very fidgety and nervous appeal to I all the time but by the time i have laboriously condensed and translate some of the remark they be talk of something quite different and i be afraid he have very hazy idea as to what they be all say we see naturally all the distinguished stranger who pass through pari that year of 1878 many of we colleague in the diplomatic corps have play a great rôle in they own country prince orloff the russian ambassador be one of we great friend he give we very good advice on one or two occasion he be a distinguished-looking man -- always wear a black patch over one eye -- he have be wound in the crimea he speak english as well as i do and be a charming talker general cialdinus be at the italian embassy he be more of a soldier than a statesman -- have contribute very successfully to the formation of unite italy and the suppression of the pope 's temporal power and be naturally not exactly persona grata to the catholic in france prince and princess hohenlohe have succeed arnim at the german embassy they beginning be difficult as they predecessor have do nothing to make the german popular in france but they strong personality tact and understanding of the very delicate position help they enormously they be catholic -lrb- the princess bear a russian -- she brother prince wittgenstein military attaché at the russian embassy -rrb- and very big people in they own country so absolutely sure of themselves and they position that it be very difficult to slight they in any way they would never have perceive it unless some extraordinary rudeness be show the princess be very striking-looking tall with a good figure and splendid jewel when she be in full dress for a ball or official reception she wear three necklace one on top of the other and a big handsome high tiara which add to she height she be the only lady of the diplomatic corps whom madame grévy ever recognize in the first week of she husband 's presidency madame grevy be throw suddenly not very young into such a absolutely new milieu that she be quite bewildered and could not be expect to recognize half the woman of the diplomatic corps but the german ambassadress impress she and she know she always the princess be not very mondaine do not care about society and life in a city -- prefer the country with ride and shoot and any sort of sport we have a very handsome dinner at the german embassy the winter of 1878 -- give to the marshal and madame de macmahon after dinner with coffee a bear make its appearance in the drawing-room a baby bear they say but i do not think it look very small the princess pat it and talk to it just as if it be a dog and i must say the little animal be perfectly quiet and keep close to she i think the light and the quantity of people frighten it it growl once or twice and we all have a feeling of relief when it be take away i ask the maréchale afterward if she be afraid ouus j' avai très peur mais je ne voulais pas le montrer devant ce allemand -lrb- yes i be very frightened but i would not show it before those german -rrb- they have eventually to send the bear away back to germany it grow wilder as it grow older and become quite unmanageable -- they could not keep it in the embassy hohenlohe be always pleasant and easy i think he have a real sympathy for france and do he best on various delicate occasion the year of the exposition -lrb- 1878 -rrb- we dine out every night and almost always with the same people hohenlohe often fall to I he take I in to dinner ten time in succession the eleventh time we be each of we in despair as we file out together so i say to he : do not let we even pretend to talk you can talk to you other neighbor and i will to mine however we _ do _ talk chiffon curiously enough i have wait for a dress which only come home at the last moment and when i put it on the corsage be so tight i could hardly bear it it be too late to change and i have nothing else ready so most uncomfortable i start for my dinner i do not dare to eat anything hardly dare move which hohenlohe remark after see three or four dish pass I untouched and say to I : i be afraid you be ill you be eat nothing no not at all only very uncomfortable -- and then i explain the situation to he -- that my dress be so tight i could neither move nor eat he be most indignant -- how could woman be so foolish -- why do we want to have abnormally small waist and be slave to we dressmaker -- man do not like made-up figure oh yes they do all man admire a slight graceful figure yes when it be natural but no man understand nor care about a fashionably dress woman -- woman dress for each other -lrb- which be perfectly true -rrb- -lrb- illustration : prince hohenlohe after the painting by fe laszlo -rrb- however he be destine to see other lady very careful about they figure the late empress of austrium who be a fine rider spend some time one spring in pari and ride every morning in the boi she be very handsome with a beautiful figure have handsome horse and attract great attention prince hohenlohe often ride with she i be ride with a friend one morning when we see handsome horse wait at the mounting-block just inside the gate we divine they be the empress 's horse and wait to see she mount she arrive in a coupé she maid with she and mount she horse from the block the body of she habit be open when she be settle in she saddle the maid step up on the block and button she habit which i must say fitted beautifully -- as if she be melt into it the official reception be interesting that year as one still see a few costume the chinese japanese persian greek and roumanian wear they national dress -- and much better they look in they than in the ordinary dress coat and white tie of we man the greek dress be very striking a full white skirt with high embroidered belt but it be only become when the wearer be young with a good figure i remember a pretty roumanian woman with a white veil spangle with gold most effective now every one wear the ordinary european dress except the chinese who still keep they costume one could hardly imagine a chinese in a frock coat and tall hat what would he do with he pigtail the entertainment go on pretty well that year until August almost all the embassy and ministry receive queen isabellum of spain be then live in the big house in the avenue kléber call the palais d'espagne -lrb- now the hotel majestic -rrb- we use to meet she often drive in the boi she be a big stout rather red-faced woman do not make much effect in a carriage in ordinary street dress but in she palace when she receive or give a audience she be a very royal lady i ask for a audience soon after w be name to the foreign office we know one of she chamberlain very well duc de m and he arrange it for I i arrive at the palace on the appoint day a little before four -lrb- the audience be for four -rrb- the big gate be open a tall porter dress in red and gold lace and button and a staff in he hand be wait -- two or three man in black and four or five footman in red livery and powder at the door and in the hall i be show at once to a small room on the ground floor where four or five lady all spanish and all fat be wait in a few minute the duke appear we talk a little -lrb- he look at I to see if i have take off my veil and my right-hand glove -rrb- and then a man in black appear at the door make a low bow and say something in spanish the duke say would i come she majesty be ready to receive I we pass through several salon where there be footman and page -lrb- no lady -rrb- until we come to a very large one quite at the other end of the palace the big door be open and at the far end i see the queen stand a stately figure -lrb- enormous -rrb- dress in a long black velvet dress a high diamond tiara on she head from which hang a black lace veil a fan in she hand -lrb- i suppose no spanish woman of any station ever part with she fan -rrb- and a splendid string of pearl i make my curtsey on the threshold the chamberlain name I with the usual formulum : i have the honor to present to you majesty madame waddington the wife of the minister of foreign affair then back himself out of the room and i proceed down the long room to the queen she do not move let I make my two curtsey one in the middle of the room one when i come close up to she -- and then shake hand we remain stand a few minute and then she sit down on a sofa -lrb- not a very small one -rrb- which she quite fill and motion I to take a armchair on one side she be very amiable have a charming smile speak french very well but with a strong spanish accent she say she be very glad to see my husband at the foreign office and hope he would stay long enough to do some real work -- say she be very fond of france love drive in the street of pari there be always so much to see and the people look gay she be very fond of the theater particularly the smaller one like the real parisian wit and gaiety better than the measure phrase and trained diction of the français and the odéon she speak most warmly of marshal macmahon hope that he would remain president of the republic as long as the republican would let he be afraid they would make he position impossible -- but that the younger generation always want reform and change i say i think that be the way of the world everywhere in family as well as nation -- child could not be expect to see with the eye of they parent then we talk about the exposition -- she say the spanish show be very good -- tell I to look at the tapestry and embroidery which be quite wonderful -- gold and silver thread work in with the tapestry the interview be pleasant and easy when i take leave she let I back down the whole length of the room not half turn away as so many princess do after the first few step so as to curtail that very inconvenient exit however a day dress be never so long and cumbersome as a evening dress with a train the chamberlain be wait just outside the door also two lady in wait just as fat as the queen certainly the mise en scène be very effective the number of servant in red livery the solitary standing figure at the end of the long enfilade of room the high diamond comb and long veil quite transform the very stout red-faced lady whom i use to meet often walk in the boi we dine once or twice at the palace always a very handsome dinner one for the marshal and madame de macmahon be beautifully do -- all the footman dozen in gala livery red and yellow the maître d'hôtel in very dark blue with gold epaulette and aiguillette the table be cover with red and yellow flower and splendid gold plate and a very good orchestra of guitar and mandolin play all through dinner the musician singing sometimes when they play a popular song we be all assemble in one of the large room wait for the queen to appear as soon as the marshal and madame de macmahon be announce she come in meet they at the door make a circle afterward and shake hand with all the lady lord lyon give a beautiful ball at the embassy that season the hotel of the british embassy be one of the best in paris -- fine reception-rooms opening on a very large garden and a large courtyard and side exit -- so there be no confusion of carriage he have need of all he room -- pari be crowd with english besides all the exposition people there be many tourist and well-known english people all expect to be entertain at the embassy all the world be there the prince and princess of wale the marshal and madame de macmahon the orléans prince princesse mathilde the faubourg st germain the government and as many foreigner as the house could hold as he invite a great many people once he obligation english and official be satisfy it be only at a embassy that such a gathering could take place and it be amusing to see the people of all the different camp look at each other there be a supper up-stair for all the royalty before the cotillion i be tell that the duc d'aumale would take I to supper i be very pleased -lrb- as we know he very well and he be always charming to we -rrb- but much surprised as the orléans prince never remain for supper at any big official function there would have be question of place and precedence which would have be very difficult to settle when the move be make for supper thing have to be change as the orléans prince have go home the crown prince of denmark take I the supper-room be prettily arrange two round table -- lord lyon with the princess of wale and denmark preside at one -- he niece the duchesse of norfolk at the other with the prince of wale and denmark i sit between the prince of denmark and sweden opposite I next the prince of wale sit a lady i do not know every one else at the table do she be very attractive-looking with a charming smile and most animated manner i ask the prince of denmark in a low voice who she be -- think it must be one of the foreign princess i have not yet meet the prince of wale hear my question and immediately with he charming tact and ease of manner say to I : you do not know the princesse mathilde do let I have the pleasure of present you to she naming I at once -- in my official capacity wife of the minister of foreign affair the princess be very gracious and smile and we talk about all sort of thing -- some of she musical protégées who be also mine she ask I if i like living at the ministry quaus d'orsay she remember it as such a beautiful house when the party break up she shake hand say she have not the pleasure of know m waddington but would i thank he from she for what he have do for one of she friend i try to find w after supper to present he to the princess but he have already go do not stay for the cotillion -- the princess too go away immediately after supper i meet she once or twice afterward she be always friendly and we have little talk together she salon -- she receive once a week -- be quite a center -- all the bonapartist of course the diplomatic corps many stranger and all the celebrity in literature and art with that exception i never see nor talk with any member of that family until i have be some year a widow when the empress eugénie receive I on she yacht at cowe when the news come of the awful tragedy of the prince imperial 's death in zululand w be foreign minister and he have invite a large party with music w instantly put off the party say there be no question of politics or a bonapartist prince -- it be a frenchman kill fight bravely in a foreign country i always think the empress know about it and appreciate he act for during he embassy in london though we never see she she constantly send he word through mutual friend of little negotiation she know about and think might interest he and always speak very well of he as a clear-headed patriotic statesman i should have like to have see she in she prime when she must have be extraordinarily beautiful and graceful when i do see she she be no longer young but a stately impressive figure and have still the beautiful brow one see in all she picture one of we friend a very clever woman and great anti-bonapartist tell we a amusing story of she little son the child be sometimes in the drawing-room when he mother be receive and hear she and all she friend inveigh against the iniquity of the imperial court and the frivolity of the empress he see the empress walk one day in the bois de boulogne she be attract by the group of child stop and talk to they the boy be delighted and say to he governess : elle est bien jolie l'impératrice mais il ne faut pas le dire à maman -lrb- the empress be very pretty but one must not say it to mother -rrb- vii the berlin congress seventy-eight be a most important year for we in many way besides the interest and fatigue of the exposition and the constant receiving and official festivity of all kind a great event be loom before we -- the berlin congress one have feel it come for some time there be all sort of new delimitation and question to be settle since the war in the balkan and europe be get visibly nervous almost immediately after the opening of the exposition the project take shape and it be decide that france should participate in the congress and send three representative it be the first time that france have assert herself since the franco-prussian war in 1870 but it be time for she now to emerge from she self-imposed effacement and take she place in the congress of nation there be many discussion both public and private before the plénipotentiaires be name and a great unwillingness on the part of many very intelligent and patriotic frenchman to see the country launch itself upon dangerous ground and a possible conflict with bismarck however the thing be decide and the three plenipotentiary name -- mr waddington foreign minister first comte de st vallier a very clever and distinguished diplomatist actual ambassador at berlin second and monsieur desprey directeur de la politique au ministère des affaires etrangères third he be also a very able man one of the pillar of the ministry au courant of every treaty and negotiation for the last twenty year very prudent and clear-headed all w 's colleague be most cordial and charming on he appointment he make a statement in the house of the line of policy he intend to adopt -- and be absolutely approve and encourage not a disparage word of any kind be say not even the usual remark of cet anglais qui nous représente he start the 10th of June in the best condition possible -- not a instruction of any kind from he chief m dufaure président du conseil -- very complimentary to he certainly but the minister take no responsibility themselves -- leave the door open in case he make any mistake it be evident that the parliament and government be nervous it be rather amusing when all the preparation for the departure be go on w take a large suite with he secretary huissier etc and i tell they they be as much take up with they coat and embroidery and cocked hat as any pretty woman with she dress i want very much to go but w think he would be freer and have more time to think thing over if i be not there he do not know berlin at all have never see bismarck nor any of the lead german statesman and be fully conscious how he every word and act would be criticise however if a public man be not criticise it usually mean that he be of no consequence -- so attack and criticism be rather welcome -- act as a stimulant i could have go and stay unofficially with a cousin but he think that would not do st vallier be a bachelor it would have be rather a affair for he to organise at the embassy a apartment for a lady and she maid though he be most civil and ask I to come -lrb- illustration : m william waddington in the uniform he wear as minister of foreign affair and at the berlin congress 1878 -rrb- i feel rather lonely in the big ministry when they have all go and i be leave with baby w stay away just five week and i perform various official thing in he absence -- among other the review of the 14th of July the distinguished guest on that occasion be the shah of persium who arrive with the maréchale in a handsome open carriage with outrider and postilion the marshal of course be ride the shah be not at all a striking figure short stout with a dark skin and hard black eye he have handsome jewel a large diamond fasten the white aigrette of he high black cap and he sword-hilt incrust with diamond he give a stiff little nod in acknowledgment of the bow and curtsey every one make when he appear in the marshal 's box he immediately take he seat on one side of the maréchale in front of the box one of the ambassadress princess hohenlohe i think next to he the military display seem to interest he every now and then he make some remark to the maréchale but he be certainly not talkative while the interminable line of the infantry regiment be pass there be a move to the back of the box where there be a table with ice champagne etc madame de macmahon come up to I say : madame waddington sa majesté demande les nouvelles de m waddington upon which he majesty plant himself directly in front of I so close that he almost touch I and ask in a quick abrupt manner as if he be firing off a shot : où est votre marus -lrb- neither madame nor m waddington nor any of the term that be usually adopt in polite society -rrb- a berlin sire pourquoi à berlin comme plénipotentiaire français au congrès de berlin oui oui je sais je sais cela l'intéresse beaucoup il voit tant de personnes intéressantes oui je sais il va bien always come closer to I so that i be edge back against the wall with he hard bright little eye fix on mine and always the same sharp jerky tone il va parfaitement bien je vous remercie then there be a pause and he make one or two other remark which i do not quite understand -- i do not think he french go very far -- but i make out something about joly femme and point out one or two to he but he still remain stare into my face and i be delight when he minister come up to he -lrb- timidly -- all he people be afraid of he -rrb- and say some personage want to be present to he he shake hand with I say something about votre mari revient bientôt and move off the maréchale ask I if i be not touch by he majesty 's solicitude for my husband 's health and would not i like to come to the front of the box and sit next to he but i tell she i could not think of engross he majesty 's attention as there be various important people who wish to be present to he i watch he a little -lrb- from a distance -rrb- try to see if anything make any impression on he -lrb- the crowd the pretty well-dressed woman the march past the long line of infantry -- rather fatiguing to see as one line regiment look very like another -- the chasseur with they small chestnut horse the dragoon more heavily mount and the gun -rrb- but he face remain absolutely impassive though i think he see everything they tell a funny story of he in london at one of the court ball when he have look on at the dancing for some time he say to the prince of wale : tell those people to stop now i have see enough -- evidently think it be a ballet perform for he amusement another one at one of the european court be funny the monarch be very old he consort also when the shah be present to the royal lady he look hard at she without say a word then remark to she husband : laide vieille pourquous garder -lrb- ugly old why keep she -rrb- -lrb- illustration : nasr-ed-din shah of persium -rrb- i go to a big dinner and reception at the british embassy give for all the director and commissioner of the exposition it be a lovely warm night the garden be light everybody walk about and a orchestra play many of the official have they wife and daughter with they and some of the toilette be wonderful there be a good many pretty woman swede and dane the northern type very fair hair and blue eye attract much attention and a group of chinese -lrb- all in costume -rrb- standing proudly aloof -- not the least interested apparently in the gay scene before they i wonder what they think of european manners and custom there be no dancing which i suppose would have shock they eastern moral lord lyon ask I why i be not in berlin i say for the best of reason my husband prefer go without I -- but i hope he would send for I perhaps at the end of the congress he tell I lady salisbury be there with she husband he seem rather sceptical as to the peaceful issue of the negotiation -- think so many unforeseen question would come up and complicate matter i go to a ball at the hôtel de ville also give for all the foreigner and french people connect with the exposition the get there be very long and tire the coupe-file do no good as every one have one comte de pontécoulant go with I and he protest vigorously but one of the head man of the police whom he know well come up to the carriage to explain that nothing could be do there be a long line of diplomatic and official carriage and we must take we chance with the rest some of we cousin -lrb- american -rrb- never get there at all -- sit for hour in they carriage in the rue du rivoli move a inch at a time happily it be a lovely warm night and as we get near we see lot of people walk who have leave they carriage some little distance off hopelessly wedge in a crowd of vehicle -- the woman in light dress with flower and jewel in they hair the room look very handsome when at last we do get in particularly the staircase with a garde municipal on every step and bank of palm and flower on the landing in the hall wherever flower could be put the ville de paris furnish all the flower and plant for the official reception and they always be very well arrange some trophy of flag too of all nation make a great effect i do not see many people i know -- it be impossible to get through the crowd but some one get I a chair at the open window give on the balcony and i be quite happy sit there look at the people pass the whole world be represent and it be interesting to see the different type -- southerner small slight dark impatient wriggle through the crowd -- the anglo-saxon big broad calm square they shoulder when there come a sudden rush and wait quite patiently a chance to get a little ahead some of the woman too push well -- evidently determine to see all they could i do not think any royalty even minor one be there w write pretty regularly from berlin particularly the first day before the real work of the congress begin he start rather sooner than he have at first intend so as to have a little time to talk matter over with st vallier and make acquaintance with some of he colleague st vallier with all the staff of the embassy meet he at the station when he arrive in berlin also holstein -lrb- we old friend who be at the german embassy in pari with arnim -rrb- to compliment he from prince bismarck and he have hardly be fifteen minute at the embassy when count herbert von bismarck arrive with greeting and compliment from he father he go to see bismarck the next day find he at home and very civil he be quite friendly very courteous and bonhomme original and even amusing in he conversation but with a hard look about the eye which bode no good to those who cross he path he have just time to get back to the embassy and get into he uniform for he audience with the crown prince -lrb- late emperor frederick -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- the vice grand-maitre des ceremony come for he in a court carriage and they drive off to the palace -- w sit alone on the back seat the grand-maître face he on the front i be usher into a room where the prince be stand he be very friendly and talk for twenty minute about all sort of thing in excellent french with a few word of english now and then to show he know of my english connection he speak of my travels in the east of the de bunsens of the emperor 's health -lrb- the old man be much better and decidedly recover -rrb- -- and of he great wish for peace all the plenipotentiary have not yet arrive they appear only on the afternoon of the 12th the day before the congress open prince bismarck send out the invitation for the first sit : -lrb- footnote 1 : the crown prince represent he father at all the function some day before the meeting of the congress the old emperor have be wound in the arm by a nihilist nobiling who fire from a window when the emperor be pass in a open carriage the wound be slight but the old man be much shake and unable to take any part in the ceremony or receive any of the plenipotentiary -rrb- le prince de bismarck a l'honneur de prévenir son excellence monsieur waddington que la première réunion du congrès aura lieu le 13 juin à deux heures au palais du chancelier de l'empire 77 wilhelmstrasse berlin le 12 juin 1878 it be a brilliant assemblage of great name and intelligence that respond to he invitation -- gortschakoff schouvaloff andrassy beaconsfield salisbury karolyus hohenlohe cortus and many other younger man who act as secretary french be the language speak the only exception be make by lord beaconsfield who always speak in english although it be most evident w say that he understand french perfectly well the first day be merely a official opening of the congress -- every one in uniform -- but only for that occasion after that they all go in ordinary morning dress put on they uniform again on the last day only when they sign the treaty w write : bismarck preside and do he part well to-day he speak french fairly but very slowly find he word with difficulty but he know what he mean to say and let every one see that he do no one else say much that first day each man be rather reserve wait for he neighbor to begin beaconsfield make a short speech which be try for some of he colleague particularly the turk who have evidently much difficulty in understand english they be count upon england 's sympathy but a little nervous as to a suppose agreement between england and russium the russian listen most attentively there seem to be a distrust of england on they part and a decide rivalry between gortschakoff and beaconsfield the congress dine that first night with the crown prince at the schloss in the famous white hall -- all in uniform and order w say the heat be awful but the evening interesting there be one hundred and forty guest no lady except the royal princess not even the ambassadress w sit on bismarck 's left who talk a great deal intend to make himself agreeable he have a long talk after dinner with the crown princess -lrb- princess royal of england -rrb- who speak english with he he find she charming -- intelligent and cultivate and so easy -- not at all stiff and shy like so many royalty he see she very often during he stay in berlin and she be unfailingly kind to he -- and to I also when i know she later in rome and london she always live in my memory as one of the most charming woman i have ever meet she face often come back to I with she beautiful bright smile and the saddest eye i have ever see i have know very few like she w also have a talk with prince frederick-charle father of the duchess of connaught whom he find rather a rough-looking soldier with a short abrupt manner he leave bitter memory in france during the franco-german war be call the red prince he be so hard and cruel always ready to shoot somebody and burn down village on the slightest provocation -- so different from the prince imperial the unser fritz of the german who always have a kind word for the fall foe -lrb- illustration : prince bismarck from a sketch by anton von werner 1880 -rrb- w 's day be very full and when the important sitting begin it be sometimes hard work the congress room be very hot -lrb- all the colleague seem to have a holy horror of open window -rrb- -- and some of the man very long and tedious in state they case of course they be at a disadvantage not speak they own language -lrb- very few of they know french well except the russian -rrb- and they have to go very carefully and be quite sure of the exact significance of the word they use w get a ride every morning as the congress only meet in the afternoon they ride usually in the thiergarten which be not very large but the bridle-path be good it be very difficult to get out of berlin into the open country without go through a long stretch of suburb and sandy road which be not very tempting a great many officer ride in the park and one morning when he be ride with the military attache of the embassy two officer ride up and claim acquaintance have know he in france in '70 the year of the war they ride a short time together and the next day he receive a invitation from the officer of a smart uhlan regiment to dine at they mess in remembrance of the kind hospitality show to some of they officer who have be quarter at he place in france during the war as the hospitality be decidedly force and the presence of the german officer not very agreeable to the family the invitation be not very happy it be well mean but be one of those curious instance of german want of tact which one notice so much if one live much with german the hour of the various entertainment be funny at a big dinner at prince bismarck 's the guest be invite at six and at eight-thirty every one have go w sit next to countess marie the daughter of the house find she simple and inclined to talk speak both french and english well immediately after dinner the man all smoked everywhere in the drawing-room on the terrace some take a turn in the park with bismarck w find princess bismarck not very femme du monde she be preoccupy first with she dinner then with she husband for fear he should eat too much or take cold go out of the warm dining-room into the evening air there be no lady at the dinner except the family -lrb- the german lady do not seem to occupy the same place in society as the french and english woman do in paris the wife of ambassador and minister be always invite to all official banquet -rrb- amusement of all kind be provide for the plenipotentiary early in July w write of a land-parthie -- the whole congress -lrb- wife too this time -rrb- invite to potsdam for the day he be rather dread a long day -- excursion be not much in he line however this one seem to have be successful he write : we excursion go off better than could be expect the party consist of the plenipotentiary and a certain number of court officer and general we start by rail stop at a station call wannsee and embark on board a small steamer the princess royal receive the guest as they arrive on board we then start for a trip on the lake but before long there come a violent squall which oblige the sailor to take down the awning in double-quick time and drive every one down into the cabin it last about half a hour after which it clear up and every one reappear on deck in course of time we land near babelsberg where carriage be wait i be tell off to go in the first with the princess royal countess karolyus -lrb- wife of the austrian ambassador a beautiful young woman -rrb- and andrassy we go over the château of babelsberg which be a pretty gothic country-seat not a palace and belong to the present emperor after that we have a longish drive through different park and village and finally arrive at san soucus where we dine after dinner we stroll through the room and be show the different souvenir of frederick the great and get home at ten-thirty w see a good deal of he cousin george de bunsen a charming man very cultivate and cosmopolitan he have a pretty house in the new quarter of berlin and be most hospitable he have a interesting dinner there with some of the literary man and savant -- mommsen leppius helmholtz curtius etc most of they he colleague as he be a member of the berlin academy he find those evening a delightful change after the long hot afternoon in the wilhelmsstrasse where necessarily there be so much that be long and tedious i think even he get tire of greek frontier notwithstanding he sympathy for the country he do what he could for the greek who be very grateful to he and give he in memory of the effort he make on they behalf a fine group in bronze of a female figure -- greece throw off the bond of turkey some of the speaker be very interesting he find schouvaloff always a brilliant debater -- he speak french perfectly be always good-humoured and courteous and defend he cause well one feel there be a latent animosity between the english and the russian lord beaconsfield make one or two strong speech -- very much to the point and slightly arrogant but as they be always make in english they be not understand by all the assembly w be always please to meet prince hohenlohe actual german ambassador to pari -lrb- who have be name the third german plenipotentiary -rrb- he be perfectly au courant of all that go on at court and in the official world know everybody and introduce w to various lady who receive informally where he could spend a hour or two quietly without meet all he colleague blowitz of course appear on the scene -- the most important person in berlin -lrb- in he own opinion -rrb- i be not quite convinced that he see all the people he say he do or whether all the extraordinary confidence be make to he which he relate to the public but he certainly impressed people very much and i suppose he letter as newspaper correspondent be quite wonderful he be remarkably intelligent and absolutely unscrupulous do not hesitate to put into the mouth of people what he wish they to say so he naturally have a great pull over the ordinary simple-minded journalist who write simply what he see and hear as he be the pari correspondent of _ the london time _ he be often at the french embassy w never trust he very much and he flair be right as he be anything but true to he the last day of the congress be very busy one the negotiation be keep secret enough but thing always leak out and the papers have to say something i be rather émue at the tone of the french press but w write I not to mind -- they do not really know anything and when the treaty be sign france would certainly come out very honourably all this have long pass into the domain of history and have be tell so many time by so many different people that i will not go into detail except to say that the french protectorate of tuni -lrb- now one of we most flourishing colony -rrb- be entirely arrange by w in a long confidential conversation with lord salisbury the cession of the island of cyprus by turkey to the english be a most unexpected and disagreeable surprise to w however he go instantly to lord salisbury who be a little embarrassed as that negotiation have be keep secret which do not seem quite fair -- everything else have be openly discuss around the council table he quite understand w 's feeling in the matter and be perfectly willing to make a arrangement about tunis the thing be neither understand nor approve at first by the french government w return to pari les main vide seulement à chercher dan sa poche on y eut trouvé les clés de la tunisie -- as one of he friend define the situation some year ago he be almost disavow by he government the minister be timid and unwilling that france should take any initiative -- even he friend léon say then minister of finances a very clever man and brilliant politician say : notre collègue waddington contre son habitude s ` est emballé cette fois pour la question de la tunisie -lrb- we colleague waddington contrary to he nature have quite lose he head this time over the tuni question -rrb- i think the course of event have fully justified he action and now that it have prove such a success every one claim to have take the initiative of the french protectorate of tuni all honor have be pay to those who carry out the project and very little be say of the man who originate the scheme in spite of great difficulty at home and abroad some of w 's friend know the truth -lrb- illustration : the berlin congress from a painting by anton von werner 1881 -rrb- there be a great exchange of visit photograph and autograph the last day of the congress among other thing which w bring back from berlin and which will be treasured by he grandson as a historical souvenir be a fan quite a plain wooden fan with the signature of all the plenipotentiary -- some of they very characteristic the french signature be curiously small and distinct a contrast to bismarck 's smudge w be quite sorry to say good-bye to some of he colleague andrassy with he quick sympathy and instant comprehension of all side of a question attract he very much he be a striking personality quite the slav type w have little private intercourse with prince gortschakoff -- who be already a old man and the type of the old-fashioned diplomatist -- make very long and well-turned phrase which make people rather impatient on the whole w be satisfied he write two or three day before the signing of the treaty : as far as i can see at present no one will be satisfy with the result of the congress it be perhaps the best proof that it be deal fairly and equitably with the very exaggerated claim and pretension of all party anyhow france will come out of the whole affair honourably and have do all that a strictly neutral power can do the treaty be sign on July 13 by all the plenipotentiary in full uniform w say there be a decide feeling of satisfaction and relief that it be finish even bismarck look less preoccupy as if a weight have be lift from he shoulder of course he be suppose to have have he own way in everything everybody -lrb- not only the french -rrb- be afraid of he with he iron will and unscrupulous brushing aside or even annihilate everything that come in he way he be a formidable adversary there be a gala dinner at the schloss to celebrate the signing of the treaty it be the exact repetition of the first at the opening of the congress i sit on the left of bismarck and have a good deal of conversation with he the crown prince and princess be just opposite and the princess talk a great deal with I across the table always in english the crown princess could never forget that she be bear princess royal of england she household be manage on english principle she child bring up by english nurse she herself always speak english with they of course there must have be many thing in germany which be distasteful to she -- so many of the small refinement of life which be absolute necessaries in england be almost unknown luxury in germany -- particularly when she marry now there have be a great advance in comfort and even elegance in german house and habit she english proclivity make she a great many enemy and i do not believe the iron chancellor make thing easy for she the dinner at the schloss be as usual at six o'clock and at nine w have to go to take leave of the empress who be very french in she sympathy and have always be very kind to he she daughter the grand duchess of baden be there and w have a very pleasant hour with the two lady the empress ask he a great many question about the congress and particularly about bismarck -- if he be in a fairly good temper -- when he have he nerve he be simply impossible do not care what people think of he and do not hesitate to show when he be bore the grand duchess add smilingly : he be perfectly intolerant have no patience with a fool i suppose most people be of this opinion i be not personally i have some nice foolish kindly happy friend of both sex i be always glad to see i think they be rather rest in these day of high education and culture and pose w finish he evening at lady salisbury 's who have a farewell reception for all the plenipotentiary he take leave of he colleague all of whom have be most friendly the only one who be a little stiff with he and express no desire to meet he again be cortus the italian plenipotentiary he suspect of course that something have be arrange about tuni and be much annoyed that he have not be able to get tripolus for italy he be we colleague afterward in london and there be always a little constraint and coolness in he manner w leave berlin on the 17th have be five week away viii gaiety at the quaus d'orsay w get home on the 17th and be so busy the first day with he colleague and political friend that i do not see much more of he than if he have be in berlin he be rather disgusted and discourage at the view he colleague of the cabinet and he friend take of france 's attitude at the congress the only man who seem to be able to look ahead a little and understand what a future there might be for france in tuni be gambetta i remember quite well he tell of a interesting conversation with he gambetta be very keen about foreign affair very patriotic and not at all willing that france should remain indefinitely a weakened power still suffer from the defeat of 1870 there be many fêtes and reunion of all kind all through the summer month as people have flock to pari for the exposition we remain in town until the first day of August then w go to he conseil-général in the department of the aisne and i go down to deauville he join I there and we have a pleasant month -- bathing driving and see a great many people we have take sir joseph oliffe 's villa one of the best in deauville oliffe a englishman be one of emperor napoleon 's physician and he and the duc de morny be the founder of deauville which be very fashionable as long as morny live and the empire last but it lose its vogue for some year after the franco-german war -- fashion and society generally congregate at trouville there be not many villa then and one rather bad hotel but the sea be nearer than it be now and people all go to the beach in the morning and fish for shrimp in the afternoon and lead a quiet out-of-doors life there be no polo nor golf nor automobile -- not many carriage a good tennis-court where w play regularly and race every Sunday in August which bring naturally a gay young crowd of all the sport world the train des maris that leave paris every Saturday evening bring a great many man it be quite different from the deauville of to-day which be charming with quantity of pretty villa and garden and sport of all kind but the sea be so far off one have to take quite a long walk to get to it and the morning on the beach and the expedition to trouville in the afternoon across the ferry to do a little shopping in the rue de paris be thing of the past curiously enough while i be look over my note the other day i have a visit from a old friend the duc de m who be one of the inner circle of the imperial household of the emperor napoleon iii and take a active part in all that go on at court he have just be hear from a friend of the very brilliant season at deauville this year and the stream of gold that flow into the caisse of the management of the new hotel and casino every possible luxury and every inducement to spend money race gambling pretty woman of all nationality and facile character beautifully dress and cover with jewel side by side with the bearer of some of the proudest name in france he say that just fifty year ago he go to deauville with the duc de morny princesse metternich and the comtesse de pourtéles to inaugurate the new watering-place then of the simplest description the lady be badly lodge in a so-called hotel and he have a room in a fisherman 's hut marshal macmahon have a house near trouville that year and he come over occasionally to see w always on horseback and early in the morning w use to struggle into he clothes when m le marechal be announce i think the marshal prefer he military title very much to he civic honor i suppose there never be so unwilling a president of a republic except many year later casimir périer who certainly hate the prison of the elysée but the marshal be a soldier and he military discipline help he through many difficult position we have various visitor who come down for twenty-four hour -- one charming visit from the marquis de vogüé then french ambassador at vienna where he be very much like a persona grata in every way he be very tall distinguished-looking quite the type of the ambassador when i go to inspect he room i be rather strike by the shortness of the bed -- do not think he long leg could ever get into it the valet assure I it be all right the bed be normal but i doubt if he have a very comfortable night he and w be old friend have travel in the east together and discuss every possible subject during long starlight night in the desert they certainly never think then that one day they would be closely associate as ambassador and foreign minister vogüé do not like the republic do not believe in the capacity or the sincerity of the republican -- could not understand how w could he be a personal friend of the marshal 's remain at vienna during the marshal 's presidency but leave with he much to w 's regret who know what good service he have do at vienna and what a difficult post that would be for a improvise diplomatist it be then and i fancy be still one of the stiffest court in europe one hear amusing story from some diplomatist of the rigid etiquette in court circle which the american be always infringe a great friend of mine a american who have live all she life abroad and whose husband be a member of the diplomatic corps in vienna be always worry over the misdemeanor of the american who never pay any attention to rule or court etiquette they invade charmed circle walk boldly up to archduke and duchess talk to they cheerfully and easily without wait to be speak to give they a great deal of information upon all subject austrian as well as american and probably interested the very stiff austrian royalty much more than the ordinary trained diplomatist who would naturally be more correct in he attitude and conversation i think the american nationality be the most convenient in the world the american do just as they like and no one be ever surprise the explanation be quite simple : they be american i have often notice little fault of manners or breed which would shock one in a representative of a older civilisation pass quite unnoticed or merely provoke a smile of amusement we drive about a great deal -- the country at the back of deauville go away from the sea be lovely -- very like england -- charming narrow road with high bank and hedge on each side -- big tree with spread branch meet overhead -- stretch of green field with cow grazing placidly and horse and colt gambol about it be a great grazing and breed country there be many hara -lrb- breed stable -rrb- in the neighborhood and the big norman poster be much in demand i have friend who never take they horse to the country they hire for the season a pair of strong norman horse that go all day up and down hill at the same regular pace and who get over a vast amount of country we stop once or twice when we be a large party two or three carriage and have tea at one of the numerous farmhouse that be scatter about boiling water be a difficulty -- milk cider good bread and butter cheese we could always find -- sometimes a galette but a kettle and boiling water be entirely out of they habit they use to boil the water in a large black pot and take it out with a big spoon however it amuse we and the water really do boil we have a italian friend count a who go with we sometimes and he be very débrouillard make himself delightful at once to the fermière and get whatever he want -- chair and table set out on the grass with all the cow and colt and chicken walk about quite undisturbed by the unusual sight and sound it be all very rustic and a delightful change from the glory of the exposition and official life it amuse I perfectly to see w with a straw hat sit on a rather rickety three-legged stool eat bread and butter and jam once or twice some of w 's secretary come down with despatch and he have a good morning 's work but on the whole the month pass lazily and pleasantly we go back to pari about the 10th of September and remain there until the end of the exposition pari be again crowd with foreigner -- the month of October be beautiful bright and warm and the afternoon at the exposition be delightful at the end of the day when the crowd have disperse a little and the last ray of the setting sun linger on the meudon hill and the river the building and costume lose they tawdry look and one see only a mass of move color which seem to soften and lose itself in the evening shadow there be various close entertainment the marshal give a splendid fête at versaille we drive out and have some difficulty in make we way through the crowd of carriage soldier police and spectator that line the road it be a beautiful sight as we get near the palace which be a blaze of light the terrace and garden be also illuminate and the effect of the little lamp hide away in the branch of the old tree cut into all sort of fantastic shape be quite wonderful there be not as many people at the entrance of the palace as we have expect to find for the invitation have be most generously give to all nationality at first the room which be brilliantly light look almost empty the famous galerie des glaces be quite enchanting almost too light if there can be too much light at a fête there be very few people in it when we arrive rather early -- so much so that when i say to m de l one of the marshal 's aides-de-camp how perfectly beautiful it be even now empty what will it be when all the uniform and jewel be reflect in the mirror he answer be : ah madame i be afraid we sha not have people enough the hall be so enormous i thought of he afterward when a angry crowd be batter at the door of one of the salon where the royalty be have refreshment i do not think they realize and we certainly do not what the noise mean but some of the marshal 's household who know that only a slight temporary partition be between we and a irate mob struggle up the staircase be green with anxiety however the royalty all get away without any difficulty and we try to hurry immediately after they but a dense crowd be then pour into the room at each end and for a moment thing look ugly the gentleman my husband and my brother-in-law eugene schuyler lord lyon british ambassador -lrb- a big square-shouldered man -rrb- and one or two other put we my sister schuyler and I in a recess of one of the big window with heavy furniture in front of we but that be not very pleasant -- with the crowd move both way close in upon we -- and the man be get nervous so one of we secretary squeeze through the crowd and find two or three huissier come back with they and we make a procession -- two big huissier in front with they silver chain and sword the mark of official status which always impress a french crowd then lord lyon my sister and i then w and schuyler and two more man behind we -- and with considerable difficulty and a good many angry expostulation we make we way out happily we carriage and servant with we wrap be wait in one of the inner court and we get away easily enough but the evening be disastrous to most of the company there must have be some misunderstanding between the marshal 's household and the official at versaille as but one staircase -lrb- and there be several -rrb- be open to the public which be of course absolutely insufficient why other be not open and light will always be a mystery every one get jam in the one narrow stairway -- people jostle and tumble over each other -- some of the woman faint and be carry out bear high aloft over the head of the struggle multitude and many people never see they cloak again the vestiaire be take by storm -- satin and lace cloak lie on the ground trample upon by everybody and at the end various man not have be able to find they coat be disport themselves in pink satin cloak line with swan 's - down -- over they shoulder quantity of people never get into the palace -- not even on the staircase the landing be directly opposite the room where the prince have they buffet -- and if they have succeed in force the door it would have be a catastrophe while we be stand in the window look into the park which look a enchant garden with the light and flower -- we wonder if we could jump or climb down if the crowd press too much upon we but it be too high and there be no project balcony to serve as stepping-stone it be a very unpleasant experience we be give a ball at the quaus d'orsay a few night afterward and have also ask a great many people -- all the ambassador send in very large list of invitation they want for they compatriot but much the largest be that send in by the american minister the invitation send to the united state legation -lrb- as it be then -rrb- be something fabulous it seem to I the whole of the united state be in paris and expect to be entertain it be a very difficult position for the american representative on these occasion everybody can not be invite to the various entertainment and distinction be very hard to make we have some amusing experience w have a letter from one of he english friend lord h say he be come to pari for the fêtes with he two daughter and he would like very much to be invite to some of the party at the elysee and the ministry w reply say he would do what he could and add that we be to have two large dinner and reception -- one with the comédie française afterward and one with music -- which one would they come to lord h promptly reply to both it be funny but really do not make any difference when you have a hundred people to dinner you can quite easily have a hundred and three and in such large party arrange week beforehand some one always give out at the last moment we have a great many discussion in w 's cabinet with two of he secretary who be especially occupy with the invitation for we ball the parliament of course -lrb- le peuple souverain -rrb- be invite but it be a different question for the woman wife of the senator and deputy we finally arrive at a solution by invite only the wife i know we have a indignant response from one gentleman : m x député ne valsant qu'avec sa femme a l'honneur de renvoyer la carte d'invitation que le ministre des affaires etrangères et madame waddington luus ont adressée pour la soirée du 28 -lrb- mr x deputy who waltz only with he wife have the honor to send back the card of invitation which the minister of foreign affair and madame waddington have send to he for the party of the 28 -rrb- it be unanimously decide that the couple must be invite -- a gentleman who go to ball only to dance with he wife must be encourage in such exemplary behavior another be funny too in a different style : madame k étant au ciel depui quelque années ne pourrait pas se rendre à la gracieuse invitation que le ministre des affaires etrangères et madame waddington ont bien voulu lui adresser monsieur k s ' y rendra avec plaisir -lrb- madame k be in heaven for some year can not accept the amiable invitation of the minister of foreign affair and madame waddington mr k will come with pleasure -rrb- we keep the letter in we archive with many other curious specimen the house be give over to workman the last two or three day before the ball with the remembrance of the staircase at versaille in we mind we be most anxious to have no contretemps of any kind to interfere with we entertainment both entrance be arrange and the old elevator -lrb- which have not work for year -rrb- be put in order it have be suggest once or twice that i should use it but as i always have hear a gruesome tale of madame drouyn de l'huys when she husband be foreign minister hanging in space for four or five hour between the two floor i be not incline to repeat that experience my recollection of the lower entrance and staircase which we never use be of rather a dark grimy corner and i be amaze the morning of the ball to see the transformation drapery tapestry flag and green plant have do wonder -- and the elevator look quite charming with red velvet hanging and cushion i do not think any one use it we have ask we guest at nine-thirty as the prince say they would come at ten i be ready about nine and think i would go down-stair by the lower entrance so as to have a look at the staircase and all the room before any one come there be already such a crowd in the room that i could not get through even my faithful gérard could not make a passage we be oblige to send for two huissier who with some difficulty make room for I w and he staff be already in the salon réservé give final instruction the servant tell we that since eight o'clock there have be a crowd at the door which they open a little before nine and a flood of people pour in the salon réservé have a blue ribbon stretch across the entrance from door to door and be guard by huissier old hand who know everybody in the diplomatic and official world and would not let any one in who have not a right to penetrate into the charm circle -lrb- which of course become the one room where every one want to go -rrb- there be too one or two member of w 's cabinet always station near the door to see that instruction be obey i do not think the salon réservé exist any more -- the blue ribbon certainly not the rise flood of democracy and equality would not submit to any such barrier i remember quite well one beautiful woman standing for some time just the wrong side of the ribbon she be so beautiful that every one remark she but she have no official rank or claim of any kind to enter the salon réservé -- no one know she though every one be ask who she be she finally make she entrée into the room on the arm of one of the member of the diplomatic corps a young secretary one of she friend who could not refuse she what she want so much she be certainly the handsomest woman in the room with the exception of the actual queen alexandra who be always the most beautiful and distinguished wherever she be the royalty do not dance much we have the regular quadrille d'honneur with the prince and princess of wale denmark sweden countess of flander and other none of the french prince come to the ball there be a great crowd but as the distinguished guest remain all the time in the salon réservé they be not inconvenience by it just before supper which be serve at little round table in a room open out of the rotonde the late king of denmark then crown prince brother of the princess of wale tell I he would like to go up-stair and see all the room he have always hear that the palais d'orsay be a beautiful house we make a difficult but stately progress through the room the staircase be a pretty sight cover with a red carpet tapestry on the wall and quantity of pretty woman of all nationality group on the step we walk through the room where there be just as many people as there be down-stair a orchestra supper-room people dancing -- just like another party go on we halt a few minute in my petit salon at the end of the long suite of room it look quite charming with the blue brocade wall and quantity of pink rose stand in high glass vase i suggest take the elevator to go down but the prince prefer walking -lrb- so do i -rrb- it be even more difficult get through the crowd down-stair -- we have the whole length of the house to cross several woman stand on chair as we pass along in the hope of see one of the princess but they have wisely remain in the salon réservé and be afraid to venture into the crowd supper be a serious preoccupation for the young secretary of the ministry who have much difficulty in keep that room private long before the supper hour some enterprising spirit have discover that the royalty be to sup in that room and find the secretary quite inaccessible to any suggestion of people who have a right to come in -- president of commission and various other distinction -- have recourse to the servant and various gold piece circulate which however do not accomplish they object the secretary say that they have more trouble with the chamberlain of the various prince than with the prince themselves they all want to sup in the private room and be much more tenacious of have a good place or the place they think be due to they than they royal master the supper be very gay -- the prince of wale -lrb- the late king edward -rrb- perfectly charming -- talk to every one remember every one with that extraordinary gracious manner which make he friend in all class immediately after supper the prince and distinguish stranger and w depart i remain about a hour longer and go to have a look at the ballroom it be still crowded people dance hard and when finally about two o'clock i retreat to my own quarter i go to sleep to the sound of waltz and dance music play by the two orchestra the revelry continue pretty well all through the night whenever i wake i hear strain of music supper go on till seven in the morning we faithful kruft tell we that there be absolutely nothing leave on the table and they have almost to force the people out tell they that a invitation to a ball do not usually extend to breakfast the next morning there be a grand official closing of the exposition at the end of November with a distribution of prize -- the city still very full and very gay -- escort and uniform in every direction -- the champs-elysées brilliant with soldier -- equipage of all description and all the afternoon a crowd of people sit under the tree much interested in all that be go on particularly when carriage would pass with people in foreign and striking costume the chinese always wear they costume the big yellow bird of paradise become quite a feature of the afternoon défilé a indian princess too dress entirely in white -- a soft cling material with a white veil _ not _ over she face and hold in place by a gold band go around the head -- be always much admire every now and then there would be a great clatter of trotting-horse and jingle sabre when a escort of dragoon would pass escort some foreign prince to the elysée to pay he formal visit to the marshal everybody look gay -- french people so dearly love a show -- and it be amusing to see the interest every one take in the steady stream of people from the fashionable woman drive to the boi in she victorium to the workman who would stand in group on the corner of the street -- some of they occasionally with a child on they shoulder frenchman of all class be good to child on a Sunday or fête day when whole family be come in from a day at the bois one often see a young husband wheeling a baby-carriage or carry a baby in he arm to let the poor mother have a rest it be curious at the end of the exposition to see how quickly everything be remove -lrb- many thing have be sell -rrb- and in a few day the champ de mar take again the same aspect it have at the beginning of the month of may -- heavy cart and camion everywhere ocean of mud line of black hole where tree and pole have be plant and the same group of small shiver southerner all huddle together wrap in wonderful cloak and blanket quite paralyse with cold i do not know if the exposition be a financial success -- i should think probably not a great deal of money come into france -lrb- but the french spend enormously in they preparation -rrb- but the moral effect be certainly good -- all the world flock to pari cab and river steamer do a flourishing business as do all the restaurant and cafés in the suburb st cloud meudon versaille robinson be crowd every night with people who be thirst for air and food after long hot day in the dust and struggle of the exposition we dine there once or twice but it be certainly neither pleasant nor comfortable -- even in the most expensive restaurant they be all overcrowded very bad service badly light and generally bad food there be various national repast -- russian italian etc -- but i never participate in any of those except once at the american restaurant where i have a very good breakfast one morning with delicious waffle make by a negro cook i be rather glad when the exhibition be over one have a feeling that one ought to see as much as possible and there be some beautiful thing but it be most fatiguing struggle through the crowd and we invariably lose the carriage and find ourselves at the wrong entrance and have to wait hour for a cab tiffany have a great success with the french many of my friend buy souvenir of the exposition from he he work be very original fanciful and quite different from the rather stiff heavy classic silver that one see in this country ix m waddington as prime minister there have be a respite a sort of armed truce in political circle as long as the exposition last but when the chamber meet again in November it be evident that thing be not go smoothly the republican and radical be dissatisfied every day there be speech and insinuation against the marshal and he government and one feel that a crisis be impend there be not loaf and fish enough for the whole radical party if one listen to they it would seem as if every préfet and every general be conspire against the republic there be long consultation in w 's cabinet and i go often to we house in the rue dumont d'urville to see if everything be in order there as i quite expect to be back there for christmas a climax be reach when the marshal be ask to sign the deposition of some of the general he absolutely refuse -- the minister persist in they demand there be not much discussion the marshal 's mind be make up and on the 30th of January 1879 he announce in the conseil des ministres he irrevocable decision and hand he minister he letter of resignation we have a melancholy breakfast -- w count de p and i -- the last day of the marshal 's presidency w be very blue be quite sure the marshal would resign and foresee all sort of complication both at home and abroad the day be gloomy too gray and cold even the big room of the ministry be dark as soon as they have start for versaille i take baby and go to mother 's as i go over the bridge i wonder how many more time i should cross it and whether the end of the week would see I settle again in my own house we drive about and have tea together and i get back to the quaus d'orsay about six o'clock neither w nor count de p have get back from versaille but there be two telegram -- the first one to say that the marshal have resign the second one that grévy be name in he place with a large majority -lrb- illustration : m jule grevy reading marshal macmahon 's letter of resignation to the chamber of deputy from _ l'illustration _ February 8 1879 -rrb- w be rather depress when he come home -- he have always a great sympathy and respect for the marshal and be very sorry to see he go -- think he departure would complicate foreign affair as long as the marshal be at the elysee foreign government be not afraid of coup d'état or revolution he be also sorry that dufaure would not remain but he be a old man have have enough of political life and party struggle -- leave the field to younger man the marshal 's letter be communicate at once to the parliament and the house meet in the afternoon there be a short session to hear the marshal 's letter read -lrb- by grévy in the chamber of deputy -rrb- and the two house senate and chamber of deputy be convoke for a later hour of the same afternoon there be not much excitement two or three name be pronounced but every one feel sure that grévy would be the man he be nominate by a large majority and the republican be jubilant -- think the republic be at last establish on a firm and proper basis grévy be perfectly calm and self-possessed -- do not show much enthusiasm he must have feel quite sure from the first moment that he would be name he first visitor be the marshal who wish he all possible success in he new mission and if grévy be please to be the president of the republic the marshal be even more pleased not to be and to take up he private life again there be many speculation as to who would be charge by grévy to form he first cabinet -- and almost permanent meeting in all the group of the left w 's friend all say he would certainly remain at the foreign office but that depend naturally upon the choice of the premier if he be take from the more advanced rank of the left w could not possibly stay we be not long in suspense w have one or two interview with grévy which result in he remain at the foreign office but as prime minister w hesitate at first feel that it would not be a easy task to keep all those very conflicting element together there be four protestant in the ministry w léon say de freycinet and le royer jule ferry who take the ministry of public instruction a very clever man be practically a freethinker and the parliament be decidedly more advance the last election have give a strong republican majority to the senate he consult with he brother richard waddington then a deputy afterward a senator president of the chamber of commerce of rouen and some of he friend and finally decide to accept the very honorable but very onerous position and remain at the foreign affair with grévy as prime minister if i have see little of he before i see nothing of he now as he work be exactly double we do breakfast together but it be a most irregular meal -- sometimes at twelve o'clock sometimes at one-thirty and very rarely alone we always dine out or have people dine with we so that family life become a dream of the past we very rarely go together when we dine out w be always late -- he coupé wait hour in the court i have my carriage and go alone after eight or ten day of irregular meal at impossible hour -lrb- we often dine at nine-thirty -rrb- i say to count de p w 's chef de cabinet : can not you arrange to have business over a little earlier it be awful to dine so late and to wait so long to which he reply : ah madame no one can be more desirous than i to change that order of thing for when the minister dine at nine-thirty the chef de cabinet get he dinner at ten-thirty we do manage to get rather more satisfactory hour after a little while but it be always difficult to extract w from he work if it be anything important he become absorb and absolutely unconscious of time the new president grévy install himself at once at the elysée with he wife and daughter there be much speculation about madame grévy -- no one have ever see she -- she be absolutely unknown when grévy be president of the national assembly he give very pleasant man 's dinner where madame grévy never appear every one -lrb- of all opinion -rrb- be delighted to go to he and the talk be most brilliant and interesting grévy be a perfect host very cultivate with a marvellous memory -- quote page of the classic french and latin madame grévy be always speak of as a quiet unpretending person -- occupy with domestic duty who hate society and never go anywhere -- in fact no one ever hear she name mention a great many people do not know that grévy have a wife when she husband become president of the republic there be much discussion as to madame grévy 's social status in the official world i do not think grévy want she to appear nor to take any part in the new life and she certainly do not want to nothing in she former life have prepare she for such a change and it be always a effort for she but both be overrule by they friend who think a woman be a necessary part of the position it be some little time before they be settle at the elysée w ask grévy once or twice when madame waddington might call upon he wife -- and he answer that as soon as they be quite install i should receive a notice one day a communication arrive from the elysee say that madame grévy would receive the diplomatic corps and the minister ' wife on a fixed day at five o'clock the message be send on to the diplomatic corps and when i arrive on the appoint day -lrb- early as i want to see the people come in and also think i must present the foreign lady -rrb- there be already several carriage in the court -lrb- illustration : m jule grévy elect president of the republic by the senate and chamber of deputy meet as the national assembly from _ l'illustration _ February 8 1879 -rrb- the elysee look just as it do in the marshal 's time -- plenty of servant in gala livery -- two or three huissier who know everybody -- palm flower everywhere the tradition of the palace be carry on from one president to another and a permanent staff of servant remain we find madame grévy with she daughter and one or two lady wife i suppose of the secretary seat in the well-known drawing-room with the beautiful tapestry -- madame grévy in a large gold armchair at the end of the room -- a row of gilt armchair on each side of hers -- mademoiselle standing behind she mother a huissier announce every one distinctly but the name and title say nothing to madame grévy she be tall middle-aged handsomely dress and visibly nervous -- make a great many gesture when she talk it be amusing to see all the people arrive i have nothing to do -- there be no introduction -- every one be announce and they all walk straight up to madame grévy who be very polite get up for every one man and woman it be rather a impose circle that gather around she -- princess hohenlohe german ambassadress sit on one side of she -- marquise molin spanish ambassadress on the other there be not many man -- lord lyon as doyen of the diplomatic corps the nonce and a good many representative of the south american republic madame grévy be perfectly bewildered and do try to talk to the lady next to she but it be a intimidating function for any one and she have no one to help she as they be all quite new to the work it be obviously a immense relief to she when some lady of the official world come in whom she have know before the two lady plunge at once into a very animated conversation about they child husband and various domestic matter -- a perfectly natural conversation but not interesting to the foreign lady we do not make a very long visit -- it be merely a matter of form lord lyon come out with I and we have quite a talk while i be wait for my carriage in the anteroom he be so sensible always in he intercourse with the official world quite realize that the position be difficult and try for madame grévy -- it would have be for any one throw at once without any preparation into such perfectly different surroundings he have a certain experience of republic and republican manners as he have be some year in washington as british minister and have often see wife of american statesman and minister fresh from the far west begin they career in washington quite bewildered by the novelty of everything and utterly ignorant of all question of etiquette -- only he say the american woman be far more adaptable than either french or english -- or than any other in the world in fact he also say that day and i have hear he repeat it once or twice since that he have _ never _ meet a stupid american woman i have always think it be unnecessary to insist upon madame grévy 's presence at the elysée it be very difficult for any woman no longer very young to begin a entirely new life in a perfectly different milieu and certainly more difficult for a frenchwoman of the bourgeoisie than any other they live in such a narrow circle they life be so cramped and uninteresting -- they know so little of society and foreign way and manners that they must be often uncomfortable and make mistake it be very different for a man all the small question of dress and manners etc do not exist for he one man in a dress coat and white cravat look very like another and man of all condition be polite to a lady when a man be intelligent no one notice whether he coat and waist-coat be too wide or too short and whether he boot be clumsy madame grévy never look happy at the elysée they have a big dinner every Thursday with a reception afterward and she look so tired when she be sit on the sofa in the diplomatic salon make conversation for the foreigner and people of all kind who come to they reception that one feel really sorry for she grévy be always a striking personality he have a fine head a quiet dignified manner and look very well when he stand at the door receive he guest i do not think he care very much about foreign affair -- he be essentially french -- have never live abroad or know any foreigner he be too intelligent not to understand that a country must have foreign relation and that france must take she place again as a great power but home politics interested he much more than anything else he be a charming talker -- every one want to talk to he or rather to listen to he the evening be pleasant enough in the diplomatic salon it be interesting to see the attitude of the different diplomatist all be correct but most of they be visibly antagonistic to the republic and the republican -lrb- which they consider much accentuée since the nomination of grévy -- the woman rather more so than the man -rrb- one feel if one do not hear the criticism on the dress deportment and general style of the republican lady -lrb- illustration : the elysée palace pari -rrb- i do not quite understand they view of the situation they be all delighted to come to pari and know perfectly well the state of thing what a abyss exist between all the conservative party royalist and bonapartist and the republican but the absence of a court do not make any difference in they position they go to all the entertainment give in the faubourg st germain and all the société come to theirs with very few exception they do only what be necessary in the way of intercourse with the official world i think they make a mistake both for themselves and they government france be pass through a entirely new phase everything be change many young intelligent man be come to the front and there be interesting and able discussion in the chamber and in the salon of the republican minister and deputy i dare say the new theory of liberty and equality be not sympathetic to the trained representative of court but the world be advance democracy be in the air and one would have think it would have interested foreigner to follow the movement and to judge for themselves whether the young republic have any chance of life one can hardly imagine a public man not wish to hear all side of a question but i think _ certainly _ in the beginning there be such a deep-rooted distrust and dislike to the republic that it be impossible to see thing fairly i do not know that it matter very much in these day of rapid travel and telephone a ambassador 's rôle be much less important than in the old day when a ambassador with he numerous suite of secretary and servant travel by post would be day on the road before reach he destination and when all sort of thing might happen kingdom and dynasty be overthrow in the interval now all the great measure and negotiation be discuss and settle in the various chancellery -- the ambassador merely transmit he instruction i think the woman be rather more uncompromising than the man one day in my drawing-room there be a lively political discussion go on and one hear all the well-known phrase le gouvernement infect no gentleman could serve the republic etc i be not pay much attention -- never do i have become accustomed to that style of conversation and know exactly what they be all go to say when i hear one of my friend a american-born marry to a frenchman of very good old family make the follow statement : toute la canaille est républicaine that be really too much and i answer : vous êtes bien indulgente pour l'empire when one think of the unscrupulous -lrb- not to use a stronger term -rrb- and needy adventurer who make the coup d'etat and play a great part in the court of the second empire it be really a little startling to be tell that the republican enjoy the monopoly of the canaille however i suppose nothing be so useless as a political discussion -lrb- except perhaps a religious one -rrb- no one ever convert any one else i have always hear it say that the best political speech never change a vote the first person who entertain grévy be prince hohenlohe the german ambassador they have a brilliant reception room crowd all the official world and a fair contingent from the faubourg st germain the president bring he daughter with he -lrb- madame grévy never accept any invitation -rrb- and they walk through the room arm-in-arm mademoiselle decline the arm of count wesdehlen first secretary of the german embassy however she be finally prevail upon to abandon the paternal support and then wesdehlen install she in a small salon where mollard introducteur des ambassadeurs take charge of she and introduce a great many man to she no woman would ask to be introduce to a unmarried woman and that of course make she position difficult the few lady she have already see at the elysée come up to speak to she but do not stay near she so she be really receive almost alone with mollard grévy be in another room très entouré as he always be the diplomatic corps do not spare they criticism madame grévy receive every Saturday in the afternoon and i go often -- not every time it be a funny collection of people some queerly dress woman and one or two man in dress coat and white cravat -- always a sprinkling of diplomatist prince orloff be often there and if anybody could have make that stiff shy semicircle of woman comfortable he would have do it with he extraordinary ease of manner and great habit of the world gambetta be install in the course of the month at the palais bourbon next to we it be brilliantly light every night and my chef tell I one of he friend a excellent cook be engage and that there would be a great many dinner the palais bourbon have see great entertainment in former day when the famous duc de morny be président de la chambre des députés under napoleon iii he entertainment be famous the whole world fashionable political and diplomatic throng he salon and invitation be eagerly seek for not only by the french people but by the many foreigner who pass through pari at that time gambetta must have be a curious contrast to the duc de morny we go to see a first function at the elysée some time in February two cardinal be to be name and grévy be to deliver the biretta mollard ask to see I one morning tell I that the two ablegate with they suite have arrive and wish to pay they respects to I one of they be monsignor cataldus whom we have know well in rome when we be live there he be a friend of my brother -lrb- general rufus king the last united state minister to the vatican under pium nono -rrb- and come often to the house he be much excite when he find out that madame waddington be the mary king he have know so well in rome he have with he a english priest whose name curiously enough be english they appear about tea-time and be quite charming cataldus just as fat and cheerful and talkative as i remember he in the old day in rome we plunge at once into all sort of memory of old time -- the good old time when rome be small and black and interesting -- something quite apart and different from any other place in the world monsignor english be much younger and more reserve the anglo-saxon type -- a contrast to the exuberant southerner we ask they to dine the next night and be able to get a few interesting people to meet they comte et comtesse de sartiges and one or two deputy -- bien-pensants sartige be formerly french ambassador in rome to the vatican and a very clever diplomatist he be very autocratic do exactly what he like i remember quite well some of he small dance at the embassy the invitation be from ten to twelve and at twelve precisely the musician stop play -- no matter who be dance the ball be over he wife be a american from boston miss thorndike who always retain the simple natural manner of the well-born american they son the vicomte de sartiges have follow in he father 's footstep and be one of the most serious and intelligent of the young diplomatist cataldus make himself very agreeable speak french perfectly well though with a strong italian accent he confide to I after dinner that he would have like to see some of the more advanced political man instead of the very conservative catholic we have invite to meet they i know what these gentleman think i would like to talk to some of the other those who think ` le clericalism c'est l'ennemus ' and who be firmly convince that the soutane serve as a cloak for all sort of underhand and unpatriotic dealings i can only see they abroad never in rome he would have talk to they quite easily italian have so much natural tact in discuss difficult question never irritate people unnecessarily w enjoy he evening he have never be in rome nor known many roman and it amuse he to see how skilfully cataldus -lrb- who be a devoted admirer of leo xiii -rrb- avoid all cross-current and difficult question say only what he intend to say and appreciate all that be say to he henrietta and i be very anxious to see the ceremony at the elysée and ask mollard introducteur des ambassadeurs and chef du protocole -- a most important man on all official occasion if he could not put we somewhere in a corner where we could see without take any part w be of no use to we as he go officially in uniform madame grévy be very amiable and send we a invitation to breakfast we find a small party assemble in the tapestry salon when we arrive at the elysée -- the president with all he household civil and military madame and mademoiselle grévy three or four lady wife of the aide-de-camp and secretary also several prominent ecclesiastic among they monsignor capel a english priest a very handsome and attractive man whom we have know well in rome he be suppose to have make more woman convert to catholicism than any man of he time i can quite understand he influence with woman there be something very natural and earnest about he -- no pose i have not see he since i have marry and be very pleased when i recognize he he tell I he have never see w -- be most anxious to make he acquaintance while we be talk w come in look very warm and uncomfortable wear he stiff gold-embroidered uniform which change he very much i introduce capel to he at once they have quite a talk before the archbishop and ablegate arrive the two future cardinal monseigneur pie archbishop of poitier and monseigneur desprey archbishop of toulouse be well know in the catholic world the pope 's choice be generally approve they be treat with all due ceremony as befitted prince of the church one of the elysée carriage -lrb- always very well turn out -rrb- with a escort of cavalry go to fetch they and they look very stately and impose in they robe when they come into the room where we be wait they be very different monseigneur pie tall thin cold arrogant -- one feel it be a trial for he to receive he cardinal 's hat from the hand of a republican president monseigneur desprey have a kind good expression i do not think he like it much either but he put a better face on the matter both cardinal say exactly what one imagine they would say -- that the traditional fidelity of france to the church should be support and encourage in every way in these troubled day of indifference to religion etc one feel all the time the strong antagonism of the church to the republic grévy answer extremely well speak with much dignity and simplicity and assure the cardinal that they could always count upon the constitutional authority of the head of the state in favor of the rights of the church i be quite pleased to see again the red coat and high boot of the garde noble it be a very showy dashing uniform the two young man be good-looking and wear it very well i ask to have they present to I and we have a long talk over old day in rome when the pope go out every day to the different villa and promenade and always with a escort of garde noble i invite they to we reception two or three night afterward and they seem to enjoy themselves they be of course delighted with they short stay in pari and i think a little surprised at the party at the foreign office under a republican régime i do not know if they expect to find the room fill with gentleman in the traditional red garibaldian shirt -- and lady in corresponding simplicity of attire -lrb- illustration : she majesty queen victorium about 1879 from a photograph by chancellor dublin -rrb- we see a great many english at the quaus d'orsay queen victorium stay one or two night at the british embassy pass through pari on she way south she send for w who have never see she since he undergraduate day at cambridge he find she quite charming very easy interested in everything she begin the conversation in french -- -lrb- he be announce with all due ceremony as monsieur le ministre des affaires etrangères -rrb- and w say she speak it remarkably well -- then with she beautiful smile which lighten up she whole face : i think i can speak english with a cambridge scholar she be much interested in he beginning in england at rugby and cambridge -- and be evidently astonished though she have too much tact to show it that he have choose to make he life and career in france instead of accept the proposition make to he by he cousin waddington then dean of durham to remain in england and continue he classic and literary study under he guidance when the interview be over he find the queen 's faithful scotch retainer john brown who always accompany she everywhere wait outside the door evidently hope to see the minister he speak a few word with he as a countryman -- w be half scotch -- he mother be bear chisholm they shake hand and john brown beg he to come to scotland where he would receive a hearty welcome w be very pleased with he reception by the queen lord lyon tell he afterward that she have be very anxious to see he she tell he later in speaking of the interview that it be very difficult to realize that she be speak to a french minister -- everything about he be so absolutely english figure coloring and speech many old school and college experience be evoke that year by the various english who pass through paris one night at a big dinner at the british embassy i be sit next to the prince of wale -lrb- late king edward -rrb- he say to I : there be a old friend of you husband 's here to-night who will be so glad to see he again they have not meet since he be he fag at rugby after dinner he be introduce to I -- admiral glynn -- a charming man say he last recollection of w be make he toast for he and get a good cuff when the toast fall into the fire and get burn the two man talk together for some time in the smoking-room recall all sort of schoolboy exploit another school friend be sir franci adam first secretary and counsellor at the british embassy when the ambassador take he holiday adam replace he and have the rank and title of minister plenipotentiary he come every Wednesday the diplomatic reception day to the quaus d'orsay to talk business as long as a secretary or a huissier be in the room they speak to each other most correctly in french as soon as they be alone relapse into easy and colloquial english we be very fond of adam -- see a great deal of he not only in pari but when we first live in london at the embassy he die suddenly in switzerland and w miss he very much he be very intelligent a keen observer have be all over the world and he knowledge and appreciation of foreign country and way be often very useful to w we continue we dinner and reception which always interest I we see so many people of all kind one dinner be for prince alexander of battenberg just as he be start to take possession of the new principality of bulgarium he be one of the handsomest man i have ever see -- tall young strong he seem the type of the dash young chief who would inspire confidence in a new independent state he do not speak of he future with much enthusiasm i wonder if a presentiment be even then overcloud what seem a brilliant beginning he talk a great deal at dinner he be just back from rome and full of its charm which at once make a bond of sympathy between we report say he have leave he heart there with a young roman he certainly speak of the happy day with a shade of melancholy i suggest that he ought to marry that would make he exile as he call it easier to bear ah yes if one could choose then after a pause with a almost boyish petulance : they want I to marry princess x but i do not want to be she pretty will she help you in you new country i do not know i do not care i have never see she poor fellow he have a wretched experience some of the exile be less interesting a lady ask to see I one day to enlist my sympathy for she brother and plead he cause with the minister he have be name to a post which he could not really accept i rather demur tell she messenger one of the secretary of the foreign office that it be quite useless she asking I to interfere w be not very likely to consult I in he choice of nomination -- and in fact the small appointment secretary be generally prepare in the chancellerie and follow the usual routine of regular promotion a ambassador of course be different and be sometimes take quite outside the carrière the lady persist and appear one morning -- a pretty well-dressed femme du monde whom i have often meet without make she acquaintance she plunge at once into she subject -- she brother 's delicate health accustom to all the comfort and what the book call higher civilisation of europe able to do good service in court and society as he know everybody it be a pity to send he to such a out-of-the-way place with a awful climate -- any consul 's clerk would do as well i suppose he have be name to caraca south america or some other remote and unhealthy part of the globe but when she stop for a moment i discover that the young man be name to washington i be really surprised do not know what to say at once when the absurdity of the thing strike I and i answer that washington be far perhaps across the ocean but there be compensation -- but she take up she argument again such a impossible place everything so primitive i really think she think the youth be go to a indian settlement all squaw and wigwam and tomahawk i decline any interference with the minister 's appointment assure she i have no influence whatever and she take leave of I very icily i hear the sequel afterward -- the young man refuse the post as quite unworthy of he there be several other ready and pleased to take it and m de x be put en disponibilité we see too that year for the first time the grand duke alexander of russium -lrb- later emperor alexander iii whose coronation we go to at moscow -rrb- and the grande duchesse marie prince orloff arrange the interview as he be very anxious that the grand duke should have some talk with w they be in paris for three or four day stay at the hotel bristol where they receive we he be a tall handsome man with a blond beard and blue eye quite the northern type she recall she sister -lrb- queen alexandra -rrb- not quite so tall but with the same gracious manner and beautiful eye the grand duke talk a great deal principally politics to w he express himself very doubtfully about the stability of the republic and be evidently worry over the possibility of a general amnesty a very dangerous measure which no government should sanction w assure he there would be no general amnesty but he seem sceptical repeat several time : soyez stable soyez ferme the grande duchesse talk to I about paris the street be so gay the shop so tempting and all the people so smile and happy i suppose the contrast strike she come from russium where the people look sad and listless i be much impressed with they sad repress look when we be in russium for the coronation -- one never hear people laugh or sing in the street -- and yet we be there at a time of great national rejoicing amusement of all kind provide for the people they national melody volklieder -lrb- song of the people -rrb- have always a strain of sadness run through they we conversation be in french which both speak very well the winter month go by quickly enough with periodical alarm in the political world when some new measure be discuss which arouse everybody 's passion and satisfied neither side i make weekly visit to my own house which be never dismantle as i always feel we stay at the quaus d'orsay would not last much longer one of we colleague madame léon say a intelligent charming woman take matter more philosophically than i do she husband have be in and out of office so often that she be quite indifferent to sudden change of residence they too keep they house open and she say she have always a terrine de crise ready in she larder the diplomatic appointment the embassy particularly be a difficulty admiral pothnau go to london he be a very gallant officer and have serve with the english in the crimea -- have the order of the bath and exactly that stand-off pompous manner which suit english people general chanzy go to st petersburg it have be the tradition almost always to send a soldier to russium there be so little intercourse between the russian emperor and any foreigner even a ambassador that a ordinary diplomatist no matter how intelligent or experienced he might be would have very few opportunity to talk to the emperor whereas a officer with the various review and maneuver that be always go on in russium would surely approach he more easily i be so strike when we be in russium with the immense distance that separate the prince from the ordinary mortal they seem like demigod on a different plane -lrb- in russium i mean of course when they come to pari they godlike attribute disappear unfortunately for themselves -rrb- chanzy be very happy in russium where he be extremely well receive he dine with we one night when he be at home on leave and be most enthusiastic about everything in russium -- they finances they army -- the woman of all class so intelligent so patriotic he be evidently quite sous le charme when he have go m desprey then directeur de la politique a very clever man who have see many ambassador come and go from all the capital of europe say : it be curious how all the ambassador who go to russium have that same impression i have never know it to fail it be the russian policy to be delightful to the ambassador -- make life very easy for they -- show they all that be brilliant and interesting -- open all door -lrb- society etc -rrb- and keep all sordid and ugly question in the background st vallier remain at berlin he name have be mention for foreign minister when dufaure be make he cabinet but he have not the health for it -- and i think prefer be in berlin he know germany well and have a good many friend in berlin w of course have a great many man 's dinner from which i be exclude i dine often with some of my friend not of the official world and i use to ask myself sometimes if the quaus d'orsay and these house could be in the same country it be a entirely different world every point of view different not only politics -- that one would expect as the whole of society be anti-republican royalist or bonapartist -- but every question discuss wear a different aspect once or twice there be a question of loui xiv and what he would have do in certain case -- the religious question always a passionate one that of course i never discuss be a protestant and know quite well that the real fervent catholic think protestant have no religion i be out drive with a friend one morning in lend -lrb- holy week -rrb- Thursday i think -- and say i could not be out late as i must go to church -- perhaps she would drop I at the protestant chapel in the avenue de la grand armée she be so absolutely astonished that it be almost funny though i be half angry too you be go to church on holy Thursday i do not know protestant ever keep lend or holy week or any saint 's day do not you think we ever go to church oh yes to a conference or sermon on sunday but you be not pratiquant like we i be really put out and try another day when she be sit with I to show she we prayerbook and explain that the creed and the lord 's prayer to say nothing of various other prayer be just the same as in she livre de messe but i do not make any impression upon she -- she only remark be i suppose you do believe in god -- yet she be a clever well-educated woman -- know she french history well and must have know what a part the french protestant play at one time in france when many of the great noble be protestant year afterward with the same friend we be discuss the propose marriage of the duke of clarence eldest son of the late king edward vii of england who want very much to marry princess hélène d'orléans daughter of the comte de paris now duchesse d'aosta it be impossible for the english prince heir to the throne to marry a catholic princess -- it seem equally impossible for the french princess to become a protestant the pope be consult and very strong influence bring to bear on the question but the catholic church be firm we be in london at the time and of course hear the question much discuss it be a interesting case as the two young people be much in love with each other i say to my friend : if i be in the place of the princess hélène i should make myself a protestant it be a big bait for the daughter of a exile prince to be queen of england but it could not be no catholic could change she religion or make herself protestant yet there be a precedent in you history you king henrus iv of beloved memory a protestant do not hesitate to make himself a catholic to be king of france ah but that be quite different for you perhaps chère amie but not for we however the poor young prince die suddenly of pneumonia so the sacrifice would have be in vain all the autumn of '79 be very agitate we be oblige to curtail we stay at bourneville we country home even though the chamber be not sit every description of political intrigue be go on every day w have a immense courrier and every second day a secretary come down from the quaus d'orsay with despatch and papers to sign telegram come all day long w have one or two shooting breakfast and the long tramp in the wood rest he the guest be generally the notability of the small town and village of he circumscription -- mayor farmer and small landowner they all talk politics and w be surprise to see how in this quiet agricultural district the fever of democracy have mount usually the well-to-do farmer be very conservative look askance at the very advanced opinion of the young radical but a complete change have come over they they seem to think the republic found at last upon a solid basis support by honest republican would bring untold prosperity not only to the country but to each individual and many very modest unpretending citizen of the small town see themselves conseilleur généraux deputy perhaps even minister it be a curious change however on the whole the people in we part of the world be reasonable i be sorry to go back to town i like the last beautiful day of September in the country the tree be just begin to turn and the ride in the wood be delightful the road so soft and springy the horse seem to like the brisk canter as much as we do we disturb all the forest life as we gallop along -- hare and rabbit scuttle away -- we see they white tail disappear into hole and when we cross a bit of plain partridge a long distance off would rise and take they crooked flight across the field it be so still always be in the wood that the horse ' foot could be hear a long way off it be get colder -lrb- all the country folk predict a very cold winter -rrb- and the wood-fire look very cheerful and comfortable in my little salon when we come in however everything must end and w have to go back to the fight which promise to be lively in pari we find people wear fur and prepare for a cold winter the house of the quaus d'orsay be comfortable well warm calorifères and big fire in all the room and whenever there be any sun it pour into the room from the garden i do not take up my official afternoon reception the session have not begin and as it seem extremely unlikely that the coming year would see we still at the quaus d'orsay it be not worth while to embark upon that dreary function i be at home every afternoon after five -- have tea in my little blue salon and always have two or three people to keep I company prince hohenlohe come often settle himself in a armchair with he cup of tea and talk easily and charmingly about everything he be just back from germany and report bismarck and the emperor -lrb- i should have say perhaps the emperor and bismarck -rrb- as rather worry over the rapid stride france be make in radicalism he reassure they tell they grévy be essentially a man of peace and as long as moderate man like w léon say and they friend remain in office thing would go quietly yes if they remain i have a idea we sha not stay much longer and report say freycinet will be the next premier he evidently have hear the same report and speak warmly of freycinet -- intelligent energetic and such a precise mind if w be oblige to resign which he personally would regret he think freycinet be the come man -- unless gambetta want to be premier he do not think he do be not quite ready yet but he hand might be force by he friend and of course if he want it he would be the next président du conseil he also tell I a great many thing that blowitz have say to he -- he have a great opinion of he -- say he be so marvellously well-informed of all that be go on it be curious to see how a keen clever man like prince hohenlohe attach so much importance to anything that blowitz say the nuncio monseigneur czaskus come too sometimes at tea-time he be a charming talker but i always feel as if he be say exactly what he mean to and what he want I to repeat to w i be never quite sure with italian there be always a certain reticence under they extremely natural rather exuberant manner monseigneur czaskus be not a italian by birth -- a pole but i do not know that they inspire much more confidence x parliament back in paris the question of the return of the parliament to paris have at last be solve after endless discussion all the republican be in favor of it and they be master of the situation the president grévy too want it very much if the chamber continue to sit at versaille he would be oblige to establish himself there which he do not want to do many people be very unwilling to make the change be honestly nervous about possible disturbance in the street and though they grumble too at the loss of time the draughty carriage of the parliamentary train etc they still prefer those discomfort to any possibility of rioting and street fight and the invasion of the chamber of deputy by a pari mob w be very anxious for the change he do not in the least anticipate any trouble -- he principal reason for want the parliament back be the loss of time and also to get rid of the conversation in the train which tire he very much he never could make himself hear without a effort as he voice be low have no timbre and he do not hear he neighbor very well in the noise of the train he always arrive at the station at the last minute and get into the last carriage hope to be undisturbed and have a quiet half-hour with he papers but he be rarely leave alone if any deputy who want anything recognize he he of course get in the same carriage because he know he be sure of a half-hour to state he case as the minister could not get away from he the chamber meet after a short vacation in November at last in pari and already there be so many interpellation announce on every possible subject so many criticism on the policy of the cabinet and so many people want other people 's place that the session promise to be very lively -- the senate at the palais du luxembourg the deputy at the palais bourbon w and i go over to the luxembourg one morning early in October to see the arrangement that have be make for the senate he want too to choose he seat i have not be there in the daytime for year -- i have dine once or twice at the petit palai with various president of the senate but my only impression be a very long drive -lrb- from the barrière de l'etoile where we live -rrb- and fine high room with heavy gilt furniture and tapestry the palace be build by maria de ' medici wife of henrus iv after the death of that very chivalrous but very undomestic monarch she retire to the luxembourg and from there as regent -lrb- she son loui xiii be only ten year old when he father die -rrb- for some year direct the policy of france under the guidance of she favorite the italian concinus and he wife the palace recall very much the palazzo pittus in florence with its solid masonry and rather severe heavy architecture it must have be a gloomy residence notwithstanding the beautiful garden with they broad alley and great open space the garden be stiff very italian with statue fountain and marble balustrade -- not many flower except immediately around the palace but they be flood with sunshine that day and the old gray pile seem to rise out of a parterre of bright flower the palace have be slightly modernize but the general architecture remain the same many people of all kind have live there since it be build -- several royal prince and the emperor napoleon when he be first consul he go from there to the tuilery the luxembourg palace have always be associate with the history of france during the revolution it be a prison and many of the curious scene one read of at that period take place in those old wall -- the grande dame so careful of they dress and they manners the grand seigneur so brave and gallant strive in every way by they witty conversation and they music -lrb- for they sing and play in the prison all through that awful time -rrb- to distract the woman and make they forget the terrible doom that be hang over they many well-known people go straight from the palace to the scaffold it seem a fitting place for the sitting of the senate and the deliberation of a choose body of man who be suppose to bring a maturer judgment and a wider experience in the discussion of all the burning question of the day than the ardent young deputy so eager to have do with everything connect with the old régime and start fresh after we have inspect the palace we walk about the garden which be charming that bright October morning -- the sun really too strong we find a bench in the shade and sit there very happy w smoking and wonder what the next turn of the wheel would bring we a great many people be walk about and sit under the tree it be quite a different public from what one saw anywhere else many student of both sex carry book small easel and campstool -- some of the man such evident bohemian with long hair sweeping moustache and soft feel hat -- quite the type one see in the picture or play of la vie de bohême they girl companion look very trim and neat dress generally in black they clothes fitting extremely well -- most of they bareheaded but some have hat of the simplest description -- none of the flaunt feather and bright flower one see on the boulevard they be a type apart the modern grisette so quiet and well-behaved as to be almost respectable one always hear that the quartier latin do not exist any more -- the student be more serious less turbulent and that the hardwork little grisette quite content with she simple life and pleasure have degenerate into the danseuse of the music-hall and barrière theater i do not think so a certain class of young impecunious student will always live in that quarter and will always amuse themselves and they will also always find girl quite ready and happy to enjoy life a little while they be young enough to live in the present and have no care for the future child be play about in the alley and broad open space and climb on the fountain when the keeper of the garden be not anywhere near -- they nurse sit in a sunny corner with they work it be quite another world neither the champs-elysées nor montmartre all look perfectly respectable and the couple sit on out-of-the-way bench in most affectionate attitude be too much take up with each other to heed the passer-by i go back there several time afterward take franci with I and it be curious how out of the world one feel paris we pari might have be mile away i learn to know some of the habitués quite well -- a white-haired old gentleman who always bring bread for the bird they know he perfectly and would flutter down to the square as soon as he appear -- a handsome young man with a tragic face always alone walk up and down mutter and talk to himself -- he may have be a aspirant for the odéon or some of the theater in the neighborhood -- a lame man on crutch a child walk beside he look wistfully at the child play about but not daring to leave she charge -- group of student hurry through the garden on they way to the sorbonne they black leather serviette under they arm -- couple always everywhere i do not think there be many foreigner or tourist -- i never hear anything but french speak even the most disreputable-looking old beggar at the gate who sell shoe-lace learn to know we and would run to open the door of the carriage with the contrariety of human nature some people would say of feminine nature now that i feel i be not go to live much longer on the rive gauche i be get quite fond of it life be so quiet and restful in those long narrow street some even with grass grow on the pavement -- no tram no omnibus very little pass glimpse occasionally of big house stand well back from the street a good-sized courtyard in front and garden at the back -- the classic faubourg st germain hotel entre cour et jardin i go to tea sometimes with a friend who live in a big old-fashioned house in the rue de varenne she live on the fourth floor -- one go up a broad bare cold stone staircase -lrb- which always remind I of some of the staircase in the roman palace -rrb- she room be large very high ceiling very little furniture in they very little fire in winter fine old family portrait on the wall but from the window one look down on a lovely garden where the sun shone and the bird sing all day it be just like be in the country so extraordinarily quiet a very respectable man servant in a old-fashioned brown livery with a great many brass button who look as old as the house itself and as if he be part of it always open the door she husband be a literary man who make conférences at the sorbonne and the collège de france and they live entirely in that quarter -- come very rarely to we part of pari he be a old friend of w 's and they come sometimes to dine with we he deplore w 's have go to the foreign office -- think the public instruction be so much more to he taste and habit she have a english grandmother know english quite well and read english review and papers she have once see queen victorium and be very interested in all that concerned she queen victorium have a great prestige in france people admire not only the wise sovereign who have weather successfully so many change but the beautiful woman 's life as wife and mother she be always speak of with the greatest respect even by people who be not sympathetic to england as a nation another of my haunt be the convent and maison de santé of the soeurs augustine du saint coeur de marie in the rue de la santé it be curious to turn out of the broad busy populous avenue crowd with tram omnibus and camion into the narrow quiet street which seem all stone wall and big door there be another hospital and a prison in the street which naturally give it rather a gloomy aspect but once inside the courtyard of the convent there be a complete transformation one find one 's self in a large square open court with arcade and building all around -- the chapel just opposite the entrance on one side of the court be the room for the patient on the other nice room and small apartment which be let to invalid or old lady and which open on a garden really a park of thirteen or fourteen acre the door be always open and one have a lovely view of green field and tree the moment you put you foot inside the court you feel the atmosphere of peace and cheerfulness though it be a hospital the nuns all look happy and smile -- they always do and i always wonder why life in a cloister seem to I so narrow and monotonous and unsatisfying unless one have be breed in a convent and know nothing of life but what the teacher tell i have a friend who always fill I with astonishment -- a very clever cultivate woman no longer very young marry to a charming man accustom to life in its largest sense she be utterly wretched when she husband die but after a time she take up she life again and seem to find interest and pleasure in the thing they have do together suddenly she announce she intention of become a nun -- sell she house and lovely garden where she have spend so many happy hour with she flower and she bird distribute she pretty thing among she friend and accept all the small trial of strict convent life -- no bath nor mirror coarse underlinen and sheet -- no fire no light no privacy the regular irksome routine of a nun 's life and be perfectly happy -- never miss the intellectual companionship and the refinement and daintiness of she former life -- like the commonplace routine of the convent -- the book they read to each other in recreation simple story one would hardly give to a child of twelve or fourteen -- the fêtes on the mother 's birthday when the nun make a cake and put a wreath of rose on the mother 's head the soeurs augustine be very happy in they life but they see a great deal more of the outside world they always have patient in the hospital and people in the apartment which be much in demand the care and attendance be very good the lady be very comfortable and have as many visitor as they like in the afternoon at state hour and the room be very tempting with white wall and furniture and scrupulously clean the cuisine be very good everything very daintily serve all day one see black-robed figure move quietly across the court carry all kind of invalid paraphernalia -- cushion rug cup of bouillon -- but there be never any noise -- no sound of talk or laugh when they speak the voice be low like people accustom to a sick-room no man be allow in the convent except the doctor of course and visitor at state hour i spend many day there one spring as c be there for some week for a slight operation she have a charming room and dressing-room with window give on a garden or rather farmyard for the soeur have they cow and chicken sometimes in the evening we would see one of the sister she black skirt tuck up and a blue apron over it bring the cow back to they stable no man could have a room in the house f want very much to be with he wife at night as he be a busy man and away all day and i try to get a room for he but the mother superior a delightful old lady would not hear of it however the night before-and the night after the operation he be allow to remain with she -- no extra bed be put in the room -- he sleep on the sofa often when c be sleep or tired i would take my book and establish myself in the garden pari might have be mile away though only a few yard off there be a busy crowded boulevard but no noise seem to penetrate the thick wall occasionally at the end of a quiet path i would see a black figure pacing backward and forward with eye fix on a breviary once or twice a soeur jardinière with a big flat straw hat over she coiffe and veil tend the flower -lrb- there be not many -rrb- or weed the lawn sometimes convalescent or old lady seat in armchair under the tree but there be never any sound of voice or of life it be very reposeful -lrb- when one feel one could get away for a little while -rrb- but i think the absolute calm and monotony would pall upon one and the call of the world -- the struggle living joyous world outside the wall -- would be a irresistible temptation i walk about a good deal in my quarter in the morning and make acquaintance with many funny little old square and shop mercery flower and toy shop which have not yet be swallow up by the enormous establishment like the louvre the bon marché and the big bazaar i do not know how they exist there be never any one in the shop and of course they choice be limited but they be so grateful they thing be so much cheaper and they be so anxious to get anything one want that it be a pleasure to deal with they everything be much cheaper on that side -- flower cake writing-paper rent servant ' wages stable equipment horse ' food we buy some toy one year for one of we christmas tree in the country from a poor old lame woman who have a tiny shop in one of the small street run out of the rue du bac she grandson a boy of about twelve or fourteen help she in the shop and they be so pleased and excited at have such a large order that they be quite bewildered we do get what we want but it take time and patience -- they stock be small and not vary we have to choose piece by piece -- horse doll drum etc -- and the write down of the item and make up the addition be long and try i mean to go back after we leave the quaus d'orsay but i never do and i be afraid the poor old woman with she petit commerce share the fate of all the other and could not hold out against the big shop one get lazy about shop the first year we live in the country we use to go ourselves to the big shop and bazaar in pari for we christmas shopping but the heat and the crowd and the wait be so tiring that we finally make arrangement with the woman who sell toy in the little town la ferté-milon she go to pari and bring back specimen of all the new toy we go into town one afternoon -- all the toy be spread out on table in she little parlor at the back of the shop -lrb- she little girl attend to the customer who be consume with curiosity as to why we carriage be wait so long at the door -rrb- and we make we selection she be a great help to we as she know all the child they age and what they would like she be very pleased to execute the commission -- it make she of importance in the town have the big box come down from paris address to she and she pay she journey and make a very good profit by charge two or three sous more on each article we be quite willing to pay the few extra franc to be save the fatigue of the long day 's shopping in paris it also settle another difficult question -- what to buy in a small country town once we have exhaust the butcher and the baker and the small grocery there be not much to buy from the beginning of my life in the country w always want I to buy as much as possible in the town and i be often puzzle now the shop in all the small country town have improve they have they thing straight from pari with very good catalogue so that one can order fairly well the thing be more expensive of course but i think it be right to give what help one can to the people of the country one cold winter at bourneville when we have we house full of people there be a sudden call for blanket i think my lingerie be pretty well stock but one gentleman want four blanket on he bed three over he and one under the sheet a couple want the same only one more a blanket for a big armchair near the fire i go in to la ferté to see what i could find -- no white blanket anywhere -- some rather nice red one -- and plenty of the stiff -lrb- not at all warm -rrb- gray blanket they give to the soldier those naturally be out of the question but i take three or four red one which of course could not go in the guest ' room but be distribute on the bed of the family they white one go to the friend after that experience i always have a reserve of blanket but i be never ask for so many again live in the country with people constantly stay in the house give one much insight into other people 's way of living and what be the necessity of life for they i think we house be pretty well provide for we be a large family party and have all we want but some of the demand be curious vary of course with the nationality the chamber meet in pari at the end of November and take possession of they respective house without the slightest disturbance of any kind up to the last moment some people be nervous and predict all sort of trouble and complication we spend the toussaint in the country with some friend and they view of the future be so gloomy that it be almost contagious one afternoon when we be all assemble in the drawing-room for tea after a beautiful day 's shoot the conversation -lrb- generally retrospective -rrb- be so melancholy that i be rather impress by it -- the beginning of the end -- the culpable weakness of the government and moderate man give way entirely to the radical a invitation to the pari rabble to interfere with the sitting of the chamber and a variety of similar remark it would have be funny if one have not feel that the speaker be really in earnest and anxious however nothing happen the first few day there be a small perfectly quiet well-behaved crowd also a very strong police force at the palais bourbon but i think more from curiosity and the novelty of see deputy again at the palais bourbon than from any other reason if it be quiet outside one could not say the same of the inside of the chamber the fight begin hotly at once speech and interpellation and attack on the government be the order of the day the different member of the cabinet make statement explain they policy but apparently they have satisfy nobody on either side and it be evident that the chamber be not only dissatisfied but actively hostile w and he friend be very discourage and disgust they have go as far as they could in the way of concession w at any rate would do no more and it be evident that the chamber would seize the first pretext to overthrow the ministry w see grévy very often he be oppose to any change do not want w to go say he presence at the foreign office give confidence to europe -- he might perhaps remain at the foreign office and resign as premier but that naturally he would not do he be really sick of the whole thing grévy be a thorough republican but a old-fashioned republican -- not in the least enthusiastic rather sceptical -- do not at all see the ideal republic dream of by the younger man -- where all man be alike -- and nothing but honesty and true patriotism be the ruling motive i do not know if he go as far as a well-known diplomatist prince metternich i think who say he be so tired of the word fraternité that if he have a brother he would call he cousin grévy be certainly very unwilling to see thing pass into the hand of the more advanced left i do not think he could have do anything -- they say no constitutional president -lrb- or king either -rrb- can there be a great rivalry between he and gambetta both man have such a strong position in the republican party that it be a pity they could not understand each other i suppose they be too unlike -- gambetta live in a atmosphere of flattery and adulation he head might well have be turn -- all he familiar be at he foot hang upon he word put he on a pinnacle as a splendid patriot grévy 's entourage be much calmer recognize he great ability and he keen legal mind not so enthusiastic but always want to have he opinion and rely a good deal upon he judgment there be of course all sort of meeting and conversation at we house with léon say jule ferry casimir périer and other st vallier come on from berlin where he be still ambassador he be very anxious about the state of affair in france -- say bismarck be very worry at the great step the radical have make in the new parliament -- be afraid the moderate man would have no show _ i _ believe he be pleased and hope that a succession of incapable ministry and internal quarrel would weaken france still more -- and prevent she from take she place again as a great power he be not a generous victor as long as w be at the foreign office thing go very smoothly he and st vallier think alike on most subject home politics and foreign -- and since the berlin congress where w have come in touch with all the principal man in germany it be of course much easier for they to work together we dine generally with my mother on Sunday night -- particularly at this time of the year when the official banquet have not begin and we sunday be free the evening be always interesting as we see so many people english and american always and in fact all nationality we have live abroad so much that we know people all over the world -- it be a change from the eternal politics and shop talk we hear everywhere else some of they english particularly -lrb- i do not think the american care much about foreign politics -rrb- be most interested and curious over what be go on and the probable fall of the cabinet a english lady say to I : how dreadful it will be for you when you husband be no longer minister you life will be so dull and you will be of so much less importance the last part of the sentence be undoubtedly true -- any functionary 's wife have a certain importance in france and when you husband have be foreign minister and premier you fall from a certain height but i could not accept the first part that my life would be necessarily dull because i be no longer what one of my friend say in italy speak of a minister 's wife a donna publica i begin to explain that i really have some interest in life outside of politics but she be so convinced of the truth of she observation that it be quite useless to pursue the conversation and i naturally do not care another one a american this time say to I : i hope you do not mind my never have be to see you since you be marry but i never could remember you name i only know it begin with w and one see it very often in the papers arthur sullivan the english composer be there one night he have come over to pari to hear one of he symphony play at the conservatoire and be very much pleased with the way it have be receive by that very critical audience he be quite surprised to find the parisian so enthusiastic -- have always hear the pari salle be so cold miss kellogg the american prima donna be there too that evening and we make a great deal of music she singing and sullivan accompany by heart mr freeman wife of one of the english secretary tell w that queen victorium have so enjoy she talk with he -- quite as if i be talk with one of my own minister she have find grévy rather stiff and reserve -- say they conversation be absolutely banal they speak in french and as grévy know nothing of england or the english the interview could not have be interesting we see a great many people that last month dine with all we colleague of the diplomatic corps they be already dîners d'adieux as every day in the papers the fall of the ministry be announce and the name of the new minister publish i think the diplomatist be sorry to see w go but of course they could not feel very strongly on the subject they business be to be on good term with all the foreign minister and to get as much as they can out of they they be with rare exception bird of passage and do not trouble themselves much about change cabinet however they be all very civil not too diffuse and one have the impression that they would be just as civil to we successor and to he successor it must be so there be no profession so absolutely banal as diplomacy all diplomatist from the ambassador to the youngest secretary must follow they instruction and if by any chance a ambassador do take any initiative profit by be on the spot and know the character of the people he be promptly disown by he chief i have grow very philosophical be quite ready to go or to stay do not mind the fight any more nor the attack on w which be not very vicious but so absurd that no one who know he could attach the least importance to they he do not care a pin he have always be a protestant with a english name educate in england so the reiteration of these fact very much exaggerated and lead up to the conclusion that on account of he birth and education he could not be a convinced french republican do not affect he very much he have always promise I a winter in italy when he leave office he have never be in rome and i be delighted at the prospect of see that lovely land again all blue sky and bright sun and smile face we dine often with ml w 's uncle who keep we au courant of all -lrb- and it be little -rrb- that be go on in the royalist camp but that be not of importance the advanced republican be have it all they own way and it be evident that the day of conciliatory measure and moderate man be over w be not a club man go very rarely to he club but he uncle go every afternoon before dinner and give we all the potin -lrb- gossip -rrb- of that world very hostile to the republic and still quite believe that they turn would come he uncle be not of that opinion he be a very clever man a diplomatist who have live in a great many place and know a great many people and be entirely on the royalist side but he think they cause be a lose one at least for a time he often ask some of he friend to meet we at dinner say it be a good thing for w to hear what man on the other side thought and w be quite pleased to meet they they be all absolutely oppose to he in politics and discussion sometimes run high but there be never anything personal -- all be man of the world have see many change in france in they life many have play a part in politics under the former régimes it seem to I that they underrate the intelligence and the strength of the republican party one of the regular habitués be the marquis de n a charming man fairly broad-minded -lrb- give the atmosphere he live in -rrb- and sceptical to the highest degree he be a great friend of marshal macmahon and have be préfet at pau where he have a great position he be very dictatorial very outspoken but be a great favorite particularly with the english colony which be large there in the hunting-season he have accept to dine one night with a english family who live in a villa a little out of town they have a accident en route which delay they very much and when he and the marquise arrive the party be at table he instantly have he carriage call back and leave the house in spite of all the explanation and apology of he host say that when one have the honor of receive the marquis de n one wait dinner for he we see always a great deal of he as he daughter marry the comte de f who be for some time in w 's cabinet at the quaus d'orsay and afterward with we the ten year we be at the london embassy where they be quite part of the family they be both perfectly fit for diplomatic life particularly in england both speak english well know everybody and remember all the face and all the name no easy thing in england where the name and title change so often i know several englishwoman who have have four different name lady holland be also a friend of oncle alphonse and dine there often she be delicate-looking rather quiet in general conversation though she speak french easily but be interesting when she be talk to one or two people we go often to she beautiful house in london the first year we be at the embassy and always meet interesting people she salon be very cosmopolitan -- every one who come to london want to go to holland house which be a museum fill with beautiful thing another lady who be often at my uncle 's be quite a different type mademoiselle a a old pupil of the conservatoire who have make a short career at the comédie française many year before she be really charming and she story of the couliss and the jalousy between the author and the actor particularly the star -lrb- who hardly accept the slightest observation from the writer of the play -rrb- be most amusing once the piece be accept it pass into the domain of the theater and the actor feel at liberty to interpret the rôles accord to they idea and tradition she have a perfect diction it be a delight to hear she she recite one night one of alphonse daudet 's little conte lettre de mon moulin i think beginning -- quus n ' a pas vu avignon du temp des papes n ' a rien vu one could not hear anything more charming in a perfectly trained voice and so easily and naturally say i suppose no one would listen to it in these day bridge have suppress all conversation or music or artistic enjoyment of any kind it must come to a end some day like all craze but at the present moment it have destroy society it have be a godsend to many people of no particular importance or position who have use it as a stepping-stone to get into society if people play a good game of bridge they be welcome guest in a great many house which formerly would have be close to they and it be a great resource to lady no longer very young widow and spinster who find they day long and do not know what to do with they life notwithstanding he preoccupation w manage to get a few day ' shooting in November he shoot several time at rambouillet with grévy who be a excellent shot and he shooting breakfast be very pleasant there be plenty of game everything very well organised and the company agreeable he always ask the minister ambassador and many of the lead political man and very often some of he old friend lawyer and man of various profession whom w be delighted to meet they idea do not run in groove like most of the man he live with and it be a pleasure to hear talk that be not political nor personal the vicious attack upon person be so try those first day of the republic every man who be a little more prominent than he neighbor seem a target for every kind of insinuation and criticism we go for two day to pout casimir périer 's fine place in the département de l'aube where we have capital shooting it be already extremely cold for the season -- the big pond in the court be frozen hard and the wind whistle about we ear when we drive in a open carriage to join the shooter at breakfast even i who do not usually feel the cold be thankful to be well wrap up in fur the pavillon d'hiver look very invite as we drive up -- a immense fire be blaze in the chimney another just outside where the soup and ragout for the army of beater be be prepare we all have nice little foot-warmer under we chair and be as comfortable as possible it be too warm in fact when the shooter come in and we sit down to breakfast we be oblige to open the door the talk be entirely shop at breakfast every man tell what he have kill or miss and the minute they have finish breakfast they start off again we follow one or two battue -lrb- pheasant -rrb- but it be really too cold and we be glad to walk home to get warm the dinner and evening be pleasant -- everybody talking -- most of they criticise the government freely w do not mind they be all friend he defend himself sometimes merely ask what they would have do in he place -- he be quite ready to receive any suggestion -- but nothing practical ever come out of the discussion i think the most delightful political position in the world must be leader of the opposition -- you have no responsibility can concentrate all you energy in point out the weak spot in you adversary 's armor and have always you work cut out for you for as soon as one ministry fall you can set to work to demolish its successor which seem the most interesting occupation possible the great question which be disturb the chamber and the country be the general amnesty that of course w would never agree to there might be exception some of the man who take part in the commune be so young little more than lad carry away by the example of they elder and the excitement of the moment and there be fiery patriotic article in almost all the republican papers invite france to make the beau geste of la mère patrie and open she arm to she misguided child and various sensible experienced man really think it would be better to wipe out everything and start again with no dark memory to cast a shadow on the beginning of the young republic how many brilliant sanguine impossible theory i hear advance all those day and how the few remain member of the center gauche try to reason with the most liberal man of the center droit and to persuade they frankly to face the fact that the country have send a strong republican majority to parliament and to make the best of the fait accompli i suppose it be ask too much of they to go back on the tradition of they life but after all they be frenchman they country be just recover from a terrible disaster and have need of all she child during the franco-prussian war all party feeling be forget every man be first a frenchman in the face of a foreign foe and if they could have stand firmly together in those first day after the war the strength of the country would have be wonderful all europe be astounded at the way in which france pay she milliard -- no one more so than bismarck who be suppose to have say that if he could have dream that france could pay that enormous sum so quickly he would have ask much more December be very cold snow and ice everywhere and very hard frost which do not give way at all when the sun come out occasionally in the middle of the day everybody be skate not only at the club of the bois de boulogne but on the lake which happen very rarely as the water be fairly deep the seine be full of large block of ice which get jam up against the bridge and make a jarring ugly sound as they knock against each other the river steamer have stop run and there be crowd of flaneur loitering on the quai and bridge wonder if the cold would last long enough for the river to be quite freeze over w and i go two or three time to the cercle des patineurs at the bois de boulogne and have a good skate the woman do not skate as well then as they do now but they look very pretty in they costume of velvet and sable it be funny to see they stumble over the ice with a man support they on each side however they enjoy it very much it be beautiful winter weather very cold but no wind and it be very good exercise all the world be there and the afternoon pass quickly enough i have not skate for year have spend all my winter in italy but on the principle that you never forget anything that you know well i think i would try and will say that the first half-hour be absolute suffer it be in the old day when one still wear a strap over the instep which naturally be draw very tight my foot be like lump of ice as heavy as lead and i do not seem able to lift they from the ground i go back to the dressing-room to take my skate off for a few minute and when the blood begin to circulate again i could have cry with the pain a friend of mine a beginner who be sit near wait to have she skate put on be rather discourage and say to I : you do not look as if you be enjoy yourself i do not think i will try oh yes you must -- ` les commencements sont toujor difficile ' and you will learn i shall be all right as soon as i start again she look rather doubtful but i see she again later in the day when i have forget all about my suffering and she be skate as easily as i do when i be a girl i think one must learn young after all it be more or less a question of balance when one be young one do not mind a fall w who have retire to a corner to practice a little by himself tell I that one of he friend comte de pourtalès not at all of he way of think in politics a imperialist be much pleased with a little jeu d'esprit he have make at he expense w catch the top of he skate in a crevice in the ice and come down rather heavily in a sit posture comte de pourtalès who be stand near on the bank see the fall and call out instantly est-ce possible que je voie le président du conseil par terre -lrb- be it possible that the president du conseil have fall -rrb- the little joke be quite de bonne guerre and quite appropriate as the cabinet be totter and very near its fall it amuse w quite as much as it do the bystander the cold be increase every day the ground be freeze hard the street very slippery and go very difficult all we horse be rough shod but even with that we make very slow progress some of the omnibus be on runner and one or two of the young man of the ministry have take off the wheel of they light carriage and put they on runner but one do not see many real sleigh or sledge as they call they here i fancy sleigh be entirely a american expression the seine be at last completely take and the public be allow on the ice which be very thick it be a very pretty animated sight many booth like those one see on the boulevard during the christmas holiday be install on the ice close to the bank and the river be black with people they could not skate much as the ice be rough and there be too many people but they run and slide and shout and enjoy themselves immensely i want to cross one day with my boy that he might say he have cross the seine on foot but w be rather unwilling however the préfet de la seine whom he consult tell he there be absolutely no danger -- the ice be several inch thick so i start off one afternoon one of the secretary go with I he be much astonished and rather nervous at see I in my ordinary boot he have nail in he and one of we friend whom we meet on the ice have woollen sock over he boot they be sure i would slip and perhaps get a bad fall but no one could slip on that ice it be quite rough might almost be a ploughed field -- but they be uncomfortable and be very pleased when i land safely on the other side and get into the carriage just in the middle the boy have sweep a path on the ice to make a glissade they be race up and down in band and the constant passing have make it quite level and very slippery we see three or four unwary pedestrian get a fall but if one keep on the outside near the bank there be no danger of slip the extreme cold lasting so long bring many discomfort many train with wood and provision could not get to pari the railroad be all block and the parisian be get uneasy fear they might run short of food and fuel we be very comfortable in the big room of the ministry there be roar fire everywhere and two or three calorifères the view from the window on the quaus be charming as long as the great cold last particularly at night when the river be alive with people light and color lantern and music every now and then there would be a ronde or a farandole -- the farandole force its way through the crowd every one carry a lantern and look like a brilliant snake wind in and out we have some people dine one night and they could not keep away from the window some of the young one -lrb- english -rrb- want to go down and have a lark on the ice but it be not possible the crowd though thoroughly good-humoured merely bent on enjoy themselves have degenerate into a rabble one would have be oblige to have a strong escort of police and besides in evening dress even with fur cloak and the fur and woollen boot every one wear over they thin shoe one would certainly have risk get a bad attack of pneumonia one of we great friend sir henry hoare be dine that night but he do not want to go down preferred smoking he cigar in a warm room and talk politics to w he have be a great deal in paris know everybody and be a member of the jockey club he be much interested in french politics and au fond be very liberal quite sympathise with w and he friend and share they opinion on most subject though as he say i do not air those opinion at the jockey club he come often to we big reception like to see all the people he too use to tell I all that be say in he club about the republic and the government but he be a shrewd observer have be a long time a mp in england and have come to the conclusion that the talk at the club be chiefly a pose -- they do not really have many illusion about the restoration of the monarchy could not have when even the duc de broglie with he intelligence and follow -lrb- the faubourg st germain follow he blindly -rrb- could do nothing but make a constitutional republic with marshal macmahon at its head it be always say too that the woman be more uncompromising than the man i go one afternoon to a concert at the austrian embassy give in aid of some inundation which have be a catastrophe for that country hundred of house and people and cattle sweep away the french public have respond most generously as they always do to the urgent appeal make by the ambassador in the name of the emperor and the government have contribute largely to the fund count beust the austrian ambassador be oblige of course to invite the government and madame grévy to the entertainment as well as he friend of the faubourg st germain neither madame nor mademoiselle grévy come but some of the minister ' wife do and it be funny to see the lady of society look at the republican lady as if they be denizen of a different planet strange figure they be not accustom to see it be curious to think of all that now when relation be much less strained i remember not very long ago at a party at one of the embassy see many of the society woman have themselves present to the wife of the then minister of foreign affair with whom they certainly have nothing in common neither birth breeding nor mode of life i be talk to casimir périer -lrb- late president of the republic -rrb- and it amuse we very much to see the various introduction and the great empressement of the lady all of whom be ask to be present to madame r what can all those woman want i ask he he reply promptly embassy for they husband it would have be better i think in a worldly point of view if more embassy have be give to the bearer of some of the great name of france -- but there be so many candidate for every description of function in france just then from a ambassador to a gendarme that anybody who have anything to give find himself in a difficult position xi last day at the foreign office the end of December be detestable we be en pleine crise for ten day every day w go to the chamber of deputy expect to be beat and every evening come home discourage and disgust the chamber be make the position of the minister perfectly untenable -- all sort of violent and useless proposition be discuss and there be a undercurrent of jealousy and intrigue everywhere one day just before christmas about the 20th w and he chef de cabinet comte de p start for the house after breakfast -- w expect to be beat by a coalition vote of the extreme left bonapartist and legitimist it be a insane policy on the part of the two last as they know perfectly well they would not gain anything by upset the actual cabinet they would only get another one much more advanced and more masterful i suppose they idea be to have a succession of radical inefficient minister which in the end would disgust the country and make a savior a prince -lrb- which one -rrb- or general possible how wise they reasoning be time have show i want to go to the chamber to hear the debate but w do not want I he would be oblige to speak and say it would worry he if i be in the gallery listen to all the attack make upon he -lrb- it be rather curious that i never hear he speak in public either in the house or in the country where he often make political speech in election time -rrb- he be so sure that the ministry would fall that we have already begin cleaning and make fire in we own house so on that afternoon as i do not want to sit at home wait for telegram i go up to the house with henrietta the caretaker have already tell we that the stock of wood and coal be give out and she could not get any more in the quarter and if she could not make fire the pipe would burst which be a pleasant prospect with the thermometer at i do not remember how many degree below zero we find a fine cleaning go on -- door and window open all over the house -- and woman scrub stair floor and window rather under difficulty with little fire and little water it look perfectly dreary and comfortless -- not at all tempting all the furniture be pile up in the middle of the room and w 's library be a curiosity book and pamphlet accumulate rapidly with we w be a member of many literary society of all kind all over the world and package and box of unopened book quite choke up the room h and i try to arrange thing a little but it be hopeless that day and besides the house be bitterly cold it do not feel as if a fire could make any impression as we could do nothing there we go back to the ministry no telegram have come but kruft we faithful and efficient chef du matériel be wait for I for last instruction about a christmas tree some day before i have decide to have a christmas tree about the end of the month w then think the ministry would last over the holiday the trêve des confiseurs and be quite willing i should have a christmas party as a last entertainment he have be too occupy the last day to think about any such trifle and kruft not have have any contrary instruction have order the present and decoration he be rather depressed because w have tell he that morning that we surely would not be at the quaus d'orsay on the 29th the day we have choose for we party however i reassure he and tell he we would have the christmas tree all the same only at my house instead of at the ministry we go to look at he present which be all spread out on a big table in one of the drawing-room he really be a wonderful man never forget anything and have remember that at the last tree the year before one or two nurse have have no present and several who have be not please with what be give to they he have make a very good selection for those lady -- lace scarf and rabat and little tour de cou of fur -- really very pretty i believe they be satisfy this time the young man of the chancery send I up two telegram : rien de nouveau -- ministère debout -lrb- illustration : m de freyeinet after a photograph by m nadaz pari -rrb- w come home late very tired and much disgusted with politics in general and he party in particular the cabinet still live but merely to give grévy time to make another w have be to the elysée and have a long conversation with grévy he find he very preoccupy very unwilling to make a change and he again urge w very much to keep the foreign office if freycinet should succeed in make a ministry that w would not agree to -- he be sick of the whole thing he tell grévy he be quite right to send for freycinet -- if any man could save the situation he could we have one or two friend political man to dinner and they discuss the situation from every point of view always end with the same conclusion that w be right to go he policy be not the policy of the chamber -lrb- i do not say of the country for i think the country know little and care less about what be go on in parliament -rrb- hardly the policy of all he own colleague there be really no use to continue worry himself to death and do no good w say he conversation with grévy be interesting but he be much more concerned with home politics and the sweeping change the republican want to make in all the administration than with foreign policy he say europe be quiet and france 's first duty be to establish herself firmly which would only be do by peace and prosperity at home i tell w i have spend a very cold and uncomfortable hour at the house and i be worry about the cold thought i might perhaps send the boy to mother but he have take he precaution and arrange with the minister of war to have a certain amount of wood deliver at the house they always have reserve of wood at the various ministry we have ours directly from we own wood in the country and it be en route but a flotilla of boat be freeze up in the canal de l'ourcq and it might be week before the wood could be deliver we dine one night at the british embassy while all these pourparler be go on en petit comité all english lord and lady reay lord edmond fitz-maurice and one or two member of parliament whose name i have forget both lord and lady reay be very keen about politics know france well and be much interested in the phase she be pass through lord lyon be charming so friendly and sensible say he be not surprise at w 's want to go -- still hope this crisis would pass like so many other he have see in france that certainly w 's presence at the foreign office during the last year have be a help to the republic -- say also he do not believe he retirement would last very long it be frightfully cold when we come out of the embassy -- very few carriage out all the coachman wrap up in muffler and fur cap and the place de la concorde a sea of ice so slippery i think we should never get across and over the bridge i go to the opera one night that week get there in a entr ` acte when people be walk about and read the papers as i pass several group of man i hear w 's name mention also that of léon say and freycinet but just in pass by quickly i could not hear any comment i fancy they be not favourable in that milieu it be very cold in the house -- almost all the woman have they cloak on -- and the come out be something awful cross that broad perron in the face of a bite wind i begin my packing seriously this time as w 's mind be quite make up he have think the matter well over and have a final talk with freycinet who would have like to keep both w and léon say but it be not easy to manage the new element that freycinet bring with he the new member be much more advance in they opinion w could not have work with they and they certainly do not want to work with he the autumn session come to a turbulent end on the 26th of December and the next day the papers announce that the minister have give they resignation to the president who have accept they and have charge m de freycinet to form a cabinet we dine with mother on christmas day a family party with the addition of comte de p and one or two stray american who be at hotel and be of course delighted not to dine on christmas day at a table d'hôte or café w be rather tire the constant talking and see so many people of all kind be very fatiguing for as long as he resignation be not official announce in the _ journal officiel _ he be still minister of foreign affair one of the last day when they be hope to come to a agreement he be oblige to come home early to receive the mission from morocco i see they arrive they be a fine set of man tall powerfully build they skin a red-brown not black entirely dress in white from turban to sandal none of they speak any french -- all the conversation take place through a interpreter notwithstanding we worry we have a very pleasant evening and w be very cheerful -- look forward to we italian trip with quite as much pleasure as i do w make over the ministry to freycinet on Monday the 28th the transmission des pouvoirs freycinet be very nice and friendly regret that he and w be no longer colleague he think he ministry be strong and be confident he would manage the chamber w tell he he could settle himself as soon as he like at the quaus d'orsay as we should go at once and would sleep at we house on Wednesday night freycinet say madame de freycinet -lrb- whom i know well and like very much -rrb- would come and see I on Wednesday and would like to go over the house with I i be rather take aback when w tell I we must sleep in we own house on Wednesday night the actual packing be not very troublesome as i have not bring many of my own thing from the rue dumont d'urville there be scarcely a van-load of small furniture and box but the get together of all the small thing be a bear -- book bibelot music card and note -lrb- these in quantity lettre de condoléance which have to be carefully sort as they have all to be answer -rrb- the hotel of the quaus d'orsay be crowd with people those last two day all w 's friend come to express they regret at he departure some very sincerely sorry to see he go as he name and character certainly inspire confidence abroad -- and some delighted that he be no longer a member of such a advanced cabinet -- -lrb- some say de cet infect gouvernement -rrb- where he be oblige by he mere presence to sanction many thing he do not approve of he and freycinet have a long talk on Wednesday as w naturally want to be sure that some provision would be make for he chef de cabinet and secretary each incoming minister bring he own staff with he freycinet offer w the london embassy but he would not take it have have enough of public life for the present i do not want it either i have never live much in england have not many friend there and be count the day until we could get off to rome there be one funny result of w have decline the london embassy admiral pothnau whom w have name there and who be very much like come to see he one day and make a great scene because freycinet have offer he the london embassy w say he do not understand why he make a scene as he have refuse it but it should never have be offer to you over my head perhaps but that be not my fault i do not ask for it -- and do not want it if you think you have be treat badly you should speak to freycinet however the admiral be very much put out and be very cool with we both for a long time i suppose he idea be that be recall would mean that he have not do well in london which be quite a mistake as he be very much like there we dine alone that last night at the ministry and sit some time in the window look at the crowd of people amusing themselves on the seine and wonder if we should ever see the quaus d'orsay again after all we have have two very happy interesting year there -- and memory that would last a lifetime -- some of the last experience of the month of December have be rather disillusion but i suppose one must not bring any sentiment into politics in the world it be always a case of donnant -- donnant -- and -- when one be no longer in a position to give a great deal -- people naturally turn to the rise man comte de p chef de cabinet come in late as usual to have a last talk he too have be busy as he have a small apartment and stable in the hotel of the ministry and be also very anxious to get away he tell we all the young man of the cabinet be very sorry to see w go -- at first they have find he a little cold and reserve -- but a two year ' experience have show they that if he be not expansive he be perfectly just and always do what he say he would the next day madame de freycinet come to see I and we go over the house she do not care about the living-room as they never live at the quaus d'orsay remain in they own hotel near the bois de boulogne freycinet come every day to the ministry and she merely on reception day -- or when there be a party just as she be go madame de zuylen wife of the dutch minister a great friend of mine come in she tell I she have great difficulty in get up as i have forbid my door but my faithful gérard -lrb- i think i miss he as much as anything else at first -rrb- know we be friend think madame would like to see she she pay I quite a long visit -- i even give she some tea off government plate and china -- all mine have be already send to my own house we sit talk for some time she have hear that w have refuse the london embassy be afraid it be a mistake and that the winter in pari would be a difficult one for he -- he would certainly be in opposition to the government on all sort of question -- and if he remain in paris he would naturally go to the senate and vote i quite agree that he could not suddenly detach himself from all political discussion -- must take part in they and must vote the policy of abstention have always seem to I the weakest possible line in politics if a man for some reason or another have not the courage of he opinion he must not take any position where that opinion would carry weight i tell she we be go to italy as soon as we could get off after the holiday while we be talk a message come up to say that the young man of the cabinet be all come up to say good-bye to I i have see the director earlier in the day so madame de zuylen take she leave promise to come to my christmas tree in the rue dumont d'urville the young man seem sorry to say good-bye -- i be too i have see a great deal of they and always find they ready and anxious to help I in every way the comte de lasteyrie who be a great friend of ours as well as a secretary go about a great deal with we w call upon he very often for all sort of thing know he could trust he absolutely he tell one of my friend that one of he principal function be to accompany madame waddington to all the charity sale carry a package of woman 's chemise under he arm it be quite true that i often buy poor clothes at the sale the object expose in the way of screen pincushion table-cover and in the spring hat make by some of the lady be so appalling that i be glad to have poor clothes to fall back upon but i do not remember he ever carry my purchase home with I they be much amuse when suddenly franci burst into the room have escape a moment from he nonnon who be busy with she last pack he little face flush and quiver with anger because he toy have be pack and he be to be take away from the big house he kick and scream like a little mad thing until he nurse come to the rescue i make a last turn in the room to see that all trace of my occupation have vanish franci half pacify be seat on the billiard-table a old grey-haired huissier who be always on duty up-stair take care of he the huissier and house servant be all assemble in the hall and the old pierson who have be there for year be the spokesman and hope respectfully that madame would soon come back w do not come with we as he still have people to see and only get home in time for a late dinner we dine that night and for many night afterward with we uncle lutteroth -lrb- who have a charming hotel fill with picture and bibelot and pretty thing -rrb- just across the street as it be some little time before we kitchen and household get into work order again the first few day be of course very tiring and uncomfortable -- the house seem so small after the big room at the quaus d'orsay i do not attempt to do anything with the salon as we be go away so soon -- carpet and curtain have to be arrange to keep the cold out but the big box remain in the carriage house -- not unpacked we have a procession of visitor all day -- and try to make w 's library possible -- comfortable it be not as there be package of book and papers and box everywhere i have a good many visit and flower on new year 's day -- which be a agreeable surprise -- lord lyon orloff the sibbern comte de ségur m alfr andré and other andré a old friend of w 's a very conservative protestant banker be very blue about affair andré be the type of the modern french protestant they be almost a separate class in france -- be very earnest religious honorable narrow-minded people they give a great deal in charity and good work of all kind in paris the protestant coterie be very rich they associate with all the catholic as many of they entertain a great deal but they live among themselves and never intermarry i hardly know a case where a french protestant have marry a catholic i suppose it be a remnant of they old huguenot blood and the memory of all they forefather suffer for they religion which make they so intolerant the ambassador have pay they usual official visit to the elysée -- say grévy be very smile and amiable do not seem at all preoccupy we have a family dinner at my uncle 's on new year 's night and all the family with wonderful unanimity say the best wish they could make for w be that 1880 would see he out of politics and lead a independent if less interesting life a interesting life it certainly be hear so many question discuss see all sort of people of all nationality and live as it be behind the scene the chamber of deputy in itself be a study with its astounding change of opinion with no apparent cause one never know in the morning what the afternoon 's session would bring for as soon as the republican party feel themselves firmly establish they begin to quarrel among themselves i go back to the ministry one afternoon to pay a formal visit to madame de freycinet on she reception day i have rather put it off think that the sight of the well-known room and face would be disagreeable to I and make I regret perhaps the past but i feel already that all that old life be over -- one adapt one 's self so quickly to different surroundings it do seem funny to be announce by my own special huissier gérard and to find myself sit in the green drawing-room with all the palm and flower arrange just as they always be for I and a semicircle of diplomat say exactly the same thing to madame de freycinet that they have say to I a few day before but i fancy that always happen in these day of democracy and equalise education and that under certain circumstance we all say and do exactly the same thing i have quite a talk with sibbern the swedish minister who be very friendly and sympathetic not only at we leave the foreign office but at the extreme discomfort of move in such frightfully cold weather he be wrap in fur as if he be go to the north pole however i assure he we be quite warm and comfortable gradually settle down into we old way and i be already look back on my two year at the quaus d'orsay as a agreeable episode in my life i have quite a talk too with the portuguese minister mende leal he be a interesting man a poet and a dreamer see more i fancy of the literary world of pari than the political blowitz be there of course -- be always everywhere in moment of crisis talk a great deal and let it be understand that he have pull a great many wire all those last week he too regret that w have not take the london embassy assure I that it would have be a very agreeable appointment in england -- be surprise that i have not urge it i reply that i have not be consult many people ask when they could come and see I -- would i take up my reception day again that be not worth while as i be go away so soon but i say i would be there every day at five o'clock and always have visit -lrb- illustration : mme sadus carnot from a drawing by mlle amelie beaury-saurel -rrb- one day madame sadi carnot sit a long time with I she husband have be name undersecretary at the ministry of public work in the new cabinet and she be very pleased she be a very charming intelligent cultivate woman -- read a great deal be very keen about politics and very ambitious -lrb- as every clever woman should be -rrb- for she husband and son i think she be a great help socially to she husband when he become president of the republic he be a grave reserved man do not care very much for society i see she very often and always find she most attractive at the elysée she be amiable and courteous to everybody and she slight deafness do not seem to worry she nor make conversation difficult she do such a charming womanly thing just after she husband 's assassination he lay in state for some day at the elysée and m casimir périer he successor go to make she a visit as he be leave he say he wife would come the next day to see madame carnot she instantly answer pray do not let she come she be young begin she life here at the elysée i would not for world that she should have the impression of sadness and gloom that must hang over the palace as long as the president be lie there i should like she to come to the elysée only when all trace of this tragedy have go -- and to have no sad association -- on the contrary with the prospect of a long happy future before she -lrb- illustration : _ photograph copyright by pierre petit pari _ president sadus carnot -rrb- w go the two or three friday we be in pari to the institute where he be most warmly receive by he colleague who have much regret he enforced absence the year he be at the foreign office he tell they he be go to rome where he hope still to find some treasure in the shape of inscription inédites with the help of he friend lancianus the day pass quickly enough until we start it be not altogether a rest as there be always so many people at the house and w want to put order into he papers before he leave freycinet make various change at the quaus d'orsay m desprey directeur de la politique -lrb- a post he have occupy for year -rrb- be name ambassador to rome in the place of the marquis de gabriac i do not think he be very anxious to go he career have be make almost entirely at the foreign office and he be much more at home in he cabinet with all he papers and book about he than he would be abroad among stranger he come to dinner one night and we talk the thing over w think the rest and change would do he good he be name to the vatican where necessarily there be much less to do in the way of social life than at the quirinal he be perfectly au courant of all the question between the vatican and the french clergy -- he son secretary of embassy would go with he it seem rather a pleasant prospect w go once or twice to the senate as the house meet on the 12th or 14th of January but there be nothing very interesting those first day the chamber be take breath after the holiday and the last ministerial crisis and give the new ministry a chance i think freycinet have he hand full but he be quite equal to the task i go late one afternoon to the elysée i have write to madame grévy to ask if she would receive I before i leave for italy when i arrive the one footman at the door tell I madame grévy be un peu souffrante would see I up-stairs i go up a side staircase rather dark precede by the footman who usher I into madame grévy 's bedroom it look perfectly uncomfortable -- be large with very high ceiling stiff gilt furniture standing against the wall and the heat something awful -- a blaze fire in the chimney madame grévy be sit in a armchair near the fire a gray shawl on she shoulder and a lace fichu on she head it be curiously unlike the bedroom i have just leave i have be to see a friend who be also souffrante she be lie under a lace coverlet line with pink silk lace and embroidered cushion all around she flower pink lamp-shades silver flacon everything most luxurious and modern the contrast be striking madame grévy be very civil and talkative -- say she be very tired the big dinner and late hour she find very fatiguing she quite understand that i be glad to get away but do not think it be very prudent to travel in such bitterly cold weather -- and rome be very far and be not i afraid of fever i tell she i be a old roman -- have live there for year know the climate well and do not think it be worse than any other she say the president have have a visit from w and a very long talk with he and that he regret he departure very much but that he do not think monsieur waddington be au fond de son sac grévy be always a good friend to w -- on one or two occasion when there be a sort of cabal against he grévy take he part very warmly -- and in all question of home policy and person w find he a very keen shrewd observer -- though he say very little -- rarely express a opinion i do not make a very long visit -- find my way down-stair as well as i could -- no servant be visible either on the stair or in the hall and my own footman open the big door and let I out we get off the first day of February -- as up to the last moment w have people to see we go for two or three day to bourneville -- i have one or two very cold tramp in the wood -lrb- very dry -rrb- which be quite unusual at this time of the year but the earth be frozen hard inside the wood we be well sheltered but when we come out on the plain the cold and icy wind be awful the workman have make fire to burn the root and rotten wood and we be very glad to stop and warm ourselves some have they child with they who look half perish with cold always insufficiently clad but they be quite happy roast potato in the ash i be so cold that i tie a woollen scarf around my head just as the woman in canada do when they go sleighing or skating we have a breakfast one day for some of w 's influential man in the country who be much disgusted at the turn affair have take and that w could no longer remain minister but they be very fairly au courant of all that be go on in parliament and quite understand that for the moment the moderate experienced man have no chance the
