produce by afra ullah virginia paque and pg distribute proofreader the theory of social revolution by brook adam 1913 prefatory note the first chapter of the follow book be publish in substantially its present form in the _ atlantic monthly _ for April 1913 i have to thank the editor for he courtesy in assent to my wish to reprint the other chapter have not appear before i desire also to express my obligation to my learn friend dr mm bigelow who most kindly at my request read chapter two and three which deal with the constitutional law and give I the benefit of he most valuable criticism further than this i have but one word to add i have write in support of no political movement nor for any ephemeral purpose i have write only to express a deep conviction which be the result of more than twenty year of study and reflection upon this subject brook adam quincy massachusett may 17 1913 contents i the collapse of capitalistic government ii the limitation of the judicial function iii american court as legislative chamber iv the social equilibrium v political court vi inference index -lrb- not include in this etext -rrb- the theory of social revolution chapter i the collapse of capitalistic government civilization i apprehend be nearly synonymous with order however much we may differ touch such matter as the distribution of property the domestic relation the law of inheritance and the like most of we i should suppose would agree that without order civilization as we understand it can not exist now although the optimist contend that since man can not foresee the future worry about the future be futile and that everything in the best possible of world be inevitably for the best i think it clear that within recent year a uneasy suspicion have come into be that the principle of authority have be dangerously impaired and that the social system if it be to cohere must be reorganize so far as my observation have extend such intuition be usually not without a adequate cause and if there be reason for anxiety anywhere it surely should be in the united state with its unwieldy bulk its heterogeneous population and its complex government therefore i submit that a hour may not be quite waste which be pass in consider some of the recent phenomenon which have appear about we in order to ascertain if they can be group together in any comprehensible relation about a century ago after the american and french revolution and the napoleonic war the present industrial era open and bring with it a new govern class as every considerable change in human environment must bring with it a govern class to give it expression perhaps for lack of a recognize name i may describe this class as the industrial capitalistic class compose in the main of administrator and banker as nothing in the universe be stationary ruling class have they rise culmination and decline and i conjecture that this class attain to its acme of popularity and power at least in america toward the close of the third quarter of the nineteenth century i draw this inference from the fact that in the next quarter resistance to capitalistic method begin to take shape in such legislation as the interstate commerce law and the sherman act and almost at the opening of the present century a progressively rigorous opposition find for its mouthpiece the president of the union himself history may not be a very practical study but it teach some useful lesson one of which be that nothing be accidental and that if man move in a give direction they do so in obedience to a impulsion as automatic as be the impulsion of gravitation therefore if mr roosevelt become what he adversary be pleased to call a agitator he agitation have a cause which be as deserving of study as be the path of a cyclone this problem have long interested I and i harbor no doubt not only that the equilibrium of society be very rapidly shift but that mr roosevelt have half-automatically be stimulate by the instability about he to seek for a new center of social gravity in plain english i infer that he have conclude that industrialism have induce condition which can no longer be control by the old capitalistic method and that the country must be bring to a level of administrative efficiency competent to deal with the strain and stress of the twentieth century just as a hundred and twenty-five year ago the country be bring to a administrative level competent for that age by the adoption of the constitution act on these premise as i conjecture whether consciously work out or not mr roosevelt 's next step be to begin the readjustment but i infer that on attempt any correlate measure of reform mr roosevelt find progress impossible because of the obstruction of the court hence he instinct lead he to try to overleap that obstruction and he suggest without i suspect examine the problem very deeply that the people should assume the right of recall judicial decision make in cause which involve the nullifying of legislation what would have happen have mr roosevelt be give the opportunity to thoroughly formulate he idea even in the midst of a election can never be know for it chance that he be force to deal with subject as vast and complex as ever vex a statesman or a jurist under difficulty at least equal to the difficulty of the task itself if the modern mind have develop one characteristic more markedly than another it be a impatience with prolonged demand on its attention especially if the subject be tedious no one could imagine that the new york press of to-day would print the disquisition which hamilton write in 1788 in support of the constitution or that if it do any one would read they least of all the lawyer and yet mr roosevelt 's audience be emotional and discursive even for a modern american audience hence if he attempt to lead at all he have little choice but to adopt or at least discuss every nostrum for reach a immediate millennium which happen to be uppermost although at the same time he have to defend himself against a attack compare with which any criticism to which hamilton may have be subject resemble a caress the result have be that the progressive movement bearing mr roosevelt with it have degenerate into a disintegrate rather than a constructive energy which be i suspect likely to become a danger to every one interested in the maintenance of order not to say in the stability of property mr roosevelt be admittedly a strong and determine man whose instinct be arbitrary and yet if my analysis be sound we see he at the supreme moment of he life divert from he choose path toward centralization of power and project into a environment of apparently for the most part philanthropist and woman who could hardly conceivably form a party fit to aid he in establish a vigorous consolidated administrative system he must have find the pressure toward disintegration resistless and if we consider this most significant phenomenon in connection with a abundance of similar phenomenon in other country which indicate social incoherence we can hardly resist a grow apprehension touch the future nor be that apprehension allay if to reassure ourselves we turn to history for there we find on every side long series of precedent more ominous still be all other evidence lack the inference that radical change be at hand might be deduce from the past in the experience of the english-speaking race about once in every three generation a social convulsion have occur and probably such catastrophe must continue to occur in order that law and institution may be adapt to physical growth human society be a living organism work mechanically like any other organism it have member a circulation a nervous system and a sort of skin or envelope consist of its law and institution this skin or envelope however do not expand automatically as it would have providence intended humanity to be peaceful but be only fit to new condition by those painful and conscious effort which we call revolution usually these revolution be warlike but sometimes they be benign as be the revolution over which general washington we first great progressive preside when the rot confederation under he guidance be convert into a relatively excellent administrative system by the adoption of the constitution take for all in all i conceive general washington to have be the greatest man of the eighteenth century but to I he greatness chiefly consist in that balance of mind which enable he to recognize when a old order have pass away and to perceive how a new order could be best introduce joseph story be ten year old in 1789 when the constitution be adopt he earliest impression therefore be of the confederation and i know no better description of the interval just subsequent to the peace of 1783 than be contain in a few line in he dissent opinion in the charle river bridge case : -- in order to entertain a just view of this subject we must go back to that period of general bankruptcy and distress and difficulty -lrb- 1785 -rrb- the union of the state be crumble into ruin under the old confederation agriculture manufacture and commerce be at they lowest ebb there be infinite danger to all the state from local interest and jealousy and from the apparent impossibility of a much longer adherence to that shadow of a government the continental congress and even four year afterwards when every evil have be greatly aggravate and civil war be add to other calamity the constitution of the united state be all but shipwreck in pass through the state convention -lrb- 1 -rrb- this crisis accord to my computation be the normal one of the third generation between 1688 and 1765 the british empire have physically outgrow its legal envelope and the consequence be a revolution the thirteen american colony which form the western section of the imperial mass split from the core and drift into chaos beyond the constraint of exist law washington be in he way a large capitalist but he be much more he be not only a wealthy planter but he be a engineer a traveller to a extent a manufacturer a politician and a soldier and he see that as a conservative he must be progressive and raise the law to a power high enough to constrain all these thirteen refractory unit for washington understand that peace do not consist in talk platitude at conference but in organize a sovereignty strong enough to coerce its subject the problem of construct such a sovereignty be the problem which washington solve temporarily at least without violence he prevail not only because of a intelligence and elevation of character which enable he to comprehend and to persuade other that to attain a common end all must make sacrifice but also because he be support by a body of the most remarkable man whom america have ever produce man who though doubtless in a numerical minority take the country as a whole by sheer weight of ability and energy achieve they purpose yet even washington and he adherent could not alter the limitation of the human mind he could postpone but he could not avert the impact of conflict social force in 1789 he compromise but he do not determine the question of sovereignty he elude a impending conflict by introduce court as political arbitrator and the expedient work more or less well until the tension reach a certain point then it break down and the question of sovereignty have to be settle in america as elsewhere on the field of battle it be not decide until appomattox but the function of the court in american life be a subject which i shall consider hereafter if the invention of gunpowder and printing in the fourteenth and fifteenth century presage the reformation of the sixteenth and if the industrial revolution of the eighteenth be the forerunner of political revolution throughout the western world we may well after the mechanical and economic cataclysm of the nineteenth cease wonder that twentieth-century society should be radical never since man first walk erect have he relation toward nature be so change within the same space of time as they have be since washington be elect president and the parisian mob storm the bastille washington find the task of a readjustment heavy enough but the civilization he know be simple when washington live the fund of energy at man 's disposal have not very sensibly augment since the fall of rome in the eighteenth as in the fourth century engineer have at command only animal power and a little wind and water power to which have be add at the end of the middle age a low explosive there be nothing in the daily life of he age which make the legal and administrative principle which have suffice for justinian insufficient for he twentieth-century society rest on a basis not different so much in degree as in kind from all that have go before through apply science infinite force have be domesticate and the action of these infinite force upon finite mind have be to create a tension together with a social acceleration and concentration not only unparalleled but apparently without limit meanwhile we law and institution have remain in substance constant i doubt if we have develop a single important administrative principle which would be novel to napoleon be he to live again and i be quite sure that we have no legal principle younger than justinian as a result society have be squeeze as it be from its rigid eighteenth-century legal shell and have pass into a fourth dimension of space where it perform its most important function beyond the cognizance of the law which remain in a space of but three dimension washington encounter a somewhat analogous problem when deal with the thirteen petty independent state which have escape from england but he problem be relatively rudimentary take the theory of sovereignty as it stand he have only to apply it to community it be mainly a question of concentrate a sufficient amount of energy to enforce order in sovereign social unit the whole social detail remain unchanged we condition would seem to imply a very considerable extension and specialization of the principle of sovereignty together with a commensurate increment of energy but unfortunately the twentieth-century american problem be still further complicate by the character of the envelope in which this highly volatilized society be theoretically contain to attain he object washington introduce a write organic law which of all thing be the most inflexible no other modern nation have to consider such a impediment moneyed capital i take to be store human energy as a coal measure be store solar energy and moneyed capital under the stress of modern life have develop at once extreme fluidity and a equivalent compressibility thus a small number of man can control it in enormous mass and so it come to pass that in a community like the united state a few man or even in certain emergency a single man may become clothe with various of the attribute of sovereignty sovereign power be power so important that the community in its corporate capacity have as society have centralize usually find it necessary to monopolize they more or less absolutely since they possession by private person cause revolt these power when vest in some official as for example a king or emperor have be hold by he in all western country at least as a trust to be use for the common welfare a breach of that trust have commonly be punish by deposition or death it be upon a charge of breach of trust that charle i among other sovereign be try and execute in short the relation of sovereign and subject have be base either upon consent and mutual obligation or upon submission to a divine command but in either case upon recognition of responsibility only the relation of master and slave imply the status of sovereign power vest in a unaccountable superior nevertheless it be in a relation somewhat analogous to the latter that the modern capitalist have be place toward he fellow citizen by the advance in apply science a example or two will explain my mean high among sovereign power have always rank the ownership and administration of highway and it be evident why this should have be so movement be life and the stoppage of movement be death and the movement of every people flow along its highway a invader have only to cut the communication of the invade to paralyze he as he would paralyze a animal by cut he artery or tendon accordingly in all age and in all land down to the nineteenth century nation even partially centralize have in they corporate capacity own and care for they highway either directly or through accountable agent and they have pay for they by direct tax like the roman or by toll levy upon traffic as many mediaeval government prefer to do either method answer its purpose provide the government recognize its responsibility and no government ever recognize this responsibility more fully than do the autocratic government of ancient rome so the absolute régime of eighteenth-century france recognize this responsibility when loui xvi undertake to remedy the abuse of unequal taxation for the maintenance of the highway by abolish the corvée toward the middle of the nineteenth century the application by science of steam to locomotion make railway a favorite speculation forthwith private capital acquire these highway and because of the inelasticity of the old law treat they as ordinary chattel to be administer for the profit of the owner exclusively it be true that railway company pose as public agent when demand the power to take private property but when it come to charge for use of they way they claim to be only private carrier authorize to bargain as they please indeed it grow to be consider a mark of efficient railroad management to extract the largest revenue possible from the people along the line of least resistance that be by tax most heavily those individual and locality which could least resist and the claim by the railroad that they might do this as a matter of right be long uphold by the court -lrb- 2 -rrb- nor have the judge even yet after a generation of revolt and of legislation altogether abandon this doctrine the court -- reluctantly it be true and principally at the instigation of the railway themselves who find the practice unprofitable -- have latterly discountenanced discrimination as to person but they still uphold discrimination as to locality -lrb- 3 -rrb- now among abuse of sovereign power this be one of the most galling for of all tax the transportation tax be perhaps that which be most search most insidious and when misuse most destructive the price pay for transportation be not so essential to the public welfare as its equality for neither person nor locality can prosper when the necessaries of life cost they more than they cost they competitor in town no cup of water can be drunk no crust of bread eat no garment worn which have not pay the transportation tax and the farmer 's crop must rot upon he land if other farmer pay enough less than he to exclude he from market toward which they all stand in a position otherwise equal yet this formidable power have be usurp by private person who have use it purely selfishly as no legitimate sovereign could have use it and by person who have indignantly denounce all attempt to hold they accountable as a infringement of they constitutional rights obviously capital can not assume the position of a irresponsible sovereign living in a sphere beyond the domain of law without invite the fate which have await all sovereign who have deny or abuse they trust the operation of the new york clearing-house be another example of the acquisition of sovereign power by irresponsible private person primarily of course a clearing-house be a innocent institution occupy with adjust balance between bank and have no relation to the volume of the currency furthermore among all highly centralized nation the regulation of the currency be one of the most jealously guard of the prerogative of sovereignty because all value hinge upon the relation which the volume of the currency bear to the volume of trade yet as everybody know in moment of financial panic the handful of financier who directly or indirectly govern the clearing-house have it in they power either to expand or to contract the currency by issue or by withdraw clearing-house certificate more effectually perhaps than if they control the treasury of the united state nor do this power vast as it be at all represent the supremacy which a few banker enjoy over value because of they facility for manipulate the currency and with the currency credit facility which be use or abuse entirely beyond the reach of the law banker at they convention and through the press be wont to denounce the american monetary system and without doubt all that they say and much more that they do not say be true and yet i should suppose that there could be little doubt that american financier might after the panic of 1893 and before the administration of mr taft have obtain from congress at most session very reasonable legislation have they first agree upon the reform they demand and secondly manifest they readiness as a condition precedent to such reform to submit to effective government supervision in those department of they business which relate to the inflation or depression of value they have show little inclination to submit to restraint in these particulars nor perhaps be they reluctance surprising for the possession by a very small favored class of the unquestioned privilege whether actually use or not at recur interval of subject the debtor class to such pressure as the creditor may think necessary in order to force the debtor to surrender he property to the creditor at the creditor 's price be a wonder beside which aladdin 's lamp burn dim as i have already remark i apprehend that sovereignty be a variable quantity of administrative energy which in civilization which we call advance tend to accumulate with a rapidity proportionate to the acceleration of movement that be to say the community as it consolidate find it essential to its safety to withdraw more or less completely from individual and to monopolize more or less strictly itself a great variety of function at one stage of civilization the head of the family administer justice maintain a armed force for war or police wages war make treaty of peace coin money and not infrequently wear a crown usually of a form to indicate he importance in a hierarchy at a later stage of civilization company of trader play a great part such aggregation of private and irresponsible adventurer have invade and conquer empire found colony and administer justice to million of human being in we own time we have see the assumption of many of the function of these and similar private company by the sovereign we have see the east indium company absorb by the british parliament we have see the railway and the telephone and the telegraph company take into possession very generally by the most progressive government of the world and now we have come to the necessity of deal with the domestic-trade monopoly because trade have fall into monopoly through the centralization of capital in a constantly contract circle of ownership among innumerable kind of monopoly none have be more troublesome than trade monopoly especially those which control the price of the necessaries of life for so far as i know no people approximately free have long endure such monopoly patiently nor could they well have do so without constraint by overpower physical force for the possession of a monopoly of a necessary of life by a individual or by a small privileged class be tantamount to invest a minority contemptible alike in number and in physical force with a arbitrary and unlimited power to tax the majority not for public but for private purpose therefore it have not infrequently happen that persistence in adhering to and in enforce such monopoly have lead first to attempt at regulation and these fail to confiscation and sometimes to the proscription of the owner a example of such a phenomenon occur to I which just now seem apposite in the earlier middle age before gunpowder make fortify house untenable when attack by the sovereign the highway be so dangerous that trade and manufacture could only survive in walled town a unarmed urban population have to buy its privilege and to pay for these a syndicate grow up in each town which become responsible for the town ferm or tax and in return collect what part of the municipal expense it could from the poorer inhabitant these syndicate call guild as a means of raise money regulate trade and fixed price and they succeed in fix price because they could prevent competition within the wall presently complaint become rife of guild oppression and the court have to entertain these complaint from the outset to keep some semblance of order but at length the turmoil pass beyond the reach of the court and parliament intervene parliament not only enact a series of statute regulate price in town but supervised guild membership require trading company to receive new member upon what parliament consider to be reasonable term nevertheless friction continue with advance in science artillery improve and as artillery improve the police strengthen until the king could arrest whom he please then the country grow safe and manufacture migrate from the walled and heavily tax town to the cheap open village and from thence undersell the guild as the area of competition broaden so the guild weaken until under edward vi be no longer able to defend themselves they be ruthlessly and savagely plunder and fifty year later the court of king 's bench gravely hold that a royal grant of a monopoly have always be bad at common law -lrb- 4 -rrb- though the court 's law prove to be good since it have stand its history be fantastic for the trade-guild be the offspring of trade monopoly and a trade monopoly have for century be grant habitually by the feudal landlord to he tenant and indeed be the only means by which a urban population could finance its military expenditure then in due course the crown try to establish its exclusive right to grant monopoly and finally parliament -- or king lord and common combine be the whole nation in its corporate capacity -- appropriate this monopoly of monopoly as its supreme prerogative and with parliament this monopoly have ever since remain in fine monopoly or competition in trade appear to be recurrent social phase which depend upon the ratio which the mass and the fluidity of capital or in other word its energy bear to the area within which competition be possible in the middle age when the town wall bound that area or when at most it be restricted to a few line of communication between defensible point garrison by the monopolist -- as be the staple town of england which carry on the wool trade with the british fortify counting-house in flander -- a small quantity of sluggish capital suffice but as police improve and the area of competition broaden faster than capital accumulate and quicken the competitive phase dawn whose advent be mark by darcy _ v _ allein decide in the year 1600 finally the issue between monopoly and free trade be fight out in the american revolution for the measure which precipitate hostility be the effort of england to impose she monopoly of the eastern trade upon america the boston tea party occur on December 16 1773 then come the heyday of competition with the acceptance of the theory of adam smith and the political domination in england towards 1840 of the manchester school of political economy about forty year since in america at least the tide would appear once more to have turn i fix the moment of flux as i be apt to do by a lawsuit this suit be the morri run coal company _ v _ barclay coal company -lrb- 5 -rrb- which be the first modern anti-monopoly litigation that i have meet with in the united state it be decide in pennsylvanium in 1871 and since 1871 while the area within which competition be possible have be keep constant by the tariff capital have accumulate and have be concentrate and volatilize until within this republic substantially all price be fix by a vast moneyed mass this mass obey what amount to be a single volition have its heart in wall street and pervade every corner of the union no matter what price be in question whether it be the price of meat or coal or cotton cloth or of railway transportation or of insurance or of discount the inquirer will find the price to be in essence a monopoly or fix price and if he will follow he investigation to the end he will also find that the first cause in the complex chain of cause and effect which create the monopoly in that mysterious energy which be enthrone on the hudson the presence of monopolistic price in trade be not always a result of conscious agreement more frequently perhaps it be automatic and be a effect of the concentration of capital in a point where competition cease as when all the capital engage in a trade belong to a single owner suppose ownership to be enough restricted combination be easier and more profitable than competition therefore combination conscious or unconscious supplant competition the inference from the evidence be that in the united state capital have reach or be rapidly reach this point of concentration and if this be true competition can not be enforce by legislation but assume that competition could still be enforce by law the only effect would be to make the mass of capital more homogeneous by eliminate still further such of the weaker capitalist as have survive ultimately unless indeed society be to dissolve and capital migrate elsewhere all the present phenomenon would be intensify nor would free trade probably have more than a very transitory effect in no department of trade be competition freer than in the atlantic passenger service and yet in no trade be there a stricter monopoly price the same acceleration of the social movement which have cause this centralization of capital have cause the centralization of another form of human energy which be its negative : labor union organize labor as a monopoly labor protest against the irresponsible sovereignty of capital as man have always protest against irresponsible sovereignty declare that the capitalistic social system as it now exist be a form of slavery very logically therefore the abler and bolder labor agitator proclaim that labor levy actual war against society and that in that war there can be no truce until irresponsible capital have capitulate also in labor 's method of warfare the same phenomenon appear as in the autocracy of capital labor attack capitalistic society by method beyond the purview of the law and may at any moment shatter the social system while under we law and institution society be helpless few person i should imagine who reflect on these phenomenon fail to admit to themselves whatever they may say publicly that present social condition be unsatisfactory and i take the cause of the stress to be that which i have state we have extend the range of apply science until we daily use infinite force and those force must apparently disrupt we society unless we can raise the law and institution which hold society together to a energy and efficiency commensurate to they how much vigor and ability would be require to accomplish such a work may be measure by the experience of washington who barely prevail in he relatively simple task surround by a generation of extraordinary man and with the capitalistic class of america behind he without the capitalistic class he must have fail therefore one most momentous problem of the future be the attitude which capital can or will assume in this emergency that some of the more sagacious of the capitalistic class have preserve that instinct of self-preservation which be so conspicuous among man of the type of washington be apparent from the position take by the management of the united state steel company and by the republican minority of the congressional committee which recently investigate the steel company but whether such man very strongly influence the genus to which they belong be not clear if they do not much improvement in exist condition can hardly be anticipate if capital insist upon continue to exercise sovereign power without accept responsibility as for a trust the revolt against the exist order must probably continue and that revolt can only be deal with as all servile revolt must be deal with by physical force i doubt however if even the most ardent and optimistic of capitalist would care to speculate deeply upon the stability of any government capital might organize which rest on the fundamental principle that the american people must be rule by a army on the other hand any government to be effective must be strong it be futile to talk of keep peace in labor dispute by compulsory arbitration if the government have not the power to command obedience to its arbitrator ' decree but a government able to constrain a couple of hundred thousand discontented railway employee to work against they will must differ considerably from the one we have nor be it possible to imagine that labor will ever yield peaceful obedience to such constraint unless capital make equivalent concession -- unless perhaps among other thing capital consent to erect tribunal which shall offer relief to any citizen who can show himself to be oppress by the monopolistic price in fine a government to promise stability in the future must apparently be so much more powerful than any private interest that all man will stand equally before its tribunal and these tribunal must be flexible enough to reach those category of activity which now lie beyond legal jurisdiction if it be object that the american people be incapable of a effort so prodigious i readily admit that this may be true but i also contend that the objection be beside the issue what the american people can or can not do be a matter of opinion but that social change be imminent appear to be almost certain though these change can not be prevent possibly they may to a degree be guide as washington guide the change of 1789 to resist they perversely as they be resist at the chicago convention of 1912 can only make the catastrophe when it come as overwhelming as be the consequent defeat of the republican party approach thus that convention of 1912 have more than a pass importance since it would seem to indicate the ordinary phenomenon that a decline favored class be incapable of appreciate a approach change of environment which must alter its social status i begin with the proposition that in any society which we now understand civilization be equivalent to order and the evidence of the truth of the proposition be that amidst disorder capital and credit which constitute the pith of we civilization perish first for more than a century past capital and credit have be absolute or nearly so accordingly it have not be the martial type which have enjoy sovereignty but the capitalistic the warrior have be the capitalist ' servant but now if it be true that money in certain crucial direction be lose its purchasing power it be evident that capitalist must accept a position of equality before the law under the domination of a type of man who can enforce obedience they own obedience as well as the obedience of other indeed it might occur even to some optimist that capitalist would be fortunate if they could certainly obtain protection for another fifty year on term as favorable as these but at chicago capitalist decline even to consider recede to a secondary position rather than permit the advent of a power beyond they immediate control they prefer to shatter the instrument by which they sustain they ascendancy for it be clear that roosevelt 's offence in the eye of the capitalistic class be not what he have actually do for he have do nothing seriously to injure they the crime they resent be the assertion of the principle of equality before the law for equality before the law signify the end of privilege to operate beyond the range of law if this principle which roosevelt in theory at least certainly embody come to be rigorously enforce capitalist perceive that private person would be preclude from use the function of sovereignty to enrich themselves there lay the parting of the way sooner or later almost every successive ruling class have have this dilemma in one of its innumerable form present to they and few have have the genius to compromise while compromise be possible only a generation ago the aristocracy of the south deliberately choose a civil war rather than admit the principle that at some future day they might have to accept compensation for they slave a thousand other instance of similar incapacity might be adduce but i will content myself with this alone briefly the precedent induce the inference that privileged class seldom have the intelligence to protect themselves by adaptation when nature turn against they and up to the present moment the old privileged class in the united state have show little promise of be a exception to the rule be this however as it may and even assume that the great industrial and capitalistic interest would be prepare to assist a movement toward consolidation as they ancestor assist washington i deem it far from probable that they could succeed with the large american middle class which naturally should aid oppose as it seem now to be to such a movement partially doubtless this opposition be bear of fear since the lesser folk have learn by bitter experience that the powerful have yield to nothing save force and therefore that they only hope be to crush those who oppress they doubtless also there be the inertia incident to long tradition but i suspect that the resistance be rather due to a subtle and as yet nearly unconscious instinct which teach the numerical majority who be inimical to capital that the shortest and easiest way for they to acquire autocratic authority be to obtain a absolute mastery over those political tribunal which we call court also that mastery be be by they rapidly acquire so long as we court retain they present function no comprehensive administrative reform be possible whence i conclude that the relation which we court shall hold to politics be now the fundamental problem which the american people must solve before any stable social equilibrium can be attain theodore roosevelt 's enemy have be many and bitter they have attack he honesty he sobriety he intelligence and he judgment but very few of they have hitherto deny that he have a keen instinct for political strife only of late have this gift be doubt but now eminent politician question whether he do not make a capital mistake when he present the reform of we court of law as expounder of the constitution as one of he two chief issue in he canvass for a nomination for a third presidential term after many year of study of and reflection upon this intricate subject i have reach the conviction that though mr roosevelt may have err in the remedy which he have suggest he be right in the principle which he have advance and in my next chapter i propose to give the evidence and explain the reason which constrain I to believe that american society must continue to degenerate until confusion supervene if we court shall remain semi-political chamber footnote : -lrb- 1 -rrb- charle river bridge _ v _ warren bridge ii peter 608 609 -lrb- 2 -rrb- fitchburg rr _ v _ gage 12

shall be unable to work the will of the favored few on the whole success in attain to ideal justice have not be quite commensurate with the time and effort devoted to solve the problem but until we constitutional experiment be try in america i think it have be pretty generally admit that the first prerequisite to success be that judge should be remove from political influence for the main difficulty have be that every dominant class as it have arise have do its best to use the machinery of justice for its own benefit no argument ever have convince like a parable and a very famous story in the bible will illustrate the great truth which be the first lesson that a primitive people learn that unless the judge can be separate from the sovereign and be strictly limit in the performance of he function by a recognize code of procedure the public as against the dominant class have in substance no civil rights the king of israel be judge of last resort solomon earn he reputation for wisdom in the cause in which two mother claim the same child they be indeed both judge and jury also they be prosecute officer also they be sheriff in fine they exercise unlimited judicial power save in so far as they be check by the divine interference usually signify through some prophet now david be admittedly one of the best sovereign and judge who ever hold office in jerusalem and in the day of david nathan be the lead prophet of the dominant political party and it come to pass in a eveningtide that david arise from off he bed and walk upon the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he see a woman wash herself and the woman be very beautiful to look upon and david send and enquire after the woman and one say be not this bath-sheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite and david send messenger and take she and she come in unto he and he lay with she and she return unto she house uriah be serve in the army under joab david send for uriah and tell he to go home to he wife but uriah refuse then david write a letter to joab and dismiss uriah order he to give the letter to joab and david write in the letter say set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from he that he may be smitten and die and the man of the city go out and fight with joab and there fall some of the people of the servant of david and uriah the hittite die also but the thing that david have do displeased the lord and the lord send nathan unto david and he come unto he and say unto he there be two man in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man have exceed many flock and herd : but the poor man have nothing save one little ewe lamb which he have buy and nourish up : and it grow up together with he and with he child it do eat of he own meat and drink of he own cup and lay in he bosom and be unto he as a daughter and there come a traveller unto the rich man and he spare to take of he own flock but take the poor man 's lamb and dress it for the man that be come to he and david 's anger be greatly kindle against the man and he say to nathan as the lord liveth the man that have do this thing shall surely die : and nathan say to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou have despise I behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wife before thine eye and give they unto thy neighbor here as the head to the twelfth chapter of second book of samuel say nathan 's parable of the ewe lamb causeth david to be he own judge but the significant part of the story be that nathan with all he influence could not force david to surrender he prey david beg very hard to have he sentence remit but for all that david send and fetch -lrb- bathsheba -rrb- to he house and she become he wife and bare he a son indeed she bear he solomon as against david or david 's important supporter man like uriah have no civil rights that could be enforce even after the judicial function be nominally sever from the executive function so that the sovereign himself do not like david and solomon personally administer justice the same result be reach through agent as long as the judge hold he office at the will of the chief of a political party to go no farther afield every page of english history blazon this record long after the law have take a almost modern shape alice perrer the mistress of edward iii sit on the bench at westminster and intimidate the judge into decide for suitor who have secure she service the chief revenue of the rival faction during the war of the rose be derive from attainder indictment for treason and forfeiture avowedly partisan henry vii use the star chamber to ruin the remnant of the feudal aristocracy henry viii exterminate as vagrant the wretched monk whom he have evict the prosecution under charle i largely induce the great rebellion and finally the limit of endurance be reach when charle ii make jeffrey chief justice of england in order to kill those who be prominent in opposition charle know what he be do that man say he of jeffrey have no learning no sense no manners and more impudence than ten cart street-walker the first object be to convict algernon sidney of treason jeffrey use simple means usually drunk he court resemble the den of a wild beast he pour forth on plaintiff and defendant barrister and attorney witness and juryman torrent of frantic abuse intermix with oath and curse the law require proof of a _ overt act _ of treason many year before sidney have write a philosophical treatise touch resistance by the subject to the sovereign as a constitutional principle but though the fragment contain nothing more than the doctrine of locke sidney have cautiously show it to no one and it have only be find by search he study jeffrey tell the jury that if they believe the book to be sidney 's book write by he they must convict for _ scribere est agere _ to write be to commit a overt act a revolution follow upon this and other like conviction as revolution have usually follow such use of the judicial power in that revolution the principle of the limitation of the judicial function be recognize and the english people seriously address themselves to the task of separate they court from political influence of protect they judge by make they tenure and they pay permanent and of punish they by removal if they behave corruptly or with prejudice or transcend the limit within which they duty confine they jeffrey have legislate when he rule it to be the law that to write word secretly in one 's closet be to commit a overt act of treason and he do it to kill a man whom the king who employ he wish to destroy this be to transcend the duty of a judge which be to expound and not to legislate the judge may develop a principle he may admit evidence of a custom in order to explain the intention of the party to a suit as lord mansfield admit evidence of the custom of merchant but he should not legislate to do so as jeffrey do in sidney 's case be tantamount to murder jeffrey never be duly punish for he crime he die the year after the revolution in the tower maintain to the last that he be innocent in the sight of god and man because all the blood he have shed fall short of the king 's command and jeffrey be perfectly logical and consistent in he attitude a judiciary be either a end in itself or a means to a end if it be design to protect the civil rights of citizen indifferently it must be free from pressure which will deflect it from this path and it can only be protect from the severest possible pressure by be remove from politics because politics be the struggle for ascendancy of a class or a majority if on the other hand the judiciary be to serve as a instrument for advance the fortune of a majority or a dominant class as david use the jewish judiciary or as the stuart use the english judiciary then the judicial power must be embody either in a military or political leader like david who do the work himself or in a agent more or less like jeffrey who will obey he order in the colony the subserviency of the judge to the crown have be a standing grievance and the result of this long and terrible experience stretch through century both in europe and america have be to inspire american with a fear of intrust power to any man or body of man they seek to limit everything by write restriction set aside the objection that such a system be mechanically vicious because it involve excessive friction and therefore waste of energy it be obviously futile unless the write restriction can be enforce and enforce in the spirit in which they be draw hamilton whose instinct for law resemble genius see the difficulty and point out in the _ federalist _ that it be not a write which can give protection but only the intelligence and the sense of justice of the community itself the truth be that the general genius of a government be all that can be substantially rely upon for permanent effect particular provision though not altogether useless have far less virtue and efficiency than be commonly ascribe to they and the want of they will never be with man of sound discernment a decisive objection to any plan which exhibit the lead character of a good government after a experience of nearly a century and a quarter we must admit i think that hamilton be right in the united state we have carry bill of right and constitutional limitation to a extreme and yet i suppose that few would care to maintain that during the nineteenth century life and property be safer in america or crime better deal with than in england france or germany the contrary indeed i take to be the truth and i think one chief cause of this imperfection in the administration of justice will be find to have be the operation of the write constitution for under the american system the constitution or fundamental law be expound by judge and this function which in essence be political have bring precisely that quality of pressure on the bench which it have be the labor of a hundred generation of we ancestor to remove on the whole the result have be not to elevate politics but to lower the court toward the political level a result which conform to the _ a priori _ theory the abstract virtue of the write constitution be not however a question in issue when washington and he contemporary set themselves to reorganize the confederation those man have no choice but to draft some kind of a platform on which the state could agree to unite if they be to unite peacefully at all and accordingly they meet in convention and draw the best form of agreement they could but i more than suspect that a good many very able federalist be quite alive to the defect in the plan which they adopt hamilton be outspoken in prefer the english model and i be not aware that washington ever express a preference for the theory that because of a write fundamental law the court should nullify legislation nor be it unworthy of remark that all foreigner after a prolonged and attentive observation of we experiment have avoid it since 1789 every highly civilized western people have readjust they institution at least once yet not one have in this respect imitate we though all have borrow freely from the parliamentary system of england -lrb- 6 -rrb- even we neighbor canada with no adverse tradition and a population similar to ours have be no exception to the rule the canadian court indeed define the limit of provincial and federal jurisdiction as fix under a act of parliament but they do not pretend to limit the exercise of power when the seat of power have be establish i take the cause of this distrust to be obvious although we write constitution be successful in its primary purpose of facilitate the consolidation of the confederation it have not otherwise inspire confidence as a practical administrative device not only have constant judicial interference dislocate scientific legislation but cast the judiciary into the vortex of civil faction have degrade it in the popular esteem in fine from the outset the american bench because it deal with the most fiercely contest of political issue have be a instrument necessary to political success consequently political party have strive to control it and therefore the bench have always have a avowed partisan bias this avowed political or social bias have i infer breed among the american people the conviction that justice be not administer indifferently to all man wherefore the bench be not respect with we as for instance it be in great britain where law and politics be sunder nor have the dissatisfaction engender by these cause be conceal on the contrary it have find expression through a series of famous popular leader from thoma jefferson to theodore roosevelt the constitution could hardly have be adopt or the government organize but for the personal influence of washington whose power lay in he genius for deal with man he lose no time or strength in speculation but take the constitution as the best implement at hand he go to the work of administration by include the representative of the antagonistic extreme in he cabinet he might as well have expect fire and water to mingle as jefferson and hamilton to harmonize probably he have no delusion on that head when he choose they for he minister and he accomplish he object he paralyze opposition until the new mechanism begin to operate pretty regularly but he have not a hour to spare soon the french revolution heated passion so hot that long before washington 's successor be elect the united state be rent by faction the question which underlie all other question down to the civil war be the determination of the seat of sovereignty hamilton and the federalist hold it to be axiomatic that if the federal government be to be more than a shadow it must interpret the meaning of the instrument which create it and if so that it must signify its decision through the court only in this way they argue could write limitation on legislative power be make effective only in this way could statute which contravene the constitution be set aside -lrb- 7 -rrb- jefferson be abroad when hamilton write _ the federalist _ but he view have since be so universally accept as embody the opposition to hamilton that they may be conveniently take as if they have be publish while the constitution be under discussion substantially the same argument be advance by other during the actual debate if not quite so lucidly or connectedly then as afterward by he very well say jefferson in answer to hamilton admit for the moment that the central government shall define its own power and that the court shall be the organ through which the exposition shall be make both of which proposition i vehemently deny you have this result : the judge who will be call upon to pass upon the validity of national and state legislation will be plunge in the most heated of controversy and in those controversy they can not fail to be influence by the same passion and prejudice which sway other man in a word they must decide like legislator though they will be exempt from the responsibility to the public which control other legislator such condition you can only meet by make the judicial tenure of office ephemeral as all legislative tenure be ephemeral it be vain to pretend continue he in support of fixity of tenure that the greater the pressure on the judge be likely to be the more need there be to make he secure this may be true of judge clothe with ordinary attribute like english judge for should these try to nullify the popular will by construe away statute parliament can instantly correct they or if parliament fail in its duty the constituency at the next election can intervene but no one will be able to correct the american judge who may decline to recognize the law which would constrain he nothing can shake he save impeachment for what be tantamount to crime or be overrule by a constitutional amendment which you have purposely make too hard to obtain to be a remedy he be to be judge in he own case without a appeal nowhere in all he long and masterly defense of the constitution do hamilton show so much embarrassment as here and because probably he do not himself believe in he own brief he really have faith in the english principle of a absolute parliament restrain if needful by a conservative chamber like the house of lord but not in the total suspension of sovereignty subject to judicial illumination consequently he fall back on platitude about judicial high-mindedness and how judge could be trust not to allow political influence to weigh with they when decide political question push to its logical end conclude he the jeffersonian argument would prove that there should be no judge distinct from legislature -lrb- 8 -rrb- now at length exclaim the jeffersonian in triumph you admit we thesis you propose to clothe judge with the highest legislative function since you give they a absolute negative on legislation and yet you decline to impose on they the responsibility to a constituency which constrain other legislator clearly you thus make they autocratic and in the worst sense for you permit small body of irresponsible man under pretence of dispense justice but really in a spirit of hypocrisy to annul the will of the majority of the people even though the right of the people to exercise they will in the matter at issue be clearly grant they in the constitution no rejoin hamilton thus drive to the wall judge never will so abuse they trust the duty of the judge require he to suppress he _ will _ and exercise he _ judgment _ only the constitution will be before he and he will have only to say whether authority to legislate on a give subject be grant in that instrument if it be the character of the legislation must remain a matter of legislative discretion besides you must repose confidence somewhere and judge on the whole be more trustworthy than legislator how can you say that retort the opposition when you better than most man know the line of despotic legal precedent from the ship money down to the writ of assistance look back upon this initial controversy touch judicial function under the constitution we can hardly suppose that hamilton do not perceive that in substance jefferson be right and that a bench purposely construct to pass upon political question must be politically partisan he know very well that if the federalist prevail in the election a federalist president would only appoint magistrate who could be rely on to favor consolidation and so the event prove general washington choose john jay for the first chief justice who in some important respects be more federalist than hamilton while john adam select john marshall who though one of the greatest jurist who ever live be hate by jefferson with a bitter hatred because of he political bias as time go on matter grow worse before marshall die slavery have become a burning issue and the slave-owner control the appoint power general jackson appoint taney to sustain the expansion of slavery and when the anti-slavery party carry the country with lincoln lincoln supplant taney with chase in order that chase might stand by he in he struggle to destroy slavery and as it have be so must it always be as long as the power to enact law shall hinge on the complexion of bench of judge so long will the ability to control a majority of the bench be as crucial a political necessity as the ability to control a majority in avowedly representative assembly hamilton be one of the few great jurist and administrator whom america have ever produce and it be inconceivable that he do not understand what he be do he know perfectly well that other thing be equal the simplest administrative mechanism be the best and he know also that he be help to make a extremely complicated mechanism not only so but at the heart of this complexity lay the gigantic cog of the judiciary which be obviously devise to stop movement he must have have a reason beyond the reason he give for not only insist on clothing the judiciary with these unusual political and legislative attribute but for give the judiciary a unprecedented fixity of tenure i suspect that he be actuate by some such consideration as these : the federalist have pretty good cause to suppose themselves in a popular minority purpose to consolidate the thirteen state under a new sovereign there be but two method by which they could prevail they could use force or to secure assent they could propose some system of arbitration to escape war the federalist convene the constitutional convention and by so do pledge themselves to arbitration but if they plan of consolidation be to succeed it be plain that the arbitrator must arbitrate in they favor for if he arbitrate as mr jefferson would have wish the united state under the constitution would have differ little from the united state under the confederation the federalist therefore must control the arbitrator if the constitution be to be adopt hamilton and every one else know that washington would be the first president and washington could be rely on to appoint a strong federalist bench hence whatever might happen subsequently when the new plan first should go into operation and when the danger from insubordination among the state would probably be most acute the judiciary would be make to throw its weight in favor of consolidation and against disintegration and if it do so it be essential that it should be protect against anything short of a revolutionary attack in the convention indeed charle pinckney of south carolina suggest that congress should be empower to negative state legislation but such a alternative for obvious reason would have be less palatable to hamilton since congress would be only too likely to fall under the control of the jeffersonian party while a bench of judge if once well choose might prove to be for many year a excellent barrier to the encroachment and oppression of the representative body -lrb- 9 -rrb- i infer that hamilton and many other federalist reason somewhat thus not only from what they write but from the temper of they mind and if they do event largely justify they john jay oliver ellsworth and john marshall be successively appoint to the office of chief justice nor do the complexion of the supreme court change until after 1830 what interest we however be not so much what the federalist think or the motive which actuate they as the effect which the clothing of the judiciary with political function have have upon the development of the american republic more especially as that extreme measure might have be avoid have pinckney 's plan be adopt nor look back upon the actual course of event can i perceive that so far as the movement toward consolidation be concern the final result would have vary materially whether congress or the supreme court have exercise control over state legislation marshall might just as well in the one case as the other have formulate he theory of a semi-centralized administration he would only have have uniformly to sustain congress as a english judge sustain parliament nor could either congress or the court have reach a definite result without a appeal to force either chamber might expound a theory but nothing save a army could establish it for two generation statesman and jurist debate the relation of the central to the local sovereignty with no result for word alone could decide no such issue in america as elsewhere sovereignty be determine by physical force marshall could not conquer jefferson he could at most controvert jefferson 's theory this he do but in do so i doubt if he be quite true to himself jefferson contend that every state might nullify national legislation as conversely pinckney wish congress to be give explicitly the power to nullify state legislation and marshall very sensibly point out that be jefferson 's claim carry into practice it would create a hydra in government -lrb- 10 -rrb- yet i be confident that marshall do not appreciate whither he own assertion of authority must lead in view of the victory of centralization in the civil war i will agree that the supreme court might have successfully maintain a position as arbitrator touch conflict jurisdiction as between the nation and the state but that be a different matter from assume to examine into the wisdom of the legislation itself the one function might possibly pass by courtesy as judicial the other be clearly legislative this distinction only develop after marshall 's death but the resentment which impel marshall to annul a act of congress be rouse by the political conflict which precede the election of 1800 in which marshall take a chief part apparently he could not resist the temptation of measure himself with he old adversary especially as he seem to have think that he could discredit that adversary without give he a opportunity to retaliate in 1798 a federalist congress pass the alien and sedition act whose constitutionality no federalist judge ever doubt but which jefferson consider as clearly a violation of the fundamental compact since they tend to drive certain state as he think into revolution and blood under this provocation jefferson proclaim that it be both the right and the duty of any state which feel itself aggrieve to intervene to arrest the progress of the evil within she territory by decline to execute or by nullify the objectionable statute as jefferson write the kentucky resolution in 1798 and be elect president in 1800 the people at least appear to have sustain he in he exposition of the constitution before he enter into office at this distance of time we find it hard to realize what the election of 1800 seem to portend to those who participate therein mr jefferson always describe it as amount to a revolution as profound as if less bloody than the revolution of 1776 and though we maybe dispose to imagine that jefferson value he own advent to power at its full worth it must be admit that he enemy regard it almost as seriously nor be they without some justification for jefferson certainly represent the party of disintegration nullification would have be tantamount to a return to the condition of the confederation besides jefferson not so many year before have write in defense of shay 's rebellion that the tree of liberty could never flourish unless refresh occasionally with the blood of patriot and tyrant to most federalist jefferson seem a bloodthirsty demagogue in 1796 oliver ellsworth have be appoint chief justice by general washington in the place of jay who resign and in 1799 john adams send ellsworth as a envoy to france to try to negotiate a treaty which should reëstablish peace between the two country ellsworth succeed in he mission but the hardship of he journey injure he health and he in turn resign in the autumn of 1800 then adam offer the chief justiceship to jay but jay would not return to office and after this the president select he secretary of state john marshall one of the greatest of the great virginian but one of jefferson 's most irreconcilable enemy perhaps at no moment in he life do john adam demonstrate he legal genius more convincingly than in this remarkable nomination yet it must be concede that in make john marshall chief justice john adams deliberately choose the man whom of all he countryman he think to be the most formidable champion of those view which he himself entertain and which he conceive that he have be elect president to advance nor be john adam deceive for thirty-four year john marshall labor ceaselessly to counteract jefferson 's constitutional principle while jefferson always denounce the political partiality of the federal court and above all the rancorous hatred which marshall bear to the government of he country and the cunning and sophistry within which he be able to enshroud himself -lrb- 11 -rrb- no one at this day would be dispose to dispute that the constitution as a device to postpone war among the state at least for a period be successful and that as i have already point out during the tentative interval which extend until appomattox the supreme court serve perhaps as well in ordinary time as a arbiter between the state and the general government as any which could have be suggest so much may be concede and yet it remain true as the record will show that when it pass this point and enter into factional strife the supreme court somewhat lamentably fail probably injure itself and popular respect for law far more by its error than it aid the union by its political adjudication although john marshall by common consent rank as one of the greatest and purest of american yet even marshall have human weakness one of which be a really unreasonable antipathy to thoma jefferson a antipathy which i surmise must when jefferson be inaugurate have verge upon contempt at least marshall do what cautious man seldom do when they respect a adversary he take the first opportunity to pick a quarrel with a man who have the advantage of he in position in the last day of he presidency john adams appoint one william marbury a justice of the peace for the district of columbium the senate confirm the appointment and the president sign and john marshall as secretary of state seal marbury 's commission but in the hurry of surrender office the commission be not deliver and jefferson find it in the state department when he take possession resent violently these midnight appointment as he call they jefferson direct mr madison he secretary of state to withhold the commission and at the next December term of the supreme court marbury move for a rule to madison to show cause why he should not be command to deliver to the plaintiff the property to which marbury pretend to be entitle of course jefferson decline to appear before marshall through he secretary of state and finally in February 1803 marshall give judgment in what be without any doubt the most anomalous opinion he ever deliver in that it violate all judicial convention for apparently no object save to humiliate a political opponent marshall have no intention of command madison to surrender the commission to marbury he be too adroit a politician for that marshall know that he could not compel jefferson to obey such a writ against he will and that in issue the order he would only bring himself and he court into contempt what he seem to have wish to do be to give jefferson a lesson in deportment accordingly instead of dismiss marbury 's suit upon any convenient pretext as accord to legal etiquette he should have do if he have make up he mind to decide against the plaintiff and yet think it inexpedient to explain he view of the law he begin he opinion with a long and extra-judicial homily first on marbury 's title to ownership in the commission and then on civil liberty have affirm that marbury 's right to he office vest when the president have sign and the secretary of state have seal the instrument he point out that withhold the property thus vest be a violation of civil rights which could be examine in a court of justice be it otherwise the chief justice insist the government of the united state could not be term a government of law and not of man all this elaborate introduction be in the nature of a solemn lecture by the chief justice of the supreme court to the president of the united state upon he faulty discharge of he official duty have ease he mind on this head marshall go on very dexterously indeed but also very palpably to elude the consequence of he temerity he continue : the right of property be establish and the violation of that right clear it be plain that a wrong have be commit and it only remain to determine whether that wrong can be redress under this form of procedure we be of opinion that it can not because congress have no constitutional power to confer upon the supreme court original jurisdiction in this class of litigation in the lower court alone can the relief pray for be obtain of all the event of marshall 's life this controversy with jefferson seem to I the most equivocal and it be a direct effect of a constitutional system which have permit the court to become the censor of the political department of the government marshall probably feel exasperated by jefferson 's virulence against these final appointment make by john adam while marshall be secretary of state and for which he may have feel himself in part responsible possibly even he may have take some of jefferson 's stricture as aim at himself at all event he go to extreme length in retaliation he might have dismiss the litigation in a few word by state that whatever the abstract rights of the party might have be the supreme court have no power to constrain the president in he official function but he yield to political animosity then have take a position practically untenable he have to find a avenue of retreat and he find it by assert a supervisory jurisdiction over congress a step which even at that early period be most hazardous -lrb- 12 -rrb- in reality jefferson 's temper far from be vindictive and revolutionary as he enemy believe be rather gentle and timid but he would have be more than mortal have he endure such a insult in silence nor could he perhaps have do so without risk the respect of he follower so he decide on reprisal and a scheme be mature among influential virginian like john randolph and senator william gile to purge the supreme court of federalist among the associate justice of this court be samuel chase a signer of the declaration of independence and a able lawyer but a arrogant and indiscreet partisan chase have make himself obnoxious on various public occasion and so be consider to be the best subject to impeach but if they succeed with he the jeffersonian proclaim they intention of remove all he brethren seriatim include the chief offender of all john marshall one day in December 1804 senator gile of virginium in a conversation which john quincy adam have report in he diary discuss the issue at large and that conversation be most apposite now since it show how early the inevitable tendency be develop to make judge who participate in political and social controversy responsible to the popular will the conversation be too long to extract in full but a few sentence will convey its purport : -- he treat with the utmost contempt the idea of a _ independent _ judiciary and if the judge of the supreme court should dare _ as they have do _ to declare a act of congress unconstitutional or to send a mandamus to the secretary of state _ as they have do _ it be the undoubted right of the : house of representative to impeach they and of the senate to remove they for give such opinion however honest or sincere they may have be in entertain they \* \* \* and a removal by impeachment be nothing more than a declaration by congress to this effect : you hold dangerous opinion and if you be suffer to carry they into effect you will work the destruction of the nation _ we want you office _ for the purpose of give they to man who will fill they better -lrb- 13 -rrb- jefferson though he control a majority in the senate fail by a narrow margin to obtain the two-third vote necessary to convict chase nevertheless he accomplish he object chase never recover he old assurance and marshall never again commit a solecism in judicial manners on he side after the impeachment jefferson show moderation he might if he have be malevolent without doubt have obtain a act of congress increase the membership of the supreme court enough to have put marshall in a minority then by appoint man like gile he could have compel marshall to resign he do nothing of the kind he spare the supreme court which he might have overthrow and contented himself with wait until time should give he the opportunity to correct the political tendency of a body of man whom he sincerely regard as a menace to what he consider popular institution thus the ebullition cause by marshall 's acrimony toward jefferson because of jefferson 's stricture on the appointment make by he predecessor subside leave no very serious immediate mischief behind save the precedent of the nullification of a act of congress by the supreme court that precedent however be follow by marshall 's democratic successor and nothing can better illustrate the inherent vice of the american constitutional system than that it should have be possible in 1853 to devise and afterward present to a tribunal whose primary purpose be to administer the municipal law a set of fact for adjudication on purpose to force it to pass upon the validity of such a statute as the missourus compromise which have be enact by congress in 1820 as a sort of treaty of peace between the north and south and whose object be the limitation of the spread of slavery whichever way the court decide it must have fall into opprobrium with one-half the country in fact have be organize by the slaveholder to sustain slavery it decide against the north and therefore lose repute with the party destine to be victorious i need not pause to criticise the animus of the court nor yet the quality of the law which the chief justice there lay down it suffice that in the decade which precede hostility no event in all probability so exasperated passion and so shake the faith of the people of the northern state in the judiciary as this decision faith whether in the priest or the magistrate be of slow growth and if once impaired be seldom fully restore i doubt whether the supreme court have ever recover from the shock it then receive and consider from this point of view the careless attitude of the american people toward general grant 's administration when in 1871 it obtain the reversal of hepburn _ v _ griswold by appointment to the bench assume a sombre aspect of late some sensitiveness have be show in regard to this transaction and a disposition have appear to defend general grant and he attorney-general against the charge of manipulate the membership of the bench to suit they own view at the outset therefore i wish to disclaim any intention of enter into this discussion to I it be immaterial whether general grant and mr hoar do or do not nominate judge with a view to obtain a particular judgment i be concern not with what man think but with what they do and with the effect of they act at the moment upon they fellow-citizen hepburn _ v _ griswold be decide in conference on November 27 1869 when eight justice be on the bench on February 1 follow justice grier resign and on February 7 judgment be enter the court then be divide four to three but grier have be with the majority the vote in reality stand five to three two vacancy therefore exist on February 7 one cause by the resignation of grier the other by a act of congress which have enlarged the court by one member and which have take effect in the previous December chief justice chase hold that the clause of the currency law of 1862 and 1863 which make depreciate paper a legal tender for preëxisting debt be unconstitutional no sooner have the judgment be record than all the world perceive that if both vacancy should be fill with man who would uphold the act hepburn _ v _ griswold might be reverse by a majority of one the republican party have full control of the government and be unite in vehement support of the law on march 21 the second of the two new judge receive he commission and precisely ten day afterward the attorney-general move for a rehearing taunt the chief justice with have change he opinion on this point and intimate that the issue be in reality political and not judicial at all in the December term follow knox _ v _ lee be argue by the attorney-general and on may 1 1871 judgment be enter reverse hepburn _ v _ griswold both the new judge vote with the former minority thus create the necessary majority of one no one have ever doubt that what general grant do coincide with the drift of opinion and that the republican party support he without inquire how he have achieve success -lrb- 14 -rrb- after this it be difficult to suppose that much respect could remain among the american people for the sanctity of judicial political decision or that a president at the head of a popular majority would incur much odium for intervene to correct they as a party measure the last example of judicial interference which i shall mention be the nullification in 1895 of a statute of congress which impose a income tax the state have since set this decision aside by constitutional amendment and i should suppose that few would now dispute that the court when it so decide make a serious political and social error as mr justice white point out the judge undertake to deprive the people in they corporate capacity of a power concede to congress by universal consensus for one hundred year -lrb- 15 -rrb- these word be use in the first argument but on the rehearing the present chief justice wax warm in remonstrate against the unfortunate position in which he brethren place the court before the nation protest with almost passionate earnestness against the reversal by half-a-dozen judge of what have be the universally accept legal political and economic policy of the country solely in order that invest wealth might be read into the constitution as a favor and protect class of property mr justice white close by say that by this act the supreme court have deprive -lrb- the government -rrb- of a inherent attribute of its being -lrb- 16 -rrb- i might go on into endless detail but i apprehend that these case which be the most important which have ever arise on this issue suffice for my purpose -lrb- 17 -rrb- i contend that no court can because of the nature of its be effectively check a popular majority act through a coordinate legislative assembly and i submit that the precedent which i have cite prove this contention the only result of a attempt and failure be to bring court of justice into odium or contempt and in any event to make they object of attack by a dominant social force in order to use they as a instrument much as charle ii use jeffrey the moment we consider the situation philosophically we perceive why use a court to control a coordinate legislature must nearly inevitably be sooner or later fatal to the court if it assert its prerogative a court to be a fit tribunal to administer the municipal law impartially or even relatively impartially must be a small body of man hold by a permanent and secure tenure guard from all pressure which may unduly influence they also they should be man of much experience and learn in the precedent which should make the rule which they apply stable and consistent in short a court should be rigid and emotionless it follow that it must be conservative for its member should long have pass that period of youth when the mind be sensitive to new impression be it otherwise law would cease to be cohesive a legislature be nearly the antithesis of a court it be design to reflect the passion of the voter and the majority of voter be apt to be young hence in period of change when alone serious clash between legislature and court be likely to occur as the social equilibrium shift the legislature almost certainly will reflect the rise the court the sink power i take the dred scott case as a illustration in 1857 the slaveholding interest have pass the zenith of high fortune and be hasten toward its decline in the election of 1858 the democratic party which represent slavery be defeat but the supreme court have be organize by democrat who have be dominant for many year and it adhere on the principle lay down by jeffrey to the master which create it occasionally it be true a court have be construct by a rise energy as be the supreme court in 1789 but then it be equally tenacious to the instinct which create it the history of the supreme court be in this point of view eminently suggestive the federalist instinct be constructive not destructive and accordingly marshall 's fame rest on a series of constructive decision like m ` culloch _ v _ maryland cohen _ v _ virginium and gibbon _ v _ odgen in these decision he either uphold actual national legislation or else the power of the nation to legislate conversely whenever marshall or he successor have seek to obstruct social movement they have not prosper marbury _ v _ madison be not a episode on which any admirer of marshall can linger with satisfaction in theory it may be true as hamilton contend that give the fact that a write constitution be inevitable a bench of judge be the best tribunal to interpret its meaning since the duty of the judge have ever be and be now to interpret the meaning of write instrument but it do not follow from this premise that the judge who should exercise this office should be the judge who administer the municipal law in point of fact experience have prove that so far as congress be concern the result of judicial interference have be negative and it would be well if in other sphere of american constitutional development judicial activity have be always negative unfortunately as i believe it have extend into the domain of legislation i will take the dred scott case once more to illustrate my mean the north find it bad enough for the supreme court to hold that under the constitution congress could not exclude slavery from the national territory beyond a certain boundary which have be fix by compromise between the north and south but the north would have find it intolerable if the court while fully concede that congress might so legislate if the character of the legislation commend itself to the judge have hold the missourus compromise to be unconstitutional because they think it _ unreasonable _ yet this in substance be what we court have do and this bring I to the consideration of american court as legislative chamber footnote :

mr jc bancroft davis compile a table of the act of congress which up to that time have be hold to be unconstitutional it be to be find in the appendix to volume 131 we report page ccxxxv mr davi have however omit from he list the dred scott case probably for the technical reason that in 1857 when the cause be decide the missourus compromise have be repeal nevertheless though this be true tansy 's decision hinge upon the invalidity of the law besides the statute which i have mention in the test the two most important i suppose which have be annul have to I no little interest these be the civil rights act of 1875 and the employer ' liability act of 1906 the civil rights act of 1875 grow rapidly unpopular and the decision which overturn it coincide with the strong drift of opinion the civil rights case be decide in October 1883 and mr cleveland be elect president in 1884 doubtless the law would have be repeal have the judiciary support it therefore this adjudication stand on the other hand the employer ' liability act of 1906 be hold bad because congress undertake to deal with commerce conduct wholly within the state and therefore beyond the national jurisdiction the court consequently in the employer ' liability case simply define the limit of sovereignty as a canadian court might do it do not question the existence of sovereignty itself in 1908 congress pass a statute free from this objection and the court in the second employer ' liability case 223 we 1 sustain the legislation in the most thoroughgoing manner i know not where to look for two better illustration of my theory chapter iii american court as legislative chamber in one point of view many of the greatest of the federalist be idealist they seem sincerely to have believe that they could by some form of write word constrain a people to be honest against they will and almost as soon as the new government go into operation they test these belief by experiment with very indifferent success i take it that jurist like jay and marshall hold it to be axiomatic that rule of conduct should be lay down by they which would be applicable to rich and poor great and small alike and that court could maintain such rule against all pressure possibly such principle may be enforce against individual but they can not be enforce against community and it be here that the federalist philosophy collapse as hamilton at least partly foresee that it must sovereign have always enjoy immunity from suit by private person unless they have be please to assent thereto not because it be less wrongful for a sovereign than for a individual to cheat but because the sovereign can not be arrest and the individual can with the declaration of independence the thirteen colony become sovereign petty sovereign it be true and singly contemptible in physical force as against most foreign nation but none the less tenacious of the attribute of sovereignty and especially of the attribute which enable they to repudiate they debt jay marshall and they like think that they could impose the same moral standard upon the state as upon private person they be unable to do so but in make the attempt they involve the american judicial system in a maze of difficulty whose gravity i fear can hardly be exaggerate before enter upon this history however i must say a word touch the nature of we law municipal law to be satisfactory should be a body of abstract principle capable of be apply impartially to all relevant fact just as marshall and jay hold it to be where exception begin equality before the law end as i have try to show by the story of king david and uriah and therefore the great effort of civilization have be to remove judge from the possibility of be subject to a temptation or to a pressure which may deflect they from impartiality as between suitor in modern civilization especially nothing be so fatal to the principle of order as inequality in the dispensation of justice and it would have be reasonable to suppose that american beyond all other would have be alive to this teaching of experience and have studiously withdraw they bench from politics in fact they have ignore it and instead they have set they judiciary at the focus of conflicting force the result have be the more unfortunate as the english system of jurisprudence be ill calculate to bear the strain it be inflexible in theory the english law move logically from precedent to precedent the judge originate nothing only elaborate idea which he have receive from a predecessor and which be bind on he if the line of precedent lead to wrongful conclusion the legislature must intervene with a statute rectify the wrong the roman who be gifted with a higher legal genius than we manage better the praetor by he edict suppress inconvenient precedent and hence the roman maintain flexibility in they municipal law without fall into confusion we have nothing to correspond to the praetor thus the english system of binding precedent be troublesome enough in a civilization in chronic and violent flux like modern civilization even when apply to ordinary municipal law which may be change at will by legislation but it bring society almost to a stand when apply to the most vital function of government with no means at hand to obtain a corrective for the court of last resort have once declare the meaning of a clause of the constitution that meaning remain fixed forever unless the court either reverse itself which be a disaster or the constitution can be amend by the state which be not only difficult but which even if it be possible entail year of delay yet press emergency arise emergency in which a settlement of some kind must almost necessarily be reach somewhat rapidly to avert very serious disorder and it have be under this tension as i understand american constitutional development that we court have resort to legislation nor be it fair for we to measure the sagacity of we great jurist by the standard of modern experience they live before the acceleration of movement by electricity and steam they could not foresee the rapidity and the profundity of the change which be imminent hence it be that in the spirit of great lawyer who be also possibly man tinge with a certain enthusiasm for the ideal they begin they work by rule on the power and limitation of sovereignty as if they be rule on the necessity of honest intent in dealings with one 's neighbor in 1789 general washington be say to have offer john jay he choice of office under the new government and jay choose the chief justiceship because there he think he could make he influence feel most widely if so he have he wish and very shortly meet with disappointment in the August term of 1792 one chisholm a citizen of south carolina sue the state of georgium for a debt georgium decline to appear and in February 1793 jay in a elaborate opinion give judgment for chisholm jay be follow by he associate with the exception of iredell j of north carolina forthwith a ferment begin and in the very next session of congress a amendment to the constitution be propose to make such suit impossible in January 1798 five year after the case be argue this amendment be declare to be adopt but meanwhile jay have resign to become governor of new york in December 1800 he be again offer the chief justiceship by john adam on the resignation of oliver ellsworth but jay resolutely decline i have often wonder whether jay 's mortification at have he only important constitutional decision summarily condemn by the people may not have give he a distaste for judicial life the federalist attempt to enforce on the state a positive rule of economic morality therefore collapse at once but it still remain possible to approach the same problem from its negative side through the clause of the constitution which forbid any state to impair the validity of contract and marshall take up this aspect of the task where jay leave it in marshall 's mind he work be simple he have only to determine the nature of a contract and the rest follow automatically all contract be to be hold sacred they greater or less importance be immaterial in 1810 marshall expound this general principle in fletcher _ v _ peck -lrb- 18 -rrb- when a law be in its nature a contract a repeal of the law can not devest rights which have vest under it a couple of year later he apply he principle to the extreme case of a unlimited remission of taxation -lrb- 19 -rrb- the state of new jersey have grant a exemption from taxation to land cede to certain indian marshall hold that this contract run with the land and inure to the benefit of grantee from the indian if the state care to resume its power of taxation it must buy the grant back and the citizen of new jersey must pay for they improvidence seven year later in 1810 marshall may perhaps be say to have reach the culmination of he career for then he carry he moral standard to a break strain but though he theory break down perhaps the most striking evidence of he wonderful intellectual superiority be that he convince the democrat joseph story -- a man who have be nominate by madison to oppose he and of undoubted strength of character -- of the soundness of he thesis in 1769 king george iii incorporate certain trustee of dartmouth college the charter be accept and both real and personal property be thereupon convey to this corporate body in trust for educational purpose in 1816 the legislature of new hampshire reorganize the board of trustee against they will if the incorporation amount to a contract the court be clear that this statute impair it therefore the only really debatable issue be whether the grant of a charter by the king amount to a contract by he with he subject to whom he grant it after prolonged consideration marshall conclude that it do and i conceive that in the eye of history he be right throughout the middle age corporate privilege of all kind but especially municipal corporate privilege have be subject of purchase and sale and indeed the mediaeval social system rest on such contract so much be this the case that the right to return member of parliament from incorporate borough be as lord eldon point out in the debate on the reform bill as much private property as any of you lordship ' title and peerage it be here that marshall falter he feel that the public would not support he if he hold that state could not alter town and county charter so he arbitrarily split corporation in half protect only those which handle exclusively private fund and abandon instrument of government as he call they to the mercy of legislative assembly toward 1832 it become convenient for middle class englishman to confiscate most of the property which the aristocracy have invest in parliamentary borough and this social revolution be effect without strain the judicial system because of the supremacy of parliament in america at about the same time it become in like manner convenient to confiscate numerous equally well-vested rights because to have compensate the owner would have entail a considerable sacrifice which neither the public nor the promoter of new enterprise be willing to make the same end be reach in america as in england in spite of chief justice marshall and the dartmouth college case only in america it be attain by a legal somerset which have disorder the course of justice ever since in 1697 king william iii incorporate trinity church in the city of new york confirm to the society the possession of a parcel of land adjoining the church to be use as a churchyard for the burial of the dead in 1823 the government of new york prohibit interment within the city limit thus close the churchyard for the purpose for which it have be grant as compensation be refuse it appear to be a clear case of confiscation and trinity resist in the tooth of recent precedent the supreme court of new york decide that under the _ police power _ the legislature of new york might authorize this sort of appropriation of private property for sanitary purpose without pay the owner for any loss they might thereby sustain -lrb- 20 -rrb- the court thus simply dispense the legislature from obedience to the law say in effect although the constitution forbid impair contract and although this be a contract which you have impaired yet in we discretion we suspend the operation of the constitution in this instance by call you act a exercise of a power unknown to the framer of the constitution i can not doubt that marshall would have flout this theory have he live to pass upon it but marshall die in 1835 and the charle river bridge case in which this question be first present to the supreme court of the united state do not come up until 1837 then joseph story who remain as the representative of marshall 's philosophy upon the bench vehemently protest against the latitudinarianism of chief justice taney and he associate but without produce the slightest effect in 1785 the massachusett legislature charter the charle river bridge company to build a bridge between boston and charlestown authorize it by way of consideration to collect toll for forty year in 1792 the franchise be extend to seventy year when the bridge be to revert to the commonwealth in 1828 the legislature charter the warren bridge company expressly to build a bridge parallel to and practically adjoining the charle river bridge the warren bridge to become a free bridge after six year the purpose of course be to accelerate movement by ruin the charle river bridge company the charle river bridge company seek to restrain the building of the warren bridge as a breach of contract by the state but fail to obtain relief in the state court and before the cause could be argue at washington the warren bridge have become free and have destroy the value of the charle river bridge though its franchise have still twenty year to run as story point out no one deny that the charter of the charle river bridge company be a contract and as he insist it be only common sense as well as common justice and elementary law that contract of this character should be reasonably interpret so far as quiet enjoyment of the consideration grant be concerned but all this avail nothing the gist of the oppose argument be contain in a single sentence in the opinion of the chief justice who speak for the majority of the court : the million of property which have be invest in railroad and canal upon line of travel which have be before occupy by turnpike corporation will be put in jeopardy if this doctrine be to prevail -lrb- 21 -rrb- the effect of the adoption by the supreme court of the united state of the new york theory of the police power be to vest in the judiciary by the use of this catch-word a almost unparalleled prerogative they assume a supreme function which can only be compare to the dispense power claim by the stuart or to the authority which accord to the council of constance inhere in the church to grant indulgence for reasonable cause i suppose nothing in modern judicial history have ever resemble this assumption and yet when we examine it we find it to be not only the logical but the inevitable effect of those mechanical cause which constrain mankind to move along the line of least resistance marshall in a series of decision lay down a general principle which have be prove to be sound when apply by ordinary court deal with ordinary social force and operate under the corrective power of either a legislature or a praetor but which have a different aspect under the american constitutional system he hold that the fundamental law embody in the constitution command that all contract should be sacred therefore he as a judge have but two question to resolve : first whether in the case before he a contract have be prove to exist second admit that a contract have be prove whether it have also be show to have be impaired within ten year after these decision it have be find in practice that public opinion would not sustain so rigid a administration of the law no legislature could intervene and a pressure be bring to bear which the judge could not withstand therefore the court yield declare that if impair a contract be on the whole for the public welfare the constitution as marshall interpret it should be suspend in favor of the legislation which impair it they call this suspension the operation of the police power it follow as the police power could only come into operation at the discretion of the court that therefore within the limit of judicial discretion confiscation however arbitrary and to whatever extent might go on in the energetic language of the supreme court of maine : this duty and consequent power override all statute or contract exemption the state can not free any person or corporation from subjection to this power all personal as well as property rights must be hold subject to the police power of the state -lrb- 22 -rrb- once the theory of the police power be establish it become desirable to define the limit of judicial discretion but that prove to be impossible it could not be determine in advance by abstract reasoning hence as each litigation arise the judge could follow no rule but the rule of common sense and the police power translate into plain english presently come to signify whatever at the moment the judge happen to think reasonable consequently they begin guess at the drift of public opinion as it percolate to they through the medium of they education and prejudice sometimes they guess right and sometimes wrong and when they guess wrong they be cast aside as appear dramatically enough in the temperance agitation up to about the middle of the last century the lawfulness of the liquor business have be unquestioned in the united state and money have be invest as freely in it as in any other legitimate enterprise but as the temperance agitation sweep over the country in obedience to the impulsion give by science to the study of hygiene deal in liquor come to be condemn as a crime presently legislature begin to pass statute to confiscate more or less completely this kind of property and sufferer bring they case before the court to have the constitutionality of the act test under the provision which exist in all state constitution forbid the take by the public of private property without compensation or without due process of law such a provision exist hi the constitution of the state of new york adopt in 1846 and it be to invoke the protection of this clause that one wynehamer who have be indict in 1855 carry he case to the court of appeal in the year 1856 in that cause mr justice comstock who be one of the ablest jurist new york ever produce give a opinion which be a model of judicial ' reasoning he show conclusively the absurdity of constitutional restriction if due process of law may be hold to mean the enactment of the very statute draw to work confiscation -lrb- 23 -rrb- this decision which represent the profoundest conviction of man of the calibre of comstock and denio deserve to rank with marshall 's effort in the dartmouth college case in both instance the tribunal exert itself to carry out hamilton 's principle of judicial duty by exercise its _ judgment _ and not its _ will _ in other word the judge propound a general rule and then simply determine whether the set of fact present to they fall within that rule they resolutely decline to legislate by enter upon a consideration of the soundness or reasonableness of the policy which underlie the action of the legislature in the one case as in the other the effort be unavailing as jefferson prophesy that it would be i have tell of marshall 's overthrow in the charle river bridge case and in 1887 after controversy of this category have begin to come before the supreme court of the united state under the fourteenth amendment mr justice harlan sweep mr justice comstock aside by quietly ignore a argument which be unanswerable -lrb- 24 -rrb- the same series of phenomenon have appear in regard to law confiscate property invest in lottery when opinion turn against lottery or in occupation suppose to be unsanitary as in the celebrated case of the tax out of existence of the render establishment which have be erect as a public benefit to relieve the city of chicago of its offal -lrb- 25 -rrb- in fine whenever pressure have reach a give intensity on one pretext or another court have enforce or dispense with constitutional limitation with quite as much facility as have legislature and for the same reason the only difference have be that the pressure which have operate most directly upon court have not always be the pressure which have sway legislature though sometimes both influence have combine for example during the civil war the court sanction everything the popular majority demand under the pretext of the war power as in peace they have sanction confiscation for certain popular purpose under the name of the police power but then court have always be sensitive to financial influence and if they have be flexible in permit popular confiscation when the path of least resistance have lie that way they have go quite as far in the reverse direction when the amount of capital threaten have be large enough to be with they a countervail force as the federal constitution originally contain no restriction upon the state touch the confiscation of the property of they own citizen provide contract be not impaired it be only in 1868 by the passage of the fourteenth amendment that the supreme court of the united state acquire the possibility of become the censor of state legislation in such matter nor do the supreme court accept this burden very willingly or in haste for a number of year it labor to confine its function to define the limit of the police power guard itself from the responsibility of pass upon the reasonableness with which that power be use it be only by somewhat slow degree as the value of the threaten property grow to be vast that the court be deflect from this conservative course into effective legislation the first prayer for relief come from the southern state who be still groan under reconstruction government but as the southern whites be then rather poor they complaint be neglect the first very famous cause of this category be know as the slaughter house case in 1869 the carpet bag government of louisiana conceive the plan of confiscate most of the property of the butcher who slaughter for new orlean within a district about as large as the state of rhode island the fourteenth amendment forbid state to deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law and the butcher of new orlean pray for protection allege that the manner in which they property have be take be utterly lawless but the supreme court decline to interfere explain that the fourteenth amendment have be contrived to protect the emancipated slave and not to make the federal judiciary a perpetual censor upon all legislation of the state on the civil rights of they own citizen with authority to nullify such as it do not approve -lrb- 26 -rrb- although even at that relatively early day this conservatism meet with strong opposition within the court itself the pressure of vested wealth do not gather enough momentum to overcome the inertia of the bench for nearly another generation it be the concentration of capital in monopoly and the consequent effort by the public to regulate monopoly price which create the stress which change the legal equilibrium the modern american monopoly seem first to have generate that amount of friction which habitually find vent in a great litigation about the year 1870 but only some year later do the state enter upon a determine policy of regulate monopoly price by law with the establishment by the illinois legislature of a tariff for the chicago elevator the elevator company resist on the ground that regulation of price in private business be equivalent to confiscation and so in 1876 the supreme court be drag into this fiercest of controversy thereby become subject to a stress to which no judiciary can safely be expose obviously two question be present for adjudication : the first which by courtesy might be term legal be whether the fix of price by statute be a prerogative which a state legislature might constitutionally exercise at all the second which be purely political be whether admit that in the abstract such a power could be exercise by the state illinoi have in this particular case behave _ reasonably _ the supreme court make a conscientious effort to adhere to the theory of hamilton that it should in emergency like this use its _ judgment _ only and not its _ will _ that it should lay down a rule not vote on the wisdom of a policy so the judge decide that from time immemorial the fix of price in certain trade and occupation have be a legislative function which they suppose might be classify as a branch of the police power but they declare that with this expression of opinion they jurisdiction end when it come to ask they to criticise the propriety of legislation it be in substance propose that they should substitute they _ will _ for the _ will _ of the representative of the people which be impossible i well remember the stir make by the case of munn _ v _ illinoi -lrb- 27 -rrb- both in and out of the legal profession those in harmony with the great vested interest complain that the court have shirk its duty but these complaint soon cease for a movement be in progress which sweep for the moment all before it the great aggregation of capital which have be accumulate ever since the charle river bridge case not long after munn _ v _ illinois attain to a point at which they begin to grasp many important prerogative of sovereignty and to impose what be tantamount to arbitrary taxation upon a large scale the crucial trial of strength come on the contest for control of the railway and in that contest concentrate capital prevail the supreme court reverse its attitude and undertake to do that which it have solemnly protest it could not do it begin to censor legislation in the interest of the strongest force for the time be that force be actually financial by the year 1800 the railway interest have expand prodigiously between 1876 and 1890 the investment in railway have far more than double and during the last five year of this period the increment have be at a average of about $ 450000000 annually at this point the majority of the court yield as ordinary political chamber always must yield to extraordinary pressure mr justice bradley however be not a ordinary man he be on the contrary one of the ablest and strongest lawyer who sit on the federal bench during the last half of the nineteenth century and bradley like story before he remonstrate against turn the bench of magistrate to which he belong from a tribunal which should propound general rule applicable to all material fact into a jury to find verdict on the reasonableness of the vote of representative assembly the legislature of minnesota in 1887 pass a statute to regulate railway rate and provide that the finding of the commission which it erect to fix those rate should be final the chicago milwaukee & st paul railway contend that this statute be unconstitutional because it be unreasonable and the majority of the court sustain they contention -lrb- 28 -rrb- justice bradley gray and lamar dissent and bradley on this occasion deliver a opinion from which i shall quote a paragraph or two since the argument appear to I conclusive not only from the point of view of law but of political expediency and of common sense : -- i can not agree to the decision of the court in this case it practically overrule munn _ v _ illinoi the govern principle of those case be that the regulation and settlement of the fare of railroad and other public accommodation be a legislative prerogative and not a judicial one this be a principle which i regard as of great importance but it be say that all charge should be reasonable and that none but reasonable charge can be exact and it be urge that what be a reasonable charge be a judicial question on the contrary it be preëminently a legislative one involve consideration of policy as well as of remuneration by the decision now make we declare in effect that the judiciary and not the legislature be the final arbiter in the regulation of fare and freight of railroad it be a assumption of authority on the part of the judiciary which it have no right to make the assertion of jurisdiction by this court make it the duty of every court of general jurisdiction state or federal to entertain complaint -lrb- of this nature -rrb- for all court be bind by the constitution of the united state the same as we be there be little to add to these word when the supreme court thus undertake to determine the reasonableness of legislation it assume under a somewhat thin disguise the position of a upper chamber which though it could not originate could absolutely veto most statute touch the use or protection of property for the administration of modern american society now hinge on this doctrine of judicial dispensation under the police power whether it be a regulation of rate and price of hour of labor of height of building of municipal distribution of charity of flood a cranberry bog or of prescribe to sleeping-car porter duty regard the lowering of upper berth -- in question great and small the court vote upon the reasonableness of the use of the police power like any old-fashioned town meeting there be no rule of law involve there be only opinion or prejudice or pecuniary interest the judge admit frankly that this be so they avow that they try to weigh public opinion as well as they can and then vote in 1911 mr justice holme first explain that the police power extend to all great public need and then go on to observe that this police power or extraordinary prerogative might be put forth by legislature in aid of what be sanction by usage or hold by preponderant opinion to be necessary to the public welfare -lrb- 29 -rrb- a representative chamber reach its conclusion touch preponderant opinion by a simple process but the influence which sway court be obscurer -- often probably beyond the sphere of the consciousness of the judge themselves nor be this the worst for as i have already explain the very constitution of a court if it be a court calculate to do its legitimate work upon a lofty level preclude it from keep pace with the movement in science and the art necessarily it lag some year behind and this tendency which be a benefit in the dispensation of justice as between private litigant become a menace when court be involve in politics a long line of sinister precedent crowd unbidden upon the mind the court of king 's bench when it hold hampden to be liable for the ship money drape the scaffold for charle i the parliament of pari when it denounce turgot 's edict touch the corvée throw wide the gate by which the aristocracy of france pass to the guillotine the ruling of the superior court of the province of massachusett bay in the case of the writ of assistance presage the american revolution and the dred scott decision be the prelude to the civil war the capital essential of justice be that under like condition all should fare alike the magistrate should be no respecter of person the vice of we system of judicial dispensation be that it discriminate among suitor in proportion to they power of resistance this be so because under adequate pressure we court yield along the path of least resistance i should not suppose that any man could calmly turn over the page of the recent volume of the report of the supreme court of the united state and not rise from the perusal convinced that the rich and the poor the strong and the weak do not receive a common measure of justice before that judgment seat disregard the discrimination which be always apparent against those who be unpopular or who suffer under special opprobrium as do liquor dealer owner of lottery and the like -lrb- 30 -rrb- i will take nearly at random a couple of example of rate regulation where tenderness have be show property in something approach to a mathematical ratio to the amount involve in April 1894 a record be produce before the supreme court which show that the state of north dakota have in 1891 established rate for elevate and store grain which rate the defendant name brass who own a small elevator allege to be to he in particular _ utterly _ ruinous and to be in general unreasonable he aver that he use he elevator for the storage of he own grain that it cost about $ 3000 that he have no monopoly as there be many hundred such elevator in the state and as land fit for the purpose of building elevator be plenty and cheap that any man could build a elevator in the town in which he live as well as he that the rate he charge be reasonable and that be he compel to receive grain generally at the rate fix by the statute he could not store he own grain all these fact be admit by demurrer and brass contend that if any man 's property be ever to be hold to be appropriate by the public without compensation and under no form of law at all save a predatory statute it should be he but the supreme court vote the dakota statute to be a reasonable exercise of the police power -lrb- 31 -rrb- and dismiss brass to he fate the converse case be a very famous one know as smyth _ v _ ame -lrb- 32 -rrb- decide four year later in 1898 in that case it appear that the state of nebraska have in 1893 reduce freight rate within the state about twenty-nine per cent in order to bring they into some sort of relation to the rate charge in the adjoining state of iowa which be calculate to be forty per cent lower than the nebraska rate several of the most opulent and powerful corporation of the union be affect by this law among other the exceedingly prosperous and influential chicago burlington & quincy railway no one pretend that be the law to be enforce the total revenue of the burlington would be seriously impaired nor be it even clear that be the estimate of reduction revenue and cost confine altogether to the commerce carry on within the limit of the state of nebraska leave interstate commerce out of consideration a loss would be suffer during the following year trade might increase with cheaper rate or economy might be make by the company or both cause and many other of increase earnings might combine corporation counsel however argue that be the principle of the statute admit and should all the state through which the line pass do the like ultimately a point might be reach at which the railway would be unable to maintain even approximately its dividend of eight per cent and that the creation of such a possibility be concede the power of confiscation and therefore a unreasonable exercise of the police power by the state of nebraska with this argument the supreme court concur they hold the nebraska statute to be unreasonable very possibly it may have be unsound legislation yet it be noteworthy that within three year after this decision mr hill buy the chicago burlington & quincy at the rate of $ 200 for every share of stock of the par value of $ 100 thus fix forever on the community tributary to the road the burden of pay a revenue on just double the value of all the stock which it have be find necessary to issue to build the highway even at this price mr hill be suppose to have make a brilliant bargain this bring I to the heart of my theorem ever since hamilton 's time it have be assume as axiomatic by conservative american that court whose function be to expound a write constitution can and do act as a barrier to the encroachment and oppression of the representative body -lrb- 33 -rrb- i apprehend that court can perform no such office and that in assume attribute beyond the limitation of they be they as history have abundantly prove not only fail in they object but shake the foundation of authority and immolate themselves hitherto i have confine myself to adduce historical evidence to prove that american court have as a whole be gifted with so little political sagacity that they interference with legislation on behalf of particular suitor have in the end be a danger rather than a protection to those suitor because of the animosity which it have engender i shall now go further for the sake of argument i be willing to admit that the court in the exercise of the dispense prerogative call the police power have always act wisely so much so that every such decree which they have issue may be triumphantly defend upon economic moral or social grounds yet assume this to be true though i think i have show it to be untrue the assumption only strengthen my contention that we court have cease to be true court and be convert into legislative chamber thereby promising shortly to become if they be not already a menace to order i take it to be clear that the function of a legislature be to embody the will of the dominant social force for the time be in a political policy explain by statute and when that policy have reach a certain stage of development to cause it to be digest together with the judicial decision relevant to it in a code this process of correlation be the highest triumph of the jurist and it be by they easy supremacy in this field of think that roman lawyer chiefly show they preeminence as compare with modern lawyer still while admit this superiority it be probably true that the roman owe much of they success in codification to the greater permanence of the roman legislative tenure of office and therefore stability of policy -- phenomenon which be both probably effect of a slower social movement among the ancient the roman therefore have less need than we of a permanent judiciary to counteract the disintegrate tendency of redundant legislation _ a fortiorus _ of course they have still less to isolate the judiciary from political onslaught which might cause justice to become a series of exception to general principle rather than a code of unvarying rule it be precisely because they be and be intend to be arena of political combat that legislature can not be trustworthy court and it be because this fact be notorious that the founder of this government try to separate the legislative from the judicial function and to make this separation the foundation of the new republic they fail as i conceive not because they make they legislature court but because under the system they devise they court have become legislature a disease perhaps the more insidious of the two insidious because it undermine order while legislative murder and confiscation induce reaction if a legislative chamber would act as a court the first necessity be to eliminate its legislative character for example the house of lord in england have long discharge the duty of a tribunal of last resort for the empire and with general approbation but only because when sit as a court the law lord sit alone politician and political influence be exclude where political influence enter disaster follow hence the infamous renown of political decision in legal controversy such as bill of attainder and _ ex post facto _ law or special legislation to satisfy claim which could not be defend before legitimate court or the scandal always attend the trial of election petition the object of true court be to shield the public from these and kindred abuse in primitive community court be erect to defend the weak against the strong by correlate local custom in such wise that some general principle can be deduce which shall protect the civil rights of those who can not protect themselves against the arbitrary exaction of powerful neighbor in no community can every person have equal civil rights that be impossible civil rights must vary accord to status but such rights as any person may have those the court be bind to guard indifferently if the court do not perform this they first and most sacred duty i apprehend that order can not be permanently maintain for this be equality before the law and equality before the law be the cornerstone of order in every modern state i conceive that the lawyer of the age of washington be the ablest that america have ever produce no man ever understand the principle of equality before the law more thoroughly than they and after the establishment of this government a long series of great and upright magistrate strive as i have show to carry this principle into effect jay and marshall story and bradley and many many more struggle protest and fail fail as i believe through no fault of they own but because fortune have place they in a position untenable for the judge when plunge in the vortex of politics court must waver as do legislature and nothing be to I more painful than to watch the process of deterioration by which we judge lose the instinct which should warn they to shun legislation as a breach of trust and to cleave to those general principle which permit of no exception to illustrate my meaning i shall refer to but one litigation but that one be so extraordinary that i must deal with it in detail in 1890 the dread of the enhancement of price by monopoly as the supreme court itself have explain cause congress to pass the famous sherman act which prohibit indiscriminately all monopoly or restraint of trade presently the government bring a bill to dissolve a obnoxious railway pool call the trans-missouri freight association and in 1896 the case come up for adjudication i have nothing to say touch the policy involve i be only concern with a series of phenomenon develop through several year as effect of pressure act upon a judiciary expose as the judiciary under we system be expose the trans-missouri case be argue on December 8 1896 very elaborately and by the most eminent counsel after long consideration and profound reflection mr justice peckham speak for the majority of the tribunal lay down a general principle in conformity to the legislative will precisely as marshall have lay down a general principle in the dartmouth college case or story in the charle river bridge case or waite in munn _ v _ illinoi or bradley in the minnesota rate case then the process of agitation immediately begin in the word of mr justice harlan fifteen year later : but those who be in combination that be illegal do not despair they at once set up the baseless claim that the decision of 1896 disturb the ` business interest of the country ' and let it be know that they would never be content until the rule be establish that would permit interstate commerce to be subject to _ reasonable _ restraint -lrb- 34 -rrb- other great cause involve the same issue be try the question be repeatedly reargue but the supreme court tenaciously adhere to its general principle that under the sherman act _ all _ restraint of trade or monopoly be unlawful and therefore the court have but two matter before it first to define a restraint of trade or a monopoly second to determine whether the particular combination complain of fell within that definition no discretion be permit judicial duty end there the court be find to be inflexible recourse be have to congress and a bill in the form of a amendment to the sherman act be bring into the senate authorize in substance those who feel unsafe under the law to apply to certain government official to be permit to produce evidence of the reasonable method they employ and if the evidence be satisfactory to receive what be tantamount to a indulgence the subject thus reopen the senate committee on the judiciary go into the whole question of monopoly anew and in 1909 senator nelson present a exhaustive report against the propose relaxation thereupon the senate indefinitely postpone further consideration of the amendment the chief reason give by senator nelson be sum up in a single sentence : the defense of reasonable restraint would be make in every case and there would be as many different rule of reasonableness as case court and jury to amend the anti-trust act as suggest by this bill would be to entirely emasculate it and for all practical purpose render it nugatory as a remedial statute the act as it exist be clear comprehensive certain and highly remedial it practically cover the field of federal jurisdiction and be in every respect a model law to destroy or undermine it at the present juncture would be a calamity in view of the foregoing you committee recommend the indefinite postponement of the bill -lrb- 35 -rrb- and so the senate do indefinitely postpone the bill matter stand thus when the government bring process to dissolve the standard oil company as a unlawful combination the cause be decide on may 15 1911 the chief justice speak for the majority of the bench in one of the most suggestive opinion which i have ever read to I this opinion like taney 's opinion in the charle river bridge case indicate that the tension have reach the breaking point the court yielding in all direction at once while the dominant preoccupation of the preside judge seem to be to plant he tribunal in such a position that it could so yield without stultify itself hopelessly before the legal profession and the public in strive to reach this position however i apprehend that the chief justice unreservedly cross the chasm on whose brink american jurist have be shudder for ninety year the task the chief justice assume be difficult almost beyond precedent he propose to surrender to the vested interest the principle of _ reasonableness _ which they demand and which the tribunal he represent together with congress have refuse to surrender for fifteen year to pacify the public which would certainly resent this surrender he be prepare to punish two hate corporation while he strive to preserve so far as he could the respect of the legal profession and of the public for the court over which he preside by maintain a semblance of consistency to accomplish these contradictory result the chief justice begin rather after the manner of marshall in marbury _ v _ madison by a extra-judicial disquisition the object of this disquisition be to justify he admission of the evidence of reasonableness as a defense although it be not needful to decide that such evidence must be admit in order to dispose of that particular cause for the chief justice very readily agree that the standard oil company be in fact a unreasonable restraint of trade and must be dissolve no matter whether it be allow to prove its reasonable method or not accordingly he might have contented himself with state that admit for the sake of argument but without approve all the defendant advance he should sustain the government but to have so disposed of the case would not have suit he purpose what the chief justice have it at heart to do be to surrender a fundamental principle and yet to appear to make no surrender at all hence he prepare he preliminary and extra-judicial essay on the human reason of whose precise meaning i must admit i still after many perusal have grave doubt i sometimes suspect that the chief justice do not wish to be too explicit so far as i comprehend the chief justice he chain of reasoning amount to something like this : it be true he observe that for fifteen year the supreme court have reject the evidence of reasonableness which he admit and have insist upon a general principle which he might be suppose to renounce but this apparent discrepancy involve no contradiction it be only a progression in think for he continue the judge who on various previous occasion sustain that general principle must have reach they conclusion by the light of reason to-day we reach a contrary conclusion but we also do so by the light of reason therefore as all these decision be guide by the light of reason they fundamentally coincide however much superficially they may seem to differ -lrb- 36 -rrb- i have never suppose that this argument carry complete conviction either to the legal profession to the public or to congress certainly it do not convince mr justice harlan who fail to fathom it and bluntly express he astonishment in a dissent opinion in another cause from which i regret to say i can only quote a couple of paragraph although the whole deserve attentive perusal : -- if i do not misapprehend the opinion just deliver the court insist that what be say in the opinion in the standard oil case be in accordance with we previous decision in the trans-missourus and joint traffic case if we resort to _ reason _ this statement surprise I quite as much as would a statement that black be white or white be black but now the court in accordance with what it denominate the ` rule of reason ' in effect insert in the act the word ` undue ' which mean the same as ` unreasonable ' and thereby make congress say what it do not say and what since the passage of the act it have explicitly refuse to say in short the court now by judicial legislation in effect amend a act of congress relate to a subject over which that department of the government have exclusive cognizance -lrb- 37 -rrb- the phenomenon which amaze mr justice harlan be i conceive perfectly comprehensible if we reflect a little on the conflict of force involve and on the path of least resistance open to a american judge seek to find for this conflict a resultant the regulation or the domination of monopoly be a issue go to the foundation of society and popular and financial energy have come into violent impact in regard to the control of price popular energy find vent through congress while the financier as financier always have and always will take shelter behind the court congress in 1890 pass a statute to constrain monopoly against which financier protest as be a species of confiscation and which the chief justice himself think harsh to this statute the supreme court give a harsh construction as the chief justice have more than once point out when he be still a associate upon the bench from a series of these decision a appeal have be make to congress and the senate in the report from which i have quote have sustain the construction give to the statute by the majority of he brethren with whom the chief justice differ since the last of these decision however the complexion of the bench have be considerably change by new appointment much as it have be after hepburn _ v _ griswold and a opportunity seem to be present to conciliate every one in any other country than the united state a chief justice so situated would doubtless have affirm the old precedent permit himself at most to point out the mischief which he think they work not so a lawyer nurture under the american constitutional system which breed in the judge the conviction that he be superior to the legislator he instinct under adequate pressure be always to overrule anything repugnant to he that a legitimate legislative assembly may have do in this instance have the case be one of first impression nothing would have be easier than to have nullify the sherman act as a unreasonable exercise of the police power as judge have be nullify statute of which they disapprove for a couple of generation previously but the case be not one of first impression on the contrary the constitutionality of the sherman act have be so often uphold by the judiciary that the chief justice himself admit that so long as congress allow he to use he reason these contention -lrb- be -rrb- plainly foreclose therefore for he the path of least resistance be to use he _ reason _ and as a magistrate to amend a statute which congress ought to have amend but have _ unreasonably _ omit to amend such be the final and logical result of the blending of judicial and legislative function in a court as they be blended under the american constitutional system nor be it unworthy of remark that the chief justice in abstain from question the constitutionality of the act expressly intimate that he do so because by the use of he reason he could make that reasonable and constitutional which otherwise might be unreasonable and unconstitutional the defendant press the argument that destroy the freedom of contract as the sherman law destroy it be to infringe upon the constitutional guaranty of due process of law to this the chief justice rejoin : but the ultimate foundation of all these argument be the assumption that reason may not be resort to in interpret and apply the statute as the premise be demonstrate to be unsound by the construction we have give the statute these argument need no further notice -lrb- 38 -rrb- should congress amend the sherman act as it seem somewhat disposed to do by explicitly enact the rule of the trans-missouri case a grave issue would be present the chief justice might submit and thus avert temporarily at least a clash or he might hold such a amendment unconstitutional as deny to the court the right to administer the law accord to due process a trial of strength would then be imminent nearly a century ago jefferson write to spencer roane the constitution on this hypothesis be a mere thing of wax in the hand of the judiciary which they may twist and shape into any form they please -lrb- 39 -rrb- and however much we may recoil from admit jefferson 's conclusion to be true it none the less remain the fact that it have prove itself to be true and that the people have recognize it to be true and have take measure to protect themselves by bring the judiciary under the same degree of control which they enforce on other legislator the progression have be steady and uniform each advance toward a assumption of the legislative function by the judiciary have be counterbalance by a corresponding extension of authority over the court by the people first come the protest against marbury and madison in the impeachment of chase because as gile explain if judge be to annul law the dominant party must have on the bench judge they could trust next the supreme court of new york imagine the theory of the police power which be adopt by the supreme court of the united state in 1837 but it stand to reason that if judge be to suspend constitutional limitation accord to they notion of reasonableness the people must have the means of secure judge whose view touch reasonableness coincide with they own and behold within ten year by the constitution of 1846 new york adopt a elective judiciary then follow the dred scott case the civil war and the attack on legislative authority in hepburn _ v _ griswold straightway the court receive a admonition which it remember for a generation somewhat forgetful of this on may 15 1911 chief justice white give he opinion in the standard oil case which follow hard upon a number of state decision intend to override legislation upon several burn social issue forthwith in 1912 the proposition to submit all decision involve a question of constitutional law to a popular vote become a issue in a presidential election only one step farther could be take and that we see be take all about we experience have show in new york and elsewhere that a election even for a somewhat short term do not bring the judge so immediately under popular control that decision objectionable to the majority may not be make hence the recall the degradation of the judicial function can in theory at least go no farther thus the state court may be say already to be prostrate or likely shortly to become prostrate the united state court alone remain and should there be a struggle between they and congress the result can hardly be doubt a event have recently occur abroad which we may do well to ponder among european nation england have long represent intelligent conservatism and at the heart of she conservatism lay the house of lord through many century and under many vicissitude this ancient chamber have perform function of the highest moment until of late it have come to occupy a position not dissimilar to that which the supreme court of the united state yet hold on one side it be the highest legal tribunal of the empire on the other it be a non-representative assembly seldom indeed originate important legislation but enjoy a absolute veto on legislation send it from the common one day in a moment of heated controversy the lord veto a bill on which the common have determine a dissolution follow and the house of lord as a political power fade into a shadow yet notwithstanding this its preeminence as a court have remain intact be a similar clash to occur in america no such result could be anticipate suppose a president support by a congressional majority be to formulate some policy no more subversive than that which have be formulate by the present british cabinet and this policy be to be resist as it surely would be by potent financial interest the conflicting force would converge upon the supreme court the court be always believe to tend toward conservatism therefore they be generally support by the conservative interest both here and elsewhere in this case a dilemma would be present either the judge would seek to give expression to preponderant popular opinion or they would legislate in the one event they would be worthless as a restrain influence in the other i apprehend a blow would fall similar to the blow which fall upon the house of lord only it would cut deeper shear the house of lord of political power do not dislocate the administration of english justice because the law lord be exclusively judge they never legislate therefore no one denounce they not even the wildest radical demand that they tenure should be make elective much less that they should be subject to the recall with we a entirely different problem would be present for solution a tribunal nominally judicial would throw itself across the path of the national movement it would undertake to correct a disturbance of the social equilibrium but what a shift of the social equilibrium mean and what follow upon tamper with it be a subject which demand a

spencer roane sept 6 1819 ford 10 141 chapter iv the social equilibrium i assume it as self-evident that those who at any given moment be the strongest in any civilization will be those who be at once the ruling class those who own most property and those who have most influence on legislation the weaker will fare hardly in proportion to they weakness such be the order of nature but since those be the strongest through whom nature find it for the time be easiest to vent she energy and as the whole universe be in ceaseless change it follow that the composition of ruling class be never constant but shift to correspond with the shift environment when this movement be so rapid that man can not adapt themselves to it we call the phenomenon a revolution and it be with revolution that i now have to do nothing be more certain than that the intellectual adaptability of the individual man be very limit a ruling class be seldom conscious of its own decay and most of the worst catastrophe of history have be cause by a obstinate resistance to change when resistance be no longer possible thus while a incessant alteration in social equilibrium be inevitable a revolution be a problem in dynamics on the correct solution of which the fortune of a decline class depend for example the modern english landlord replace the military feudal aristocracy during the sixteenth century because the landlord have more economic capacity and less credulity the man who supplant the mediaeval soldier in great britain have no scruple about rob the clergy of they land and because of this quality they prosper greatly ultimately the landlord reach high fortune by control the borough which have in the middle age acquire the right to return member to the house of common they domination last long nevertheless about 1760 the rise tide of the industrial revolution bring forward another type of mind flush by success in the napoleonic war the tory fail to appreciate that the social equilibrium by the year 1830 have shift and that they no longer command enough physical force to maintain they parliamentary ascendancy they think they have only to be arrogant to prevail and so they put forward the duke of wellington as they champion they could hardly have make a poorer choice as disraelus have very truly say he grace precipitate a revolution which might have be delay for half a century and need never have occur in so aggravate a form the duke though a great general lack knowledge of england he begin by dismiss william huskisson from he cabinet who be not only its ablest member but perhaps the single man among the tory who thoroughly comprehend the industrial age huskisson 's issue be that the franchise of the intolerably corrupt east retford should be give to leed or manchester have get rid of huskisson the duke declare imperiously that he would concede nothing to the disfranchised industrial magnate nor to the vast city in which they live a dissolution of parliament follow and in the election the tory be defeat although wellington may not have be a sagacious statesman he be a capable soldier and he know when he could and when he could not physically fight on this occasion to again quote disraelus he rather flee than retire he induce he friend to absent themselves from the house of lord and permit the reform bill to become law thus the english tory by they experiment with the duke of wellington lose they borough and with they they political preeminence but at least they save themselves they family and the rest of they property as a class they have survive to this day although shear of much of the influence which they might very probably have retain have they solve more correctly the problem of 1830 in sum they be not altogether impervious to the exigency of they environment the french revolution be the classic example of the annihilation of a rigid organism and it be a example the more worthy of we attention as it throw into terrible relief the process by which a intellectually inflexible race may convert the court of law which should protect they decline into the most awful engine for they destruction the essence of feudalism be a gradation of rank in the nature of caste base upon fear the clergy be privileged because the laity believe that they could work miracle and could dispense something more vital even than life and death the nobility be privileged because they be resistless in war therefore the nobility could impose all sort of burden upon those who be unarmed during the interval in which society centralize and acquire more and more a modern economic form the discrepancy in status remain while commensurately the physical or imaginative force which have once sustained inequality decline until the social equilibrium grow to be extremely unstable add to this that france under the monarchy be ill consolidated the province and town retain the administrative complexity of a archaic age even to local tariff thus under the monarchy privilege and inequality pervade every phase of life and as the judiciary must be more or less the mouthpiece of society the judiciary come to be the incarnation of caste speaking broadly the judicial office under the monarchy be vendible in legal language it be a incorporeal hereditament it could be buy and sell and inherit like a advowson or right to dispose of a cure of soul in the english church or of a commission in the english army the system be well recognize and widespread in the eighteenth century and work fairly well with the french judiciary for about three hundred year but it be not adapt to a industrial environment the judicial career come to be pretty strongly hereditary in a few family and though the member of these family be on the whole self-respecting honest and learn they hold office in they own right and not as a public trust so in england member of the house of common who sit for nomination borough do not either in fact or theory represent the inhabitant of those borough but patron and in like manner french judge could never learn to regard themselves as the trustee of the civil rights of a nation but as a component part of a class who hold a status by private title look at as a problem in dynamics the inherent vice in all this kind of property and in all this administrative system be the decay after 1760 of the physical force which have engender it and defend it as in england the ascendancy of the landlord pass away when england turn from a agricultural into a industrial society so in france priest and noble fall into contempt when most peasant know that the church could neither harm by its curse nor aid by its blessing and when commission in the army be give to child or favorite as a sort of pension while the pith of the nation be exclude from military command because it could not prove four quartering of nobility hardly a aristocrat in france have show military talent for a generation while when the revolution begin man like jourdan and kleber ney and augereau and a host of other future marshal and general have be dismiss from the army or be eat out they heart as petty officer with no hope of advancement local privilege and inequality be as intolerable as personal there be privileged province and those administer arbitrarily by the crown there be a multiplicity of internal tariff and endless municipal franchise and monopoly so much so that economist estimate that through artificial restraint one-quarter of the soil of france lay waste turgot in he edict on the grain trade explain that king in the past by ordinance or the police without royal authority have compile a body of legislation equivalent to a prohibition of bring grain into pari and this condition be universal one province might be starve and another oppress with abundance meanwhile under the stimulant of apply science centralization go on resistlessly and the cost of administration be proportionate to centralization to bear the burden of a centralized government tax must be equal and movement free but here be a rapidly centralize nation the essence of whose organism be that tax should be unequal and that movement should be restrict as the third quarter of the eighteenth century close with the death of loui xv all intelligent french administrator recognize the dilemma either relief must be give or france must become insolvent and revolution supervene upon insolvency but for the aristocracy revolution have no terror for they believe that they could crush revolution as they class have do for a thousand year robert turgot be bear in 1727 of a respectable family he father educate he for the church but lack of faith cause he to prefer the magistracy and on the death of he father he obtain a small place in the court of parliament afterward he become a master of request and serve for seven year in that judicial position before he be make intendant of the province of limousin even thus early in life turgot show political sagacity in a address at the sorbonne he support the thesis that well-timed reform alone avert revolution distinguish himself as intendant on the death of loui xv the king call turgot to the council of state and in August 1774 turgot become minister of finance he come in pledge to reform and by January 1776 he have formulate he plan in that month he present to the king he memorable six edict the first of which be the most celebrated state paper he ever write it be the edict for the suppression of the corvée the corvée throw the burden of maintain the highway on the peasantry by exact force labor it be admittedly the most hateful the most burdensome and the most wasteful of all the bad tax of the time and turgot follow the precedent of the roman empire advise instead a general highway impost the propose impost in itself be not considerable and would not have be extraordinarily obnoxious to the privileged class but for the principle of equality by which turgot justify it : the expense of government have for they object the interest of all all should contribute to they and the more advantage a man have the more that man should contribute nor be this the most levelling of turgot 's argument he point out that though originally the exemption from taxation which the nobility enjoy might have be defend on the ground that the noble be bind to yield military service without pay such service have long cease to be perform while on the contrary title could be buy for money hence every wealthy man become a noble when he please and thus exemption from taxation have come to present the line of cleavage between the rich and poor by this thrust the privileged class feel themselves wound in they vitals and the parliament of paris the essence of privilege assume they defense to be bind the edict have to be register by the parliament among the law of france and parliament decline to make registration on the ground that the edict be unconstitutional as subversive of the monarchy and of the principle of order the opinion of the court be long but a single paragraph give its purport : the first rule of justice be to preserve to every one what belong to he : this rule consist not only in preserve the rights of property but still more in preserve those belong to the person which arise from the prerogative of birth and of position from this rule of law and equity it follow that every system which under a appearance of humanity and beneficence would tend to establish between man a equality of duty and to destroy necessary distinction would soon lead to disorder -lrb- the inevitable result of equality -rrb- and would bring about the overturn of civil society this judicial opinion be a enunciation of the archaic law of caste as oppose to the modern law of equality and the cataclysm of the french revolution hinge upon the incapacity of the french aristocracy to understand that the environment which have once make caste a necessity have yield to another which make caste a impossibility in vain turgot and he contemporary of the industrial type represent in england by adam smith or even by the younger pitt explain that unless tax be equalize and movement accelerate insolvency must supervene and that a violent readjustment must follow upon insolvency with they eye open to the consequence the nobility and clergy elect to risk revolt because they do not believe that revolt could prevail against they nothing be so impressive in the mighty convulsion which ensue as the mental opacity of the privileged order which cause they to increase they pressure in proportion as resistance increase until finally those who be destine to replace they reorganize the court that they might have a instrument wherewith to slaughter a whole race down to the woman and child no less drastic method would serve to temper the rigidity of the aristocratic mind the phenomenon well repay a hour of study insolvency come within a decade after turgot 's fall as turgot have demonstrate that it must come and a insolvency immediately precipitate by the rapacity of the court which have most need of caution the future loui xviii for example who be then know as the comte de provence on one occasion when the government have make a loan appropriate a quarter of it laughingly observe when i see other hold out they hand i hold out my hat in 1787 the need for money become imperative and not daring to appeal to the nation the king convoke a assembly of notable that be to say of the privileged calonne the minister propose pretty much the measure of turgot and some of these measure the notable accept but the parliament of pari again intervene and decline to register the law the provincial parliament follow the parliament of pari after this the king have no alternative but to try the experiment of call the states-general they meet on may 4 1789 and instantly a administrative system which no longer rest upon a social center of gravity crumble carry the judiciary with it at first the three estate sit separately if this usage have continue the clergy and the noble combine would have annul every measure vote by the common for six week the common wait then on June 10 the abbé sieyès say let we cut the cable it be time so the clergy and the nobility be summon and some of the clergy obey this suffice on motion of sieyès the common proclaim themselves the national assembly and the order fuse immediately caste admit defeat and through its mouthpiece the king command the assembly to dissolve the common refuse to dissolve and the noble prepare for a _ coup d'etat _ the foreign regiment in the pay of the government be station about pari while the bastille which be suppose to be impregnable be garrison with swiss in reply on July 14 1789 the citizen of pari storm the bastille a unstable social equilibrium have be already convert by pressure into a revolution nevertheless excentric as the center of gravity have now become it might have be measurably readjust have the privileged class be able to reason correctly from premise to conclusion man like lafayette and mirabeau still control the assembly and if the king and the nobility have make term probably the monarchy might have be save certainly the massacre would have be avert as a decaying class be apt to do the nobility do that which be worst for themselves become at length partly conscious of a lack of physical force in france to crush the revolution a portion of the nobility lead by the comte d'artoi the future charle x flee to germany to seek for help abroad while the bolder remain to plan a attack on the rebellion on October 1 1789 a great military banquet be give at versaille the king and queen with the dauphin be present a royalist demonstration begin the bugle sound a charge the officer draw they sword and the lady of the court tear the tricolor from the soldier ' coat and replace it with the white cockade on October 5 a vast multitude pour out of pari and march to versaille the next day they break into the palace kill the guard and carry the king and queen captive to the tuilery but loui be so intellectually limit that he could not keep faith with those who wish he well on July 14 1790 the king swear before half a million spectator to maintain the new constitution in that summer he be plot to escape to metz and join the army which have be collect there under the marquis de bouillé while bouillé himself after the rise at nancy be busy in improve discipline by break on the wheel a selection of the soldier of the swiss regiment of châteauvieux which have refuse to march against pari on the 14th of July 1789 in October 1790 loui write to the king of spain and other sovereign to pay no heed to he concession for he only yield to duress and all this even as mirabeau make he supreme effort to save those who be fix upon destroy themselves mirabeau seek the king and offer he service the court sneer at he as a dupe the queen write we make use of mirabeau but we do not take he seriously when mirabeau awake to he predicament he break out in mixed wrath and scorn : of what be these people think do they not see the abyss yawn at they foot both the king and queen will perish and you will live to see the rabble spurn they corpse the king and queen the nobility and clergy could not see the abyss which mirabeau see any more than the lawyer could see it because of the temper of they mind in the eye of caste europe be not primarily divide into nation to whom allegiance be due but into superimpose order he who betray he order commit the unpardonable crime death be better than that but to the true aristocrat it be inconceivable that serf could ever vanquish noble in battle battle must be the final test and the whole aristocracy of europe be certain frenchman know to succor the french aristocracy in distress so in the winter of 1790 the french fugitive congregate at coblentz on the german frontier persuade that they be perform a patriotic duty in organize a invasion of they country even should they onset be fatal to they relative and to they king and loui doubt not that he also do he duty as a trustee of a divine commission when he in one month swear before the assembly to maintain the constitution tender he and in the next authorize he brother the comte d'artoi to make the best combination he could among he brother sovereign for the gathering of a army to assert he divine prerogative on June 21 1791 loui flee with he whole family to join the army of bouillé with intent to destroy the entire race of traitor from mirabeau and lafayette down to the peasant he manage so ill that he be arrest at varenne and bring back whence he come but he lie and plot still two year have elapse between the meeting of the states-general and the flight to varenne and in that interval nature have be busy in select she new favored class economist have estimate that the church own one-third of the land of europe during the middle age however this may have be she certainly hold a very large part of france on April 16 1790 the assembly declare this territory to be national property and proceed to sell it to the peasantry by means of the paper _ assignat _ which be issue for the purpose and be suppose to be secure upon the land the sale be generally make in little lot as the sale be make of the public domain in rome under the licinian law and with a identical effect the emperor of germany and the king of prussium meet at pilnitz in August 1791 to consider the conquest of france and on the eve of that meet the assembly receive a report which state that these land to the value of a thousand million franc have already be distribute and that sale be go on it be from this breed of liberated husbandman that france draw the soldier who fight she battle and win she victory for the next five and twenty year assume that the type of the small french landholder both rural and urban have be pretty well develop by the autumn of 1791 the crisis come rapidly for the confiscation which create this new energy rouse to frenzy perhaps the most formidable energy which oppose it the church have not only be rob of she property but have be wound in she tenderest part by a decree of June 12 1790 the assembly transfer the allegiance of the french clergy from the pope to the state and the priesthood everywhere vow revenge in may 1791 the marquis de la rouërie it be true journey from he home in brittany to germany to obtain the recognition of the royal prince for the insurrection which he contemplate in la vendée but the insurrection when it occur be not due so much to he or he kind as to the influence of the nonjuring priest upon the peasant woman of the west the mental condition of the french emigrant at coblentz during this summer of 1791 be nothing short of a psychological marvel they regard the revolution as a jest and the flight to the rhine as a picnic these beggar aristocrat male and female would throw they money away by day among the wonder native and gamble among themselves at night if they ever think of the future it be only as the patrician in pompey 's camp think who have no time to prepare for a campaign against caesar because they be absorb in distribute office among themselves or in invent torment to inflict on the rebel they chief anxiety be lest the resistance should be too feeble to permit they to glut themselves with blood the creature of caste the emigrant could not conceive of man as a variable animal or of the birth of a race of warrior under they eye to they human nature remain constant such they believe be the immutable will of god so it come to pass that as the revolution take its shape a vast combination among the antique species come semi-automatically into existence pledge to envelop and strangle the rise type of man a combination however which only attain to maturity in 1793 after the execution of the king leopold ii emperor of germany have hitherto be the chief restrain influence both at pilnitz and at pari through he correspondence with he sister marie antoinette but leopold die on march 1 1792 and be succeed by franci ii a fervid reactionist and a obedient son of the church then caste fuse throughout germany and prussium and austrium prepare for war rouërie have return to brittany and only await the first decisive foreign success to stab the revolution in the back england also be ripening and the instinct of caste incarnate in george iii find its expression through edmund burke in 1790 burke publish he reflection and on may 6 1791 in a passionate outbreak in the house of common he renounce he friendship with fox as a traitor to he order and he god man of burke 's temperament appreciate intuitively that there could be no peace between the rise civilization and the old one of the two must destroy the other and very few of they conceive it to be possible that the enfranchised french peasantry and the small bourgeoisie could endure the shock of all that in they eye be intelligent sacred and martial in the world indeed aristocracy have perhaps some justification for arrogance since the revolt in france fall to its lowest depth of impotence between the meeting at pilnitz in August 1791 and the reorganization of the committee of public safety in July 1793 until August 1792 the executive authority remain with the king but the court of loui be the focus of resistance to the revolution and even though a quasi-prisoner the king be still strong monarchy have a firm hold on liberal noble like mirabeau and lafayette on adventurer like dumouriez and even on lawyer like danton who shrink from excessive cruelty have the pure royalist be capable of enough intellectual flexibility to keep faith upon any reasonable basis of compromise even as late as 1792 the revolution might have be benign in June 1792 lafayette who command the army of the north come to pari and not only venture to lecture the assembly on its duty but offer to take loui to he army who would protect he against the jacobin the court laugh at lafayette as a don quixote and betray he plan to the enemy i have rather perish say the queen than be save by m de lafayette and he constitutional friend and in this she only express the conviction which the caste to which she belong hold of they duty cazalés protest to the assembly though the king perish let we save the kingdom the archduchess christina write to she sister marie antoinette what though he be slay if we shall triumph and condé in December 1790 swear that he would march on lyon come what might to the king france be permeate with archaic thought which disorganize the emerge society until it seemingly have no cohesion to the french emigrant on the rhine that society appear like a vile phantom which have but to be exorcise to vanish and the exorcism to which he have recourse be threat of vengeance threat which before have terrify because they have behind they a force which make they good torture have be a integral part of the old law the peasant expect it be he insubordinate death alone be hold to be too little to inspire respect for caste some frightful spectacle be usually provide to magnify authority thus bouillé break on the wheel while the man be yet alive every bone in the body of he soldier when they disobey he and for scratch loui xv with a knife damien after indescribable agony be tear asunder by horse in pari before a immense multitude the french emigrant believe that they have only to threaten with a similar fate man like kellermann and hoche to make they flee without a blow what chiefly concern the noble therefore be not to evolve a masterly campaign but to propound the fundamental principle of monarchy and to denounce a awful retribution on insurgent by the middle of July 1792 the prussian be ready to march and emperor king and general be meditate manifesto loui send the journalist mallet du pan to the duke of brunswick the commander-in-chief to assist he in he task on July 24 and on August 4 1792 the king of prussium lay down the law of caste as emphatically as have the parliament of paris some twenty year before on July 25 the duke of brunswick pronounce the doom of the conquer i come say the king of prussium to prevent the incurable evil which will result to france to europe and to all mankind from the spread of the spirit of insubordination and to this end i shall establish the monarchical power upon a stable basis for he continue in the later proclamation the supreme authority in france be never cease and indivisible the king could neither be deprive nor voluntarily divest himself of any of the prerogative of royalty because he be oblige to transmit they entire with he own crown to he successor the duke of brunswick 's proclamation contain some clause write expressly for he by mallet du pan and by limon the royalist if the palace of the tuilery be force if the least violence be offer to they majesty if they be not immediately set at liberty then will the king of prussium and the emperor of germany inflict on those who shall deserve it the most exemplary and ever-memorable avenging punishment these proclamation reach pari on July 28 and simultaneously the notorious fersen write the queen of france you have the manifesto and you should be content the court actually believe that have insult and betray lafayette and all that body of conservative opinion which might have steady the social equilibrium they could rely on the fidelity of regiment fill with man against whom the emigrant and they ally the prussian have just denounce a agonizing death such as bouillé 's soldier have undergo together with the destruction of they home all the world know what follow the royalist have be gather a garrison for the tuilery ever since lafayette 's visit in anticipation of a trial of strength with the revolutionist they have bring thither the swiss guard fifteen hundred strong the palace be full of royalist gentleman mandat who command the national guard have be gain over the approach be sweep by artillery the court be very confident on the night of August 9 mandat be murder a insurrectional committee seize the city hall and when loui xvi come forth to review the troops on the morning of the 10th of August they shout vive la nation and desert then the assault come the swiss guard be massacre the assembly thrust aside and the royal family be seize and convey to the temple there the monarchy end thus far have the irrational opposition of a moribund type throw into excentricity the social equilibrium of a naturally conservative people they be destine to drive it still farther in this supreme moment while the prussian be advance france have no stable government and very imperfect means of keep order all the fight man she could muster have march to the frontier and even so only a demoralize mass of levy under dumouriez and kellermann lay between the most redoutable regiment of the world and pari the emigrant and the german think the invasion but a military promenade at home treason to the government hardly care to hide itself during much of August the street of pari swarm with royalist who curse the revolution and with priest more bitter than the royalist under the window of loui as he lay in the temple there be cry of long live the king and in the prison themselves the noble drink to the ally and correspond with the prussian finally roland who be minister so far lose courage that he propose to withdraw beyond the loire but danton would hear of no retreat de l'audace he cry encore de l'audace et toujors de l'audace the assembly have not be responsible for the assault on the tuilery on August 10 1792 fill with conservative it lack the energy that movement have be the work of a knot of radical which have its center in danton 's club of the cordelier under they impulsion the section of pari choose commissioner who should take possession of the city hall and eject the loyalist council they do so and thus danton become for a season the minister of justice and the foremost man in france danton be a semi-conservative he tenure of power be the last possibility of avert the terror the royalist whom he trust themselves betray he and danton fall to be succeed by robespierre and he political criminal court meanwhile on September 20 1792 the prussian column recoil before the fire of kellermann 's mob of vagabond cobbler and tailor on the slope of valmy and with the victory of valmy the great eighteenth-century readjustment of the social equilibrium of europe pass into its secondary stage chapter v political court in the eye of philosophy perhaps the most alluring and yet illusive of all the phenomenon present by civilization be that which we have be consider why should a type of mind which have develop the highest prescience when advance along the curve which have lead it to ascendancy be stricken with fatuity when the summit of the curve be pass and when a miscalculation touch the velocity of the descent must be destruction although this phenomenon have appear pretty regularly at certain interval in the development of every modern nation i conceive its most illuminating example to be that intellectual limitation of caste which during the french revolution lead to the creation of those political criminal tribunal which reach perfection with robespierre when coolly examine at the distance of a century the royalist combination for the suppression of equality before the law as finally evolve in 1792 do not so much lack military intelligence as it lack any approximate comprehension of the modern mind the royalist propose to reëstablish privilege and to do this they be ready to immolate if necessary they king and queen and all of they own order who stay at home to defend they indeed speak generally they value loui xvi living cheaply enough count he a more considerable asset if dead what a noise it would make throughout europe they whisper among themselves if the rabble should kill the king nor do marie antoinette delude herself on this score at pilnitz in 1791 the german potentate issue a declaration touch france which be too moderate to suit the emigrant who publish upon it a commentary of they own this commentary be so revolting that when the queen read she brother-in-law 's signature append to it she exclaim -- cain the royalist plan of campaign be this : they reckon the energy of the revolution so low that they count pretty confidently in the summer of 1792 on the ability of they party to defend the tuilery against any force which could be bring against it but assume that the tuilery could not be defend and that the king and queen should be massacre they believe that they own position would be improve they monarchical ally would be thereby violently stimulate it be determine therefore that regardless of consequence to they friend the invade army should cross the border into lorraine and march by way of sierk and rodemach occupy châlons they entry into châlons which they be confident could not be hold against they because of the feeling throughout the country be to be the signal for the rise in vendée and brittany which should sweep down upon pari from the rear and make the capital untenable at châlons the ally would be but ninety mile from pari and then nothing would remain but vengeance and vengeance the more complete the greater the crime have be all go well with they up to valmy the german advance on August 11 1792 reach rodemach and on August 19 the bulk of the prussian army cross the frontier at rédagne on August 20 1792 longwy be invest and in three day capitulate in the camp of the comte d'artoi there be not one of we write las casas who do not see himself in a fortnight triumphant in he own home surround by he humble and submissive vassal at length from they bivouac at saint-remy and at suippe the noble see in the distance the tower of châlons the panic at châlons be so great that order be give to cut the bridge across the marne but it be not until about September 2 that the whole peril be understand at paris it be true that for several week the government have be aware that the west be agitate and that rouërie be probably conspire among the royalist and nonjuring priest but they do not appreciate the imminence of the danger on September 3 at latest danton certainly hear the detail of the plot from a spy and it be then while other quail that he incite pari to audacity this be danton 's culmination as we look back the weakness of the german seem to have be psychological rather than physical at valmy the number engage be not unequal and while the french be for the most part raw and ill-compacted levy with few trained officer the german regiment be those renowned battalion of frederick the great whose onset during the seven year ' war no adversary have be able to endure yet these redoubtable prussian fall back in confusion without have seriously try the french position and they officer apparently do not venture to call upon they to charge again in vain the french gentleman implore the prussian king to support they if they alone should storm kellermann 's battery under the advice of the duke of brunswick the king decide on retreat it be say that the duke have as little heart in the war as charle fox or possibly pitt or as he own troops and yet he be so strong that dumouriez after he victory hang back and offer the invader free passage lest the german if arouse should turn on he and fight they way to the marne to the emigrant the retreat be terrible it be a disaster from which as a compact power they never recover the rise in vendée temporarily collapse with the check at châlons and they be leave literally naked unto they enemy some of they return to they home prefer the guillotine to starvation other disguise in peasant ' blouse try to reach rouërie in la vendée some die from hardship some committed suicide while the bulk regain liège and there wait as suppliant for assistance from vienna but these unfortunate man who have enter so gayly upon a conflict whose significance they could not comprehend have by this time lose more than land and castle many of they have lose wife and child in one of the most frightful butchery of history and a butchery for which they themselves be responsible because it be the inevitable and logical effect of they own intellectual limitation when after the affair of August 10 danton and he party become master of the incipient republic pari lay between two peril whose relative magnitude no one could measure if châlons fall vendée would rise and the republican of the west would be massacre five month later vendée do rise and at machecoul the patriot be slaughter amidst nameless atrocity largely at the instigation of the priest in march 1793 one hundred thousand peasant be under arm clearly the west could not be denude of troops and yet if châlons be to be make good every available man have to be hurry to kellermann and this gigantic effort fall to the lot of a body of young and inexperienced adventurer who form what could hardly be dignified with the name of a organize administration for a long time marat with whom danton have be oblige to coalesce have be insist that if the enemy be to be resist on the frontier pari must first be purge for pari swarm with royalist wild for revenge and who be know to be arm danton be not yet prepare for extermination he institute domiciliary visit he make about three thousand arrest and seize a quantity of musket but he liberate most of those who be under suspicion the crisis only come with the news on September 2 of the investment of verdun when no one longer could doubt that the net be close about pari verdun be but three or four day ' march from châlons when the duke of brunswick cross the marne and brittany revolt the government would have to flee as roland propose and then the royalist would burst the gate of the prison and there would be another saint bartholomew toward four o'clock in the afternoon of September 2 1792 the prison of the abbaye be force and the massacre begin they last until September 6 and through a circular send out by marat they be extend to lyon to reim and to other city about 1600 prisoner be murder in pari alone hardly any one have ever defend those slaughter even marat call they disastrous and yet no one interfere neither danton nor roland nor the assembly nor the national guard nor the city of pari although the two or three hundred ruffian who do the work could have be disperse by a single company of resolute man have society so will it when robespierre 's time come he fall almost automatically though the head of the despotic committee of public safety and nominally the most powerful man in france he be send to execution like the vilest and most contemptible of criminal by adversary who would not command a regiment the inference be that the September massacre which have ever since be stigmatize as the deepest stain upon the revolution be veritably due to the royalist who make with the republican a issue of self-preservation for this be no common war in royalist eye it be a servile revolt and be to be treat as servile revolt during the middle age have always be treat again and again with all solemnity the royalist have declare that be they to return as conqueror no stone of pari should be leave stand on another and that the inhabitant should expire in the ash of they home on the rack and the wheel though danton have many and obvious weakness he be a good lawyer and danton perceive that though he might not have be able to prevent the September massacre and although they might have be and probably be inevitable under the tension which prevail yet that any court even a political court would be better than marat 's mob some month later he explain he position to the convention when it be consider the erection of the tribunal which finally send danton himself to the scaffold nothing be more difficult than to define a political crime but if a simple citizen for any ordinary crime receive immediate punishment if it be so difficult to reach a political crime be it not necessary that extraordinary law intimidate the rebel and reach the culpable here public safety require strong remedy and terrible measure i see no compromise between ordinary form and a revolutionary tribunal history attest this truth and since member have dare in this assembly to refer to those bloody day which every good citizen have lament i say that if such a tribunal have then exist the people who have be so often and so cruelly reproach for they would never have stain they with blood i say and i shall have the assent of all who have watch these movement that no human power could have check the outburst of the national vengeance in this perversion of the court lay as i understand it the foulest horror of the french revolution it be the effect of the rigidity of privilege a rigidity which find its incarnation in the judiciary the constitutional decision of the parliament under the old régime would alone have make they continuance impossible but the worst evil be that after the shell crumble the mind within the shell survive and discredit the whole regular administration of justice when the national assembly come to examine grievance it find protest against the judicial system from every corner of france and it refer these petition to a committee which report in August 1789 set aside the centralization and consolidation of the system as be for we immaterial the committee lay down four leading principle of reform first purchase of place should be abolish and judicial office should be recognize as a public trust second judge should be confine to apply and restrain from interpret the law that be to say the judge should be forbid to legislate third the judge should be bring into harmony with public opinion by permit the people to participate in they appointment fourth the tendency toward rigor in criminal case which have become a scandal under the old régime should be temper by the introduction of the jury bergasse propose that judicial appointment should be make by the executive from among three candidate select by the provincial assembly after long and very remarkable debate the plan be in substance adopt in may 1790 except that the assembly decide by a majority of 503 to 450 that the judge should be elect by the people for a term of six year without executive interference in the debate cazalès represent the conservative mirabeau the liberal the vote be a test vote and show how strong the conservative be in the assembly up to the reorganization of the clergy in July 1790 and the electoral assembly of the district which select the judge seem on the whole to have be rather more conservative than the assembly in the election not a sixth of those who be enfranchise vote for the delegate who in turn choose the judge and these delegate be usually either eminent lawyer themselves or wealthy merchant or man of letter the result be a bench not differ much from a old parliament and equally incapable of understand the convulsion about they install early in 1791 not a year elapse before these magistrate become as ill at ease as have be those whom they displace and in march 1792 jean debry formally demand they recall although they term properly be to expire in 1796 during the summer of 1792 they sink into contempt and after the massacre the legislative assembly just before its dissolution provide for a new constituency for the judicial election this they degrade so far that out of fifty-one magistrate to be choose in paris only twelve be professionally train nor do the new court inspire respect after the 10th of August one or two special tribunal be organize to try the swiss guard who surrender in the palace and other political offender but these prove to be so ineffective that marat thrust they aside and substitute for they he gang of murderer no true and permanent political court be evolve before danton have to deal with the treason of dumouriez nor be this tribunal perfect before danton give way to the committee of public safety when french revolutionary society become incandescent through universal attack from without and through insurrection within danton though a orator and a lawyer possibly even a statesman be not competent to cope with a emergency which exact from a minister administrative genius like that of carnot danton 's story may be briefly tell at once after valmy the convention establish the republic on January 21 1793 loui be behead and between these two event a new movement have occur the revolutionist feel intuitively that if they remain shut up at home with enemy without and traitor within they would be lose if the new idea be sound they would spread and valmy have prove to they that those idea have already weaken the invade army danton declare for the natural boundary of france -- the rhine the alp and the ocean -- and the convention on January 29 1793 throw dumouriez on holland this provoke war with england and then north south and east the coalition be complete it represent at least half a million fight man danton have no military knowledge or experience fix he hope on dumouriez to danton dumouriez be the only man who could save france on November 6 1792 dumouriez defeat the austrian at jemmape on the 14th he enter brussels and belgium lay helpless before he on the question of the treatment of belgium the schism begin which end with he desertion dumouriez be a conservative who plot for a royal restoration under perhaps loui philippe the convention on the contrary determine to revolutionize belgium as france have be revolutionize and to this end cambon propose to confiscate and sell church land and emit assignat danton visit dumouriez to attempt to pacify he but find he deeply exasperate have danton be more sagacious he would have be suspicious unfortunately for he he leave dumouriez in command in February dumouriez invade holland and be repulse and he then fall back to brussels not strong enough to march to pari without support it be true but probably expect to be strong enough as soon as the vendean insurrection come to a head doubtless he have relation with the rebel at all event on march 10 the insurrection begin with the massacre of machecoul and on march 12 1793 dumouriez write a letter to the convention which be equivalent to a declaration of war he then try to corrupt he army but fail and on April 4 1793 flee to the austrian meanwhile la vendée be in flame to appreciate the situation one must read carnot 's account of the border during these week when he alone probably avert some grave disaster for my purpose it suffice to say that the pressure be intense and that this intense pressure bring forth the revolutionary tribunal or the political court on march 10 1793 the convention pass a decree constitute a court of five judge and a jury to be elect by the convention to these be join a public prosecutor fouquier-tinville afterward attain to a sombre fame in this position six member of the convention be to sit as a commission to supervise draw the indictment the preparation of evidence and also to advise the prosecutor the punishment under the limitation of the penal code and other criminal law be to be within the discretion of the court whose judgment be to be final -lrb- 40 -rrb- death be accompany by confiscation of property consider that this be a extraordinary tribunal work under extreme tension which try person against whom usually the evidence be pretty conclusive its record for the first six month be not discreditable between April 6 and September 21 1793 it render sixty-three sentence of death thirteen of transportation and thirty-eight acquittal the trial be hold patiently testimony be hear and the jury duly deliberate nevertheless the terror deepen as the stress upon the new-born republic increase nothing more awful can be imagine than the ordeal which france endure between the meeting of the convention in September 1792 and the completion of the committee of public safety in August 1793 hem in by enemy the revolution glow in paris like molten lava while yet it be tear by faction conservative opinion be represent by the girondist radical opinion by the mountain and between the two lay the plain or the majority of the convention who embody the social center of gravity as this central mass sway so do supremacy incline the movement be as accurate as that of any scientific instrument for register any strain dumouriez 's treason in April leave the northern frontier open save for a few fortress which still hold out when those should fall the enemy could make a junction with the rebel in vendée still the girondist keep control and even elect isnard the most violent among they president of the convention then they have the temerity to arrest a member of the commune of pari which be the focus of radicalism that act precipitate the struggle for survival and with it come the change in equilibrium on June 2 pari hear of the revolt of lyon and of the massacre of the patriot the same day the section invade the convention and expel from they seat in the tuilery twenty-seven girondist the plain or center now lean toward the mountain and on July 10 the committee of public safety which have be first organize on April 6 1793 directly after dumouriez 's treason be reorganize by the addition of man like saint-just and couthon with prieur a lawyer of ability and energy for president on July 12 1793 the austrian take condé and on July 28 valencienne while on July 25 kleber starve surrender mayence nothing now but they own inertia stand between the ally and la vendée thither indeed kellermann 's man be send since they have promise not to serve against the coalition for a year but even of these a division be surround and cut to piece in the disaster of torfou a most ferocious civil war soon rage throughout france caen bordeaux lyon marseille declare against the convention the whole of the northwest be drench in blood by the chouan sixty department be in arm on August 28 the royalist surrender toulon to the english who blockade the coast and supply the need of the rebel about paris the people be actually starve on July 27 robespierre enter the committee of safety carnot on August 14 this famous committee be a council of ten form a pure dictatorship on August 16 the convention decree the _ levée en masse _ when carnot become minister of war to this dictatorship the republic have 479000 demoralize soldier with the color under beaten and discredited commander bouillé have conspire against the states-general lafayette against the legislative assembly and dumouriez against the convention one year from that time it have a superb force 732000 strong command by jourdan and pichegru hoche moreau and bonaparte above all carnot love hoche up to valmy the old regular army however shake have remain as a core then it become merge in a mass of volunteer and these volunteer have to be arm and discipline and feed and lead against the greatest and strongest coalition which the modern world have ever see france under camot become a vast workshop its most eminent scientific man teach the people how to gather saltpetre and the government how to manufacture powder and artillery horse have to be obtain carnot be as reckless of himself as of other he know no rest there be that to be do which have to be do quickly and at any cost there be that or annihilation on October 21 1794 when the people have gather in the champ de mar to celebrate the festival of victory after the president of the convention have proclaim that the republic have be deliver carnot announce what have be accomplish france have win twenty-seven victory of which eight have be pitch battle one hundred and twenty lesser combat france have kill eighty thousand enemy have take ninety-one thousand prisoner also one hundred and sixteen place or town six after siege two hundred and thirty fort or redoubt three thousand eight hundred cannon seventy thousand musket ninety flag as benjamin constant have observe nothing can change the stupendous fact that the convention find the enemy at thirty league from pari and make peace at thirty league from vienna under the stimulus of a change in environment of mind be apt to expand with something of this resistless energy it do so in the reformation it may be say almost invariably to do so when decay do not supervene and it now concern we to consider in some rough way what the cost to the sink class of attempt repression may be when it miscalculate its power in such a emergency i take it to be tolerably clear that if the french privileged class have accept the reform of turgot in good faith and thus have spread the movement of the revolution over a generation there would have be no civil war and no confiscation save confiscation of ecclesiastical property i take it also that there would have be no massacre and no revolutionary tribunal if france in 1793 have fight foreign enemy alone as england do in 1688 even as it be the court do not grow thoroughly political until the preservation of the new type of mind come to hinge largely on the extermination of the old danton 's first and relatively benign revolutionary tribunal establish in march 1793 be reorganize by the committee of public safety in the follow autumn by a series of decree of which the most celebrated be that of September 17 touch suspect person by these decree the tribunal be enlarged so that in the word of danton every day a aristocratic head might fall the committee present a list of judge and the object of the law be to make the possession of a reactionary mind a capital offence it be only in extreme exigency that pure thinking by a single person become a crime ordinarily a crime consist of a malicious thought couple with a overt act but in period of high tension the harboring of any give thought become criminal usually during civil war test oath be tender to suspect person to discover they loyalty for several century the church habitually burnt alive all those who deny the test dogma of transubstantiation and during the worst spasm of the french revolution to believe in the principle of monarchy and privilege be make capital with confiscation of property the question which the convention have to meet be how to establish the existence of a criminal mind when nothing tangible indicate it the old régime have tortured to prove heresy the church also have always use torture the revolution proceed more mildly it act on suspicion the process be simple the committee of whom in this department robespierre be the chief make list of those who be to be condemn there come to be finally almost a complete absence of form no evidence be necessarily hear the accuse if inconvenient be not allow to speak if there be doubt touch the probability of conviction pressure be put upon the court i give one or two example : scellier the senior associate judge of the tribunal appear to have be a good lawyer and a fairly worthy man one day in February 1794 scellier be at dinner with robespierre when robespierre complain of the delay of the court scellier reply that without the observance of form there could be no safety for the innocent bah reply robespierre -- you and you form : wait soon the committee will obtain a law which will suppress form and then we shall see scellier venture no answer such a law be draft by couthon and actually pass on 22 prairial -lrb- June 10 1794 -rrb- and yet it alter little the method of fouquier-tinville as prosecute officer scellier have complain of this law of prairial to saint-just saint-just reply that if he be to report he word or that he be flinch to the committee scellier would be arrest as arrest be tantamount to sentence of death scellier continue he work without reasoning the subject out logically from premise to conclusion or be of course capable of do so in the mass frenchman have collectively receive the intuition that everything must be endure for a strong government and that whatever obstruct that government must be eliminate for the process of elimination they use the court under the condition in which they be place by the domestic enemy they have little alternative if a political party oppose the dictatorship in the convention that party must be break down if a man seem likely to become a rival for the dictatorship that man must be remove all who conspire against the republic must be destroy as ruthlessly at home as on the battle-field the republic be insolvent and must have money as it must have man if the government need man it take they -- all if it need money and a man be rich it do not hesitate to execute he and confiscate he property there be very famous example of all these phenomenon strew through the history of the terror the girondist be liberal they always have be liberal they have never conspire against the republic but they be impracticable the ablest of they vergniaud complain before the tribunal that he be be try for what he think not for what he have do this the government deny but it be true nay more he be try not for positive but for negative opinion and he be convict and execute and he friend be convict and execute with he because have they remain in the convention the dictatorship through they opposition would have lose its energy also the form of the conviction be shocking in the extreme the defense of these twenty-one man be practically suppress and the jury be direct to bring in a verdict of guilty still the prosecution of the girondist stop here when they refrain from obstruction they be spare danton and he friend may have be and probably be whether intentionally or by force of circumstance a menace to the dictatorship either robespierre or danton have to be eliminate there be not room for both on April 1 1793 danton camille desmoulin and other be arrest on a warrant sign by such man as cambacérès carnot and prieur carnot in particular be a soldier of the highest character and genius he would have sign no such warrant have he not think the emergency press nor be the risk small danton be so popular and so strong before a jury that the government appear to have distrust even fouquier-tinville for a order be give and hold in suspense apparently to henriot to arrest the president and the public prosecutor of the revolutionary tribunal on the day of danton 's trial under such a stimulant fouquier do he best but he feel himself to be beat examine cambon danton break out : do you believe we to be conspirator look he laugh he do not believe it record that he have laugh fouquier be at he wit ' end if the next day the jury be ask if they have hear enough and they answer no there would be a acquittal and then fouquier 's own head would roll into the basket probably there might even be insurrection fouquier write to the committee that they must obtain from the convention a decree silencing the defense so grave be the crisis feel to be that the decree be unanimously vote when fouquier hear that the decree be on its way he say with a sigh of relief -- faith we need it but when it be read danton spring to he foot rage declare that the public cry out treason upon it the president adjourn the court while the hall resound with the protest of the defendant and the shout of the police as they tear the condemn from the bench which they clutch and drag they through the corridor toward the prison they emerge no more until they mount the cart which take they to the scaffold nor be it safe to hesitate if one be attach to this court fouquier have a clerk name paris-fabricius now pari have be a friend of danton and take he condemnation to heart he even decline to sign the judgment which it be he duty to do the next day when he present himself to fouquier fouquier look at he sourly and observe we do not want man who reason here we want business do the follow morning pari do not appear he friend be disturbed but he be not to be find he have be cast into a secret dungeon in the prison of the luxembourg so if a man be too rich it might go hard with he louis-philippe-joseph duc d'orlean afterward know as égalité be one of the most interesting figure among the old nobility the great-great-great-grandson of loui xiii he be a distant cousin of loui xvi and rank as the first noble of france beyond the royal family he education have be unfortunate he father live with a ballet-dancer while he mother the princess henriette de bourbon-contus scandalize a society which be not easily shock during the terror the san culotte everywhere aver that the duke be the son of a coachman in the service of the banker duruet doubtless this be false but the princess have abundant liaison not much more reputable left to himself at sixteen year old égalité lead a life of extreme profligacy but he marry one of the most beautiful and charming woman of the age whom he succeed in inspiring with a devoted affection bear in 1747 he father die in 1785 leave he just at the outbreak of the revolution the master of enormous wealth and the father of three son who adore he the eldest of these be the future king louis-philippe the man must have have good in he to have be love as he be throughout life he be besides more intelligent touch the revolution and its meaning than any man approach he in rank in france the duke when a young man serve with credit in the navy but after the battle of ushant in 1778 where he command the blue squadron he be receive with such enthusiasm in pari that marie-antoinette obtain he dismissal from the service from this period he withdraw from court and he opposition to the government begin he adopt republican idea which he draw from america and he educate he child as democrat in 1789 he be elect to the states-general where he support the fusion of the order and attain to a popularity which on one occasion accord to madame de campan nearly make the queen faint from rage and grief it be from the garden of he palace of the palais royal that the column march on July 14 wear he color the red white and blue to storm the bastille it seem that he have only to go on resolutely to thrust the king aside and become the ruler of france he make no effort to do so mirabeau be say to have be disgust with he lack of ambition he be charitable also and spend very large sum of money among the poor of pari during the year of distress which follow upon the social disorder the breach with the court however become steadily wider and finally he adhere to the party of danton and vote for the condemnation of the king he send two of he son to serve in the army the elder be still with dumouriez at the time of he treason on April 6 1793 when dumouriez 's treachery have become know the assembly order the arrest of the whole bourbon family and among they the duke be apprehend and send to marseille thus it appear that whatever complaint he own order may have have against égalité the republic certainly have none no man could have do more for modern france than he he abandon he class renounce he name give he money send he son to the war and vote for he own relative 's death no one fear he and yet robespierre have he bring to paris and guillotine he trial be a form fouquier admit that he have be condemn before he leave marseille the duke be however very rich and the government need he money every one understand the situation he be tell of the order for he arrest one night when at supper in he palace in pari with he friend monsieur de monville the duke much move ask monville if it be not horrible after all the sacrifice he have make and all that he have do yes horrible say monville coolly but what would you have they have take from you highness all they could get you can be of no further use to they therefore they will do to you what i do with this lemon -lrb- he be squeeze a lemon on a sole -rrb- now i have all the juice and he throw the lemon into the fireplace but yet even then robespierre be not satisfied he harbor malice against this fall man on the way to the scaffold he order the cart in which the duke sit to stop before the palais royal which have be confiscate in order that the duke might contemplate he last sacrifice for he country the duke show neither fear nor emotion all the world know the story of the terror the long procession of cart carry victim to the guillotine these increase in number until after the law of prairial they average sixty or seventy a day in pari alone while in the province there be no end at nante carrier could not work fast enough by a court so he sink boat load of prisoner in the loire the hecatomb sacrifice at lyon and the red mass of orange have all be describe the population of toulon sink from 29000 to 7000 all those in fine be seize and slay who be suspect of have a mind tinge with caste or of be traitor to the republic and it be the center or the majority of the convention who do this by tacitly permit it to be do that be to say france permit it because the onslaught of the decaying class make atrocity such as these appear to be a condition of self-preservation i doubt if in human history there be such another and so awful a illustration of the possible effect of conservative error of judgment for france never love the terror or the loathsome instrument such as fouquier-tinville or carrier or billaud-varenne or collot-d'herboi or henriot or robespierre or couthon who conduct it on this point there can i think be neither doubt nor question i have try to show how the terror begin it be easy to show how and why it end as it begin automatically by the stress of foreign and domestic war so it end automatically when that stress be relieved and the most curious aspect of the phenomenon be that it do not end through the application of force but by common consent and when it have end those who have be use for the bloody work could not be endure and they too be put to death the procession of date be convince when on July 27 1793 robespierre enter the committee of public safety the fortune of the republic be near they nadir but almost immediately after carnot take the war department on August 14 they begin to mend on October 8 1793 lyon surrender on December 19 1793 the english evacuate toulon and on December 23 the insurrection in la vendée receive its death blow at savenaus there have also be success on the frontier carnot put hoche in command in the vosge on December 23 1793 hoche defeat wurmser at freschweiller when the austrian abandon the line of wissembourg fall back across the rhine thus by the end of 1793 save for the great border fortress of valencienne and condé to the north which command the road from brussels to pari the soil of france have be clear of the enemy and something resemble domestic tranquillity have be restore at home simultaneously as the pressure lessen rift begin to appear in the knot of man who hold the dictatorship in the republic robespierre couthon and saint-just coalesce and gain control of the police while billaud-varennes collot-d'herboi and secretly and as far as he dare barère form a opposition not that the latter be more moderate or merciful than robespierre but because in the nature of thing there could be but one dictator and it become a question of the survival of the fittest carnot take little or no part in active politics he devote himself to the war but he disapprove of the terror and come to a breach with saint-just robespierre 's power culminate on June 10 1794 with the passage of the law of 22 prairial which put the life of every frenchman in he hand and after which save for some dozen or two of he most intimate and devoted adherent like saint-just couthon le bas fouquier fleuriot the mayor of pari and henriot the commander of the national guard no one feel he head safe on he shoulder it need but security on the northern frontier to cause the social center of gravity to shift and robespierre to fall and security come with the campaign of fleurus jourdan and pichegru be in command on the belgian border and on June 26 1794 just sixteen day after the passage of the law of prairial jourdan win the battle of fleurus this battle though not decisive in itself lead to decisive result it uncover valencienne and condé which be invest close the entrance to france on July 11 jourdan enter brussels on July 16 he win a crush victory before louvain and the same day namur open its gate on July 23 pichegru drive the english before he seize antwerp no frenchman could longer doubt that france be deliver and with that certainty the terror end without a blow eventually the end must have come but it come instantly and accord to the old legend it come through a man 's love for a woman john lambert tallien the son of the butler of the marquis of bercy be bear in 1769 and receive a education through the generosity of the marquis who notice he intelligence he become a journeyman printer and one day in the studio of madame lebrun dress in he workman 's blouse he meet thérézia cabarrus marquise de fontenay the most seductive woman of she time and fall in love with she on the instant nothing apparently could have be more hopeless or absurd but the revolution come tallien become prominent be elect to the convention grow to be influential and in September 1793 be send to bordeaux as representative of the chamber or as proconsul as they call it there he the all-powerful despot find thérézia try to escape to spain in prison humble poor shuddering in the shadow of the guillotine he save she he carry she through bordeaux in triumph in a car by he side he take she with he to paris and there robespierre throw she into prison and accuse tallien of corruption on June 12 robespierre denounce he to the convention and on June 14 1794 the jacobin strike he name from the list of the club when fleurus be fight thérézia lay in la force daily expect death while tallien have become the soul of the reactionary party on the 8 thermidor -lrb- July 261794 -rrb- tallien receive a dagger wrap in a note sign by thérézia -- to-morrow they kill I be you then only a coward -lrb- 41 -rrb- on the morrow the great day have come saint-just rise in the convention to read a report to denounce billaud collot and camot tallien would not let he be hear billaud follow he collot be in the chair robespierre mount the tribune and try to speak it be not without reason that thérézia afterwards say this little hand have somewhat to do with overthrow the guillotine for tallien spring on he dagger in hand and grasp he by the throat cast he from the tribune exclaim i have arm myself with a dagger to pierce he heart if the convention dare not order he accusation then rise a great shout from the center down with the tyrant arrest he accuse he from the center which until that day have always silently support the robespierrian dictatorship robespierre for the last time try to speak but he voice fail he it be danton 's blood that choke he arrest he arrest he they shout from the right robespierre drop exhaust on a bench then they seize he and he brother and couthon and saint-just and order that the police should take they to prison but it be one thing for the convention to seize robespierre singly and within its own hall it be quite another for it to hold he and send he to the guillotine the whole physical force of pari be nominally with robespierre the mayor fleuriot close the barrier sound the tocsin and forbid any jailer to receive the prisoner while henriot who have already be drink mount a horse and gallop forth to rouse the city fleuriot cause robespierre couthon and le ba to be bring to the city hall a provisional government be complete it only remain to disperse the assembly henriot undertake a duty which look easy he seem to have collect about twenty gun which he bring to the tuilery and train on the hall of the convention the deputy think all be over collot-d'herbois take the chair which be directly in range put on he hat and calmly say as henriot give the order to fire we can at least die at we post no volley come -- the man have mutiny then the convention declare henriot beyond the protection of the law and henriot flee to the city hall the convention choose barra to command they armed force but save a few police they have no force the night be wear away and fleuriot have not be able to persuade robespierre to take any decisive step robespierre be indeed only a pettifogging attorney at length he consent to sign a appeal to arm he have write two letter of he name -- ro -- when a section of police under barras reach the city hall they be but a handful but the door be unguarded they mount the stair and as robespierre finish the o one of these man name merda fire on he break he jaw the stain of blood be still on the paper where robespierre 's head fall they shoot couthon in the leg they throw henriot out of the window into a cesspool below where he wallow all night while le bas blow out he brain the next day they bring robespierre to the convention but the convention refuse to receive he they throw he on a table where he lay horrible to be see he coat tear down the back he stocking fall over he heel he shirt open and soak with blood speechless for he mouth be fill with splinter of he broken jaw such be the man who the morning before have be dictator and master of all the army of france couthon be in little better plight twenty-one in all be condemn on the 10 thermidor and take in cart to the guillotine a awful spectacle there be robespierre with he disfigured face half dead and fleuriot and saint-just and henriot next to robespierre he forehead gash he right eye hang down he cheek drip with blood and drench with the filth of the sewer in which he have pass the night under they foot lay the cripple couthon who have be throw in like a sack couthon be paralyzed and he howl in agony as they wrench he straight to fasten he to the guillotine it take a quarter of a hour to finish with he while the crowd exult a hundred thousand people see the procession and not a voice or a hand be raise in protest the whole world agree that the terror should end but the oldest of those who suffer on the 10 thermidor be couthon who be thirty-eight robespierre be thirty-five and saint-just but twenty-seven so close the terror with the strain which produce it it will remain a by-word for all time and yet appalling as it may have be it be the legitimate and the logical result of the opposition make by caste to the advent of equality before the law also the political court serve they purpose they kill out the archaic mind in france a mind too rigid to adapt itself to a change environment thereafter no organize opposition could ever be maintain against the new social equilibrium modern france go on steadily to a readjustment on the basis of unification simplification of administration and equality before the law first under the directory then under the consulate and finally under the empire with the empire the civil code be complete which i take to be the greatest effort at codification of modern time certainly it have endure until now government have change the empire have yield to the monarchy the monarchy to the republic the republic to the empire again and that once more to the republic but the code which embody the principle of equality before the law have remain fundamentally the social equilibrium have be stable and a chief reason of this stability have be the organization of the court upon rational and conservative principle during the terror france have she fill of political tribunal since the terror french judge under every government have shun politics and have devote themselves to construe impartially the code therefore all party and all rank and all condition of man have sustain the court in france as in england there be no class jealousy touch the control of the judiciary footnote : -lrb- 40 -rrb- _ histoire du tribunal revolutionaire de paris _ h wallon i 57 -lrb- 41 -rrb- c'est demain qu'on I tue n'êtes - vous donc qu'un lache chapter vi inference as the universe which at once create and destroy life be a complex of infinitely vary force history can never repeat itself it be vain therefore to look in the future for some paraphrase of the past yet if society be as i assume it to be a organism operating on mechanical principle we may perhaps by ponder upon history learn enough of those principle to enable we to view more intelligently than we otherwise should the social phenomenon about we what we call civilization be i suspect only in proportion to its perfection a more or less thorough social centralization while centralization very clearly be a effect of apply science civilization be accordingly nearly synonymous with centralization and be cause by mechanical discovery which be application of scientific knowledge like the discovery of how to kindle fire how to build and sail ship how to smell metal how to prepare explosive how to make paper and print book and the like and we perceive on a little consideration that from the first great and fundamental discovery of how to kindle fire every advance in apply science have accelerate social movement until the discovery of steam and electricity in the eighteenth and nineteenth century quicken movement as movement have never be quicken before and this quicken have cause the rise of those vast city which be at once we pride and we terror social consolidation be however not a simple problem for social consolidation imply a equivalent capacity for administration i take it to be a axiom that perfection in administration must be commensurate to the bulk and momentum of the mass to be administer otherwise the centrifugal will overcome the centripetal force and the mass will disintegrate in other word civilization would dissolve it be in deal with administration as i apprehend that civilization have usually though not always break down for it have be on administrative difficulty that revolution have for the most part supervene advance in administration seem to presuppose the evolution of new govern class since apparently no established type of mind can adapt itself to change in environment even in slow-moving civilization as fast as environment change thus a moment arrive when the mind of any give dominant type fail to meet the demand make upon they and be supersede by a younger type which in turn be set aside by another still younger until the limit of the administrative genius of that particular race have be reach then disintegration set in the social momentum be gradually relax and society sink back to a level at which it can cohere to we however the most distressing aspect of the situation be that the social acceleration be progressive in proportion to the activity of the scientific mind which make mechanical discovery and it be therefore a triumphant science which produce those ever more rapidly recur change in environment to which man must adapt themselves at they peril as under the stimulant of modern science the old type fail to sustain themselves new type have to be equally rapidly evolve and the rise of a new govern class be always synonymous with a social revolution and a redistribution of property the industrial revolution begin almost precisely a century and a half ago since when the scientific mind have continually gain in power and during that period on a average of once in two generation the environment have so far shift that a social revolution have occur accompany by the advent of a new favored class and a readjustment of wealth i think that a glance at american history will show this estimate to be within the truth at the same time such rapidity of intellectual mutation be without precedent and i should suppose that the mental exhaustion incident thereto must be very considerable in america in 1770 a well-defined aristocracy hold control as a effect of the industrial revolution upon industry and commerce the revolutionary war occur the colonial aristocracy misjudge the environment adhere to great britain be exile lose they property and perish immediately after the american revolution and also as a part of the industrial revolution the cotton gin be invent and the cotton gin create in the south another aristocracy the cotton planter who flourish until 1860 at this point the change of the environment cause largely by the railway bring a pressure upon the slave-owner against which they also fail to comprehend they situation rebel they be conquer suffer confiscation of they property and perish furthermore the rebellion of the aristocracy at the south be cause or at all event be accompany by the rise of a new dominant class at the north whose power rest upon the development of steam in transportation and industry this be the class which have win high fortune by the acceleration of the social movement and the consequent urban growth of the nineteenth century and which have now for about two generation dominate in the land if this class like its predecessor have in its turn mistake its environment a redistribution of property must occur distressing as previous redistribution have be in proportion to the inflexibility of the sufferer the last two redistribution have be painful and if we examine pass phenomenon from this standpoint they hardly appear to promise much that be reassure for the future administration be the capacity of coördinating many and often conflict social energy in a single organism so adroitly that they shall operate as a unity this presuppose the power of recognize a series of relation between numerous special social interest with all of which no single man can be intimately acquaint probably no very highly specialize class can be strong in this intellectual quality because of the intellectual isolation incident to specialization and yet administration or generalization be not only the faculty upon which social stability rest but be possibly the highest faculty of the human mind it be precisely in this preëminent requisite for success in government that i suspect the modern capitalistic class to be weak the scope of the human intellect be necessarily limited and modern capitalist appear to have be evolve under the stress of a environment which demand excessive specialization in the direction of a genius adapt to money-making under highly complex industrial condition to this money-making attribute all else have be sacrifice and the modern capitalist not only think in term of money but he think in term of money more exclusively than the french aristocrat or lawyer ever think in term of caste the modern capitalist look upon life as a financial combat of a very specialize kind regulate by a code which he understand and have indeed himself concoct but which be recognize by no one else in the world he conceive sovereign power to be for sale he may he think buy they and if he buy they he may use they as he please he believe for instance that it be the lawful nay more in america that it be the constitutional right of the citizen to buy the national highway and have buy they to use they as a common carrier might use a horse and cart upon a public road he may sell he service to whom he please at what price may suit he and if by do so he ruin man and city it be nothing to he he be not responsible for he be not a trustee for the public if he be restrain by legislation that legislation be in he eye a oppression and a outrage to be annul or elude by any means which will not lead to the penitentiary he know nothing and care less for the relation which highway always have hold and always must hold to every civilized population and if he be ask to inform himself on such subject he resent the suggestion as a insult he be too specialize to comprehend a social relation even a fundamental one like this beyond the narrow circle of he private interest he might have he so choose have evolve a system of governmental railway regulation and have administer the system personally or by he own agent but he could never be bring to see the advantage to himself of rational concession to obtain a resultant of force he resist all restraint especially national restraint believe that he one weapon -- money -- would be more effective in obtain what he want in state legislature than in congress thus of necessity he precipitate a conflict instead of establish a adjustment he be therefore in essence a revolutionist without be aware of it the same specialized thinking appear in he reasoning touch actual government new york city will serve as a illustration new york have for two generation be note for a civic corruption which have be theoretically abominable to all good citizen and which the capitalistic class have denounce as abominable to itself i suspect this to be a imaginative conception of the situation tammany hall be i take it the administrative bureau through which capital purchase its privilege a incorruptible government would offend capital because under such a government capital would have to obey the law and privilege would cease occasionally tammany grow rapacious and exact too much for its service then a reform movement be undertake and finally a new management be impose on tammany but when tammany have consent to a satisfactory scale of price the reform end to change the system would imply a shift in the seat of power in fine money be the weapon of the capitalist as the sword be the weapon of the mediaeval soldier only as the capitalist be more highly specialize than the soldier ever be he be more helpless when he single weapon fail he from the day of william the conqueror to we own the great soldier have be very commonly a famous statesman also but i do not now remember in english or american history a single capitalist who have earn eminence for comprehensive statesmanship on the contrary although many have participate in public affair have hold high office and have show ability therein capitalist have not unusually however unjustly be suspect of have ulterior object in view unconnected with the public welfare such as tariff or land grant certainly so far as i be aware no capitalist have ever acquire such influence over he contemporary as have be attain with apparent ease by man like cromwell washington or even jackson and this lead advance in a orderly manner step by step to what be perhaps to I the most curious and interesting of all modern intellectual phenomenon connect with the specialize mind -- the attitude of the capitalist toward the law naturally the capitalist of all man might be suppose to be he who would respect and uphold the law most consider that he be at once the wealthiest and most vulnerable of human being when call upon to defend himself by physical force how defenceless and how incompetent he be in such exigency he prove to the world some year ago when he plunge himself and the country into the great pennsylvanium coal strike with absolutely no preparation nevertheless in spite of he vulnerability he be of all citizen the most lawless -lrb- 42 -rrb- he appear to assume that the law will always be enforce when he have need of it by some special personnel whose duty lie that way while he may evade the law when convenient or bring it into contempt with impunity the capitalist seem incapable of feel he responsibility as a member of the govern class in this respect and that he be bind to uphold the law no matter what the law may be in order that other may do the like if the capitalist have buy some sovereign function and wish to abuse it for he own behoof he regard the law which restrain he as a despotic invasion of he constitutional rights because with he specialized mind he can not grasp the relation of a sovereign function to the nation as a whole he therefore look upon the evasion of a law devise for public protection but inimical to he as innocent or even meritorious if a election be lose and the legislature which have be choose by the majority can not be pacify by money but pass some act which promise to be annoy the first instinct of the capitalist be to retain counsel not to advise he touch he duty under the law but to devise a method by which he may elude it or if he can not elude it by which he may have it annul as unconstitutional by the court the lawyer who succeed in this branch of practice be certain to win the highest prize at the bar and as capital have have now for more than one or even two generation all the prize of the law within its gift this attitude of capital have have a profound effect upon shape the american legal mind the capitalist as i infer regard the constitutional form of government which exist in the united state as a convenient method of obtain he own way against a majority but the lawyer have learn to worship it as a fetich nor be this astonishing for be write constitution suppress he would lose most of he importance and much of he income quite honestly therefore the american lawyer have come to believe that a sheet of paper soil with printer ' ink and interpret by half-a-dozen elderly gentleman snugly doze in armchair have some inherent and marvellous virtue by which it can arrest the march of omnipotent nature and capital gladly accept this view of american civilization since hitherto capitalist have usually be able to select the magistrate who decide they cause perhaps directly through the intervention of some president or governor whom they have have nominate by a convention control by they money or else if the judiciary have be elective they have cause sympathetic judge to be choose by means of a mechanism like tammany which they have frankly buy i wish to make myself clearly understand neither capitalist nor lawyer be necessarily or even probably other than conscientious man what they do be to think with specialize mind all dominant type have be more or less specialize if none so much as this and this specialization have cause as i understand it that obtuseness of perception which have be they ruin when the environment which favor they have change all that be remarkable about the modern capitalist be the excess of he excentricity or he deviation from that resultant of force to which he must conform to we however at present neither the morality nor the present mental excentricity of the capitalist be so material as the possibility of he acquire flexibility under pressure for it would seem to be almost mathematically demonstrable that he will in the near future be subject to a pressure under which he must develop flexibility or be eliminate there can be no doubt that the modern environment be change faster than any environment ever previously change therefore the social center of gravity constantly tend to shift more rapidly and therefore modern civilization have unprecedented need of the administrative or generalizing mind but as the mass and momentum of modern society be prodigious it will require a correspondingly prodigious energy to carry it safely from a unstable to a stable equilibrium the essential be to generate the energy which bring success and the more the mind dwell upon the peculiarity of the modern capitalistic class the more doubt obtrude themselves touch they ability to make the effort even at present and still more so to make it in the future as the magnitude of the social organism grow one source of capitalistic weakness come from a lack of proper instrument wherewith to work even suppose the will of capital to be good and this lack of administrative ability be somewhat due to the capitalistic attitude toward education in the united state capital have long own the lead university by right of purchase as it have own the highway the currency and the press and capital have use the university in a general way to develop capitalistic idea this however be of no great moment what be of moment be that capital have commercialize education apparently modern society if it be to cohere must have a high order of generalize mind -- a mind which can grasp a multitude of complex relation -- but this be a mind which can at best only be produce in small quantity and at high cost capital have prefer the specialize mind and that not of the highest quality since it have find it profitable to set quantity before quality to the limit which the market will endure capitalist have never insist upon raise a educational standard save in science and mechanic and the relative overstimulation of the scientific mind have now become a actual menace to order because of the inferiority of the administrative intelligence yet even suppose the synthetic mind of the highest power to be increase in proportion to the population instead of as i suspect pretty rapidly decrease and suppose the capitalist to be fully alive to the need of administrative improvement a phalanx of washington would be impotent to raise the administrative level of the united state materially as long as the court remain censor of legislation because the province of the censorial court be to dislocate any comprehensive body of legislation whose effect would be to change the social status that be the fundamental purpose which underlie the adoption of a write constitution whose object be to keep local sovereignty intact especially at the south jefferson insist that each sovereignty should by means of nullification protect itself it be a long step in advance when the nation conquer the prerogative of assert its own sovereign power through the supreme court now the intervention of the court in legislation have become by the change in environment as fatal to administration as would have be in 1800 the success of nullification i find it difficult to believe that capital with its specialized view of what constitute its advantage its duty and its responsibility and stimulate by a bar mould to meet its prejudice and requirement will ever voluntarily assent to the consolidation of the united state to the point at which the interference of the court with legislation might be eliminate because as i have point out capital find the judicial veto useful as a means of at least temporarily evade the law while the bar take as a whole quite honestly believe that the universe will obey the judicial decree no delusion could be profounder and none perhaps more dangerous court i need hardly say can not control nature though by try to do so they may like the parliament of pari create a friction which shall induce a appalling catastrophe true judicial court whether in time of peace or of revolution seldom fail to be a substantial protection to the weak because they enforce a established _ corpus juri _ and conduct trial by recognize form it be startling to compare the percentage of conviction to prosecution for the same class of offence in the regular criminal court during the french revolution with the percentage in the revolutionary tribunal and once a stable social equilibrium be reach all man tend to support judicial court if judicial court exist from a instinct of self-preservation this have be amply show by french experience and it be here that french history be so illuminating to the american mind before the revolution france have semi-political court which conduce to the overthrow of turgot and therefore work for violence but more than this france under the old régime have evolve a legal profession of a cast of mind incompatible with a equal administration of the law the french court be therefore when trouble come support only by a faction and be cast aside with that the old régime fall the young duke of chartre the son of égalité orlean and the future loui philippe have relate in he journal a anecdote which illustrate that subtle poison of distrust which undermine all legal authority the moment that suspicion of political partiality in the judiciary enter the popular mind in June 1791 the duke go down from pari to vendôme to join the regiment of dragoon of which he have be commission colonel one day soon after he join a messenger come to he in haste to tell he that a mob have gather near by who be about to hang two priest i run thither at once write the duke i speak to those who seem most excited and impressed upon they how horrible it be to hang man without trial besides to act as hangman be to enter a trade which they all think infamous that they have judge and that this be they affair they answer that they judge be aristocrat and that they do not punish the guilty that be to say although the priest be non-jurors and therefore criminal in the eye of the law the court would not enforce the law because of political bias -lrb- 43 -rrb- it be you fault i say to they since you elect they -lrb- the judge -rrb- but that be no reason why you should do justice yourselve danton explain in the convention that it be because of the deep distrust of the judiciary in the public mind which this anecdote show that the September massacre occur and it be because all republican know that the state and the army be full of traitor like dumouriez whom the ordinary court would not punish that danton bring forward he bill to organize a true political tribunal to deal with they summarily when danton carry through this statute he suppose himself to be at the apex of power and popularity and to be safe if any man in france be safe very shortly he learn the error in he calculation billaud be a member of the committee of public safety while danton have allow himself to be drop from membership danton have just be marry and to a aristocratic wife and the turmoil of office have grow to be distasteful to he on march 30 1794 billaud somewhat casually remark we must kill danton for in truth danton with conservative leaning be become a grave danger to the extreme jacobin have he live a few month longer he would have be a thermidorist billaud therefore only express the prevail jacobin opinion so the jacobin arrest danton camille desmoulin and he other friend and danton at once anticipate what would be he doom as he enter he cell he say to he jailer : i erect the tribunal i ask pardon of god and man but even yet he do not grasp the full meaning of what he have do at he trial he wish to introduce he evidence fully protest that he should understand the tribunal since he create it nevertheless he do not understand the tribunal he still regard it as more or less a court topino-lebrun the artist do understand it topino sit on the jury which try danton and observe that the heart of one of he colleague seem fail he topino take the waverer aside and say : this be not a _ trial _ it be a _ measure _ two man be impossible one must perish will you kill robespierre -- no -- then by that admission you condemn danton lebrun in these few word go to the root of the matter and state the identical principle which underlie we whole doctrine of the police power a political court be not properly a court at all but a administrative board whose function be to work the will of the dominant faction for the time be thus a political court become the most formidable of all engine for the destruction of its creator the instant the social equilibrium shift so danton find in the spring of 1794 when the equilibrium shift and so robespierre who slew danton find the next July when the equilibrium shift again danton die on the 5th April 1794 about three month later jourdan win the fleurus campaign straightway thermidor follow and the tribunal work as well for the party of thermidor as it have for the jacobin carrier who have wallow in blood at nante as the ideal jacobin walk behind the cart which carry robespierre to the scaffold shout down with the tyrant but that do not save he in vain he protest to the convention that be he guilty the whole convention be guilty down to the president 's bell by a vote of 498 out of 500 carrier be send before the tribunal which even though reorganize condemn he thérézia cabarrus gaily preside at the closing of the jacobin club tallien move over to the bench on the right and therefore the court be ruthless to fouquier on the 11 thermidor seventy member officer or partisan of the commune of pari be send to the guillotine in only two batch on the next day twelve more follow four of whom be jurymen fouquier 's turn come later it may also be worth while for american to observe that a political court be quite as effective against property as against life the duke of orlean be only the most celebrated example of a host of frenchman who perish not because of revenge fear or jealousy but because the party in power want they property the famous law touch suspect person -lrb- loi des suspect -rrb- be pass on September 17 1793 on October 10 1793 that be three week afterward saint-just move that additional power should be grant by the convention to the committee of public safety define by way of justification for he motion those who fall within the purview of this law among these first of all come the rich who by that fact alone be to be consider _ prima facie _ enemy to they country as i state at the beginning of this chapter history never can repeat itself therefore whatever else may happen in the united state we certainly shall have no revolutionary tribunal like the french tribunal of 1793 but the mechanical principle of the political court always remain the same it be a administrative board the control of which be useful or may be even essential to the success of a dominant faction and the instinctive comprehension which the american people have of this truth be demonstrate by the determination with which they have for many year seek to impose the will of the majority upon the judiciary other means fail to meet they expectation they have now hit on the recall which be as revolutionary in essence as be the method use during the terror court from the supreme court downward if purge by recall or a process tantamount to recall would under proper stress work as surely for a require purpose as do the tribunal supervise by fouquier-tinville these consideration rather lead I to infer that the extreme complexity of the administrative problem present by modern industrial civilization be beyond the compass of the capitalistic mind if this be so american society as at present organize with capitalist for the dominant class can concentrate no further and as nothing in the universe be at rest if it do not concentrate it must probably begin to disintegrate indeed we may perceive incipient sign of disintegration all about we we see for example a universal contempt for law incarnate in the capitalistic class itself which be responsible for order and in spite of the awful danger which impend over every rich and physically helpless type should the coercive power collapse we see it even more distinctly in the chronic war between capital and labor which government be admittedly unable to control we see it in the slough of urban politics inseparable from capitalistic method of maintain its ascendancy and perhaps most disquieting of all we see it in the dissolution of the family which have for untold age be the seat of discipline and the foundation of authority for the dissolution of the family be peculiarly a phenomenon of we industrial age and it be cause by the demand of industry for the cheap labor of woman and child napoleon tell the lawyer who draft the code that he insist on one thing alone they must fortify the family for say he if the family be responsible to the father and the father to I i can keep order in france one of the difficulty therefore which capital have to meet by the aid of such administrative ability as it can command be how to keep order when society no longer rest on the cohesive family but on highly volatilize individual as incohesive as grain of sand meditate upon these matter it be hard to resist the persuasion that unless capital can in the immediate future generate a intellectual energy beyond the sphere of its specialize call very much in excess of any intellectual energy of which it have hitherto give promise and unless it can besides rise to a appreciation of diverse social condition as well as to a level of political sagacity far higher than it have attain within recent year its relative power in the community must decline if this be so the symptom which indicate social disintegration will intensify as they intensify the ability of industrial capital to withstand the attack make upon it will lessen and this process must go on until capital abandon the contest to defend itself as too costly then nothing remain but flight under what condition industrial capital would find migration from america possible must remain for we beyond the bound even of speculation it might escape with little or no loss on the other hand it might fare as hardly as do the southern slaveholder no man can foresee he fate in the event of adverse fortune however the position of capitalist would hardly be improve by the existence of political court serve a malevolent majority whatever may be in store for we here at least we reach a intelligible conclusion should nature follow such a course as i have suggest she will settle all we present perplexity as simply and as drastically as she be apt to settle human perturbation and she will follow logically in the infinitely extend line of she own most impressive precedent footnote : -lrb- 42 -rrb- in these observation on the intellectual
